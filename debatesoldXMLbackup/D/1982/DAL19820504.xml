      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the most recent unemployment figures for Waterford city and county; and the corresponding figures for each of the last three years.</P>

      <P>The latest information available on the number of persons on the live register relates to 26 <Col N="2" /> March 1982.  On that date the number of persons on the live register at Waterford city employment exchange was 3,698.  At the corresponding dates in each of the last three years the figures were as follows: 1981, 2,871; 1980, 1,951; 1979, 2,059.</P>
      <P>For the other local employment offices in County Waterford the aggregate live register totals on the same dates were: 1982, 832; 1981, 715; 1980, 468; 1979, 422.</P>

      <P>Obviously those figures do not include the latest factory closures in Waterford.  Would the Minister agree that the figures are catastrophic and that something urgently needs to be done to improve the employment situation in Waterford city and county?</P>

      <P>The information I have given is of a statistical nature.  I do not know to what date the Deputy is referring in respect of recent figures.  If he will put down a separate question in that regard to the Minister for Industry and Energy perhaps the matter can then be dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has any plans to change the administration of the health services and, in particular, if he will consider the abolition of the health boards and the reconstitution of the local health authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to abolish the health boards and to reconstitute local health authorities. It is proposed, however, to review the operation of the health boards from the point of view of performance, constitution, and overall responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister mean by reform of the constitution of the health boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the constitution of the health boards is to be revised from 1 June next.  I have no proposals at this <Col N="4" /> stage &mdash; lest the Deputy is wondering about that aspect &mdash; to alter their constitution in that sense, in terms of the boards themselves.  But the work and operations of the boards constitute the first priority in such review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have used the word `review' rather than `reform'.  Is the Minister satisfied with the present workings of health boards in general?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to the health boards is that they have grown enormously since their formation ten or 12 years ago.  As a result of that growth many changes have taken place in their kinds and volume of activities and even the volume of personnel.  This growth has itself brought problems.  What I plan to do at this stage is to review the organisation and arrangements for dealing with the work of the boards given the new situation in which there has been so much growth.  The first area with which we shall be dealing is that of community care which has grown very considerably.  It is anticipated that there will be further growth in that area as a result &mdash; to give one instance &mdash; of the Task Force on Child Care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that their administrative costs have risen to an astronomical level?  Is he aware also that it now costs £79 per day to keep a person in a public ward in a general hospital? Surely the Minister must see the necessity to reform the present constitution of the health boards and the running of the health system generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In that respect, one step I am taking at present is the setting up of a new research unit within the Department of Health to examine the costs and financial procedures within health boards and within hospitals funded by the Vote of my Department.  Therefore, I shall certainly be looking into those questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate <Col N="5" /> what changes he envisages in the community care schemes as a result of the task force report and in particular whether legislation will be introduced in this House in relation to such changes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking here of the performance, administration and administrative changes which may be necessary. When I was Minister for Health previously I initiated a review of the community care organisation and structure in consultation with the staff.  The report on that review was concluded very recently only and is at present being circulated. Basically it was intended to consider the existing organisation and to quantify and study that organisation as it stands.  The second phase was to ascertain what changes and organisation were needed to meet future requirements in that community care area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I have been allowed only one and, arising out of the Minister's replies, there are a number of serious matters that should be dealt with. I shall be as brief as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall have the Estimate for the Department of Health when the Deputy can discuss those matters at length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but this arises directly from the replies of the Minister.  The Minister has not actually clarified the action he is taking in relation to the community care scheme.  Is he proposing merely internal administrative changes or the introduction of legislation to give them a statutory basis?  Is he doing this in the light of the dissatisfaction of many members of the community care scheme at the manner in which the teams at present operate?  Could he give the House a more substantial indication of what his thinking is in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="6" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refute the Deputy's allegations that the community care schemes are not giving a first-class service to the community.  I prefaced my remarks by saying that there has been considerable growth particularly in the area of community care and in view of the growth that has taken place I considered it necessary to have a review of the organisation of community care.  The decisions which will be taken on that review will follow on the conclusion of the review.  In addition we will have to consider some of the implications of the Task Force on Child Care in relation to that same review.  When these matters have been studied&mdash;they are being studied at present &mdash; we will come forward with our proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the task force report was published approximately two years ago and that it is reasonable for the Minister at this stage to let us have his views as to what action should be taken?  Could the Minister indicate whether he has reached any conclusions as to the implementation of any of the recommendations contained in the task force report, in particular in the area of the operation of the community care scheme <i>vis-à-vis</i> the problems of children and children's services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>First, this question is not about the Task Force on Child Care. Secondly, I wish to make clear that the Task Force Report was concluded approximately a year ago, I had that report in effect concluded at that time, the work having gone on for some seven years before that.  I assure the Deputy that on resuming office I now will be quite concerned to implement as much as is feasible of the Task Force Report within the scope of the resources available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. P. O'Sullivan Mr. P. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the review of the health board system, does the Minister intend to ensure that local representatives have a greater role to play, because there is an obvious erosion of responsibility and the authority is now vested mainly in the officials?</P>

    <Col N="7" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would be anxious to ensure that the community care teams were as closely related as possible to the community and those concerned directly in it.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Farmers' Eligibility for Health Benefits.</Title>
    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, when eligibility for health benefits is being decided for farmers, he will accept audited accounts rather than land valuation, where the latter would disqualify the applicant and the former would deem the applicant eligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as full eligibility for health services is concerned, that is eligibility for a medical card, the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board determines this on the basis of the applicant's means.  In the case of farmers this involves an assessment of actual means at the time of application, and land valuation is not a determining factor.</P>
      <P>With regard to eligibility for free hospital consultant services and general practitioner maternity services, the entitlement of a farmer who has another trade or profession is determined by the total amount of income as assessed for income tax purpose which is based on audited accounts.  For other farmers the income from farming is determined by multiplying the rateable valuation of the land occupied by a prescribed multiplier. This determination is made by the chief executive officers of the health boards in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Health Services Regulations, 1979, as amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the latter case I am concerned about.  Has the Minister any proposals to change the system whereby <Col N="8" /> the rateable valuation is taken as a guideline for the farmer's income?  Surely that is anachronistic at this time.  Would the Minister be prepared, for instance, to accept audited accounts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I made clear in the reply that the regulations actually specify the way in which this is determined.  I am having a review undertaken which should be completed before June 1 this year. This is a review of the regulations in total, and I shall consider the matter the Deputy has raised in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will that review contemplate the replacement of land valuation by audited accounts for assessment purposes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall consider the point which the Deputy has raised in the context of that review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of directors of community care employed in each of the health boards and their qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of directors of community care employed in each of the health boards is as follows: Eastern Health Board, 10; Midland Health Board, 2; Mid Western Health Board, 3; North Eastern Health Board, 3; North Western Health Board, 2; South Eastern Health Board, 4; Southern Health Board, 5; Western Health Board, 3.</P>
      <P>In relation to qualifications, I assume that the Deputy requires information on the professional qualifications for the post rather than the individual qualifications of each of the directors.</P>
      <P>In addition to being registered medical practitioners with at least seven years satisfactory experience in the practice of medicine since full registration, directors of community care are required to:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) possess a recognised degree or <Col N="9" /> diploma in public health; or be a member of the Faculty of Community Medicine of one of the Royal Colleges of Physicians; or possess a qualification acceptable as being equivalent to one of these; (b) have had adequate practical experience in the administration of health services; (c) possess a high standard of (i) professional attainment in relation to health services and (ii) administrative capacity; and, (d) possess the requisite knowledge and ability (including a high standard of suitability) for the proper discharge of the duties of the post.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>To summarise, in effect what the Minister is saying is that all directors of community care are medical practitioners.  Is the Minister aware that there is considerable resentment over that on the part of social workers who are part of the community care team, in particular having regard to the fact that it is the directors of community care who make the ultimate decision as to whether a child at risk of non-accidental injury should be taken into care?  Could the Minister indicate whether he intends, in the context of the general review, to look at the possibility of appointing social workers as the final decision-makers in determining whether children at risk of non-accidental injury should be taken into care or appointing social workers to posts similar to these of directors of community care <i>vis-à-vis</i> childern's services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister acknowledge that, in making decisions as to whether the children should or should not be taken into care, personnel require specialist training and that directors of community care who are at present charged with that responsibility under his Department's guidelines receive no specialist training in this area?  Pending the Minister completing his review, would he consider providing specialist training for all directors of community care concerned <Col N="10" /> and dealing directly with the matter of non-accidental injury to children and concerned with making judgments as to whether the children should or should not be taken into care?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Minister referred to the dissemination of information. What efforts are made to ensure that the list is up to date by ensuring adequate dissemination of the guidelines?  The Minister mentioned teachers.  At what point do teachers come across this?  Does the Minister feel there is need for public involvement, the involvement of non-specialised personnel, who may be able to refer cases and who might then be included on this list?  Is there sufficient public knowledge that the director of community care is the person who should be notified of a suspected case of non-accidental injury?</P>

The situation at the moment is that if a member of the public reports a case to a social worker there is no guarantee that that social worker will follow it up and a member of the public has no guarantee that that case will be properly handled.  Will the Minister say if he will provide a well publicised telephone number?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of children at present regarded by each of the health boards as being at risk from non-accidental injury inflicted by parents; and the criteria health boards use for determining whether they should have such children taken into care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, health boards do not keep lists of children termed as &ldquo;children at risk&rdquo;.  However, lists are maintained of children suspected of having had non-accidental injury inflicted on them by parents and as such they are children who are, of course, subject to the risk of further injury.</P>
      <P>The number of such children for each health board is: Eastern Health Board 105; Midland Health Board, 47; Mid-Western Health Board, 32; North-Eastern Health Board, 20; North-Western Health Board, 8; South-Eastern Health Board, 88; Southern Health Board, 40; Western Health Board, 71.</P>
      <P>In determining whether a child at risk of non-accidental injury should be taken into care health boards act on the recommendations of the professional workers involved in the particular case.  In such cases, child and family are kept under constant observation by members of the community care team and receive appropriate help and advice.  The decision to take the child into care is generally taken when the board, on the recommendation of the professional workers involved, consider that the child cannot, with safety, be maintained at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister I am sure will correct me if I am wrong but did he make the extraordinary statement that children who are simply at risk are not maintained on such a register unless they have already been battered on at least one occasion?  Could the Minister clarify the first part of his reply if that is what he meant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should read again what I said so that the Deputy can absorb very carefully what I said and be <Col N="17" /> clear about what my reply was.  I did not say what the Deputy suggested and neither did anybody else suggest that.  The problem about keeping a total list of children at risk is knowing which children will be at risk.  Obviously, the health boards will have suspicion of cases where non-accidental injury has been inflicted. Obviously other children in families associated with an incident like that or where there are other incidents of violence will be included on this list.  It is really a question of how to determine when a child is at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying that it is not necessary for a child to be battered and beaten on at least one occasion before the child appears on the list. I would not want any confusion to arise out of that.  Is that what the Minister is saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course.  I went on to elaborate that where cases occur of children having received non-accidental injuries, other children in the families concerned would come on to the list then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to constant supervision &mdash; I presume that by that he means constant social worker supervision &mdash; being made available in relation to children at risk.  Might I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there is considerable public disquiet regarding the level of supervision and could the Minister indicate what constant supervision means?  On how many occasions, for instance, would a family in which there were children at risk be visited by a social worker?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a matter for the judgment of the professional staff involved. The social workers and other community care workers operate as a team in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Minister that in 1981 three children died as a result of non-accidental injuries.  There were two court cases in 1981 arising out of the deaths of young children in which parents were convicted of criminal <Col N="18" /> offences.  There is one case pending this year.  I suggest it is a public scandal that three children are dead as a consequence of non-accidental injuries, of injuries that were inflicted by their parents.  Is the Minister concerned about this?  Does such a situation not indicate that either the level of supervision is insufficient or that the criteria applied in determining whether children are at risk is inadequate and should be investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asks that question specifically in the next question so perhaps he will wait until I have given the reply to that other question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that children at risk are provided with supervision but he has not clarified the extent of such supervision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The word he used was &ldquo;observed&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>To what extent, then, are children at risk observed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This operates on the competence of the community care team and not only on their supervision and observation but also on the information that comes to them from other workers within the community.  I am familiar with cases where, for instance, the supervisor of home helps often brings to light cases of children who are at risk.  Therefore, there is co-ordination and co-operation between members of the community care teams and other workers in the community in keeping an eye on such cases.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister confirm that, if a member of the public reports an instance in which he thinks a child is at risk, that child's name automatically is put on the at-risk list?  I am aware of cases in which such situations arise at weekends when members of the professional staffs are not available with the result that by the time the child is examined there is no evidence of non-accidental injury.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to an earlier question, as soon as a member of the public brings any such case to the attention of a member of the community care team, the matter is then considered.

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will amend his Department's guidelines on non-accidental injury to children and include in the section entitled &ldquo;The Legal Position&rdquo; a statement that a health board may apply to the High Court to have children at risk made wards of court and taken into care in circumstances in which it is not possible to seek a care order pursuant to the provisions of the Children Act, 1908.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he will undertake a major re-examination of the services available to protect children from non-accidental injury; and whether he will as a matter of urgency require all social work personnel attached to each of the health boards to undertake an immediate review of the action that should be taken in respect of all cases of non-accidental injury to children or suspected non-accidental injury that have come to their notice over the past five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department have already initiated an examination of the operation of the guidelines on non-accidental injury to children.  Directors of community care have responsibility for monitoring and co-ordinating the management of non-accidental injury cases in their area.  They have been asked to consult with relevant members of their team as well as local hospital staff and to report on the adequacy and effectiveness of the procedures outlined in the guidelines in the light of experience to date.  This consultation <Col N="20" /> process will of course include social work personnel.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's proposed amendment to the section of the guidelines dealing with the legal position will be considered in the context of this review.  I might mention however that I shall be introducing a new, comprehensive Children's Bill in this House later in the year and it is likely that the new provisions will obviate the need for the type of proceedings which the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Question No. 10, I would draw the Minister's attention to social workers in the employment of health boards being frequently advised in cases in which children are at risk that under the existing legal position a health board cannot have a child taken into care?  Would the Minister consider as a matter of urgency circulating all social workers, health boards and solicitors acting for them, that children who are in need of care can be made wards of court and taken into care by way of that procedure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have no objection to doing that but I am advised that it would be a particularly cumbersome way of dealing with the situation.  I have no objection to advising people of the availability of the remedy referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that that remedy should always be used. Where the Children Act of 1908 applies, it can be used.  I am asking the Minister to circulate the relevant personnel concerned regarding the availability of the wards of court procedure.  I am being contacted constantly by social workers from all parts of the country who are being given incorrect legal advice and because of that children are at risk.  In these circumstances I am asking the Minister, rather than wait for a review to be concluded, to take immediate action, action of a fire brigade nature, to ensure that all persons dealing with children who are at risk, whether in terms of physical injury or otherwise, are aware of the legal <Col N="21" /> procedures available to them to ensure that such children are properly protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be quite happy to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that there is a grave urgency about all these matters and that the reference to the review in reply to so many of these questions today is to some extent unacceptable on this side of the House?  Will the Minister confirm that the review he is talking of was initiated as early as January and that it was anticipated that there would be an early response on immediate action to be taken within the Department arising out of their examination of the more dramatic cases reported in the recent past?  Is the Minister prepared at this stage at least to confirm that the child care Bill will not necessarily deal with the guidelines in this area but that any revision in that respect is something that could go ahead immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not suggested that it is necessary to await the publication of that Bill.  I merely pointed out that, in relation to the legal remedy suggested by Deputy Shatter, the Bill would cover that position more comprehensively.  That was only by way of a point of information. So far as the review is concerned, it arose out of the most unfortunate and tragic incidents of the deaths of three children due to physical abuse.  I hope to have that review completed as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a matter of grave public concern that three children died last year as a result of non-accidental injuries and can he indicate how soon the review will be completed?  Can he indicate also whether it is now the intention to set up a central register in relation to the list of non-accidental injuries to children and, if so, whether that forms part and parcel of his review?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very concerned to ensure that the review is completed as quickly as possible.  So far as the question of communication between health boards regarding the names included in the lists <Col N="22" /> of the individual health boards is concerned, I will ensure that that matter is considered in the context of the review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the position in relation to co-ordination within health board areas of existing lists? If the Minister is considering the establishment of a central register containing the names of all children at risk in the country will he indicate whether such a register exists within each health board area at present in the context of all the lists maintained by the Eastern Health Board or other boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that I would undertake to set up a central register.  I want to be clear about that because this is a matter of considerable importance to individual families and their children. Health boards are careful about the lists and names which are included.  The establishment of a central register is a matter which should be considered seriously. We should consider whether it is valuable or necessary and that is why I indicated that the best approach may be to ensure that if a person whose name is on a list in one health board area moves to another area that the other health board is informed.  I will ensure that the matter raised by the Deputy is considered in the context of the review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know why the review of these cases took place after the court hearings rather than following the incidents.  Does that procedure not raise serious questions about the review procedure within health boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially an investigation was undertaken into the position following the deaths.  After that the matter was <i>sub judice</i> for some time and subsequently a full report was available from the court.  As the Deputy has stated this was initiated in January and it is something she would have been close to at that time.  On the basis of the findings a more comprehensive review was set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that within each health board area there <Col N="23" /> is more than one list&mdash;I believe there are at least ten lists of children at risk maintained by the Eastern Health Board&mdash; and I should like to know the extent of co-operation or co-ordination that exists within the health boards in relation to those lists.  In other words, if a family moves from one part of Dublin to another part of the county how is that noted?  Is there a central register within health boards?  If that register does not exist does the Minister agree that the maintenance of lists is grossly defective and does not provide adequate information to protect children?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made inquiries from the Eastern Health Board regarding the case referred to by the Deputy.  I have been informed that the applicant has been granted a disabled person's maintenance allowance with effect from 1 August 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In expressing my appreciation and pleasure that the application has been granted I should like to ask the Minister the reason for the excessive delay that took place in his Department in sanctioning this allowance having regard to the fact that the application was filed in the middle of 1981?  This unfortunate person who is disabled and cannot walk was unable to pursue the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned at the delay which occurred in relation to the <Col N="24" /> case and I am having the matter investigated. A number of delays occurred but not specifically in the Department of Health.  There was a delay in arranging the medical examination due to the non-availability of medical staff and that goes back to last August-September. There was a delay in obtaining clearance once the case was referred to the central headquarters of the health board for approval.  I am investigating the reasons for the delay because I believe it was undue in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of allowances for disabled people it is important that the Department and health boards deal with their applications expeditiously. Such people are disadvantaged enough without having their applications for allowances put on the long finger by the Department and health boards.  They urgently need such benefits and the Minister should give the House an assurance that all such applications will be dealt with expeditiously in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The health board did supply a supplementary welfare allowance in the interim.  The Deputy should be clear that the executive functions in relation to this area rest with health boards and not directly with the Department.  If the Deputy brings any complaints of this nature to my attention I will certainly have them reviewed immediately.  In view of the delay which occurred in the case referred to I will have the matter reviewed to ensure that such delays do not occur again.</P>

      <P>My Department has already examined the circumstances of <Col N="25" /> this case very closely and arising out of this examination has sought clarification from the Eastern Health Board on a number of aspects relating to it.</P>
      <P>When I receive this clarification, which I expect very shortly, I shall then consider whether an inquiry as suggested by the Deputy is necessary.</P>

      <P>When was the health board requested to provide clarification?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The health board initially was requested to supply a full report and immediately following the conviction the Department initiated an examination into the circumstances leading to the death of the infant concerned.  That examination involved a request to the health board to furnish a report.  I do not have the exact dates but we have been in contact with the health board frequently to have their report finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the facts surrounding this case.  A father was convicted of battering to death his young child after previously spending nine months in prison for beating up his three-year-old daughter.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the report of the court proceedings published in the newspapers stated that there were more than 80 bruises on the child's body including fractured ribs and a fracture of the skull.  The Minister should deal with this matter urgently because it is of grave public concern that children were left in the custody of a father who had already served a prison sentence for battering a member of his family.  I suggest to the Minister that the facts of the case indicate that there exists some grave and serious deficiencies in the manner in which we are dealing with children at risk of being battered.  Will the Minister, in view of the health board's apparent reluctance to provide the comprehensive information sought since last December, set up an independent inquiry to investigate the circumstances of the death of this child which I believe is a public scandal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I took office on this <Col N="26" /> occasion I have been pressing the health board to furnish a complete report on the matter.  I have sought clarification of some of the matters outstanding.  I am anxious to receive that clarification and I expect I will have it very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree it is totally unsatisfactory that five months after the father of this child was convicted and sentenced to two terms of imprisonment the Minister still has not received from the health board the comprehensive information he requires to decide what action should be taken? Would he not agree that in the circumstances an independent inquiry should be established and in the light of the facts of this case would the Minister now request all community care personnel attached to all the health boards to ngage in an immediate review of all cases of non-accidental injury to children which have come to their notice in the past five years to establish whether a re-assessment of the desired action should now be made?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated, I am taking this as a matter of very considerable urgency.  I have been pressing the health boards to give the requested clarification and am hopeful of obtaining this information any day now, certainly within the next week or so.  At that stage I will be in a position to take a decision as to whether the type of inquiry suggested by the Deputy should be undertaken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will give details of the Government's commitment to tackle drug abuse and to provide proper treatment facilities; and the estimated cost of this programme in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as my Department are concerned, the action taken to deal with the drug problem is concentrated on the adoption of preventive measures and the provision of essential treatment.</P>
      <P>In the preventive sphere the implementation of the Health Education Bureau's drug education programme will be intensified in the coming months.  On 26 April I announced that I was making an additional £250,000 available to the bureau to enable it to undertake an urgent national programme of counselling and preventive education aimed primarily at parents.  The programme will involve the training by the bureau of teachers, doctors, pharmacists, career guidance counsellors, health board personnel, Garda and clergy as drug educators to operate extensively throughout the community and particularly in schools.  Through this approach we can best inform parents of the nature and extent of the problem and enable them to help their children to avoid becoming involved in drug abuse.  Also, parents with a child who has a drug problem will be in a position to react early and appropriately, organising suitable treatment and support.</P>
      <P>There is also a need to educate and alert young people directly to the dangers of drug abuse.  To this end the Health Education Bureau, with the co-operation of the Department of Education, have devised material on all forms of substance abuse for second level school children. This is being tested in selected schools at present and will be extended to all second level schools later in the year.</P>
      <P>The operation of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, is also being reviewed by my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to treatment facilities, my Department are in consultation with the Eastern Health Board about the range of services for drug abusers available in the Dublin area with a view to identifying any further measures that may be necessary. <Col N="31" /> I am unable at this stage to indicate the likely cost of these measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the details involved.  Would he not agree that at present there is a very serious lack of co-ordination between his Department and the Department of Justice with regard to the tackling of this problem? Would he not further agree that the additional £250,000 is merely a pittance, compared with what is actually needed for a full campaign of education against the dangers of drug abuse?  Does he not feel that the time has now arrived for a major national campaign under some Government agency, to begin to control this most serious national problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The measures being taken by the present Government are very comprehensive. There is very good co-ordination between the Department of Justice and the Department of Health in this respect.  With regard to the additional £250,000, as far as the programme is concerned it will immediately have a direct impact on educating the educators, if you like, in this area.  It is quite a substantial initial amount and the Health Education Bureau have been particularly pleased to have these funds available for that area. That is all that I can say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister ensure that the work of the Health Education Bureau is constantly assessed so that he will know that the money being spent is being put to good use?  Would he keep the House informed of this in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health Education Bureau have recently reviewed their work and objectives very comprehensively. The funds will be spent on specific problems.  The bureau have taken a new orientation in their work, which is a very good and specific one.  The Deputy can be satisfied that it will be in the direction for which he hopes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister ask the Health Education Bureau to send any <Col N="32" /> documentation or literature they have on the drug problem to Members of the House who express themselves interested in receiving it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly ask the Health Education Bureau to do this.  Last evening the Asthma Society of Ireland launched a very interesting booklet and I asked the society to circulate it to Members of the House so that they will be kept fully informed, as I know Members come across these problems in their constituency clinics.  I am quite happy to follow the suggestion made by Deputy Briscoe.</P>

      <P>Before I left office I was very close to setting up a national council for children.  We had set up a National Council for the Aged at that stage and we were undertaking a review of the National Social Service Council, both of which I had completed.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Broadly speaking, at this <Col N="33" /> stage I visualise the council having functions such as making recommendations on the development of the child care system, concerning themselves with areas of weakness which may exist here, making recommendations for remedying these weaknesses, fostering and encouraging co-operation between the various bodies concerned, promoting research work in child care, collecting and disseminating knowledge, creating public awareness of developments in child care services and various other functions such as these.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the questions from Deputies FitzGerald, Barry and Gregory together.</P>
      <P>Last Sunday, 2 May, the Government issued a statement indicating their serious concern at the deteriorating situation in the South Atlantic.</P>
      <P>We said that from the outset of the Falklands crisis the policy of the Irish Government, both at the United Nations and within the European Community, has been directed at preventing a wider conflict and promoting a negotiated, honourable settlement by diplomatic means; and that an adequate framework exists within which such a settlement can be achieved if the parties demonstrate the political will to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We said that it was important that the possibilities offered by the United Nations should be fully explored and further military escalation which would only make negotiations all the more difficult avoided.  We indicated our readiness to help in any way we can, through our <Col N="36" /> current membership of the Security Council, to advance a diplomatic solution.</P>
    <P>The statement re-affirmed Ireland's traditional role of neutrality in relation to armed conflicts.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that the fears we expressed on Sunday have been realised.</P>
    <P>The Government are appalled by the outbreak of what amounts to open war between Argentina and Great Britain and at reports that hundreds of lives have already been lost.  They see the present situation as a serious threat to world peace.  We believe that it is even more imperative now that the United Nations become involved immediately to secure an end to the present conflict.</P>
    <P>We have, accordingly, indicated that the Irish Government will seek an immediate meeting of the Security Council in order to prepare a new resolution calling for:</P>
    <P>(1)  An immediate cessation of hostilities by both British and Argentinian forces, and</P>
    <P>(2)  The negotiation of a diplomatic settlement under the auspices of the UN.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government regard the application of economic sanctions as no longer appropriate and will therefore be seeking the withdrawal of these sanctions by the Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Taoiseach whether the statement of the Minister for Defence quoted in today's paper was authorised in accordance with Government policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was a personal statement by the Minister for Defence and does not represent Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of that assurance because it is a matter of concern that any Minister, on a matter as delicate as this, would make personal statements of a kind which are embarrassing to the Government and to the country.  In the new resolution which the Government propose to call for, will the key element <Col N="37" /> in the original Resolution 502, a call for the Argentine forces to withdraw from the Falklands, be included, because the wording the Taoiseach has just used and contained in a Government statement a short time ago does not make any reference to that but involves the call for an immediate cessation of hostilities by both sides and negotiations to find a settlement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our experts are considering that and other aspects of our draft resolution at present.  At this stage it seems to me that, as far as Resolution 502 stands, there might not be a necessity to repeat the contents of 502 but that is a matter under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <P>I do not accept that.  I do not propose to take any such action. I have discussed the matter with the Minister for Defence.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1)  THAT in this Resolution&mdash;&ldquo;insurable employment&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by section 2 (1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 (No. 1 of 1981);</P>
      <P>&ldquo;specified emoluments&rdquo; means emoluments within the meaning of section 111 (4) of the Income Tax Act, 1967 (No. 6 of 1967), which arise to a specified employed contributor from an insurable employment;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;specified employed contributor&rdquo; means a person who is an employed contributor for the purposes of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, but does not include a person&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  who is an employed contributor for those purposes, by reason only of section 65 (1) of that Act,</P>
      <P>(b)  in whose case section 10 (7) of that Act has effect, or</P>
      <P>(c)  to whom Article 7 of the Social Welfare (Modifications of Insurance) Regulations, 1979 (S.I. No. 87 of 1979), applies.</P>
      <P>(2)  THAT, in relation to income tax for the year 1982-83, the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  for the purposes of ascertaining the amount of the income on which an individual (being an individual who is a specified employed contributor) is to be charged to income tax for the year 1982-83 in a case where the total income of the individual for the said year consists of or includes specified emoluments (including in a case where the individual is a husband who is assessed to tax in accordance with the provisions of section 194 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, any specified emoluments of his wife which are deemed to be income of his wife by that section for the purposes referred to in that section)&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  a deduction of £312 shall be made from so much, if any, of the <Col N="111" /> specified emoluments (but not including, in the case where the individual is a husband assessed as aforesaid, the specified emoluments, if any, of his wife) as arise to the individual, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  in the case where the individual is a husband assessed as aforesaid, a deduction of £312 shall be made from so much, if any, of the specified emoluments as arise to his wife,</P>
    <P>(b)  any deduction to be made under this Resolution from specified emoluments shall be given in priority to any deduction to be made under section 138B of the Income Tax Act, 1967, from those emoluments,</P>
    <P>(c)  all such provisions of the Income Tax Acts as apply in relation to claims for the deductions specified in section 138 to 143 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, shall, with any necessary modifications, apply in relation to a claim for a deduction under this Resolution,</P>
    <P>(d)  except as otherwise expressly provided, a deduction under this Resolution shall be given either by discharge or reduction of the assessment, or by repayment of any excess tax which has been paid, or by all or any of those means, as the case may require.</P>
    <P>(3)  IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>This resolution is required to give effect to the Government decision, announced on 22 April, to provide for a special income tax allowance of £312 in the case of employees liable for the new PRSI contributions at the higher rates. The Revenue Commissioners are advising employers to apply this allowance from this week onwards and it is necessary in the first place to obtain the approval of the Dáil before this arrangement can be put into effect.  A corresponding provision to this resolution will <Col N="112" /> be included in the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>There have been detailed press statements about the allowance and the reasons the Government have decided to take this action.  The PRSI increases which took effect on 6 April were substantial. There was a total increase in employees' contributions of 2¾ percentage points, including 1 per cent on gross income in respect of youth employment. These increases had been well heralded. They formed part of the budget proposals introduced by the previous Minister for Finance on 27 January.  The youth employment levy was incorporated in the programme of the previous Government and the necessary legislation for it was enacted in December.  Indeed, this programme envisaged a number of other additional charges which would have added very considerably to the overall PRSI contribution if they had been implemented.  The Social Welfare Bill, which was passed by this House on 24 March, that is the day before the budget was introduced, provided for the 1¾ percentage point increase additional to the youth employment levy.</P>
    <P>The Government, therefore, implemented without change the proposals put forward by the previous Government and these proposals had been widely publicised. In the event, however, many workers felt that the imposition was too severe when they received their first pay packet for April.  Unfortunately the problem was compounded because it was not possible to implement from the beginning of the tax year the tax changes announced in the budget.  Due to unavoidable administrative delays these changes will not take effect until later this month and, for many taxpayers, they will mean an improvement in their income tax position. Also, many workers had ceased to pay PRSI for some weeks at least because their earnings had exceeded the ceiling for PRSI and consequently they moved in one week from a position of no PRSI deduction to a deduction of 7½ per cent. In these circumstances it was inevitable that there should be widespread dissatisfaction. I should mention at this point that the Government are looking <Col N="113" /> urgently at the possibility of arranging that in future PRSI payments for all workers will be staggered over the full year.  There are technical administrative difficulties associated with this and I cannot say at this stage whether a workable solution can be found.</P>
    <P>Apart, however, from the combination of factors which gave rise to dissatisfaction, the fact remains that the PRSI as it now stands is quite a severe imposition on the worker with average or low earnings and it is time to re-examine it in depth. As PRSI payments are not allowable as a deduction for the purposes of assessing income tax, it is argued in some quarters that those on PRSI are subject to double taxation.  I intend to arrange that the taxation arrangements in respect of PRSI will be investigated in detail in the coming months and this investigation will take account of any recommendations which may be put forward in the first report of the Commission on Taxation.  I understand that this report is likely to be available in a few weeks' time.  In the meantime the Government have introduced for this year a special allowance of £312 as an interim measure for those who have to pay PRSI at the higher rates.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the Government discussed the new PRSI changes with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions before arriving at a decision.  The view of congress was that some relief now was essential because of the extra burden that workers were being asked to bear and this view, of course, influenced the Government decision.  I am glad to note that in their May Day Declaration, congress have welcomed the special tax allowance and describe it as a significant attempt to ease the burden on workers.  I should like to quote what congress had to say on this:</P>
    <P>Congress welcomes this easing of the burden on workers.  What was done may not have matched the expectations or hopes of some but in the light of the severe budgetary constraints, the reasons for which are by now well-known, a concession costing £45 million in the remainder of this year <Col N="114" /> (£69 million in a full year) does represent a significant attempt to ease the situation, as must be recognised by all who have not lost touch with reality.</P>
    <P>For the taxpayer on the standard rate of tax the new allowance is worth over £2 a week in take-home pay.  This allowance, together with the income tax changes and social welfare child allowance improvements announced in the budget, will ease the overall tax and PRSI burden for the big majority of workers. A single taxpayer will be better off on weekly earnings up to £128, a married taxpayer up to £228 and a married taxpayer with two children up to £236.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism that the new allowance provides no benefit for the lower paid who are liable for PRSI but who are below the income tax thresholds. Let me put this in perspective.  Altogether there are approximately 700,000 employees who are paying PRSI at the full rates.  Of this total all but an estimated 40,000 pay income tax.  While precise details of these 40,000 employees are not available, the indications are that the majority of them are in part-time work and some of these undoubtedly qualify for short-term social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>As the congress declaration pointed out, single persons pay income tax on earnings from £42 a week upwards and married persons on earnings from £85 upwards.  There can be very few in fulltime, year-round employment whose earnings are below these thresholds.</P>
    <P>The only alternative to a tax allowance was a reduction in the overall PRSI contribution. This in effect would have required a reduction in PRSI payments for the social insurance fund or some cut in the youth employment levy.  The employee's contributions to the insurance fund now total 23½ per cent of what is required whereas the State has to make a contribution of 25 per cent and in this situation a reduction in the PRSI proper would hardly be warranted.  If this year's increase were withdrawn, then the State would be called upon to make a 38 per cent contribution or else the employer's rate would have to be increased.  Some employers are already complaining <Col N="115" /> loudly that the PRSI contribution is too big a burden for them and is acting as a disincentive to employment.</P>
    <P>The youth employment levy is a contribution to meet the problem of youth unemployment and it is charged on all workers irrespective of their status.  I might remind the Opposition again that this levy was introduced by them when in Government and that they did not provide any special arrangements in this legislation for the lower paid workers in relation to this levy.</P>
    <P>As already mentioned, the new allowance will cost £45 million this year in terms of tax foregone.  This will have to be made good through expenditure savings and other taxes and I am looking at the possibilities in this area with a view to making recommendations to Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>Those who clamour for reductions in PRSI should follow through these demands with proposals for alternative sources of revenue or reductions in public expenditure.  As to alternative sources of revenue, the reality is that the scope for extra taxation is limited and it is a myth to suggest that there are large untapped sources which can be called upon to solve all our problems.  I agree that the tax net has to be widened and I look forward to the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation in this regard.</P>
    <P>The only other course of action is to abandon our commitment to reduce borrowing for day-to-day expenses and allow the current budget deficit to rise.  I think the House in general would agree with me that this policy would be extremely short-sighted.</P>
    <P>There is one other issue that I should like to deal with at this point.  There has been considerable criticism at the decision to narrow the 35 per cent tax band from £4,500 to £3,000 for single persons and from £9,000 to £6,000 for married persons.  This criticism is based on a misconception of the tax package which I announced in my budget of 25 March. This package was carefully designed to achieve the same effect for individual taxpayers as the January proposals which were based on a tax credit system.  Thus, <Col N="116" /> while the 35 per cent band was narrowed, the personal allowances were increased very substantially and this factor is not taken into account at all by those who want to widen the band again.</P>
    <P>The allowance provided for in this resolution is an interim measure for the current tax year.  We have to look carefully at the whole PRSI structure and its link with the income tax system and devise arrangements which are demonstrably fair and which distribute the overall burden of taxation as equitably as possible. This is a difficult issue and it could not be resolved at short notice in response to an immediate problem.  The special allowance is the short-term response.  It should be a most welcome change for those who must pay PRSI at the full rates and I commend to the House the resolution which will bring it into effect.</P>

      <P>I am highly critical of the approach the Government have adopted in meeting what is a real problem. There is a real problem in regard to the burden of pay-related social insurance contributions.  The approach chosen by the Government to meet that problem is a bad one for two reasons, the first being the Minister's blank refusal to say how the £45 million necessary to pay for this concession will be raised.  I do not believe the Minister is being straight with <Col N="117" /> the people by concealing at this stage how he proposes to raise that money.  All of it must be raised before 31 December 1982 if the Minister is to adhere to his stated intention of maintaining the budget deficit as set out in the March budget statement.  It is not good enough for him to say, as he said in an interview with the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last week, that, &ldquo;It would be entirely inappropriate at this point in time to give any indication of how the revenue loss will be made good&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I submit it is entirely appropriate at this time that such information be given. Never before has the House been asked to vote on a budget proposal, as this is, without being told simultaneously how that budget proposal was to be paid for. Lest any Member of the House be of the opinion that £45 million is a trifling sum, I remind such Member that if the £45 million were to be raised by an increase in the lower rate of VAT before the end of this year it would have to be introduced in the form of an increase in VAT rates from 1 July, and raising £45 million by that method would bring the lower rate of VAT up to a minimum of 20 per cent.  I from its present level of 18 per cent.  I point out that it is highly probable that this £45 million will have to be raised by means of indirect taxation, for two reasons. First of all, it is well-nigh impossible to raise additional money through income tax in the middle of a tax year. Already major problems have been created by the changes made in the income tax code by this proposal, but if it were to be paid for by further compensating increases in income tax at higher levels total confusion would be created in the tax offices.  Therefore, I believe that any recourse to income tax to raise the £45 million which the Minister seeks is impossible for administrative reasons and it would be highly undesirable for other reasons also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Likewise, I do not believe it is possible to raise £45 million in the next six months in expenditure cuts.  I am not saying that it is not possible to raise £45 million in expenditure cuts.  It is, but the money would not be available before the end of this year.  Modifications in expenditure <Col N="118" /> are notoriously slow to take effect.  You can make a decision now in regard to cutting expenditure which will yield nothing for maybe 12 months but will yield quite a significant sum in two or three years' time.  As the Minister has said that he would adhere to this year's current budget deficit, he must raise the entire £45 million this year.  Therefore, the avenue of seeking expenditure cuts is very unpromising, as the avenue of increases in income tax is administratively and perhaps politically impossible.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we must concentrate on the fact that the Minister will have to pay for this probably by increases in indirect taxation. I am sure that by now he has been made well aware of the fact that diminishing returns have already been reached with regard to increases in taxes on drink and cigarettes.  The Minister is effectively faced with a choice, if he is to raise this £45 million, between increasing VAT by more than 2 per cent on the basic rate or alternatively increasing the price of petrol.  It is not honest for the Minister to say that it is inappropriate or impossible for him to tell the House how he proposes to raise the money.  Quite clearly, his options are very narrow indeed if he is to raise the entire sum, as he has said he will, before the end of this year.  His choice boils down to VAT increases or petrol increases.  This £45 million is to be raised by either of them or a combination of both, and it behoves the Minister to tell the House now when he will make an announcement in this matter, otherwise the Irish taxpayer and the House are not being given a true picture of the nature of the Minister's proposal.</P>
    <P>It is a measure of the state of unreality into which this nation's finances have sunk that a tax concession is now being introduced to mitigate the effect of a tax increase and in some weeks' time we will have the spectacle of a tax increase being introduced for a tax concession which was introduced to mitigate the effect of a tax increase.  This piggy-backing of concession on top of increase and increase on top of concession could go on forever as long as we have a government who are not capable of making up their mind and sticking to it.  I hope, however, <Col N="119" /> that the Government will have the degree of forthrightness with the people to say, if not today at least in the next week, exactly where they will raise this £45 million. I hope that they will not attempt to conceal this information from the electorate of Dublin West before the electors of that constituency go to the polls.  It will be entirely dishonest of the Government to announce the concessions before the by-election and conceal the method whereby it is to be paid for until after the by-election.  I challenge the Minister for Finance to say now if he is prepared to let that information be known before the electorate in Dublin West go to the polls. Otherwise I will have to say that he and his Government are engaged in a form of confidence trick.  That is my first objection to the way in which the Minister is proceeding.</P>
    <P>My second objection is to the substance of the proposal.  Certainly I agree that there is a need to introduce concessions in regard to the burden of pay-related social insurance contributions, but I believe that the way in which this proposal has been designed makes it about the worst possible form of concession because the maximum benefit of this tax allowance will go to the people with the maximum incomes and the minimum, or indeed nil, benefit of this concession will go to people with the lowest incomes. As the Minister has said, 40,000 people in this country are at work but because they have substantial family responsibilities or particularly low incomes they are not paying income tax.  The Minister in his speech seemed to sweep these people aside as if they did not matter &mdash; there are only 40,000 people in that position. The 40,000 lower income people at work are not to be dismissed in that manner. They will gain not a single penny from this concession, although they will be paying the full increase in PRSI contributions. It is simply not good enough to say, as the Minister seems by implication to say, that these people do not matter. I point out to him and the House that these are the very people who are caught in what is known as the poverty trap.  In many cases they would be better off not <Col N="120" /> working than working, yet the Minister chooses to give them no concession whatever in the concessions he is introducing in relation to the increase in PRSI contributions. Fundamentally, he is wrong in adopting that course.  Indeed, the fact that he has choosen to ignore the needs of low income people at work in this manner will surely make many of them contemplate whether they should continue working at all, whether they should instead seek to find a way whereby they can become either certifiably ill or simply unemployed because their income is so low and the Government so obviously do not care about them as to leave them out of the concessions introduced with regard to PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>However, it must be said that it is not only the people paying no tax at all who are being treated inequitably under the type of concession the Minister has chosen to introduce.  Let us compare the situation of a worker in the 35p in the £ tax band at his maximum rate with another worker who is in the 60p in the £ tax band at his maximum rate.  The former worker is what one describes as a middle income employee and the latter is certainly a high income employee.  Who will gain most from this concession?  The high income employee.  He will get 60p worth whereas the middle income employee will get only 35p worth from his allowance.  Clearly this tax allowance is designed to give more benefit to the better off and less or no benefit to the less well off.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, inaccurately, that he had no choice in the matter and that he could either have introduced this tax allowance or else cut PRSI contributions. That is not so.  As the Minister knows, it would have been possible for him to have introduced a tax credit for social insurance contributions rather than a tax allowance.  If a tax credit had been introduced &mdash; in other words, a deduction not from a person's income before tax was calculated but a deduction from the actual tax payment &mdash; that concession would have been of equal benefit to all taxpayers.  It would have been of the same benefit to a taxpayer paying 60p in the £ as to the person paying 25p in the £. <Col N="121" /> Both would have been getting the same level of concession.  However, the Minister chose to opt for a tax allowance.  I believe he did so not because he objects to the principle of a tax credit but because the Coalition parties have been associated with the idea of tax credits and, whether the idea is good or bad, the Minister could not afford to be associated with the idea of tax credits because of its provenance on this side of the House. That is not a good enough reason for throwing away the opportunity of making these proposals much fairer than they are.  The Minister should have opted for a tax credit solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>I would have introduced an amendment to this proposal to substitute a tax credit of the same cost, that is, £45 million, for the tax allowance the Minister is giving if such an amendment had been in order but I was advised by the Ceann Comhairle's office that such an amendment, within the strict terms of this debate, would be out of order.  The Minister has made a serious blunder in choosing to use a tax allowance rather than a tax credit for this concession.  He has lost an opportunity of giving equal benefit to all and instead has chosen to give maximum benefit to the well off and minimum benefit to the less well off.</P>
    <P>The Minister might say that there is no precedent in existing legislation for tax credits and that there would be administrative difficulties.  That is not so.  A tax credit has been introduced in relation to the payment of rates by farmers.  Under the tax code a farmer's payment of rates is treated as a tax credit against his payment of income tax in a subsequent year. The mechanism exists already for tax credits and the Minister should have used that mechanism to introduce a tax credit rather than an allowance for PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>Having decided not to opt for a tax credit, it would have been fairer for the Minister to have introduced a concession within the PRSI system rather than a tax-related concession.  I put down an amendment detailing this suggestion but it has been ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle for reasons which I fully accept.  I cannot move that amendment <Col N="122" /> but I am not prevented from talking about it because it is relevant as an alternative to this proposal.  I suggested a reduction in the rate of PRSI for people on low incomes and proposed a very modest and perhaps insufficiently generous concession that anyone earning less than £4,000, if married, should have PRSI contributions reduced from the prospective 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent. This would be much fairer because it would give the entire benefit directly to the low paid whereas the Minister's concession will give the maximum benefit to the well paid.  The Minister will probably shake his head and say with great rectitude that this would reduce the contributions of employees to the social insurance fund and ask where the money would be found.  However, he is prevented from saying that because he has not told us where he intends to find £45 million.  If money is to be plucked from some unspecified source, we should at least use it to achieve the maximum benefit for the low paid.  If £45 million is available it should be used either to introduce a tax credit or to finance a reduction in the rate of PRSI for the low paid.  It should not be used to finance a tax allowance which gives maximum benefit to the well paid.</P>
    <P>This brings me to my amendment which is designed, in the only way open to me within the order and rules of this House, to seek to help in some small way the low paid.  I am speaking in particular of the 40,000 people, a significant number, who by the Minister's own admission will gain not a single penny from this tax allowance.  The reason they cannot benefit is that they will not pay income tax this year due to their low income.  My amendment proposes that in any case where the income for this year is of such amount that a person is not liable to pay income tax, the reduction of £312, to be increased proportionately in future years in line with the CPI, shall be carried over to the next and subsequent years.  In other words, if a person has too low an income this year to benefit from this concession, he will be able to get the benefit next year or in subsequent years if his income is such that he is liable to <Col N="123" /> income tax.  This would introduce some small element of fairness to this proposal. It would not cost a single penny this year because it applies only to future years and merely gives people the entitlement to carry forward an allowance which they are unable to use this year.</P>
    <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P>In subsection (2), to add to paragraph <i>(a):&mdash;</i></P>
    <P>&ldquo;provided that in a case where an individual's total income for the year 1982-83 is of such amount that he is not liable to be charged to income tax, the deduction of £312 (proportionally increased by the percentage figure as represented by the Consumer Price Index to mid-February for each intervening year) shall be carried over to the next subsequent year of assessment in which that individual's income becomes so liable,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputies not just in my party but in the Labour Party and The Workers' Party as well as Independent Deputies are concerned about the problems of low paid workers.  This concession need not trouble them if they are worried about the balance of the budget because it will not cost any money this year.  However, it will give low paid workers the opportunity of using this year's allowance in future years.  I would remind the House that the concession framed by the Minister applies only for this year.  There is no question in the resolution &mdash; as would be usual &mdash; of this allowance being available in subsequent years.  It is my view that if people are not in a position to use it this year they should be able to use it in subsequent years.  My amendment is reasonable and I hope I will get support from all my colleagues &mdash; and perhaps even from the Minister &mdash; for the amendment.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about the more general problems of the increase in the rate of PRSI contributions. Why has this occurred?  The main reasons are twofold.  First, there is an increase in the number of unemployed. <Col N="124" /> Unemployment benefit and pay-related benefits for unemployed persons now cost about four times as much to the social insurance fund as they cost when the system of PRSI contributions was introduced in 1979.  In that year unemployment benefits took 11 per cent of the expenditure of the fund but in 1982 they will take 17 per cent of the expenditure of the fund.  On the other hand, disability benefits are taking a smaller share of the fund now than they took in 1979.  The main reason for the increases, which have to be levied if the State contribution is to go no higher than 25 per cent, is the increase in unemployment.  Unfortunately it will not be possible for us to prevent an increase in social insurance contributions until we succeed in reducing the level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that when this system was introduced in 1979 there were approximately 80,000 persons unemployed.  This year, when determining the amount of money to be raised through PRSI contributions, provision has had to be made for a level of unemployment somewhere in the region of 143,000 &mdash; almost twice as many people unemployed now as in 1979.  Of course 75 per cent of that cost has to be met by levies on employers and employees. Unfortunately, to some extent this is a self-perpetuating exercise because every increase in PRSI contributions creates more unemployment and every increase in unemployment creates more demands on the fund and more increases in social insurance contributions.  It is a vicious circle in the classic sense.  This is so because the larger the proportion of a person's wages that has to be taken for social insurance either from him or his employer &mdash; there is not much difference between the contributions of the employer and the employee because it all comes ultimately from the same source, namely, the sale price of the product they produce &mdash; the less will be the incentive for job creation in the industries in question. We have reached the stage now where many employers are not employing additional workers, even though they need them, because of the high level of social insurance contributions they have <Col N="125" /> to make, plus the substantial burden of paperwork that must be done in respect of every additional employee.  This is a vicious circle because it is creating more unemployment, further demands and further increases in PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>In particular we must look for ways to relieve this burden on small firms.  It has been shown in countries throughout the world that in the recent recession the firms who have shown the best performance in terms of creating and maintaining employment have been small firms.  I am not particularly concerned about the structure of the companies: they can be private enterprise, co-operatives or even State-owned small firms but small firms have been more successful than the larger firms.  Unfortunately this burden falls very heavily on small firms and we must try to relieve that burden to some extent.</P>

      <P>I am reluctant to interrupt the Deputy because normally he is a well-mannered contributor. However, we are now dealing specifically with a resolution and an amendment. As the Deputy knows, when we discuss later item No. 12 on the Order Paper there will be ample opportunity for a discussion.  I ask him not to set a headline for straying too far from the resolution and the amendment before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point made by the Chair.  He is quite right.  We must consider two other points with regard to the social welfare code if we are to tackle the problem and prevent increases in the social insurance contributions going through the roof.  We will have to do this to avoid creating a type of Alice in Wonderland situation where tax concessions have to be paid for by further tax increases which in turn have to be compensated for with further tax concessions and so on.  We must accept that at certain levels there exists a disincentive to work. A significant number &mdash; but not a majority &mdash; of people are better off not working than working.  For that reason I introduced in my budget a proposal to tax short-term social welfare benefits.  If one person gets £104 in unemployment benefit <Col N="126" /> and another person gets the same amount in pay they should both pay the same tax.  However, at the moment the person who gets that money as pay for work done pays tax while the other person does not pay tax.  That is not fair.</P>
      <P>The other matter we must consider is the abuse of the social welfare code.  That is costing money although it is impossible to say how much less social insurance would be this year if there was no abuse of the social welfare code.  There is no scientific evidence available on this but every Member who canvassed in the recent general election campaign will know from the reactions he received at the doorstep that this is seen to be a major problem by large numbers of the electorate who are closer to the ground than we are.  It is a problem; it is a scandal and if it were stamped out fewer increases in social welfare contributions would be necessary.</P>
      <P>I would like to return to the two main points I started with.  First, the Minister must say in honesty to this House and to the electorate, not just of Dublin West but to the entire country, where he is going to get the £45 million.  Otherwise, the people will be perfectly within their rights in assuming the worst.  Secondly, he must accept, and I hope the House will accept, that he is wrong in giving the concession in the form of a tax allowance because that gives the maximum benefit to the better-off.  Instead, he should have either introduced a tax credit which would have given the same benefit to everyone, or a cut in social insurance contributions for the low paid, which would have given most benefit to the low paid and no benefit to the well paid.  He should have taken one of those two avenues rather than the tax allowance avenue if he was interested in social justice and tax equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clearly too late now to do anything about it this year but if any such concession is contemplated for next year &mdash; and I believe the underlying problems with the level of contributions that will be necessary to finance the scale of unemployment benefit that will have to be paid next year will be such that some concession will be necessary next year just as <Col N="127" /> one is necessary this year &mdash; I sincerely hope that whoever is Minister for Finance he will be able to find a more just and fair way of giving concessions and that he will adopt either of the suggestions I made &mdash; a tax credit or a direct cut in pay-related contribution for the lower paid only.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>When I made my critical comments on the budget and said I would not be surprised to see the current budget deficit being thrown out the door before the end of 1982, little did I think it would happen within three or four weeks.  I anticipated that the Minister and the Taoiseach might pull back from telling the people that they would give them what they wanted and that they would not have to pay for it because the Government would borrow the money, but I did not anticipate that that Fianna Fáil disease, which has affected that party since 1977, would break out within three or four weeks.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is a constitutional office holder I want to remind him of Article 45 which says:</P>
      <P>1º the State pledges itself to safeguard with especial care the economic interests of the weaker sections of the community, and, where necessary, to contribute to the support of the infirm, the widow, the orphan, and the aged.</P>
      <P>I thought that constitutional provision was summed up rather well in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 3 May 1982 in their third editorial when they said:</P>
      <P>A caring society is a paying society. There is no way of having benefits such as we do without some of the pangs of taxpaying.  Bigger peoples can't do it. We can't.</P>
      <P>But Fianna Fáil can.  The debt is so high at present that it is a wonder Fianna Fáil Ministers can even face going to their offices in the mornings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there are many injustices and inadequacies in the general taxation system and in the structure and level of taxation within the PRSI system, the <Col N="128" /> myth is being perpetrated by Fianna Fáil that the people can have social welfare benefits, increases and extensions of scope without having to pay for them. Somebody will have to pay, but that &ldquo;somebody else&rdquo; never happens to be oneself or one's fellow workers or even one's employers.</P>
    <P>At present there is a surprising campaign being carried out by one particular section of the community.  Some trade union officers are campaigning for the abolition of the PRSI system.  I never thought I would see that day.  Suddenly the system has become unjust; it is a penal tax.  In the fifties, in the days of William Norton when the 1952 Act was brought in, the trade union movement campaigned for the reform and extension of the social welfare system.  Since October 1972, when I was first appointed Labour spokesman for Social Welfare, I have campaigned for an effective national comprehensive system of pay-related social insurance.  I make no apology to anybody for holding this firm belief because what this country needs is a broadly based effective social insurance system for which we pay and from which we get substantial social welfare benefits. That is my philosophy.  It is not a soft option philosophy nor is it based on the blatant dishonesty contained in that awful GIS statement on PRSI contributions issued on 22 April.  They said that the cost of the concession &mdash; the so-called concession &mdash; now being given would be £45 million in 1982 and that the loss of revenue would be made good in the course of the year by a combination of additional taxation and economies in expenditure.  One must ask the Minister where are the details of the combination of additional taxation and economies in expenditure.  That was on 22 April. Today on 4 May we see the proposal watered down again.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>This will have to be made good through expenditure savings and other taxes...</P>
    <P>Suddenly a clear statement on economies and expenditure becomes expenditure savings and other taxes.  With great certitude <Col N="129" /> and the firmness one would expect from the Fianna Fáil Party talking about fiscal rectitude the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I am looking at the possibilities in this area with a view to making recommendations to the Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been in office for a couple of weeks only and he would not be expected to know all the exigencies of taxation possibilities.  We were told that the loss of revenue would be made good. That was a firm statement.  It has now been diluted into:</P>
    <P>I am looking at the possibilities in this area with a view to making recommendations to the Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>Let us be frank, the Minister has already written a letter seeking to borrow another £45 million.  Endemically and inherently Fianna Fáil are incapable of saying to anybody: &ldquo;We will ask you to pay for what you will get.&rdquo; They will not say that to employees, employers, speculators, financial institutions, building societies, farmers, the manufacturing sector, public sector employees or private sector employees.  Instead they suggest: &ldquo;You need not worry.  It will be all right on the day.&rdquo; In a sense perhaps they are right. There is a suggestion in the community: &ldquo;Let us abolish PRSI.&rdquo; We meet that every day of the week.</P>

      <P>Many of us were Members of this House &mdash; and I, as a fully paid-up social-insured employee &mdash; and will recall that when the stamp, as we then knew it, was abolished in 1979 there was a great welcome generally for the introduction of pay-related social insurance. We will recall also that there was great abuse down through the years when stamps were lost, when insurance cards were not submitted.  By and large there was tremendous acceptance in the community that a far more progressive system of pay-related social insurance should be introduced.</P>
      <P>My current reaction against some of the exploiting propaganda surrounding PRSI is that the wrong enemy is being attacked.  The enemy is the inadequacy of the current scheme of payments rather than its dilution as many people would wish.  I wish to see the scope of pay-related insurance extended to the farming community, to the self-employed generally. It is my view that until such time as every worker over the age of 16 years is paying pay-related social insurance &mdash; until that fundamental principle is accepted &mdash; then we are going to have the type of <i>ad hoc</i> measures such as that which the Minister has brought in here today, on giving relief after the imposition of tax increases on a narrow sector of the labour force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is of critical importance that the Minister should have stated in his speech that pay-related social insurance in the community now amounts to well over £800 million a year.  The Minister has a fundamental obligation to point out that the social insurance fund, to which all of this controversy, relates, for 1982 &mdash; even after the £45 million relief is given &mdash; will be approximately £829 million.  There is a clear obligation to dispel some of the more outrageous propaganda surrounding this area.  The Minister should have pointed out that of the £829 million income of the social insurance fund for 1982 employers will pay in the region of £448 million, that employees will pay in the region of £162 million &mdash; that is after the relief of £45 million has been granted, as I understand it &mdash; and that the Exchequer contribution apparently will now <Col N="137" /> amount to approximately £219 million.  It is important that the magnitude and scale of the fund be realised, that its central importance in paying for social welfare and health services, particularly paying for social welfare and social insurance, has tended to be diluted by the running-away attitude adopted by the Government in recent weeks, adopted solely and exclusively because there is a by-election pending in Dublin West.  That is a sad and unfortunate situation for our country because the enemy is not pay-related social insurance: the enemy is the fact that our taxation system, or its scope, is far too narrow.  Our social insurance system is much too narrow in scope as well, as is our capital taxation system in its general scope.  That is where I complain and where I contend there should be reform.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have pointed out to the House today that the social insurance fund is necessary if we are to pay, as we are now paying, retirement pensions. The new rate of pension for a single individual is now £40 per week which is not very much to live on.  I should not like to see any Deputy trying to live on £40 per week.  That is the current rate from April 1982.  The money paid into the social insurance fund is entirely necessary to enable those rather meagre payments to be made to working people who retire or go on old age pension.  We have a system of disability benefit and unemployment benefit.  The current rate from April 1982 is £31.65 and a person with an adult dependant gets £52 per week, a very miserly sum for a so-called Christian country bearing in mind there is much reaction now against people who are unemployed &mdash; one would swear they are living on the fat of the land the way some people go on.  If we are to pay pension rates of that nature we must have a social insurance fund.  Almost one million people in the country depend on social insurance and social welfare all of which has to come from the social insurance fund.  About 700,000 people or 20 per cent of the population depend on social welfare payments for their principal long-term source of income.  Also, one-sixth of our children depend solely on <Col N="138" /> social welfare to eat and to live.  Last year we spent some £260 million on unemployment-related benefits.  That had to come out of the social insurance fund.  When I remember that I am staggered when people say: &ldquo;Let us abolish PRSI&rdquo; or &ldquo;Let us reduce PRSI&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If we want to have a caring society prepared to pay people substantial general incomes when sick, out of work or retired or when they suffer occupational injuries we must have a system of social insurance.  I do not believe we should abolish PRSI or reduce it substantially but we should extend the general scope of it.  One of my big arguments is that we do not have an effective system of occupational pensions.  I have been fighting for it since I came into this Dáil in 1969. Again and again I have sought the introduction of a system of occupational income-related pensions.  Successive Ministers for Health have done nothing about bringing in a White Paper.  We had the odd green or discussion paper but most Ministers in the Department of Health, Department of Finance and other Government Departments have done very little about having an occupational national scheme of income-related pensions with full transferability rights. If we are to have that sort of scheme it will have to be based on pay-related insurance contributions in a similar type of scheme or extension of the scheme.  I favour such a scheme being introduced.</P>
    <P>I hold very strongly that pay-related contributions should be extended to the farming community.  I suggest that if one took a substantial number of better-off farmers, about 14,000 or 15,000 out of a total of 150,000, and insisted that they should pay pay-related income contributions into the social insurance fund it would be a very good thing, beneficial to the insurance fund and to the farmers themselves.  They should get contributory retirement pensions and old age pensions on a contributory basis.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to bring all self-employed people in the community under PRSI.  I suggest, and many Deputies here might agree with me, that the £9,500 income limit should be abolished. The system is highly regressive.  I feel <Col N="139" /> strongly that all incomes should be subjected to the general pay-related contributions scheme and that there should not be an income limit.  When I became a voluntary contributor I think I went over the income limit of £600 in the early sixties.  I then became a voluntary contributor. Then the income limit went up and I came back into the scheme.  Then I went out again.  I have been a socially insured person, in fact, since 27 February 1957 when I first went to work.  I must have paid thousands of pounds in contributions over that period.  Fortunately, I never had to claim unemployment benefit or disability benefit although I benefited in many ways from social insurance, including the fact that children were born into my family who had to go to hospital. I do not regret the fact that I have been paying social insurance contributions from 1957 or that last year I paid, and presumably in the coming year I shall have to pay, up to £9,500.  I shall have to pay the full rate as I am a full voluntary contributor.  In a society where those who are fortunate enough to retain their health can look after those in need of care in the community, they must be prepared to pay directly.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see some of my colleagues in Sinn Féin here.  There is an argument that you can abolish PRSI&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not meandering at all.  I would point out to our fellow Deputy &mdash; I am not sure whether he is on the Government side or the Opposition side &mdash; that one cannot abolish the £850 million of the social insurance fund as seems to be implied and replace it by capital taxation overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowadays, if you are stuck for any kind of taxation reform or want to get more money anywhere the easy way out <Col N="140" /> is to say immediately: &ldquo;We will get it from capital taxation.&rdquo; Suppose we abolished the social insurance fund of £850 million and suppose, for instance, we said we would bring back domestic rates, all we would get would be about £120 million or £130 million.  You would have to bring back rates and multiply the yield by five in order to abolish PRSI.  That shows the magnitude of the problem.  Even as regards the Workers' Party as it is now called, even with the most horrendous taxation they were proposing as regards capital taxation, the maximum yield they spoke of or that I read of in any of their documentation at the abolute zenith of Exchequer revenue was in the region of £210 million, which is only the equivalent of the Exchequer contribution this year into the social insurance fund.  The social insurance fund is £850 million.  The net PAYE income tax yield last year was £1,350 million.  If you transfer the whole insurance fund over to PAYE you have to increase income tax by about 30 per cent.  I am flabbergasted that it has not yet dawned on those who are proposing to abolish PRSI that the employers are paying 50 per cent of it.  This year this is over £410 million.  I ask the trade union movement and the Workers' Party, who are so preoccupied with the best interests of the workers, if they favour the abolition of the employers' contribution on PRSI.  I am not sure that is their policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I find great difficulty in understanding it because there is an element of great confusion.  Some of my colleagues who suddenly discovered that PRSI is not a very popular thing among working people were not even here when the Minister for Social Welfare came into the House and announced the new rates. We all accepted the Social Welfare Bill which went through the House unanimously without the slightest dissension on any side.  Deputy Eileen Desmond supported the adoption of the new rates of PRSI.  Nobody in the House objected to the new rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> Suddenly overnight some people decided it was time to exploit the situation. There is enough bandwagon politics in the country.  If people want an airport give them one, if they want an oil refinery, give them one, if they want us to abolish PRSI let us do so.  In the process you put at risk the fundamental socialist concept of social insurance whereby you set up a fund and workers have a right to get from it disability benefit, unemployment benefit, mortality benefit, invalidity pensions and nobody else has a right to interfere with this, it does not go into general taxation.  Some of my colleagues in the House feel we should transfer the whole burden over to income tax.  What do we do then?  We reintroduce the pauper system of the means test.  If you abolish PRSI you are back to the means test applications.  People have then got to go with cap in hand, state their income and look for pensions on a non-contributory basis from the State.</P>
    <P>That is not socialism; that is opportunism. The most opportunist thing of all was after the Social Welfare Bill had been passed and the rates established which cannot be altered in this financial year and no motion can be taken in the House for six months after a Bill is passed.  The motion was then put down, because they were confident the motion could not be moved.  That is what happened seven days after the PRSI rates were adopted. In the west European democracies the money collected on a revenue basis for social security is totally embedded.  I spent eight years on the Social Affairs Committee of the Council of Europe, from 1973 to 1981.  In France revenue from taxes for social security totals about 42 per cent.  There is a lot of talk here when we consider our contribution of 18 per cent but it is much greater in other European countries.  In Austria it is 31 per cent, in Germany 34 per cent, in Japan, a country of very high productivity, it is around 30 per cent.  It cannot be said that it is a very penal tax here.  If one wants to be opportunist and one wants to promise this, that and the other without saying where the money is to come from, one can just fall into the trap.</P>
    <P>I have always been able to distinguish <Col N="142" /> between the industrial and the political. Some other Deputies are incapable of doing so.  Congress in its May day declaration welcomed this easing of the burden on workers.  It is the job of congress to represent trade union members.  I hope when the Minister announces the cuts in public expenditure possibly well after the by-election and maybe as late as October, when all the budget figures will be in such a state that they will not matter.  I hope there will be an effusive welcome by those who are now welcoming the £45 million.  The Minister mentioned other areas of taxation.  I remind Deputy Sherlock that these will have to be made good through expenditure savings and other taxes.  Where will the other taxes come from?  They will be indirect taxation.  The trade union movement go berserk when there is indirect taxation.  It is anathema to the trade union movement that there should be an increase in general indirect taxation here.  We are all opposed to indirect taxation.  If it was not to be income tax or PRSI or, as even Deputy Sherlock knows, capital taxation, as that was reduced in the budget, and since neither was it to be discretionary trust taxation, because that had been abolished, the only possibility remaining was indirect taxation.</P>

      <P>Therefore, let us expect an effusion of welcome generally from those who repeatedly emphasised the rejection of any taxation proposals that would involve a switch from direct to indirect taxation.  The ICTU have been very critical of any such switch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been critical of some of the propaganda that has surrounded this whole issue.  The Minister for Finance should revert in some way to the original honesty of purpose shown by him when he was asked first about this issue at media level.  There is an illuminating and interesting report by the political correspondent of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> in which a couple of weeks ago she quoted the Minister in his comments on the RTE radio &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; programme.  At the <Col N="143" /> time the Minister was asked if we could expect a change in the PRSI contribution level within a few weeks.  This reply was that the Commission on Taxation would be reporting shortly on all aspects of taxation and that the Government would be taking into account the proposals and the recommendations of that body.  He went on to say that the level of PRSI payments generally would be reviewed by the Government in the light of that report.  There was no indication then of this sudden about-turn on the part of the Government. During the programme concerned, and as reported in the newspaper to which I have referred, the Minister was asked if the PRSI position was negotiable. That is the big question that was asked.  It was then he said that the level of PRSI contributions would be reviewed by the Government in the light of the report of the Commission on Taxation which was expected within a few weeks. Overnight, then, the Minister and the Cabinet changed their minds and decided to make what I regard to have been a ridiculous statement.  The best summing up of the measures proposed by the Minister I have found has been that of Mr. Colm Rapple in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of April 25.  He asked the question how crazy one can become, whether any sane man could justify the Government handing out £45 million in such a way that those on top incomes were gaining to the extent of £187 per year while there was nothing for the poor.  Mr. Rapple continued and said that, even assuming the Government had the £45 million &mdash; and he did not believe they had &mdash; no one could argue convincingly that that was an equitable or just way of spending that money.  He went on to say that in providing a new income tax allowance for private sector workers of £312 the Government had ensured that those on the higher incomes got most while those who are very poor are not helped in any way. I agree totally with Mr. Rapple in that regard.  He stated the position correctly.</P>
    <P>The £45 million could have been given in an entirely different way.  As has been pointed out by Deputy Bruton, it could have been given under a general tax <Col N="144" /> credit system.  Whatever one's views might be in relation to our attitude to taxation, the introduction of the tax credit system was inherently and fundamentally more progressive and more acceptable to the community and should have been introduced by the Minister at the earliest possible opportunity.  As I pointed out on the night of the budget when we debated that issue, the marriage allowance of £2,230 was worth only £780 to somebody on a 35 per cent rate, whereas for someone on the 60 per cent rate it was worth £1,338.  That was, therefore, a totally inequitable and regressive step.  If the Minister had wanted to give £45 million tax relief there were other ways in which he could have done so.</P>
    <P>I am critical of the general proposal before us.  There is an urgent need for an equitable taxation system in respect of capital taxation, of social insurance and of income tax generally, but so far successive Governments have not succeeded in bringing in a system that would contain the major elements of general equality. That is a major criticism that anyone can make of the system.  It is a criticism that I intend continuing to make in my capacity as spokesman on Finance for my party.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to indulge in the process of soft options.  Neither do I intend to try to con people into thinking that they can have a 20 per cent increase in social welfare and major improvements in standards of living without having to pay for such benefits.  We must be honest with the people and tell them the facts.  And the fact in relation to the motion before us is that it is a classic deliberate by-election ploy on the part of the Minister by saying: &ldquo;Here is £45 million relief for you and I will tell you after the end of May how you will have to pay for it, but if you do not wish to pay for it then I will borrow it&rdquo;.  That would mean that in the next five years 46 per cent of all the money we borrowed would have to be paid back.   I would not wish to see my children being handed down that sort of legacy.  The prospect is frightening.  That would mean that in a further three or four years 50 per cent of the entire borrowing would have to be paid back and <Col N="145" /> that we would finish up with the collapse, not merely of a property group, but of Exchequer finances.  That is something that I would not wish to see any responsibility for devolving on me.  While accepting the motion and supporting the amendment in the name of Deputy Bruton, I hope that we will have an interesting debate on the whole question of social insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief.  I wish merely to put a few points into perspective and Deputy Desmond has given me the opportunity of doing that because of his having said repeatedly in the course of his speech that we in the Workers' Party created a furore about the increase in PRSI.  That is what has really annoyed him.  Of course a Deputy of the Labour Party would be annoyed that the effect of what we did was to create a situation in which £45 million is to be raised and redistributed to the PAYE sector who are the victims of the increases in the PRSI contributions.</P>
      <P>The increase in PRSI contributions were proposed in the January budget by Deputy J. Bruton and it makes the House a little ridiculous to hear the same person putting forward answers to questions he could not answer prior to January.  It is very difficult to understand that.  The Minister for Finance presented these increases in a different way in that the increases were contained in a Social Welfare Bill.  It is understandable that workers are revolting against such massive increases.  Those workers were being asked to accept a cut in their living standards by accepting a pay increase of 16 per cent at a time when inflation was running at more than 23 per cent.  It was understandable that workers in that situation and facing such a massive increase in PRSI would revolt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are behind the workers four square on this issue, and there can be no doubt about that.  The Minister in the course of his speech stated that he intended to arrange that the taxation arrangements in respect of PRSI would be investigated in detail in the coming months and that this investigation would take account of any recommendations which may be put <Col N="146" /> forward in the first report of the Commission on Taxation.  We welcome that statement because many changes are needed in connection with our taxation system.  To impose PRSI on gross earnings is totally unjust.  The Minister also stated:</P>
    <P>As to alternative sources of revenue, the reality is that the scope for extra taxation is limited and it is a myth to suggest that there are large untapped sources which can be called upon to solve all our problems.</P>
    <P>In our submission we made the point that the restoration of estate duties would have brought in £60 million based on 1971 figures.  It is a pity Deputy Desmond is not present to hear me make that statement.  The reason we have this problem in relation to taxation is that successive Governments and Members of the House represent one class of the community, those with wealth and property. That is the reason we do not have an equitable tax system as has been demanded for many years by workers. Those who have been making decisions in relation to tax did not represent working class people.</P>
    <P>PRSI is not a social insurance scheme under any criterion.  It is clearly just another form of taxation and as such it bears heaviest on the working class, particularly those in the private sector.  This is illustrated in the 1982-83 rates of PRSI on the following forms of income in the economy: wages and salaries of private working class, 7.5 per cent: wages and salaries of most public sector workers, 2.9 per cent; income and profits of self-employed and farmers,2 per cent; investment and dividend income, zero; capital gains income, zero; and benefits in kind, such as company cars, zero.  Workers in the public sector pay half the amount that those in the private sector pay.  Farmers and the self-employed in practice pay only one-third of what supposedly the cosseted public sector workers' pay.  Capitalists, those who receive their income from dividends or capital gains, do not pay anything at all.  Although the self-employed are liable to 2 per cent, inclusive of the 1 per cent youth employment <Col N="147" /> levy, the Revenue Commissioners report that in recent years they have been able to obtain about half of what they are owed by those groups.</P>
    <P>On the general level of taxation we reiterate our earlier demand that all people must pay their fair share of tax and that all forms of income should be taxed in an equal fashion.  It is our contention that the tax system is inherently biased against the working class whose tax is deducted at source.  We welcome the £45 million being provided by the Government in this resolution to give some relief to the PAYE sector who are subject to this massive increase in PRSI.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to make a few remarks about the way the Minister introduced the resolution.  I notice that in combining things which he said with things which were said by one of his colleagues &mdash; rather like a lawyer using what is called a rolled-up plea in order to defend an action for libel or slander &mdash;&ldquo;the words were not spoken, or, if they were spoken, they did not mean what the plaintiff says&rdquo;&mdash; in a way reminiscent of that, the Government are trying to provide themselves with two routes of justification and escape from the situation which has left them with their tails between their legs, producing this very defensive and expensive measure this afternoon.  The first line of defence is that it is all Deputy John Bruton's fault, that it was the callousness of the former Minister which left poor Deputy MacSharry with no option but to impose PRSI at the rate originally proposed. In the course of his speech the Minister said: &ldquo;These increases had been well heralded&rdquo;.  However, they were not well-heralded enough for his colleague, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, who did not understand or had not time to get to grips with the matter by the time it arrived on the table here.  The Minister stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These increases had been well-heralded. They formed part of the budget proposals introduced by the previous Minister for Finance on 27 January. The youth employment levy was incorporated <Col N="148" /> in the programme of the previous Government and the necessary legislation for it was enacted in December. Indeed, this programme envisaged a number of other additional charges which would have added very considerably to the overall PRSI contribution if they had been implemented. The Social Welfare Bill, which was passed by this House on 24 March, that is the day before the budget was introduced, provided for the 1¾ percentage point increase additional to the youth employment levy.</P>
    <P>The Government, therefore, implemented without change the proposals put forward by the previous Government and these proposals had been widely publicised.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; is used to accompany or to introduce a conclusion to which the arguments in the preceding part of one's speech have compelled one inexorably.  Where are all those arguments in the Minister's speech?  Where is the &ldquo;therefore&rdquo;?  What &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; was there in it?  The Government were able to scrap the tax on short term social welfare benefits and the VAT on clothing and footwear; but they were &ldquo;therefore&rdquo; compelled to go ahead with the level of PRSI increase proposed by Deputy Bruton. It was all our fault.  That is one line of defence.</P>
    <P>The other line of defence is one which the Minister's colleague, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, adopted on 18 April.  In the newspapers of 19 April he plaintively told a meeting in Ballincollig, County Cork, that &ldquo;due to time constraints it had not been possible for the Government to reconsider each of the previous proposals as outlined in the budget&rdquo;.  That was with specific reference to the PRSI increases; and although they were &ldquo;well heralded&rdquo; in advance as the Minister for Finance told us today, they were not well enough heralded for the Government to do anything about reducing them, eliminating them, or introducing at the proper time, instead of making a pig's breakfast of it as we see now, introducing a tax concession in order to mitigate the hardship which these increases represented.  We <Col N="149" /> have two defences: they had no time to do anything about it, although it was well heralded, and it was Deputy Bruton's fault anyway.  That is what I call a sleeveen route of escape.</P>
    <P>The next thing in the Minister's speech which I deplore is his references to &ldquo;dissatisfaction&rdquo; and &ldquo;discontent&rdquo;.  I want to tell the Minister something.  If there was nothing to the art of Government except rolling with the tide of assent and approval, there would be no need to look for a salary, because job satisfaction would be so limitless.  Unless a Government are willing to face up to &ldquo;dissatisfaction&rdquo; and &ldquo;discontent&rdquo;, they are not worth a damn and are not earning their salaries.  There was dissatisfaction and discontent with this PRSI increase &mdash; we have chapter and verse for it here, we even have, in a four-page speech, the high honour paid to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that part of their May Day Declaration is incorporated in the Minister's speech.  &ldquo;In these circumstances,&rdquo; he admits, &ldquo;it was inevitable that there should be widespread dissatisfaction.&rdquo; That was the reason for the climb down. He further says: &ldquo;... the Government discussed the new PRSI changes with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions before arriving at a decision.  The view of Congress was that some relief now was essential because of the extra burden that workers were being asked to bear, and this view, of course, influenced the Government decision.&rdquo; Tell us something new.  We know well what influenced the Government's decision.  The Government are not capable of making a decision which they can perceive to be unpopular and sticking to it.  That disqualifies them from drawing their salaries in my view.</P>
    <P>There is always dissatisfaction; and the longer we have governments running away from dissatisfaction and giving in to discontent the longer we will be in difficulties and the deeper we will sink in those difficulties.  When I think of the pretensions, of the 20-year campaign, the relentless publicity intended to build up the Deputy's leader into a kind of Mussolini figure, when I see the idea being allowed to spread throughout the country <Col N="150" /> that no matter what the difficulties may be which other mortals may encounter in trying to find money to pay for the public services, this granite figure, this Mussolini cast in bronze will make these difficulties dissolve, I have to ask myself &ldquo;Are we a nation of dopes altogether?  Do we ever measure performance against promise? Was there ever a country in which people are taken more at their own evaluation than here?&rdquo; The material of which that Mussolini is carved is no granite or bronze; it is a much more malleable material, somewhere around the degree of hardness of marshmallow.  Dissatisfaction, discontent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Do not congratulate yourself too much on that.  That point of view &mdash; that dissatisfaction and discontent which the Government must run away from, shy away from like the devil from holy water &mdash; was, of course, reinforced by Mr. Carroll of the ITGWU, when he said, also on 18 April &ldquo;It is quite obvious that if the Taoiseach is unable to give satisfaction to the Congress Executive there will be loud noises made throughout the country, and in the end the politicians must listen to these loud noises.&rdquo; Politicians seeking the government of a free people are elected to resist &ldquo;loud noises&rdquo;.  They are elected to shut their ears to &ldquo;loud noises&rdquo;, if their solemn, sober judgment is that the loud noises are not conductive to the general good.</P>
      <P>That is the point of view which is allowed to survive, to flourish and spread in all sections of this country.  We tried to make a stand and perhaps should have tried a little harder.  I do not complain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Another dimension of the Minister's approach to this is to be seen in his reference to the youth employment levy which is also, naturally, part of the complex of items which underlay the present fiscal dilemma in which the Government are floundering: &ldquo;The youth employment levy is a contribution to meet the problem of youth unemployment and it is charged on all workers, irrespective of their status.  I might remind the Opposition that this levy was introduced by them when in Government, and that they did not provide any special arrangements in this legislation for the lower paid workers in relation to this levy.&rdquo; I ask the Minister and his party, are they for or against the levy? The Minister had the power to scrap it altogether if he so wished, and equally had the power to exempt from it the lower paid workers, had he so wished.</P>
      <P>On 19 April, the Minister opposite was reported as saying that he pledged the Government to review PRSI in the light of the report when it eventually surfaced from the Commission on Taxation, but he was not going to do anything about it before then.  The following day, the papers carried headlines to the effect that &ldquo;MacSharry rules out reversal of PRSI rises&rdquo;.  There was going to be no back down on this.  At the same time, the representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions were reported as going to meet officials of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance &ldquo;to examine the question of equity in the taxation system in the light of the current difficulties which have arisen&rdquo;.  That reference to &ldquo;current difficulties which have arisen&rdquo; is not invented by me and was not thought up by a journalist.  It comes from a joint statement from the Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions after a meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Deputies opposite, would the founder of their party ever, in his life, have consented, as leader of a Government, to issue a joint statement with anybody &mdash; union or anything else &mdash; and make a reference to &ldquo;difficulties arising <Col N="153" /> from a budget&rdquo; which his own Minister had produced less than a month previously? He would have resigned rather than do that, and so would any self-respecting Taoiseach who ever was seen, until last week.  Even if I did not agree with him, and I consider that his net contribution to this country was negative, he was a man that one might plausibly call a figure cast in bronze or carved in granite.  There was something about him which compelled a certain grudging admiration, even from those who disliked and despaired of the direction in which he was bringing the country on other grounds.</P>

There were times, in my adolescence and student days and thereafter, when I had to admire him when he was still operating in the political field, for that very quality which has now vanished from his party.  There is not a trace of it left anywhere.  It occasionally surfaces with some Deputy or other on the opposite side of the House &mdash; I will not be hurtful by mentioning names &mdash; but they lie down under the lash.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The public perception of the chronology of this change is that first of all there was going to be no backdown and that there was going to be a review after the Commission on Taxation Report came out.  Then, lo and behold, on 22 April the Government were going to put £45 million into a new dimension of tax allowance which would have the effect of substantially cushioning the PRSI increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to mention something which I may come back to in the budget debate if I get in, that is the extraordinary degree to which the press are now showing real <Col N="154" /> signs of panic about the situation in the economy, of a kind which they did not exhibit a year ago, when it was high time for them to have done so.  A year ago I made a count of <i>The Irish Times</i> editorials over a period immediately following Deputy Gene Fitzgerald's 1981 budget. In 40 editorials, counting the first, second and third in <i>The Irish Times</i> spreading over a period of three weeks after that, I counted something like four on the world situation, perhaps five on the North of Ireland, two on the Dublin traffic and environmental problems and a whole scattering of individual topics &mdash; Thailand, Cambodia, the Caribbean, holidays in Spain and, at the end of the list, with one each, was the fine spring weather and the budget.  In three weeks they had succeeded in producing one editorial on any economic theme whatsoever; and that was an editorial on the budget in which they gave an indulgent, roguish slap on the back to the Taoiseach for &ldquo;a little sleight of hand&rdquo; that his Minister had been seen to engage in in producing his budget.</P>
    <P>That was the sleight of hand which was able to write itself a credit of £25 million in respect of &ldquo;rationalisation in the public service&rdquo;.  Where is the rationalisation? Has anybody ever put a figure on it or what was achieved?  Was it 6 pence?  Why not pick some other figure out of the air? One can neither affirm nor deny it.  He was going to get £200 million from the private sector.  What eventually materialised was a sum far less than half of that; but of course these were credits he was able to write for himself on budget day; and he was let off by the press as though he were a spoilt child with an amusing trick for the visitors.</P>
    <P>That was a year ago.  It is very different now.  They are striking a very sombre note now and the economic correspondents who, a year ago, were sounding notes of warning and, indeed, of fright from the rear pages of their journals, are now being allowed to write the editorials. They are doing so with very considerable skill and they do not pull punches as far as we are concerned when they think they are deserved.  I think the net effect of <Col N="155" /> their contribution is extremely important and valuable.</P>
    <P>The view expressed by the editorials on 23 April after this climb-down was unanimous.  It was unanimous that this was the clearest sign that the country was slipping out of control, that the Government did not know where they were going, that they had no purpose to bring us back into fiscal rectitude, that everything in regard to planned budget deficits and phasing the thing out over a certain number of years and restoring fiscal viability had all been abandoned.  It was a unanimous note of warning.  I notice that one of the few apologists &mdash; perhaps it is not fair to call him that but he certainly has a very soft spot for the Taoiseach&mdash; one of the few journalists of whom that can now be said, said not long after the election that he thought the economic comment hostile to Fianna Fáil had been heavily associated with UCD, which was ever and always a haven for the Fine Gael Party.  I have been associated with UCD for 30 years and I can tell the House that although there are Fine Gael supporters there, there are also a lot of supporters of the other side of the House.  The idea that a serious commentator could bring himself to say that merely because somebody was employed by a particular third level institution which had an association which has long since dissolved, if it was ever of any significance, with a particular party, would also take their politics from that lead, is absolutely childish.</P>
    <P>The real point I want to get at is that the economic correspondents that were hostile to the present Government both on this occasion and in their previous term from 1977 to 1981, were not confined to UCD.  You could comb the entire range of third level institutions, and I defy anybody here to mention one economic commentator, whether he was an academic economist or any other kind, who had a good, substantial word to say for the way the country was being run, once they focused on the issue, since the 1977 manifesto.  It was not just UCD, there was no one in Trinity, Cork, Galway, NIHE or the ESRI.  You could comb the furthest rookeries of the most <Col N="156" /> obsucure body drawing public money to produce the occasional paper or lecture and you would not find a single economist that could bring himself to defend what was going on.</P>
    <P>But now these economists are coming forth, moving out of the obscurity of page 17 and page 23 into the main editorial columns, not because they are leaning on the editorial boards of the papers but because the editorial boards of the papers, and I suppose the papers' owners and the volume of letters which the papers receive, have succeeded in awakening in the press a sense of real alarm. That sense of alarm was expressed with peculiar clarity and in a very concentrated way on 23 April and on following days in consequence of the PRSI turnaround. Even the farmers' column on 23 April in <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash; although one would not think the farmers' column would be concerned with such a matter &mdash; asked in connection with the failed Luxembourg talks if this meant that the farmers are going to be even further hit, that the economies will affect them, meagre though their incomes are and great the difficulties against which they have to struggle.</P>
    <P>How will this be financed?  I know it is easy to shout &ldquo;Where is the money going to come from?&rdquo; and, naturally, one does not expect a Minister at every stage of every game to be entirely specific.  We have been powerfully concentrated here in the last couple of years at last, very largely due to the efforts of this party, on the question of financial rectitude and on the necessity, which has now begun to get through to the public, via the media, for paying our way out of our own pockets. People are now asking, in a way in which they never did before, where the money is coming from.  I want to know where the extra taxation is going to come from or where the economies are going to be effected.</P>
    <P>A couple of helpful economists and commentators in the paper made suggestions about where the extra taxation might come from.  I have seen a suggestion that we might have another 15 pence on a gallon of petrol which would raise a certain amount and we might have a few <Col N="157" /> more pence on the old reliables to raise some more.  I have no doubt that these are measures which will be up near the top of the list of the brief which the Minister gets from his advisers on this matter.  I suppose it might be said that there is a certain leeway for additional taxation in these spheres, although I am not advocating it.  I can see it might be possible to squeeze a bit more from sources of that kind.</P>
    <P>What really interests me is the economies. Will these be fairy economies, like the &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo; of 1981?  Will they be economies of that kind, where we can be satisfied that we will feel happy about them now but will not remember to check a year from now whether they ever materialised?  Or are they serious economies in the sense of cutting back on the capital or current Estimates?  If it is possible to prune the Estimates any further than they have been pruned, it will come as a blinding revelation to everyone who served in the last Government and to myself.  We sat around for backbreaking weeks, week after week, trying to see where money could be saved.  The atmosphere of the Government in July and thereafter as I said in a moment of despair &mdash; because we had to produce a July budget as well as one in January of this year &mdash; resembled a field hospital during a 19th century pitched battle; there were severed limbs all over the place and we could hear the groans of people from whom favourite schemes had been amputated. There was a most appalling savagery, the necessity of which everybody recognised.  Every Minister was obliged to sacrifice some dimensions, even some whole schemes, of departmental functions to which he was either personally committed or attached or could see the political difficulty in having to deprive himself of and having to do without.  We went through that exercise not just once but two or three times.  After the first sweep had been made we went back and made a second sweep to see if we had overlooked anything the first time, and then we made a third sweep.  That exercise went on in July and at intervals right up to the January budget.</P>
    <P>I would dearly like to know where <Col N="158" /> there are further economies to be made of the order of £45 million.  If we had been able to find £45 million in economies we could have avoided the controversial and perhaps politically ill-judged VAT on clothing and footwear &mdash; and I hope no one will think it worries me to have it said about us now that it was politically ill-judged.  We would have been able to do without that altogether if we could find anywhere that we could save a sum like £45 million.  I am very interested to hear where it is going to come from.  I suspect it is going to come from buoyancy &ldquo;because there will be more money left in the economy&rdquo;.  I suspect that is going to be the Minister's answer, and, if it is not, then it can only be going cap in hand to borrow once again, pushing us that much further down the slope, fraying away a few more of the cords in the solitary cable which attaches us to a reasonable, respectable economy and financial system.  I suspect it is going to be that &mdash; and all for what?  It is all in order to get away from &ldquo;dissatisfaction and discontent&rdquo; coming up to a by-election, all so that the seat vacated by Deputy Dick Burke should not be retained by us.  That is what it is all in aid of.</P>
    <P>In its editorial of 23 April <i>The Irish Times</i> described the Government's present technique in the face of their difficulties as resembling the activity of a man who runs from one point of a dyke to another trying to plug one hole after another, but without any plan for stopping the sea from coming in.  That is an altogether too favourable simile, because at least a man running from one part of the dyke to another and plugging the holes is acting purposefully in some way, in that his activity is directed towards some useful object, even if it is a relatively short-term one.  If we are going to stay at the seaside for similes, nothing could better illustrate the approach of this Government to this awful mess with the PRSI within a few weeks of the budget than to say that they have all the dynamism and sense of purpose of a dead fish being cast up on the shingle and washed from one part of the beach to another by each succeeding tide.</P>

      <P>There were many points made in the debate which warrant a reply.  I referred to some of them in my opening address.  Deputy Bruton, in his initial remarks, first of all welcomed the concession and then criticised us for introducing it.  He cannot have it both ways.  The same can be said of a certain proportion of Deputy Desmond's contribution which was, I must say in fairness, very balanced in most of its aspects.  The main point made by Deputy Bruton was the raising of the £45 million.  He was right to raise it.  I said quite clearly when it was introduced a few weeks ago, and again today, that through a combination of saving in expenditure and taxation increases we will raise this shortfall of £40 million &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

There will be an opportunity on the Finance Bill to discuss this. But the £45 million will be made good.  I want to make it quite clear that there is no question of giving away the £45 million for the sake of doing so without looking for corresponding savings or tax increases to make up the difference.  I reject Deputy Bruton's statement, made on a <Col N="160" /> few occasions, that I was not honest in any regard.  The concessions as announced by us, and now being introduced here today, have absolutely nothing to do with the by-election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to say that they have, perhaps the people in the Dublin West constituency should read the contributions here today from Fine Gael and Labour and then they would know for whom to vote.  The Opposition cannot be riding two horses. My interest in it was basically to eliminate, because of the size of the PRSI contributions, what has now become a very inequitable situation, particularly in relation to double taxation.  That is the way we set about undertaking the task of correcting this inequity in the quickest possible time while awaiting various other measures on which we have not concluded our deliberations.  That was the only way we could do it.  I did say that we would not change the level of PRSI contributions and we have not done that yet either.  That is what I was reported as saying, and I stand over that.</P>
      <P>We are getting rid of the double taxation element by introducing this new allowance.  Deputy Bruton mentioned the figure I gave of 700,000 people who pay PRSI at the full rate and the fact that 40,000 of them do not pay tax and, therefore, will not benefit from the allowance. That is true.  One must be realistic.  I refer back to what I said in my opening remarks as to why precise details of these 40,000 employees are not available.  The indications are that the majority of them are in part-time work and some of them qualify for short term social welfare benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton put forward a suggestion that we should introduce this on a tax credit basis which would help that sector.  Bearing in mind the reason for doing it &mdash; double taxation &mdash; those people are not affected.  It is not possible to have a credit and allowance system operating together.  For PAYE purposes it would not be possible to introduce the <Col N="161" /> tax credit.  It would necessitate 12 extra tax tables on top of the existing eight we have at present.  It would be an impossible situation for employers and the revenue commissioners to operate.  I have sympathy with the Deputy's concern for small industries and employers and the level of contribution they make.  If the credit allowance system was introduced it would be a tremendous burden on such people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond welcomed what was done but from his contribution one would gather that he was against it to some extent.  His contribution was very balanced and I agree with most of it.  The reason for introducing the allowance is because of inequities in the high level of PRSI contributions and the double taxation element, which is a justifiable argument and one which was put to us forcibly. We accept it.  This is the way we moved, to give some concession.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Bruton's amendment, even if I accepted the underlying intention of his amendment, I would have to give very careful consideration to the precise wording of it.  As the proposal does not affect tax for this year, it does not need to be included in the present resolution.  I would be prepared to give consideration to the proposal when preparing the confirming section of the Finance Bill.  However, if I accepted the underlying intention, what we would be doing would be in conflict with the whole basis of the income tax code, which is that allowances and relief are available only for a particular tax year and if unused are not available to carry forward. If this principle of carry forward was concerned here it should apply in respect of all income tax allowances and deductions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>This would lead to untold confusion and would inevitably lead to the manipulation of taxable incomes.  It would also give rise to serious administrative difficulties.  The Government have announced that this allowance is only an interim measure and the whole <Col N="162" /> PRSI system will be subject to review. The reason I made those points in relation to Deputy Bruton's amendment is that the wording, even if I accepted it, could be inequitable and the parliamentary draughtsman would have to have a serious look at it.  There is no provision in it for marginal relief.  If the Deputy wishes to pursue it he can do so in another way as we will be discussing this resolution as part of the Finance Bill.  The Deputy and I will have plenty of opportunity between now and then to examine it in detail.  However, if the Deputy pursues it in the form of wording before us, I would have to oppose it.</P>

I intend to press my amendment to a vote.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Clare):</i> The purpose of the Bill is to approve the terms of the agreement establishing the Common Fund for Commodities and to enable this country to honour its financial and other obligations as a signatory.</P>
      <P>We can trace the origin of the fund to the Fourth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD-IV) held in Nairobi in May 1976 which adopted the Integrated Programme for Commodities (IPC).  The main objectives of the IPC are:</P>
      <P>&mdash; to diversify and expand the processing of commodities in developing tain adequate production and at the same time be consistent with the long-term progress of developing countries;</P>
      <P>&mdash; to diversify and expand the proccessing of commodities in developing countries and to modernise their marketing and distribution systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Conference on International Economic Cooperation (CIEC) agreed at Paris in June 1977 that a common fund should be established to serve as a key instrument in attaining the objectives of the IPC.  A negotiating conference was convened to work out the common fund's functions and structure.  After several meetings in Geneva the Agreement Establishing the Common Fund for Commodities <Col N="168" /> was finally adopted there in June 1980.</P>
    <P>The basic function of the common fund will be to provide loans to International Commodity Organisations (ICOs) to enable them to intervene in the market with a view to stabilising commodity prices.  Let us take the International Natural Rubber Agreement as an example. If there is an excessive supply of rubber on the market the rubber organisation may borrow from the first account of the Fund to purchase some of the excess stock, thus restricting supplies and ensuring a minimum price.  Conversely, if the price of rubber begins to rise rapidly stocks may be released onto the market, thereby increasing the supply and preventing the price from rising above an agreed ceiling.  In the event both producers and consumers benefit from greater stability of supply and price.</P>
    <P>In particular, the fund must be seen as a helpful gesture to the Third World which relies so heavily on the production of primary commodities.  It should give some momentum to the various international movements which have evolved in recent years with a focus on the Third World and a clear call for action.  I might, for example, refer to the Brandt Commission which reported on international development issues.  It declared:</P>
    <P>An action programme must be launched comprising emergency and longer-term measures, to assist the poverty belts of Africa and Asia and particularly the least developed countries. Measures would include large regional projects of water and soil management; the provision of health care and the eradication of diseases;... afforestation projects; solar energy development; mineral and petroleum exploration; and support for industrialisation, transport and other infrastructural investment.</P>
    <P>It went on:</P>
    <P>Such a programme would require additional financial assistance of at least $4 billion per year for the next two decades, at grant or special concessional <Col N="169" /> terms assured over long periods and available in flexibly usable forms. New machinery is required on a regional basis to coordinate funding and to prepare plans in cooperation with lending and borrowing countries. Greater technical assistance should be provided to assist such countries with the preparation of programmes and projects.</P>
    <P>We would see the common fund as a significant step in the implementation of such a programme.  We have taken an active part in the preparation of the agreement and, being aware of our obligations to the Third World, are glad to be associated with the fund, to contribute to its financial resources and to ensure that it operates effectively.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, of course, appreciate that in helping the Third World one is also helping international trade as a whole.  Ireland, in common with other developed countries, has a vital interest in market stability for raw materials.  In addition, price stability will strengthen Third World purchasing power, so improving international trade generally.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the agreement which forms the Schedule to the Bill.  The explanatory memorandum already gives an outline of the content so I do not propose to describe it in any great detail.</P>
    <P>The common fund will have two separate accounts, one to be used for market intervention, the other for research and development.  The first account will provide credit to international commodity organisations for the purchase of buffer stocks of their respective commodities when supplies reaching the market are excessive, The buffer stocks will be owned and managed internationally.  The first account should, in fact, lead to the conclusion of more commodity agreements because ICOs will know in advance that they can get the financial resources required for intervention buying and selling.</P>
    <P>The second account will be used to provide loans and grants to ICOs and other designated bodies associated on a continuing basis with the trade, production and consumption of particular commodities. <Col N="170" /> The objective is to promote research and to improve productivity and marketing.  For example, developing countries will be encouraged to engage in additional processing of goods within their own territories and greater diversification in production.</P>
    <P>The first account will be financed from directly contributed capital, that is, member's subscription to shares, capital guarantees and cash deposits from ICOs associated with the fund, and borrowings from the financial markets.  The resources of the second account will consist of an initial allocation from the share subscription to the first account, additional voluntary contributions from members and borrowings.  The target set for resources is US $750 million - $400 million for the first account and $350 million for the second account.</P>
    <P>Membership of the fund is open to all states who are members of the United Nations or of any of its specialised agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  It will be managed by a governing council and an executive board.  Each member state will appoint one governor to the council which will elect 28 executive directors to the board.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the agreement are the customary ones for international financial institutions and deal with such matters as the legal status of the fund, immunities from judicial proceedings, interpretation and arbitration procedures, process of amendment and provision for entry into force.</P>
    <P>Ireland's commitments to the fund will consist of US $1,000,000 for the purchase of shares in the initial capital of the fund. A portion of this may be transferred to the second account.  This country will also provide a voluntary contribution of US $250,000 to the second account.  These payments will be spread over a two-year period after the entry into force of the agreement.  Besides we will have certain liabilities as members of international commodity organisations associated with the fund.  These would consist of the annual membership subscription to each ICO and the provision of guarantees which each member may have to give <Col N="171" /> from time to time as part security for ICO borrowings from the fund.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I will summarise briefly the provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 defines various terms.  Section 2 provides for approval of the agreement.  Section 3 contains the financial and other provisions.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides for the payment out of the Central Fund of subscriptions for shares in the fund, both the initial shares and those issued subsequent to reviews of the existing levels of paid-in capital.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides for the payment, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, of an initial contribution to the second account and of later contributions to this account subsequent to reviews of the adequacy of its resources.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides for the issue and discharge of guarantees, required by reason of the State's participation in international commodity organisations associated with the fund.  Such guarantees are given by means of a ministerial order.  This subsection also provides for the repayment, out of voted moneys, to the Central Fund of moneys paid on foot of guarantees.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) provides for the issue and discharge of promissory notes which may be used in part payment of share subscriptions and cashed at the discretion of the fund.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) states that ministerial orders relating to guarantees must be approved beforehand by affirmative resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the disposal of any moneys received under the agreement. Section 5 provides for payment of administration expenses.  The Schedule contains the text of the agreement.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I am disappointed with the content of the speech of the Minister of State.  This is the first issue in the area of development co-operation to come before this House since this Government came to power.  I had hoped the opportunity would be used to provide a <Col N="172" /> statement of policy of general intent in the area of development co-operation. Instead the Minister of State has confined himself to a very correct but rather erudite approach.  In the light of the major advances made in the area of development co-operation during the term of office of the Coalition Government, I am entitled to be disappointed at htis approach.  There are few enough occasions that this House has the opportunity to discuss development co-operation issues and any such occasion should be used to the full.  In particular, and speaking from the Opposition benches, I believe we are entitled to know the general thrust and policy of the present Government in the area of development co-operation. The fact that Fianna Fáil's record on development co-operation in the past has been so weak, coupled with the Taoiseach's failure so far to appoint a Minister of State for Development and Co-operation, gives rise to very grave suspicions in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, recognising the appalling level of crime and vandalism, declares a crime emergency in the Dublin Metropolitan area, and calls for all reasonable steps to be taken urgently, to bring the situation under control, including the reform of the law and the expansion and re-organisation of the Garda as rapidly as possible including the consideration of establishing a Dublin Garda Reserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Dubliner it grieves me to have to move a motion of this kind.  Not only Dubliners are appalled and grieved at what has happened to this city.  In a short number of years it has become a city of shutters and barbed wire; it has become a city of two armed bandits.  It is worth spending a few minutes to tell the House some of the experiences of people in this <Col N="173" /> city.  It is worth underlining at the outset that this is no longer a problem in only what are called crime-prone areas, although it is obviously more acute there, but there is no area of this city where people do not feel fearful and unhappy about the state of law and order.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency over the past few years at least six people I know were forced to abandon their homes and many more had to take extraordinary protective measures to give them a sense of security in their homes &mdash; shutters on windows, bars behind windows, triple locks on doors, alarms back and front and lights on in houses and shops.  The story is horrific.  It is a story which makes every Dubliner, and every Irishman, sad and, more than that, everyone is exasperated. If we cannot put together a series of actions to resolve this problem I fear many people will take the law into their own hands and that will lead to a disastrous situation.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister I said Dublin had become bandit country, a paradise for criminals, and this is true today.  This is a city where Al Capone and his Chicago henchmen would feel at home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>They would be terrified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we can exaggerate this problem.  As I said, there is no area in this city where people are not fearful but the problem is worse in some areas than in others.  I believe very few people can understand the fear and oppression felt in some of the worst areas.  This is very alarming and sad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is twofold: we have serious crime on the one hand and petty crime on the other.  Both are rampant. Petty crime covers car stealing, which has reached epidemic proportions because not only do people steal cars but they burn them, drive them at people and so on.  People have been killed on our streets and more have been injured, many of them walking on footpaths or even in their own gardens.  Last night I met a lady in my constituency clinic who told me two of her sons who were behind the railings in her garden, were knocked down by a stolen car, both their legs were <Col N="174" /> broken and they suffered serious injuries. These people do not get compensation because there is no insurance.  A few weeks ago a gentleman with a young child in the back of his car, was about to drive off.  A stolen car came up the road and gardaí came around the corner to block the road; they drove up on the footpath and knocked over the parked car very seriously injuring the child.  These are not rare occurrences.  At 8.30 a.m. six or seven weeks ago a man parked his car outside a shop while he went in to buy his newspaper and his car was stolen.  By 11 a.m. a six-year-old child was in St. Mary's Hospital, Crumlin, in a critical condition, marked from head to toe.  I cannot exaggerate the extent of this problem.</P>
    <P>Crime and vandalism are rampant &mdash; car stealing, wrecking and raiding telephone boxes, wrecking bus shelters, raiding pharmacies for drugs, muggings, breaking into cars halted at traffic lights, especially those driven by women, and so on.  Every Dublin TD knows the extent of this problem but it is worth putting it on the record that this is what life is like today in this once fair city of ours.</P>
    <P>We talk about serious crime and petty crime, both of which are equally rampant. We have bank robberies, post office robberies, shop robberies, armed robberies, shootings and murders.</P>
    <P>We have to ask ourselves what has given rise to this problem.  What are the causes of this problem?  Some people would say this is part of a growth in crime throughout the western world.  I suppose there is an element of truth in that, but an element only.  In any of the cities of the Continent of Europe which I was lucky enough to visit in recent years, I was struck by the absence of shutters on windows, by the absence of vandalism, and the security on the streets even late at night is very remarkable indeed. Unlike other European cities, this city of ours sticks out like a very sore thumb. We cannot write it off as part of an international spiral of crime, although we have to accept that is part of the reason for our problem.</P>
    <P>There are six or seven major reasons why we have the problems we have <Col N="175" /> today.  I will come back to them in detail later on.  The first is the state of the law. There is no doubt that the state of the law combined with judges' rules and successive court rulings are a major factor. Secondly, there is the number and disposition of the Garda.  Thirdly, there is the drugs problem.  Fourthly, there is the juvenile drink problem.  Fifthly there is unemployment.</P>
    <P>The sixth and seventh reasons are fairly new, and I want to develop them for some time.  The sixth reason is that many parents have &ldquo;copped out&rdquo; of their responsibility for their own children. Neglectful parents are one of the most significant contributory factors to the disgraceful state of law and order in this city.  I have been amazed at the number of people who have come to me as a TD, and as Minister for Justice, and told me that they found out after four, five, six or seven days that their child was in Mountjoy.  When I asked them, &ldquo;Did you not think of inquiring after the first night?&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;Oh no, he often stays out for a few nights.&rdquo; The frequency with which that has been said to me has absolutely appalled me.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that neglectful parents are one of the reasons, if not the major reason, why crime and vandalism are out of control in this city.  I have been at meetings in my own constituency which were packed with hundreds of people concerned and enraged about the law and order situation.  As Minister for Justice, I had to bear the brunt of their criticisms.  When I asked them did they know where their children were that night, some of them did not.  When I asked were these vandals and thugs and criminals from outside their areas, or were they local, I was told that of course they were local and they were the children of some of the people who were complaining.  If we are to get this problem under control, we cannot expect the Government to do it all.  We must give back to the parents the responsibility they once took for their own children's actions.  We must put the onus back on the parents to keep their children under control.  I am not sure how we are to do that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> There are several proposals which are worth thinking about.  A popular one is that the penalty for any crime or misdeed committed by juveniles should be visited on the parents.  Very often that solution is advocated to me by people who come to talk to me about this terrible problem. Sadly, I have to admit that I know decent parents who are living in fear of their own children, and who are being intimidated by their 14-, 15- and 16-year-old children. That is very sad indeed.</P>
    <P>The seventh reason is a connected reason. The seventh factor contributing to this crime wave is the attitude of the community in general.  We could have regiments of the Garda in every parish in Dublin and in every village in Ireland and yet not get the problem under proper control unless the attitude of the community to crime is unequivocal and condemnatory from beginning to end.  The community has abandoned the old moral and social controls which used to keep crime off the streets, and which used to make Dublin a peaceful and safe place to live in.  We can seek and get hundreds and thousands of extra gardaí &mdash; and we will have to get them &mdash; but, in the end, that will be futile unless we can restore to the community a sense of right and wrong.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately in our society tolerance is the order of the day.  There are no taboos.  Everything goes.  In some areas it is worse than that.  All too frequently the criminal is not the subject of condemnation but the subject of not-too-secret admiration.  This is the lovable rogue syndrome. As a society we are deifying dishonesty. Only when we abandon our ambivalence about right and wrong, and our tolerance of wrong, will we begin to restore to the community the necessary sense of right and wrong.  This would have a much more beneficial effect on the law and order problem than recruiting thousands of extra gardaí, even though they are necessary.</P>
    <P>In this respect we politicians have a particular role to play.  We all know that, for so long as politics have been in existence, politicians have been represented <Col N="177" /> as dishonest, opportunist, and so on.  We in this House have a particular duty to give a lead in honesty and in showing that there is a difference between right and wrong, that there is a value in telling the truth, and in doing the right thing, and that doing the wrong thing or being dishonest is wrong and counter-productive. We should not suppose that if we give dishonest leadership in our actions and deeds, in our omissions or commissions, that that is not being followed in society at large, because it is.  And it is because dishonesty is verified in our society we have many of our present problems.</P>
    <P>I said that there are seven problems now listed.  The first I said was the state of the law.  There is no doubt that throughout western democracy it would be difficult to find a police force which has to operate under more restrictive legislation than ours.  The Garda Síochána are severely handicapped by the state of the law.  The proposals on which I was working diligently as Minister, and on which I have no doubt my successor is now working, contained several important key points.  I should say at the outset that in any changes to be effected in the law we should be very careful not to react in panic, not to over-react, because if we do there would be the danger that we could worsen the situation rather than improve it.  A very fine balance indeed needs to be struck but at present the law is wholly imbalanced in favour of the criminal.</P>
    <P>The changes in the law I advocate contain the following main points.  Firstly, there is the question of the power of Garda to hold people for questioning in serious ordinary criminal cases, if I might describe them as such.  I propose that the Garda should have powers to hold people up to 24 hours for questioning in certain cases.  At present they have no such power except under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act.  They are, I think, the only police force in Europe who do not have the power to take people in for questioning.  Secondly, I propose that majority verdicts in jury cases be introduced so that if any ten members of a jury vote for a verdict of guilty or not guilty, that would constitute <Col N="178" /> a sufficient majority to carry the day. Interestingly enough in the past week a person came to me who had been engaged on a jury recently.  According to that juror the accused was manifestly guilty.  Eleven of the 12 jurors so agreed at the very beginning of their sitting but one obstructive juror, who was very anti-Garda, would not agree and held up the case.  I am not saying that is a frequent occurrence but it does occur.  Therefore, there is a need for majority verdicts in jury cases.  Thirdly, there is the question of alibis.  This is a small but significant point.  If a defendant or accused is going to produce an alibi at a court hearing advance notice should be given to the prosecution so that they be given time to test that alibi.  At present such alibis are given without notice and very often put the prosecution at a complete disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, I propose the moderation of the rights &mdash; rights plural &mdash; of silence: (a) that if an accused or a suspect refuses to answer Garda questions that in future such silence can be referred to in the court case leaving the court or jury free to draw what inference from that fact they feel reasonable in the circumstances. At present that fact cannot be referred to at all.  The other change in the rights of silence I would advocate is to remove altogether the right to unsworn statements, to make it compulsory for a defendant to go into the witness box, under oath, to be cross-examined.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, there is the question of bail, in respect of which there are constitutional problems involved.  This is a matter we shall have to face up to before too long &mdash; perhaps later on this year &mdash; when we shall have to consider a constitutional amendment because of the serious problems emanating from the Supreme Court decision.  However, we can improve the situation greatly through legislation, by banning the practice in the courts of concurrent sentencing and insisting instead on consecutive sentencing in all cases.  I should say that a practice has grown up that when criminals are caught for one offence and get bail &mdash; because in 99 per cent of cases they must &mdash; it is then in their interest to go out and commit as <Col N="179" /> many crimes as they like because the chances are they will end up being given concurrent sentences for all of those crimes.  There is another practice that has grown up, that when one criminal is caught he asks that a lot of crimes committed by his pals be taken into consideration so that they become free from being charged for those crimes later on and remain free to commit further crimes.  Were we to introduce consecutive rather than concurrent sentencing that problem would be greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>I would advocate also giving the Garda powers to fingerprint, take photographs and other forensic samples, on this condition, that once a suspect ceased to be a suspect or is found not guilty, all samples and copies of such samples be destroyed in front of the accused person.</P>
    <P>To offset these proposals and ensure that a balance is maintained &mdash; which is vitally important and something of which I hope the Minister is aware &mdash; it is of the utmost importance to include in the same Bill some proposals to deal with custodial guardians, as referred to in the Ó Briain Report.  The House will recall that the Ó Briain Report suggested that a garda be custodial guardian in each Garda station. I have given very close consideration to that proposal and find it to be totally impractical.  First of all, it would tie up an awful lot more gardaí that we urgently need on our streets.  Secondly, if allegations persist against the Garda &mdash; and this was one of the reasons the Ó Briain Committee was established, to protect the Garda against false allegations &mdash; and the press or politicians go to a custodial guardian who is a garda will anybody believe that he under questioning is an independent witness to what happened? Will anybody believe him if he says there was no oppressive questioning or no brutality by the Garda, that the accused is a liar?  Of course they will not, even when the garda is telling the truth.  Therefore, we must have an independent type of custodial guardian.  That is why I propose that in each division of the Garda Síochána there be a board of custodial guardians comprised of volunteers, of people of high standing in the community, <Col N="180" /> who would each be available, say, for a 48-hour period in any 4-week cycle. This will not be easy to organise or without problems but I believe it has great merit from the points of view of involving the community &mdash; which I hope to deal with later &mdash; and of the great number of people who would be very pleased to serve in a capacity like this.</P>
    <P>The idea would be that an accused when taken in for questioning under the powers given in the proposed Bill would be cautioned at the outset that he had the right to have a custodial guardian present for the duration of the questioning.  If he opts for that a guardian would be called who would not interfere in the questioning but merely observe it for fear that later there would be allegations against the Garda or for fear questions would arise as to whether the defendant was improperly or oppressively questioned. That protects both garda and suspect. The idea basically comes from the North and from England where there is a large number of lay magistrates who serve voluntarily and make themselves available for 48 or 72 hours in every four weeks' period and are on call.  It would also have the advantage of involving very little cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The second balancing measure I would propose is that a person of very high standing in the community nationally would be appointed as an independent complaints officer.  In my term of office I was accused &mdash; indeed I was wrongly accused by the present Minister &mdash; of interfering with the Garda.  A Minister, especially a Minister in Dublin, is bound to get a great deal of complaints against the Garda.  I am glad to say most of the complaints are spurious but no Minister having received complaints can bury his head in the sand and not ask for a report on them as I had to do.  Understandably that is not appreciated by the garda on duty who is under immense pressure to catch criminals and to prevent and detect crime.  I can understand the human reaction that the Minister is on the side of the criminal and is interfering, but if the Minister did not inquire he would be accused by others of covering up.</P>
    <P>In order to avoid allegations of political <Col N="181" /> interference or cover-up it would be much better if we had an officer of high standing nationally, independent in his function, to whom complaints would be made.  This is a reasonable half-way house; it is not an independent complaints tribunal, since there are many complex questions involved in that and I shall come to it later, but at the same time it removes from the Minister the problems I have mentioned.  I think it would also reassure the community that there is no political cover-up and no reason for it and no political interference with the Garda.</P>
    <P>These are the major changes now needed in the criminal justice law.  I hope the Minister will be able to bring in his proposals &mdash; I know he is working on them &mdash; before the summer recess because it is urgent.  Two other laws need urgent attention also.  One is the drink law, especially as it relates to juvenile drinking.  The present Minister when Minister of State had begun some work on this matter.  I and Deputy Spring as my Minister of State continued that work and I hope that the new law relating to juvenile drinking and other matters involving alcohol will be before the House before long.  The areas that I believe need attention are, first, the question of young people working and drinking in pubs; second, the question of beer and wine being available off the shelves in supermarkets.  Young children can take these from the shelves, and go to a girl of 16 or 17 years of age at the cash register with them.  There is no control. There is also the question of disco licences and extensions, hotel licences and extensions.  These are the main areas where this law can be changed to protect the young against danger of abuse of alcohol which is the source of much of our crime.</P>
    <P>The other area is the abuse of drugs, which is a massive problem, part of a major international wave.  The Department of Justice and the Department of Health in my time &mdash; I know this is ongoing &mdash; had been reviewing the Misuse of Drugs Act with a view to strengthening it.  Again, I hope the Minister for Health can bring in those amendments before <Col N="182" /> the summer recess.  The drug problem will be an ongoing one.  Again, it is an area in which parents have a very major role to play.  These three major areas in the law need attention.</P>
    <P>I had also proposed to have a white paper this year on other related matters including the idea of a national peace authority, the idea of Garda community councils and the idea of a Garda reserve especially in the Dublin area.  The Minister's amendment deletes this proposal &mdash; it is not even to be considered.</P>
    <P>In the time left I want to deal with the idea of the Garda reserve.  There is a police reserve in London and while I was there last December I met the Home Secretary and I spoke about the value of the police reserve in London.  I was convinced from these discussions and others that this is certainly something we should consider as part of the solution to our problems.  If the Minister were to get all the money he wanted from the Minister for Finance tomorrow he would have serious difficulties in training sufficient gardaí.  Templemore Training Depot can only accommodate, I think, 500 or 600 people at most and that only if you abandon all other courses.  In reality I think the most that can be trained would be 600 in a 10-month period.  But there are other courses that must go on and in reality at the moment the greatest number of new recruits that can be taken at Templemore is 250 unless everything else is abandoned.</P>
    <P>Can we expand or extend training facilities?  I had been looking into that and I am sure the present Minister is doing likewise but certainly it cannot be done overnight.  At least it will take months, perhaps much longer.  We certainly need to expand training capacity, but having said that, even if we doubled training capacity, allowing for natural wastage in the Garda, we will not get a massive increase in numbers overnight or even over months.  In fact, if we are to get the 3,000 extra gardaí which the association say they need &mdash; and I agree with them &mdash; it will take, at the present rate of recruitment and of natural wastage, something like six or seven years.  That is where the Garda reserve comes in.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="183" /> There is another reason.  All over the city vigilante groups are springing up. That is very dangerous and the situation is so bad that I fear we will have very serious incidents if people take the law into their own hands.  Behind the vigilante groups idea &mdash; which is a negative expression of a certain desire &mdash; there is something positive.  The community are saying they want the Garda to maintain peace, to prevent crime and to detect it. I appeal to the Minister not to reject the idea out of hand but to think about it. There are thousands of decent people in Dublin who are willing to serve the community and to help restore some sort of peace, order and calm to this beloved and distraught capital city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>As soon as copies are available they will be distributed.  The number of indictable offences reported to the Garda in 1981 was 89,400, as against a figure of 72,782 for 1980.  This represents a percentage increase of 22.8. Of the figure of 89,400 offences, 2,475 were in respect of offences against the person, 28,914 in respect of offences against property with violence, 57,647 in respect of larcenies etc. and the remaining 364 were in the miscellaneous category. The overall detection rate was 36.7 per cent as against 39.9 per cent in 1980. As might be expected in view of the concentration of population in the area, most crime was committed in the Dublin Metropolitan Area, the percentage being 59.1.</P>
      <P>These figures must cause considerable concern to anyone with a genuine desire for improvement of the quality of life in our society.  They also show the enormous task facing the members of the Garda Síochána who are charged with the onerous work of protecting our citizens and preventing crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past decade or so there have been substantial changes in the extent and nature of crime in this country.  The level of serious crime is of particular concern <Col N="185" /> as is the casual manner in which violence is used in the commission of even the most petty of offences.  The great changes in modern society must undoubtedly have a bearing on the level of crime.  More property is available.  Television has a great influencing effect. More people are travelling abroad.  Concepts like discipline and obedience are no longer in vogue.</P>
    <P>There have been many outrages in recent years including, of course, the tragic killing of a number of members of the force in the carrying out of their duty. One must feel deeply disturbed at the increasing extent to which firearms are being carried by criminals and the brazen ease with which firearms are regularly discharged in the commission of crime.</P>
    <P>The upsurge in the use of violence is not something which is peculiar to this country but is a phenomenon experienced in developed countries the world over.  The many social advances of modern times have been accompanied by a growth in the number of individuals who are determined to reject society and its values.  This rejection is carried out by attacking the institutions of society and is typically done by way of assaults, break-ins and the vandalism of property. We are all aware of the muggings that take place in our cities and towns.  There have been attacks on women and children. Shopkeepers and pharmacists have been assaulted and robbed.  Gardaí, post office staff, bank employees and employees of business firms have been attacked. Bus crews have been threatened, intimidated and assaulted.  I share the public concern about these offences and I deplore such attacks on people who are providing important services to the community and indeed on any other people.</P>
    <P>Crimes of violence have two effects. The physical injury or intimidation involved is the obvious direct effect. There is another indirect effect which is not so obvious and that is the fear and anxiety violent crime creates among people who are not themselves the victims. The second effect is largely overlooked. However, it can reach substantial proportions and cause people to remain indoors, not daring to venture forth after <Col N="186" /> dark or to visit certain areas of the cities even in the day-time.  Sensational reporting of crime can cause unnecessary worry and anxiety, particularly to our senior citizens, and I hope that the mass media will bear this in mind in performing their important task of keeping the public informed.</P>
    <P>The most visible form of violence, particularly for those who live in an urban environment, is the senseless vandalism of property which is such a common feature of our life today.  Most acts of vandalism are, by themselves, of a somewhat trivial nature but in many cases they can cause serious inconvenience or even danger where they damage essential services. This type of crime against society is one which is costing the taxpayer millions of pounds every year and undoubtedly has an adverse effect on our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>These violent attacks on person and property cannot and will not be condoned. We are living in an age in which there is less respect for the rule of law; but respect for the rule of law is a fundamental requirement of a civilised democratic state.  This Government are convinced of the need to strengthen law and order.  Those who flout the law and cause injury to persons and property cannot be allowed to succeed.  The Government are affording a top priority to restoring safety and security for our people in their homes and on the streets and to the protection of life and property.</P>
    <P>This Government are also giving the growth of drug abuse and the crimes associated with it urgent attention.  This is a menace which attacks our young people, takes advantage of their immaturity and causes untold misery and hardship. A concerted effort by a number of agencies and by the general public is needed to eliminate this grave threat to society.  The Garda Síochána have my full support and encouragement in their campaign against the trafficker in drugs.  The emphasis that is currently being placed on training members of the force to deal with drug abuse is already showing positive results by increased seizures and prosecutions.  We all have a role to play in eliminating this scourge from our midst and I am confident that the Garda <Col N="187" /> Síochána will play their part in bringing to rask those who exploit our youth by way of drugs.</P>
    <P>It is important that parents, teachers, clergy and other responsible groups in society make themselves aware of the dangers posed by drug abuse.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, recently announced that he is making an additional £250,000 available to the Health Education Bureau to undertake an urgent national programme of counselling and preventive education aimed primarily at parents.  This will involve the training of teachers, doctors, pharmacists, health board personnel and other responsible persons as drug educators to operate extensively throughout the community and particularly in the schools. This type of positive support will enable parents to react at an early stage to any evidence of drug abuse in their children. It will also develop an awareness of the human suffering and misery which this evil can cause.</P>
    <P>I have recently announced as a result of discussions with the Garda Commissioner that members of the Garda Síochana of Inspector level will now be going into second-level education schools, initially in urban centres such as Dublin, Cork Galway, Waterford, Sligo and Limerick.  Their visits will be to heighten the awareness of young people to the serious problem of drug abuse, to inform them of the things to look out for and to ask their support in identifying the perpetrators either by communication of knowledge to their parents or teachers or to members of the Garda.  The purpose of the visits will also be to inform young people of the terrible risks involved in drug abuse and of the impact drug abuse has on crime generally by way of robberies and vandalism.</P>
    <P>Drug pushers can expect no refuse or no asylum where I am concerned.  Everything at my disposal and at the disposal of the Garda Commissioner will be used against them.  The full rigours of the law will be applied.  These are evil men and women who prey on our young people with extraordinarily damaging effects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="188" /> An all-out campaign will be waged against them.</P>
    <P>I am seeking the removal of the phrase in the motion relating to the declaration of a crime emergency, because proposing that Dáil Éireann declare a crime emergency is strictly speaking without meaning in this particular context.  I do not say this in any offensive sense but strictly as a fact.  If, as I believe, what the Deputy has in mind is that the Dáil should place on record that in its view the crime situation is serious, I think that that is adequately done by the remainder of the motion.  I do not think that the House should be put in the position of adopting a form of words which, as I have said, is literally without meaning.  My objection to the phrase is nothing to do with the substance, but rather the form, and I hope the Deputy on reflection will agree with this.  I recognise that there is a serious problem.  I am taking emergency steps to deal with it and I propose to outline these presently.  They are steps taken in a matter of weeks by me, and are part of early preliminary steps to deal with what I recognise as an urgent situation.</P>
    <P>The Government regard the present levels of crime and lawlessness as unacceptable and are taking concrete measures to defeat the criminal.</P>
    <P>With regard to the expansion of the Garda Síochána, as already announced in the budget speech of 25 March, additional funds amounting to £2,500,000 have been provided for the recruitment and equipping of extra gardaí.  Deputies will I am sure be pleased to hear that since taking office as Minister for Justice, I have arranged to have the intake of recruits accelerated.  Since 10 March, a total of 276 recruits have been appointed and by next week, the Garda Training Centre at Templemore will be filled to its existing capacity of approximately 300. As soon as these recruits complete training, they will be replaced by 300 more, so that a total of 600 will be trained, or in training, by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>This is a far cry from 25 last January, and how the then Minister for Justice thought he was going to take any steps to handle crime beats me.  He is talking <Col N="189" /> about a reserve force now &mdash; he had no more than 25 recruits in Templemore last January.  I wonder how serious Deputy Mitchell can be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>How he intended to solve the problem of law and order with 25 additional recruits since last January I do not know.  Their passing out parade was unknown to the population.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Garda authorities to see what can be done to provide additional accommodation and facilities for the training of extra gardaí.  The Office of Public Works have been asked to provide prefabricated buildings for use as classrooms at Templemore, and proposals for the provision of additional sleeping accommodation for recruits are at present under consideration.  While I am not in a position just now to say precisely how many extra gardaí can be appointed this year, in addition to the 600 I have just mentioned, Deputies may take it that the number involved will be substantial.</P>
      <P>I am also glad to be in a position to announce that I have obtained approval from the Government for the appointment of over 160 civilian clerical staff for Garda offices, with a view to releasing gardaí for outdoor police duties. Already, arrangements have been made to have more than 90 of the new staff appointed by the end of this month.  It is expected that the remainder will be appointed by the end of June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of establishing a garda reserve, it is not clear what type of reserve force the Deputy has in mind. If he has in mind the re-employment of retired gardaí, then, apart from any other consideration, the numbers who have retired on age grounds in recent years and who would be likely to be available <Col N="190" /> are so small that their re-employment would in practical terms have no impact on the overall crime situation.  If the Deputy is referring to the establishment of a volunteer group who would be trained and called to assist the Garda in certain situations, then I would not favour the proposal, particularly in a situation in which there is no difficulty in recruiting suitable men and women for the Garda Síochána.  Some of the problems about the introduction of a reserve force are that it is undesirable to establish a force with police powers but without police discipline.  It is not at all certain that it would make for a better police system and, as I have just mentioned, there is no shortage of recruits for the Garda Síochána.  The problem about allowing a group of people to exercise police powers without their being subject to police discipline is that the citizen would be deprived of a very important protection from those who enforce the law, which he now has, and which is his right.  There would also be problems at present about providing even limited training for a reserve force, due to the large numbers of recruits being trained. All in all, the arguments against such a force carry more weight than those in favour, and as I have indicated, I am not prepared to recommend this proposal to the Government.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken of the Government's commitment to increasing the strength of the Force and now wish to outline other measures by which the effectiveness of the Force is to be improved.</P>
    <P>It is one thing to increase the strength of the Force, but it is equally important to see that Garda manpower is used in the most effective way possible.  With this end in view, studies have been going on in recent times to see whether it is possible to improve on means by which the Force is deployed in different areas.  It will readily be appreciated that the type of policing required in a city centre or suburban area differs from what may be best in a sparsely-populated rural area. These studies which were carried out by members of the Force's own Research and Planning unit and the Department of <Col N="191" /> the Public Service's Operations Research unit have resulted in plans, which were accepted by both my immediate predecessors and by the Garda Commissioner, for possible new ways for policing rural areas.  It has been agreed that these plans should first be implemented on a trial basis and pilot schemes will get under way in two specially selected districts, Claremorris and Thomastown, in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to ensure that not only is more manpower made available to the Force but that the best possible use is made of existing manpower and other resources.  I am confident that the experiments about to get under way in Claremorris and Thomastown represent an important step towards providing a better police service to the public.</P>
    <P>Garda effectiveness will not only be improved by additional manpower and improvements in deployment policy but also through the provision of improved back-up services for the Force.  An essential element in this process is the provision of the national radio-communications network which when completed, will cost in the region of £9 million and provide the Garda with a communications system as modern and sophisticated as any in Europe.  The final details for the supply of equipment are at present under negotiation and the stage will be reached in about two weeks when contracts can be signed for the supply of equipment, costing in excess of £3 million for the first phase of the network.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities and my Department are being assisted in the detailed planning and design of this system by a voluntary advisory committee drawn from the foremost experts in the field of communications.</P>
    <P>A new Garda computer has been installed already and is directly under the control of Garda management.  It will be operated by Garda personnel.  Work is proceeding on the transfer of existing Garda systems to the new computer.</P>
    <P>Coupled with the introduction of the national radio network, the new computer facilities, when fully operational, will ensure that a Garda on the beat in <Col N="192" /> any part of the country will have rapid access to centrally-stored information thus improving his and the Force's effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The Garda are meeting the challenge of the modern criminal by developing more advanced techniques not only for the purposes of detection but also for obtaining evidence to secure convictions. In some cases the use of forensic science can provide the best evidence.  I am fully convinced of the value of this service and, with Government approval, I am expanding significantly the forensic science facilities available to the Force by way of recruiting more scientists and providing more sophisticated equipment.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the criticism which has recently been made regarding the standard of Garda accommodation.  Progress has been and continues to be made on this problem.  In this regard, I would point to the acquisition of the High School complex in Harcourt Street which will serve as the new accommodation for the Dublin Metropolitan Area Headquarters staff and other Garda units. Work is also currently in progress on the replacement of 16 stations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>A large problem still, however, remains and in order to assess the exact extent of this a detailed census is being carried out of all Garda accommodation by officials of my Department and the Garda Housing Section.  When this survey is completed, later this year, it will enable a comprehensive building and renewal programme to be prepared.  I then intend to ask the Government to provide the funds and other resources necessary to have the problem tackled within an acceptable timespan.</P>
    <P>We all have a common interest in the development and maintenance of a peaceful and law-abiding community where men and women can go about their business without fear of intimidation or violence.  It can have a horrific, frightening effect on law-abiding citizens to see elderly people mugged, schools and shops vandalised, telephone kiosks smashed, and to see so many cars being stolen and used for criminal purposes. <Col N="193" /> The Garda Síochána are, of course in the forefront of the campaign against crime. This dedicated body of men and women are charged with a difficult task.  Much is expected of them and it is vital that they receive the full support and co-operation of the public on whose behalf they act. This partnership is of the utmost importance if the campaign against crime is to succeed.  It requires hard work and effort on both sides.  In enforcing the criminal law the Garda must ensure that they keep in touch with the needs and wishes of the community they serve.  The public, for their part, must be conscious of the fact that it is society that is being attacked by the criminal and the vandal and that it is in everybody's interest to support the good work of the Garda Síochána.  The Garda Síochána have, of course, always been aware of the great benefits to be derived from good community relations and the renewed emphasis now being placed on promoting Garda-community relations has my full support.  The expansion of liaison arrangements and the establishment of additional structures for co-operation between the Garda and their local communities seem to offer great potential for effective action against crime and ways of promoting developments on these lines are being examined at present.  Crimes of vandalism, car thefts, larcenies from cars and those types of crimes are seriously inflating the crime figures.  These are all areas where public co-operation, public awareness and parental control can have a major impact.</P>
    <P>In so far as the resolution advocates reform of the law, I am in full agreement with it.  Indeed one of my priorities is to amend the law to the extent necessary to remove outmoded provisions and to ensure that in general the legal system adequately and properly reflects changing concepts of criminal justice in our society.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy will be aware of the fact that there is a growing demand for the Garda to be given whatever powers are reasonably necessary to investigate crime and to bring the perpetrators to justice. There is also concern that the law should not allow criminals when apprehended to <Col N="194" /> escape punishment as a result of legal technicalities or loopholes.</P>
    <P>In earlier times the accused was at a serious disadvantage as compared with the prosecution.  During much of the last century, for example, it was the exception for an accused to be legally represented at his trial.  That situation has changed materially and nowadays, especially since the advent of free legal aid, the defence avails itself of every conceivable legal loophole in an attempt to secure an acquittal no matter how unmeritorious its case might be.  While I am not, of course, suggesting that there is anything improper about this, many people think that the changes that have taken place have gone too far in the other direction and that the balance needs to be restored.</P>
    <P>Nevértheless, we must be careful to ensure that any changes we do make do not go so far as to jeopardise the right of accused persons to a fair trial.  We are dealing here with what is essentially a delicate balance between two important, though conflicting, interests.  On the one hand, there is the interest of the community in ensuring that it is adequately protected from the criminal.  This means that crime must be properly investigated by the Garda, who undertake this work on behalf of the community, and that the guilty must be convicted and punished. On the other hand, it is essential that accused persons are dealt with fairly and that only the guilty are punished.  This is a difficult and complex matter and virtually every aspect of it has a constitutional law dimension which must be fully taken into account.  I must emphasise therefore that any changes that are to be made must be intrinsically right and justifiable on their merits.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I am glad to be able to confirm that work is proceeding urgently in my Department on the preparation of a Criminal Justice Bill.  I have had consultations with the Garda authorities and I shall be in a position to bring proposals for amending legislation before the Government at a very early date.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to thank Deputy Mitchell for tabling this motion and, <Col N="195" /> except for the deletions I have proposed in it, I accept the views expressed by him.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for the courtesy of making copies of his speech available and assure the Chair that I was not attempting to be obstructive.  The Minister said he wanted to base his case on certain statistics and it seemed desirable that we should have an opportunity of looking at them in a somewhat more considered manner than is possible when somebody is reading a speech at speed.</P>

      <P>I should like to address myself to the alternative wording now available to the House, the original motion as drafted by Deputy Mitchell and the deletion proposed by the Minister. The Minister suggested that it would be inappropriate and meaningless for the House to declare that a state of emergency in this case exists.  I should like to tell the Minister that his thinking in that area is at variance with the thoughts of many of his Dublin colleagues.  In fact, it is hard to understand how the Minister can make that statement when from his own backbenches Deputy Briscoe intervened to say that the situation in Dublin is now such that Al Capone would be afraid to walk the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misinterpreting what I said in that regard.  It is not possible for the Dáil to declare a crime emergency.  The Deputy, a barrister, must understand the constitutional requirements in that regard.  He should not confuse the issue and make it appear that I am not conscious of the emergency that exists on our streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is saying that the House is not being asked to declare an emergency as contemplated by the Constitution which would suspend normal legislation then, of course, that is the case and nobody on this side of the House contemplated that.  However, the <Col N="196" /> motion seeks to assert in the clearest and most unequivocal language possible the House's concern in a manner and language identical to language used by the Minister's party colleagues at meetings of Dublin Corporation.  That is a drafting point and we should not fall out over it. The Minister proceeds to recommend the deletion of portion of the motion which deals with consideration of the setting up of a Dublin Garda reserve.  I accept what the Minister has said in relation to difficulties arising in this regard.  I readily concede to the Minister that a number of points he has made against the proposal have weight and substance but I ask him to accept that there is merit in our proposal which seeks to channel constructively a deep feeling in the community for which if there is not a channel a negative outlet may be found.  That is worthy of consideration and is all the motion requests.  The motion does not pretend to have all the answers on this matter.  It does not say that the issue is clear-cut but asks the Minister to approach the issue with an open mind, to look at the suggestion to see if there is substance in it and if the advantages which would undoubtedly arise from it would outweigh the disadvantages which I accept must exist.</P>
      <P>The Minister has come in with a closed mind and rejected the suggestion out of hand.  That is unfortunate and he should reconsider his attitude.  I am not asking the Minister to say that he intends establishing a Dublin Garda reserve because it would be irresponsible of him to do that without proper consideration.  We are asking him to state that he is prepared to listen to views, to give the matter further thought.  Deputy Mitchell earlier examined this whole area comprehensively. What I should like to do is to see how we as legislators have served the Garda and the community.  To quite an extent we have failed in those areas.  All too often our response has been, in the wake of an atrocity or of a serious crime, to make declarations about our determination to stamp out crime but as soon as that crime has faded from the front pages of our newspapers our resolve weakens and the matter is put on the long finger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> How many more commissions must we have dealing with the structure of the Garda before the House and the Government get to grips with the problem? Again the situation is that wheneveer there is unrest in the Gardai, particularly in regard to pay &mdash; Ryan and Conroy &mdash; commissions investigate but as soon as the matters that brought the thing to a head, generally pay or working conditions, are dealt with the matter is allowed to slide.  It is pushed aside and we proceed as normal.  I should like to ask the Minister to consider the document produced last year by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.  They set out fully and thoughtfully what they saw as the role for the Garda and how they saw developments taking place.  That was a worthwhile document and is probably the clearest and most impressive contribution that has taken place in many years to this debate.  The Minister should respond to that by establishing now, when there is no particular hassle about pay or working conditions, a commission to examine the role of the Garda in the community &mdash; not a commission to be put on the long finger but one which will report within a specified period of six or nine months and be followed rapidly by legislation.</P>
    <P>If the Garda at present are relatively satisfied with their pay, other aspects of their working conditions are very much not to their liking.  We must accept that there is a significant degree of frustration among the Garda about the manner in which they are required to perform their duties and the difficulties which they face. Gardai required to investigate a crime find themselves in a situation where we as legislators have, over the years put obstacles in their way rather than sought to assist them.  Gardai seeking to follow up a suspect find themselves with no power of arrest for the purpose of questioning, save under the Offences against the State Act.</P>
    <P>I cherish our reputation as a liberal democracy, but do not believe that the United Kingdom, Germany and many of our partners in the European Community are any less liberal democracies and all of these find it necessary and desirable to <Col N="198" /> allow to their policemen a much clearer and wider right of arrest for the specific purpose of questioning.</P>
    <P>If it is unsatisfactory that the law seems to give no such right of arrest, even worse, from the point of view of the Garda, is that the law in this area is so unclear.  Gardai seeking to arrest a suspect find themselves faced with at least two conflicting Supreme Court decisions. A garda in hot pursuit is now expected to try to distinguish between Supreme Court decisions &mdash; a task which, I suggest, would be a matter of difficulty for the most eminent senior counsel practising in the criminal field and a task to which those eminent senior counsel have devoted themselves day after day and week after week in the criminal courts. A garda in the course of investigation is now required to make an instant decision on whether or not this is a case where he is permitted to proceed to question.  That is an absurdity which has had practical consequences.</P>
    <P>In some of the most celebrated cases where arrests were made and no prosecutions followed &mdash; I am thinking specifically of some drugs cases &mdash; the difficulties that arose there, which were a source of scandal to the community, arose from an understandable misinterpretation by the Garda of their powers.  I do not blame the gardaí who were in charge of those investigations.  Any police force, in Europe or elsewhere, would find it difficult to get to grips with that situation.  I blame us, as legislators, and in saying that I am not making a party political point because this is an issue on which people on all sides of the House have responsibility.  The garda required to investigate a serious crime at the very least is entitled to have his rights and responsibilities clearly set out for him. That this House has lamentably failed to do.  If he gets over the question of the need to ask some questions of the suspect and to arrest the suspect, he is then faced with the situation of deciding what charges might be preferred.  He immediately comes face to face with the fact that much of our substantive criminal law is antiquated.</P>
    <P>The debate in this House earlier this <Col N="199" /> evening and, indeed, public debate generally, has tended to focus exclusively on the question of procedural changes, the need for change in the law of evidence, of arrest and so on, but the substantive law is actually in serious need of reform. It is a matter of great comment that the basic law which deals with offences against persons, of which there were 2,475 last year, dates from 1861 and the law in relation to offences against property dates from 1916.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in a number of respects our basic criminal code is seriously defective. Let me take just one example, the law relating to receiving stolen property. That, with respect, is a crying disgrace. The situation has now been reached where, in this city, nobody competently defended can ever be convicted of receiving stolen property because the obligation on the prosecution to prove that the accused knew that the goods were stolen is one which is not capable of being fulfilled. An accused gets into the witness box and says that he had reason to be suspicious because the price was a peculiar one but he thought that there might be something funny about it and that perhaps the goods had been smuggled in from Northern Ireland, or something like that.  As the law stands at the moment nobody will ever be convicted, provided the case is taken seriously and he sets out to be acquitted of receiving stolen goods. Clearly, that imposes a ridiculous burden on the Garda.  If they were able to deal with offences of receiving stolen property and get fences off the street, the market for the criminals would dry up and one could have reasonable expectation of cutting off crime at source.</P>
    <P>The case will then, presumably, come to the District Court where the accused will as a matter of form, be released on bail.  In 1966, the law on bail was set out in its present form.  Since then, there has been all but unanimous agreement that the law is unsatisfactory and yet absolutely nothing has happened.  We are apparently to have, before the end of the year, a referendum dealing with the protection of the right to life of the unborn child.  I appeal to the Minister to take <Col N="200" /> advantage of that referendum and to hold, on the same day, a referendum dealing with the laws on bail and making sense of the laws on bail.  At the moment they are nonsensical and are a cause of frustration and difficulty.</P>
    <P>If the case remains in the District Court and the accused finds himself out on bail, another difficulty arises.  The accused knows that when he comes up for trial the worst thing which can happen to him is a maximum sentence of twelve months. He knows that his trial will not be able to take place for three, four or six weeks, or whatever length it takes.  There is an obvious incentive to adopt the principle that one might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb &mdash; one might as well serve one's sentence of 12 months for six offences as for one.  There is an obvious incentive to commit further offences because the power of the District Court is limited, even on multiple offences, to imposing one single sentence of 12 months' imprisonment.  That is nonsense. Several years ago &mdash; the Minister may have the date for this but I have not at present &mdash; the Supreme Court directed a message to this House saying that that was an absurd situation which cried out for legislative action, and legislative action has not been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>If the case goes on, as the Minister has indicated, the defendant will be legally represented, almost always, and certainly in a very high number of cases, at the expense of the State.  In most cases in the District Court, the State will be represented only by the prosecuting garda. That is a most unsatisfactory situation. There has been much talk about cases being thrown out on technicalities, but much of that arises from the imbalance which exists inherently in a situation where one side is professionally represented and the other side, the prosecution, is represented by gardaí who are recruited on the basis of being policemen to apprehend criminals and are now required to act as advocates in court. Such an imbalance is bound to give rise to the sort of situation about which people have expressed unhappiness.</P>
    <P>In the space of the last week or so, this House has had occasion to consider in <Col N="201" /> some detail the outcome of one District Court decision.  Concern was expressed by many people in the House that an acquittal appeared to have little to do with merits and a great deal to do with technicalities.  It came as quite a shock to some people to realise how District Court proceedings ran but, in fact, acquittals on technicalities rather than on merits, is very frequent.  It arises from the fact that our criminal system is an adversarial one. We operate on the basis that it is a game and that it is for the prosecution to prove their case beyond all reasonable doubt. The defendant can sit there and smugly poke holes in the prosecution case afterwards. That is universally accepted.  I wonder whether it is a system which should remain unchallenged.  It does not have as its object even seeking the truth of the issue.  The onus that is placed on the tribunal or the district justice is not to seek and delve for the truth but to stand back as a referee and see who has won the game and, particularly in the case of a criminal case, whether the prosecution have scored enough goals to put them far enough ahead to be declared the winner.</P>
    <P>As long as that remains so, there will be public disquiet because they see acquittals which seem to have nothing to do with the merits of the case.  Perhaps it is an appropriate time to stand back and ask to what extent our criminal law and procedures serve us adequately and to what extent we should continue to rely entirely on a very British tradition of an adversarial system alone.  It is not a system which applies in very many countries in continental Europe, and their idea of an inquisitorial system, where there is an obligation on the tribunal to seek for the truth, is one which we could look at with some advantage.</P>
    <P>Assuming that the case actually proceeds and ends in a conviction, further difficulties are going to arise because the options available to the court are limited in the extreme.  Effectively, the options available are a custodial sentence, imprisonment or detention, or monetary penalties. In relation to monetary penalties, I think the Minister will readily accept that, for very many offences, the maximum <Col N="202" /> monetary penalty which is available to the court bears no relation to present monetary values.  In many relatively serious cases coming before the District Court, the option available to the court is a maximum fine of £100 or a custodial sentence.  That is ridiculous.  There is no earthly reason why a court deciding that it would be appropriate to impose a monetary penalty should not be at liberty to impose one that reflects the seriousness of the case, reflects today's value of money and the defendant's ability to raise that money over a period to meet the penalty imposed.</P>
    <P>I indicated already the problems which can arise in relation to custodial sentences, specifically those imposed by the District Court, which is debarred from imposing consecutive sentences.  As a result of this unsatisfactory situation, many judges are adopting extra-statutory procedures requiring defendants to pay large sums in compensation to nominated charities, to the victims of the crime and so on.  I welcome the initiative of those judges because it is appropriate that if the court is satisfied that a custodial sentence is not required, it should not find itself limited to imposing a nominal monetary penalty.  I also feel it is highly undesirable that in the particularly sensitive area of criminal law, so much should now operate outside what is actually laid down in the statutes.  The Minister should consider bringing before the House legislation to raise the maximum monetary penalties that are available by way of a straightforward traditional fine and giving express statutory authority across the board for the court to be in a position to direct defendants to pay compensation, particularly to victims of crimes against the person.</P>
    <P>The rather timid experiments that have been suggested in the area of community work orders should be extended.  In the last few days, when canvassing in the Dublin West by-election, I was struck by the number of times that people raised the question of crime, law and order.  I was surprised at the number of times that people said that it was all no good because when the Gardaí catch criminals they get off and that even when they do <Col N="203" /> not get off, the courts cannot do anything useful for them.  They also said, and I think they expressed a significant degree of maturity in this, that prison is no good and there is no other option available.</P>
    <P>The Minister could usefully look at some of the practices that have been adopted elsewhere in Europe and see which of them would be relevant to this jurisdiction.  There is room for experiment and thought in that area.  I am reminded of the fact that during the last general election campaign the then Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, visited the constituency of Dublin North-Central and, as part of that tour, went to Coolock Garda station where he met the chief superintendent and many of his senior officers.  They discussed generally the problems of crime in the area.  One might have expected that those senior officers would have placed emphasis on extra gardaí, more powers of arrest, wider latitude to question and so on.  Of course they raised all those things but one of the interesting things about that discussion was the very strong emphasis they put on their obligation to be seen as part of the community and the community's obligation to respond to this situation.  They specifically made the point that where young offenders have come under their notice and where they have been able to deal with the case under the provisions of the juvenile liaison scheme, they have had a staggering success rate.  In that district they claimed a success rate of 70 per cent.  If you compare the statistics for recidivism in all the penal institutions in the State there is a clear message that non-custodial options, may, in many instance, prove better.  There is a need for thought and examination in that area as a matter of real urgency.</P>
    <P>If one pursues further this typical investigation to which I was referring where the justice opts for a custodial sentence, difficulties may again arise because we also have a problem in relation to our prisons.  They are overcrowded and, in the case of St. Patrick's Institution for juvenile offenders, it has reached the stage where, every afternoon, a telephone call has to be made <Col N="204" /> from the Metropolitan District Courts to St. Patrick's to tell them how many people have received custodial sentences that day so that an equivalent number of people can be released prematurely.  I realise that extra places of detention cannot be provided overnight but that is a wholly unsatisfactory situation and one which cries out for speedy attention.</P>
    <P>We should provide the necessary places of detention but we should also see what alternatives are available to custodial sentences and approach that with a fresh mind.  I do not believe this is a problem that will be solved exclusively by legislative changes.  If much of my speech has been concentrated in that area, it is because my time was limited and it was, therefore, sensible to pick out one area and say something about it rather than to be jumping from Billy to Jack.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise these matters. Today, by way of Private Notice Question I attempted to get some information from the Minister for the Environment. I wanted to ask the Minister to give an immediate response to the request submitted to him by a Cork deputation on 30 March.  The deputation were promised a speedy response, within six to seven days, but we have not had a reply so far.  That question today was ruled out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cork is facing major problems at the moment because of unemployment: 7,000 people are unemployed in the city. In facing up to Cork's problems we first of all realise that Cork has enormous potential for growth.  There is a need to create new employment in the city, and Cork Corporation, Cork County Council and the IDA have come together to try to make Cork more attractive for foreign industry.  Because of its geographical situation, the city has particular problems. The road infrastructure is not the best <Col N="205" /> and this is one of the deterring points in efforts to sell Cork as a site for foreign industries.</P>
    <P>The local authorities in the area have recognised this for a long time and, accordingly, a land use and transportation scheme was drafted and adopted. Part of the scheme sets out plans for ring roads around the city, a number of new bridges and down-river crossings.  These would improve the traffic flow in the city centre and in the suburbs.  The city is also faced with a major problem concerning derelict buildings in the inner city and nearby suburbs.  These areas have suffered badly in the past number of years because of the collapse of many traditional industries in the region.</P>
    <P>With a view to improving these districts, Cork Corporation drafted a local plan proposing radical renewal of the areas in the next few years.  In order to carry out these essentail plans Cork requires a special allocation of funds.  If the unemployment problem in the city is to be tackled properly, we must lay the foundations of a good road infrastructure. Otherwise we cannot hope to attract foreign industrialists to the city.</P>
    <P>However, though we are proceeding with plans for new roads and bridges we now find ourselves in difficulties in regard to the day-to-day requirements of the city and consequently our well-laid plans are at a halt.  I appreciate that all local authorities, particularly urban ones, have been experiencing difficulties in the past number of years, because in the period from 1979 to 1981 inflation has been running at an aggregate rate of 60 per cent while at the same time rates revenue has been allowed to increase by only 47 per cent. One can see, accordingly, the difficulties urban local authorities have been faced with.</P>
    <P>In Cork City this has affected us badly. Corporation staff numbers are down on the 1978 level.  Overtime has been abolished at many levels; temporary full-time staff have been laid off.  All this has been happening while Cork City has been growing.  My main point is that living conditions in the city have been deteriorating rapidly in recent years.  We submit that once-off injections of capital or <Col N="206" /> grant-type finance to Cork Corporation would improve the situation, but it would not remedy the problem because Cork needs a steady injection of funds over a number of years.</P>
    <P>Therefore, an all-party deputation approached the Minister on 30 March to make reasonable demands, to seek for Cork what Dublin had been given. Unlike Dublin, in Cork we have all agreed on a plan for the future of the city &mdash; I should think that Cork is the best planned-for city in the country.  We came to the Minister confident that he would meet our requests.  We have plans but we have not the money to carry out these plans.</P>
    <P>An example of the services being curtailed at the moment was the reduction in the opening hours of the swimming pools and public libraries.  Temporary staff are being laid off and we are now faced with the possibility that permanent staff in the parks will be put on a three-day week.  We came determined to get for Cork a fair share of the money that is going.  The Minister met the deputation and in our submission to him we made the following points, from which I will quote:</P>
    <P>(1)  Cork Corporation needs £2.9 million to fund existing deficits and maintain service levels in 1982.  This can be regarded as equivalent to the £20 million injection to the Dublin Corporation Revenue Account which, effectively, increases the 1982 Dublin rate limitation from 15 per cent to 45 per cent.</P>
    <P>(2)  A broadening of the corporation's revenue base is essential if the recurrence of these deficits is to be avoided.  This, in effect, is the permanent solution and could, for instance, be achieved by the introduction of charges for services without clawback of domestic rate grant.</P>
    <P>(3)  Cork Corporation have the capacity to utilise and a need for increased road grant allocation, thereby providing the means to absorb a greater proportion of labour costs. <Col N="207" /> Merchants Quay is a particular problem&mdash;new bridges and ring roads.</P>
    <P>(4)  It is essential that additional monies should continue to be made available through the Capital Account for continuing Remedial Work on the NBA schemes at the Glen, Togher and Mayfield.  Expenditure of at least £100,000 per annum is envisaged.</P>
    <P>The fifth point was that Cork's inner city and housing maintenance programmes, while relatively not as great as Dublin's, were deserving of similar attention. We also asked for further moneys that are needed for environmental grants, without strings attached.  We asked the Minister to meet us on these points, realising the background against which we were coming to Dublin.</P>
    <P>I will mention a number of points that are in the Dublin scheme.  There is £¾ million for house maintenance.  The work force for environmental works was increased from 150 to 500 at a cost of £2.5 million extra.  A special allocation of £20 million was made to Dublin Corporation to supplement their resources for normal services in 1982 and £1 million extra was allocated to modernise substandard Corporation housing without bathrooms.  We in Cork have the same problems.  This was the background against which the deputation met the Minister.  I did not speak because we were asked not to speak as Oireachtas Members.  They presented their case in a very efficient manner and &mdash; it is no secret at this stage because it was mentioned in some of the Cork papers &mdash; the Minister refused to discuss the implications of the Gregory deal and the reasons Cork should not get similar treatment.  In fact the Minister interjected when the Lord Mayor was presenting his case on this point.  But the Minister did acknowledge the seriousness of the situation in relation to Cork and the need for an early decision.  He promised the deputation that a decision would be given in six to seven days.  I have checked subsequently with members of the deputation from all parties, but to date no response has been forthcoming from the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="208" /> We now have a situation where we have been waiting five weeks for a decision and in that time county councils have come to the Minister and got fairly major injections of funds.  Leitrim County Council obtained a sum of £700,000 because they threatened the Minister with the big stick and the Minister succumbed to pressure as has happened in regard to other decisions by the present administration.  We in Cork are very angry at the reluctance of the Minister to give us a decision.  Early last week I approached some other TDs in the Cork area and we agreed that we would ask the Minister to meet us so that we could put a case to him to make an early decision. I have made five attempts to make an appointment with the Minister and on none of the five occasions I telephoned the Minister's office did I get the courtesy of a return telephone call.  This is a shabby way to treat the public representatives of Cork city.</P>
    <P>It is now obvious to me and to other public representatives of the area that the Minister and his Government are intent on building a 20th century pale around the Dublin area, and on this occasion he intends to make it a more localised pale. We demand from the Minister the financial allocations which we deserve.  We want a <i>pro rata</i> allocation with the allocation given to Dublin.  We are looking for nothing more and nothing less.  Over the next few weeks I intend to find out the amount of money allocated to Ireland through the European Social Fund because I am convinced at this stage that the applications made to Europe have been strengthened a lot by the firm and detailed plans but forward by the Cork region.  I am also convinced that much or the money we got has been diverted into other regions in the State.  I have only to look at the development of the Dublin area and especially the Shannon and Limerick region over the last number of years to convince myself further.</P>
    <P>In finishing up I am asking the Minister to make an immediate decision on the points raised by the Cork delegation.  We discussed this problem at Cork Corporation level last Monday night week and we were so disturbed that we sent a telegram <Col N="209" /> to the Minister asking for an immediate decision.  We have received sums for road improvements and environmental works amounting to about £176,000 for each item.  But these sums are miniscule compared to the funds that will be injected into Dublin.  It is unjust and it is the duty of all the politicians of the Cork area to make their voices heard.  They have done so and we expect a decision from the Minister on the matter.  I hope the Minister in replying does not refer to the sums allocated by the previous Minister for the Environment and the present one.  I would like to stress that the sums allocated have been quite the same.  What we are looking for is a <i>pro rata</i> increase in line with what Dublin got.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I may not have the time at my disposal to go into all the matters that the Deputy has raised.  At the request of Cork Corporation the Minister, Deputy Burke, and the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, received a deputation from Cork Corporation on 30 March 1982.  The purpose of the deputation was to press for additional funds towards an expected revenue deficit and finance for particular schemes and projects.  There was a full discussion on the various aspects of local authority finances in the course of which a range of specific matters was referred to, including the claim of Cork Corporation, for some form of special assistance towards the revenue deficit.  In the course of the discussion the Minister indicated that he was open to consider fully the needs and problems of Cork city and to that end he asked the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, who has special responsibility for urban affairs, to visit Cork and to assess the problems on the spot.  The Minister also undertook to give favourable consideration to the needs of Cork in relation to the allocations which he hoped to make very shortly out of additional funds which have been made available for certain services in the recent budget, and also appropriate consideration to various projects which have been referred to in the course of the discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the deputation was received <Col N="210" /> arrangements have been made between Cork Corporation and the Minister of State's Office for him to visit Cork.  Cork Corporation have been informed that the visit will take place on 11 and 12 May, that is, Tuesday and Wednesday of next week.  He will look at their problems in regard to housing, roads, bridges and planning.  He will meet the Lord Mayor, the Chairmen of various committees of the corporation, the city manager and other officials.</P>
    <P>A supplementary allocation of £165,000 for roads was notified to Cork Corporation on 28 April.  The total allocation this year for roads is £4,203,000. It is an increase on last year of £656,000. That is a substantial increase.  On the day the deputation was received the Minister made an extra capital allocation of £500,000 for sanitary services.  The stage has not yet been reached when the usual supplementary allocations for local authority housing new works can be made.  We received a submission from Cork Corporation today for new works. As regards Mayfield and other matters, when the Minister is in Cork next week he will look into these.</P>
    <P>The amount of £846,000 allocated to Cork Corporation since 13 March is not the whole story.  Since we came to office we made two important decisions about local finance.  We changed the Coalition line that all proceeds of local housing had to go to capital.  We restored 40 per cent to the current account and we limited the statutory demands for supplementary welfare.  This brought in £450,000 extra to Cork Corporation this year.  The total extra allocation to them is £1,296,000. That could not have been brought about but for the changes and alterations we made in our approach to county councils and corporations.  I am amazed at the Deputy bringing up this matter.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's Minister, who was a Corkman, did not make the money available.  We saw what the situation was when we came to office and made the necessary adjustments.  The telegram which was sent crossed in the post with the allocations that were made. The Deputy must not have been aware of this or have been in touch with the officials of the corporation.  The total extra allocation now will be £1,296,000.  This money would not have been made available but for the steps we took to rectify the situation.  In the Department we never have enough money and I do not think any Minister ever had.  We must keep essential items going and that is what we set about doing.</P>

It took us weeks to do so.  I was nearly blind looking at figures.  We are only in office since 9 March and it must be realised that we have now given hope to local authorities.</P>
      <P>Deputies also asked the SDA loan rates be looked at.  We reduced the rate from 15½ per cent to 12½ per cent.  It is not now necessary to go to a clergyman to know whether the applicants are to be married or not.  We cured that evil.  That was a discriminatory practice which was brought in by the last Government.  The interest the last Government put on of 15½ per cent was to have been reviewed half-yearly and more than likely would have been increased.  We were able to reduce the interest to a fixed rate of 12½ per cent.  The Minister of State will spend two days in Cork.</P>

With the money available to us we will look after Cork where the last Government failed to do so.</P>

      <P>Of the 16 applications received from Pollrevagh and Mannin some required further examination to determine eligibility. These applicants were asked to provide additional information.  In certain cases, even when this was provided, it was necessary to seek the advice of the Department of Agriculture before a final decision could be taken.  Decisions on the applications have now been taken, and I am happy to say that 15 of the 16 applicants will benefit under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Most of those approved have been informed of the outcome and the remainder will be informed in the near future. The timing of connection depends upon the ESB's work programme for each district. Once the applicants have been informed of the outcome, the matter becomes part of the day-to-day administration of the ESB.  I understand from the ESB that these connections will be effected as quickly as possible.</P>

The treatment proposed includes grit removal, coarse screening, maceration, fine screening and diffusion from the deep water outfall. The proposed system of disposal is intended to ensure that neither environmental nor aesthetic problems need be anticipated when the scheme is completed.</P>

However, a pedestrian crossing was not recommended by the group at their meeting on 10 September 1981 as the counts of pedestrians did not reach the minimum requirements.  These requirements are set out in guidelines issued by An Foras Forbartha.  The guidelines are adhered to by the parties concerned and, save in exceptional circumstances, the Commissioner's statutory request to the road authority to provide a traffic sign is only made when the specified requirements have been met.

      <P>It is preferable, both in principle and in practice, that the matter should be dealt with in this wider context rather than in the narrower context of cases where requests or appeals may be made by the Garda because the Garda are themselves often involved only on humanitarian grounds and not because a crime has or may have been committed. In other words, the Garda in many cases are themselves volunteers and I would have no responsibility for expenses incurred by other groups.  If, when the wider question has been settled, there is any residual problem about the requisition of services for official Garda purposes, the Deputy may take it that it will be dealt with but there is no reason to expect that there will be any such problem.</P>

      <P>My Department are currently examining ways of ensuring that such incidents do not occur in future.  Any information will, as a matter of course, be supplied to the relevant Departments.</P>

      <P>Quarterly accounts were sent to the person named for the period up to June 1981, but due to an unexplained clerical failure which continued over a long period, the accounts issued were prepared in the name of the previous renter of the telephone at this same address.  A correct account covering the entire period involved was issued last February and the Department is in touch with the subscriber with a view to arranging payment over a reasonable period.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health do not operate any schemes of allowances specifically for the mentally handicapped. There are three main schemes under which a mentally handicapped person may be entitled to benefit.</P>
      <P>(1)  Disabled Persons Maintenance Allowance Scheme: This allowance is payable by health boards, subject to a means test, to persons over 16 years and under 66 years who are substantially handicapped and who are unable to maintain themselves or their spouse.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Mobility Allowance Scheme: This allowance is payable by health boards, subject to a means test, to severely handicapped people who are unable to walk.  The scheme applies to persons over 16 years who are living at home or are maintained by a health board in any long term institution.</P>
      <P>(3)  Infectious Diseases Maintenance Allowance Scheme: The scheme applies to persons suffering from one of the specified infectious diseases who, by reason of undergoing treatment therefor is prevented from providing for his maintenance and that of his dependants.</P>
      <P>Similarly the Department of Social Welfare does not operate any schemes specifically for mentally handicapped persons.  However, such persons may qualify under the various social insurance and social assistance schemes subject to the satisfaction of qualification conditions.</P>
      <P>I am sending the Deputy an information booklet covering the various allowances mentioned as well as some information leaflets on services for the mentally handicapped.</P>

      <P>This person's case has been referred to a social welfare officer for investigation. When inquiries are completed his means will be assessed by a deciding officer and his entitlement to unemployment assistance will be determined expeditiously.</P>

      <P>The person concerned, who is a postal claimant, claimed unemployment benefit on 9 December 1981 but his claim was disallowed up to 15 January 1982 by a deciding officer on the grounds that he left his employment voluntarily without just cause.  He did not appeal against the disallowance.  He was subsequently written to on three occasions seeking information about his claim but to-date he has not replied.  When he replies to the inquiries his entitlement to unemployment benefit will be reviewed in the light of his reply.</P>

      <P>Petrol expenses as such are not paid to Civil Defence volunteers but they are paid travelling expenses, when Civil defence transport is not provided for them as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Volunteer instructors who are permitted to use their cars on Civil Defence business carried out at the request of the local authority may be paid travelling expenses including mileage allowance at the rates and subject to the conditions <Col N="92" /> laid down in the Department of Environment regulations.</P>
    <P>Volunteers other than instructors are paid travelling expenses, at a rate equivalent to the cost of public transport or at a rate of £0.18 per mile if public transport is not available.</P>
    <P>Records are not kept separately by the Department of Defence of payments of such travelling expenses as these in many instances are bulked with subsistence allowances in the normal annual returns made by the local authorities to the Department.  Accordingly, it is not possible to state the amount paid in respect of travelling expenses for any particular year.</P>
    <P>Authority to pay these expenses direct to the members is exercised by the local authorities against individual claims which are normally channelled through, and verified by, the local Civil Defence officer or his assistant.  The local authorities recoup 70 per cent of the outlay on these expenses from the Department when the annual grant-aid is being paid to them.</P>
