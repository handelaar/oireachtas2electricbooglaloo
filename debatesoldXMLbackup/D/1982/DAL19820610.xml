      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 10 (resumed) and 5.  Business will be interrupted at 3.30 p.m. to take Item No.5 and the order will be resumed thereafter.</P>

      <P>I am glad item No. 5 is being taken but I am somewhat puzzled about the procedure.  The leader of the Labour Party and I had a meeting with the Taoiseach about establishing committees of this House.  The Taoiseach expressed reservations about this committee and its methods of operation and said he would want to come back to me on the subject.  I have not heard from him since.  I have no reservations about the matter but I am anxious to know if the Taoiseach has withdrawn his reservations, which included reservations about the employment of consultants by the committee.  I have had no communication from the Taoiseach on the matter and it seems rather odd that it should appear on the Order Paper now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="The Tánaiste Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday morning the Taoiseach was asked a question about this committee and he said the matter would be on the Order Paper today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble was that the Taoiseach was going to America and I had no opportunity to pursue the matter <Col N="1458" /> further with him privately.  I would like an assurance that it is not the Taoiseach's intention to limit the work of this committee before it is established.  He expressed doubts about it to me and was to come back to me about it.  Perhaps we can have an assurance now about the matter?</P>

      <P>Yesterday on the Order of Business the escalating problem in Lebanon was discussed.  In view of the fact that so many Irish people have relations in Lebanon, my point was that there was going to be an impending breakdown in communications which would cause greater anxiety to relatives and I wanted to know if the Minister had any intention of making a statement on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>A serious situation arises here.  If this House legislates for something to be done but does not provide the means of doing it and deprives people of a legal remedy they have by substituting one they cannot get because of failure to make the appropriate provision, a very serious situation arises between ourselves and the Judiciary with which this House must deal.  The Minister's answer is unacceptable.  We must have a discussion in this House as to how legal remedies are to be preserved.</P>

      <P>There is provision for Private Notice Questions on a matter like this, but we cannot have an instant Question Time.  I stopped Deputy Hussey when she was making her point. I must anticipate questions; otherwise if I were to wait until Deputies asked questions we could have an instant Question Time.  That was the reason I stopped Deputy Hussey.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Chair is aware of the number of questions on the Order Paper and the time that will be taken to reach them, if they can be reached in this session.  We have here a matter of great urgency, where this House has withdrawn a remedy and failed to provide a substitute.  That is something we are not entitled to do. There must be a procedure by which that can be discussed in this House other than by way of an ordinary question which may not be reached even in this session. I would submit that the original question put down should be taken and I hope you will on reflection agree to that.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by the Minister for Finance on Wednesday 9th June 1982:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give the Bill a Second Reading on the grounds of social justice and economic responsibility, and in particular because&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a) in departing significantly from the terms of the Budget as outlined in the Financial Statement by the Minister for Finance in March, 1982, it confers concessions solely on the relatively well off, while giving no equivalent concessions to the low-paid as was proposed in the Family Income Supplement provisions of the Budget presented to the House in January, 1982,</P>
    <P>(b) in granting concessions in regard to P.R.S.I., it does so in such a way as to give maximum benefit to the well-paid, and little or no benefit to the low-paid,</P>
    <P>(c) it aggravates national economic difficulties by measures, in regard to payments in advance of Value-Added Tax and Corporation Tax, which will cause losses of jobs <Col N="1463" /> in many vulnerable businesses, and will worsen the national budgetary situation for 1983 by using up revenue that would otherwise be available in that year, and</P>
    <P>(d) it does not provide for any long-term reform of the P.A.Y.E. system as was contained in the proposal for the introduction of a system of tax credits in the January Budget, while it fails to seek other sources of revenue by abandoning any proposal to reduce tax avoidance through discretionary trusts.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>&mdash;(Deputy J. Bruton). </P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned last evening I was talking about the Connacht Regional Airport, CRAP for short.  I was talking about it in the context of the economic ambitions of the Minister which were echoing the advice of the Central Bank.  That ambition was to ensure that public capital expenditure would be directed towards the most productive purposes possible.  I made the point that the Minister's words were something with which we could all agree. In fact, the sentiment was so obvious that it was, in effect, an economic truism.  But I contrasted the admirable sentiments of the Minister with the actions of the Government in which he serves.  The sentiments are to ensure the spending of capital resources in the most productive way possible.  Yet this Government are committed to continue investing in a project that can be seen at this stage to be arguably the biggest white elephant in the western world.  It will cost £8 million to complete the project and the estimation of the annual loss on running it, apart from interest and amortisation charges, would be around £800,000 annually.  How any government having read the analysis made by their own bureaucracy of the consultant's report could proceed with that investment defies imagination.  It makes nonsense of what the Minister said when he spoke about the need for greater selectivity, the need to provide a worthwhile return, when he said that there will have to be more exhaustive analysis proposals for capital <Col N="1464" /> investment.  That sort of statement only makes a mockery of this House when the Government choose so blatantly to ignore it and continue with this investment in the Connacht Regional Airport.</P>
      <P>As I said last night, we need not be surprised because this particular financial leopard has not changed its spots.  This type of silly investment is not new.  This playing politics with the people's money is not a new development on the part of the Government.  There are two other terrible examples.  But there is one appalling example of lack of responsibility &mdash; and that is using a mild cliché&mdash; that I want to refer to.  I refer to the agreement with the Talbot workers.  That was an agreement entered into by the Taoiseach to, in effect, guarantee the wages of a number of redundant workers, an open-ended agreement drawn up without the benefit of lawyers.  I know people are cynical about the benefit lawyers actually bring, but when it is a question of drawing up agreements I do not think anyone can argue but that they are some use.  This document was drawn up without benefit of lawyers and as a result it is riddled with ambiguities and there are question marks as to its meanings which still have to be resolved.  It reveals a careless attitude towards the public purse and towards taxpayers' money to commit the Exchequer in an open-ended and unique way and sets a precedent which if followed&mdash;and having regard to the weakness of the present Government in giving in to pressure groups there is every likelihood that this precedent will be followed &mdash; will make a mockery of financial planning and budgeting.  Of course we have the other extreme example of the agreement with Deputy Gregory, this mysterious document that nobody knows exactly what is involved in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to the sentiments of the Minister about the need for greater selectivity and more exhaustive analysis of the proposals for capital investment, these actions of the Government make nonsense of the Minister's speech.  Again it seems clear that this year's Finance Bill, uniquely making significant changes &mdash; and I say &ldquo;uniquely&rdquo; deliberately &mdash; in <Col N="1465" /> the budget statement is going to mean tremendous difficulties next year.  Many independent commentators have forecast that the budgetary difficulties that appear to be solved by the financial sleight of hand in getting two years' VAT this year will be even greater next year.  Indeed, the Central Bank would appear to agree with that proposition, though they couch the problem in more diplomatic language. As they express it, &ldquo;The nonrecurrent nature of some of this year's revenue will create difficulties for fiscal policy in 1983.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is only too true.  As Deputy Dukes pointed out, the changes that have been made in the Finance Bill from the budget statement and which the Minister estimates to cost £2.5 million this year, will if continued into next year's budget be considerably more and will add to the growing difficulties that will face whoever may be Minister for Finance come 1983.</P>
    <P>Of course, the <i>raison d'etre</i> behind the entire approach of the Government to the budget and this Finance Bill we now have has been in line with their general philosophy of turning the head away from the problem, avoiding recognition of the necessity to deal strictly with a difficult situation.  It is a continuation of the old policy of promises and strokes.  I do not say that because of Opposition paranoia.  That is a policy which has been condemned from that side of the House by three former members of the Fianna Fáil Government, although their condemnation sounds a little hollow because they were all involved in this philosophy of promises and strokes.  Nevertheless their conversion is to be welcomed and one can only hope that conversion will spread through all the ranks of the Government.  Then we might begin to have some responsible financial planning, a little rectitude in the management of our economic affairs, so that we might in future avoid having to read in the annual report of the Central Bank the statement that the non-recurring nature of some of this year's revenue will create difficulties for fiscal policies in 1983.  That is as close as the Central Bank can go to saying this year's budget is a con job.</P>
    <P>In this Bill there are a number of specific <Col N="1466" /> points I would like to mention in relation to the duties on betting.  So far as SP betting is concerned, I put it to the Minister that the present position is a classical case of diminishing returns due to an excessive rate of duty.  He is probably also going to find so far as beer and spirits are concerned, that there will be a diminishing return at the end of the year.  The present penal rate of duty on SP betting is causing an immense amount of money to be bet outside the country and to be bet illegally with unlicensed bookmakers.  It is also imposing tremendous pressures on bookmakers to take bets without returning the full tax because customers are loth to pay an extra 20 per cent on top of their bets and that is understandable.</P>
    <P>If the Minister examines the statistics for off-course betting and the volume of betting in Northern Ireland, he will see there must be an immense amount of money going from this jurisdiction to the North to avoid paying this penal tax. While it may seem <i>prima facie</i> wrong and crazy to reduce a tax level having regard to the straitened condition of the Exchequer, nevertheless when this tax is examined, the Minister must come to the conclusion that the high level is counter-productive and a lower level would produce greater revenue.</P>
    <P>Likewise for the tax on on-course betting. This is having a damaging effect on the amount of money available for investment in the racing industry.  I use the word &ldquo;industry&rdquo; deliberately because it is an industry supporting a very large number of people&mdash; breeding, training of horses and the operation of the racecourses. Many people in that industry are extremely worried that the present taxation regime is having a detrimental effect on the industry.  Attendances are falling, prize money is stagnant, yet owners' costs are rising.  Unless horses can race here and provide an outlet for the breeders, the breeding industry, which has been so valuable in terms of earning foreign revenue and giving employment, could be prejudiced.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the level of on-course duties also because racing and the scene allied to it need a financial <Col N="1467" /> injection.  As I said, it may not be popular in difficult times to advocate a reduction of this duty and one can understand the argument that the higher this duty the less temptation there will be for people to bet because betting is not a good thing. If people were well disposed, that might follow but that is not what happens. Instead of betting in the orthodox, legal way people are betting under the counter or across the Border.  The Minister must face that fact and reduce the tax so that the money spent on betting will be spent at home and so that the benefit will come to the Exchequer and the industry.</P>
    <P>There is another point to which I want to refer, but on which I will go into more detail on Committee Stage, that is the new proposals for tax on capital gains resulting from the sale of development land.  This provision was brought over from the January budget.  The intention was to ensure that the speculative gain would result in substantial tax benefit to the Exchequer and that a speculative gain not producing anything or adding to the wealth of the country would not remain unscathed in the hands of the speculator. As drafted, the new heavy rates of capital gains tax on the sale and disposal of land would appear to be going to catch the bona fide farmer who, because of an accident of geography, finds his land in demand for development purposes from an expanding town or industrial estate. He may have to give into that demand because in that situation it is often not practical to continue farming surrounded by urban areas and all the pressures they bring.</P>
    <P>That farmer will have to pay these new and heavy rates of tax.  The allowance he had in the past to roll-over into another farm is being removed.  This is a hardship. The farmer is being uprooted from land which may have been the family farm for generations and his pattern of life, work and social activities have been geared to living and working on that farm.  Yet because of pressures over which he has no control he is being forced to sell, even if there is not a compulsory purchase order made.</P>
    <P>If he is a bona fide farmer and invests <Col N="1468" /> in another farm.  I do not think it was ever the intention to take from him a tax at the comparatively penal rate being suggested in the Bill.  The exemption that allowed him in the past to roll-over into another farm without tax penalty should be reintroduced for the bona fide farmer. By all means let the person who buys land for speculative reasons be taxed heavily on speculative gains, but I want to make an especially strong plea to the Minister for farmers who find themselves, due to geographical accidents, on the periphery of expanding towns and industrial estates and who, through compulsory purchase procedures or through the compulsion of industrial pressures, have to give up their land.  They should be allowed to roll-over without having to pay penal taxation.</P>
    <P>The intention was that, in the case of the proceeds of the sale of land and certain other assets where there might be a property gains tax liability, part of the proceeds would be held on account of that liability.  That system of withholding has been in operation since the budget and pending the passing of the Act.  The Minister now indicates that this 30 per cent deduction will not be continued after the enactment of the Bill and that the previous situation of issuing certificates in advance will be restored.  The Bill provides for refunds in regard to the special deductions which were made.  If it is not intended to introduce the system of deductions, the 30 per cent deductions already made come to a substantial amount on a purchase price.  When that money is being refunded, equity demands that it be refunded with interest for the period in which it was held by the Exchequer.  If not, there will have been discrimination against the section of vendors who were unlucky enough to have had to sell between the budget and the enactment of the Finance Bill, as this deduction will not apply to people selling after the enactment of the Bill.  They have the benefit of the full proceeds and what interest the proceeds in their hands would have earned them.  This is something which can be argued in more detail on Committee Stage, but I make the point <Col N="1469" /> now so that the Minister might give it his consideration.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, this Bill is uniquely unsatisfactory in that it is making significant policy and arithmetical changes on the budget statement.  As the amendment put down by Deputy Bruton points out, these changes have adverse consequences in terms of social justice and economic responsibility.  The changes in PRSI, while welcome to those whom they affect, give no benefit to those whom we all want to benefit &mdash; the lower paid.  That is not social justice.</P>
    <P>In terms of economic responsibility, it will impose a very difficult situation on many importing firms.  As I pointed out last evening, most of our trading concerns at the moment have actual liquidity difficulties. For some, these are of priceless proportions.  If those difficulties are now compounded by the need to find value-added tax at point of import, one can only describe the budgetary measures and resultant Finance Bill which imposed those difficulties on our traders as economically irresponsible, particularly when we all know that it is a piece of financial trickery to get money in this year to try to present a respectable budget.</P>
    <P>As the Central Bank points out diplomatically in its annual report:</P>
    <P>The non-recurring nature of some of this year's revenue will create difficulties for fiscal policy in 1983. </P>
    <P>That is the type of economic irresponsibility which Deputy Bruton's amendment is designed to avoid.  Again, as his amendment points out, the Finance Bill does not provide, or even start to provide, for any reform of the taxation system.  The Minister is living in hope that the commission, whose report we understand is in print at the moment, will take him off that hook.  He should look at the reports of previous commissions and may then realise that it is not at all certain that their recommendations will be palatable to him politically.  They might not even be palatable economically or fiscally.  In this Bill he should have continued the measures started by Deputy Bruton to bring equity and progression into our income tax system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1470" /> It is not surprising that the Bill is as it is when one looks at the recorded acts of the Government in the area of budgeting and financial planning.  Their record is depressing.  What is even more depressing is that, apparently, the lessons which that past should teach have not been learned.  I can only hope that others in this House who favour economic equity, fairness in taxation and responsibility in the management of our economy, having considered the Bill and the implications and issues raised in Deputy Bruton's amendment, will come to see that there is no alternative but to vote for that amendment.  If they do not vote for that amendment, they will be voting for measures which have been detrimental to the less well-off, which will do economic damage to the country and which will be socially inequitable.  I am sure that nobody in this House would want to be associated with such measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Having had previously a debate on the budget lasting for nearly a fortnight, we now have the same long-winded debate on the Finance Bill.  It is a rehash of the whole thing, with Members speaking for hours and hours and at the end of the day saying nothing.</P>
      <P>I want to make the points which, in my opinion, will make some impact.  I will start by analysing the situation as well as I can and asking why at this time of the year the Dáil is discussing the Finance Bill.  It is because on January 27 the Coalition Government brought in a budget which was rejected because in setting out to solve the economic crisis it imposed real hardship on the ordinary working people by value-added tax, tax on social welfare benefits and the removal of food subsidies.  For those reasons it was rejected.  The Coalition budget proposals also contained increases on workers' PRSI contributions, which was another reason for its rejection.  Consequently there was an election and a change of Government. We now have a new Government coming forward with very little different in its budget proposals from the previous Coalition proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most contentious issues were <Col N="1471" /> taken out &mdash; the VAT, the subsidies were retained and there was no tax on social welfare.  Now we have an amendment proposed by the former Minister for Finance.  Let me just try to prove the terrible hypocrisy of the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, because he said that in departing significantly from the terms of the budget as outlined in the Financial Statement of March last the present Minister conferred concessions solely on the relatively well-off while giving no equivalent concessions to the low paid as was proposed in the family income supplement provisions of the budget presented to the House in January last.  The man who talks about the family income supplement is the same man who said: &ldquo;You will pay VAT at 18 per cent on the clothes and shoes you buy for your children; you will pay tax on the social welfare benefit if you are lucky enough to get it from the Department of Social Welfare; and you will pay increased costs for your food because we are going to take away the subsidies&rdquo;.  I call it blatant hypocrisy on the part of the former Minister for Finance when he makes that statement in an amendment to the present proposals.</P>
    <P>I think the people can make their fair and honest appraisal of the situation. They know thoroughly well that there is an economic crisis but they are saying very definitely that it is not the working class people who must carry the burden of it.  We in the Workers Party made submissions previously to the former Minister for Finance and to the present Minister, Deputy MacSharry.  Our proposals were under a number of headings and are simply a short term response to the present capitalist crisis.  Admittedly, they involve no more than tinkering with the superficial details of the present capitalist economy but, as we have indicated, the economic crisis has much deeper roots.  Playing around with subsidies and direct and indirect taxation cannot solve the problems of over 20 per cent inflation and over 147,000 unemployed&mdash; a figure still growing &mdash; and the acute balance of payments problem.  These are just surface manifestations of the extent to which private enterprise economy is in trouble.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1472" /> These problems cannot be solved without a radical change in attitude overall to the economic system.  We make the point that the handing out of vast sums of money by the State to private enterprise is nothing short of a scandal.  Private enterprise have used that capital in some cases to continue their little engineering works and provided employment in the short term and then went into liquidation when they had the profits they had made invested in land and other property.  That is what private enterprise has done for the country, as I am well aware from my knowledge of the scene at local level.</P>
    <P>Two basic changes are required for the solution of the long-term economic crisis facing the country in the eighties: (i) there must be a new commitment among the workforce to the task of economic development and (ii) there must be a planned approach to development so that the resources of the economy are harnessed fully and efficiently to achieve the increase in national output necessary to cut inflation, reduce taxation burdens, raise real wages and provide a material base for social progress.  Neither of these two changes can be brought about in a private enterprise dominated economy. Why should the workforce contribute increased productivity and efficiency required for such a plan to a system in which it has no stake?  The working class in this country know intuitively that if they respond to this call for wage moderation by conservative politicians and industrialists or to the demand for acceptance of an unbalanced tax system they will get nothing in return.  In the past year the working class people took a cut at a time when inflation was over 20 per cent. The pay increases were set according to the public sector level at 16 per cent and workers took a real cut in their living standards and at the very time when they were taking that cut the PRSI contributions were hiked up to 7.5 per cent.  By that kind of thing workers have seen clearly that they have no stake and consequently they are prepared to demand fair play and justice.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that workers must resist attempts to raise efficiency or productivity not just in the public sector but <Col N="1473" /> in the private sector. For the same reason the endless calls for wage moderation repeatedly fall on deaf ears even though economic circumstances dictate the need for such austerity.  For the country's long term economic problems to be solved it is essential that the working class cooperate fully to improve efficiency, increase competitiveness, raise exports and cut imports &mdash; the measures necessary to solve the balance of payments crisis.  Without the consent of the working class it is inevitable that the country will lurch from balance of payments crisis to deflation for years to come.  Thus the key principle of our long term economic development plan is a guarantee to workers that the profits to be reaped from belt-tightening, from efficiency and the raising of productivity will accrue to the ordinary people in a just way, by ensuring through legislation democracy in the work place so that each and every worker will fully participate in the running of his or her enterprise and by ensuring a key role for socially-owned State enterprises such as CIE, the ESB, Bord na Móna and the Sugar Company.  It is the creative energies of the working class people which can ultimately solve all economic problems.</P>
    <P>At this time what are the Government and Opposition parties saying?  They are saying: &ldquo;You must cut public expenditure, reduce the number of public employees&rdquo;.  Are they saying in fact that the numbers employed in Bord na Móna, the Sugar Company, the number of nurses and gardaí and the number in the Army, who are all public servants, are to be cut?  Are those the people they refer to when they talk of the public service? Whom are they talking about?</P>
    <P>The response of the conservatinve parties to the economic crisis was predictable. The Coalition Minister for Finance in his budget showed clearly who would pay the cost &mdash; it was to be placed yet again on those who could least afford to pay.  Fianna Fáil in Government were little different but, as I have said, they have taken the contentious issues out of the previous budget.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said that the yield from capital taxation has been much <Col N="1474" /> too low and that substantial increases are fully justified.  In our submission both to the previous Government and to the present Government we listed a number of headings under which there could have been a shift from direct and indirect taxation to capital taxation.  We had these submissions costed by the Department. The recommendations we listed were in respect of capital acquisitions tax, capital gains tax, wealth tax, property tax and corporation tax.  The only reason one can find for successive Governments having failed to raise revenue by imposing taxation under those various heads has been that the lobby has been much stronger on that side that it has been for workers.  I do not wish to be very critical of the Labour Party but they in Coalition have failed the working people totally in this respect.  Had this position been rectified we would probably not be in such a serious economic crisis now.</P>
    <P>On the whole question of taxation I wish to make a point that I have been making for a long time but without getting any response from successive Ministers. The point is that when assessing a person's eligibility, whether in respect of health services, an educational grant or a housing loan, tax is not deductible.  That is most unjust.  There can only be fair play in these cases if the criteria used is a person's real income, the actual amount of money that a family have to spend. There is no point in taking the gross income figure because a high percentage of that will already have been paid in income tax.</P>
    <P>We in the Workers' Party accept fully that the country is experiencing a serious economic crisis.  We are spending more than we are earning and the difference is being made up by way of Government borrowing, but borrowing at record world interest rates.  Successive Governments have attempted to carry on the illusion of prosperity under capitalism by increasingly indulging in borrowing in order to pay for our day-to-day spending. Both Fianna Fáil and the Coalition parties in Government refused to follow the policies necessary to lay the foundation for real prosperity by way of a significant restructuring of the economy, by <Col N="1475" /> raising production to the levels necessary to maintain our standard of living and by creating sufficient employment for our growing labour force.  The unshakable faith of the conservative parties in private enterprise has resulted in the engine of growth being misplaced despite an investment rate of the order of that of Japan. It has been proved that the inefficient, remshackle private enterprise economy is not capable of meeting the challenge with the result that the engine seized and we are left now with nothing but an unemployment level in excess of 147,000, an inflation rate of more than 20 per cent, economic stagnation and a huge foreign debt.  With the economy on its knees and with little prospect of being able to pay the interest on that huge debt through self-sustained growth, by international definition we are virtually bankrupt.  Like any company facing bankruptcy, the economy turns first to its workforce in order to cut the wage bill.  This is what successive Governments have done. They have tried to take the money out of the pockets of the workers by way of huge increases in direct and indirect taxation. Down through the years Irish workers have more than proved their willingness to pay their fair share of the cost of running the country.  Again, in 1981, the PAYE sector paid 87 per cent of the total income tax bill.  This is in sharp contrast to the ludicrous ½p in the pound contributed by way of capital taxation in the same year.</P>
    <P>We are told that very shortly the Government will produce an economic plan.  It would be our hope to have an input into that plan.  We have been waiting a long time for tax reform.  I understand that within a short time there will be available the report of the Commission on Taxation.  I was pleased to hear through the media last night that there is reference in that to capital taxation.  We can only hope that as a result of whatever recommendations the commission make we will have a just, fair and equitable taxation system and that the stage will be reached quickly when the workers will realise once and for all that this is their country, that they have a stake in it.  That <Col N="1476" /> is the sort of situation that my party will be seeking in this House to bring about. We shall do everything in our power to ensure that there is brought about a just society.  In our efforts to this end we do not care about what the FUE will say, about what the Stock Exchange will have to say or about what Deputy Colley will have to say, and he has had something to say in the past few days.  The working class demand fair play and when that is achieved we will have a better economy. The emphasis must be on the development of our State enterprises and of our natural resources.  When all of this is done we can look forward to reducing our balance of payments and to providing a better way of life for the ordinary people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-Central):</i> Of the two Deputies who have contributed to this debate this morning, I have no doubt in saying that the last speaker came across as the one who was the most consistent and the most sincere.  I am surprised, though perhaps I should not be, at the blatant attempt made by Fine Gael speakers up to now, including Deputy Cooney this morning, to make a case for the lower-paid workers for whom they have shed crocodile tears.  The reason I use the phrase &ldquo;crocodile tears&rdquo; is that very few tears were shed last January when severe taxation was proposed for those in the low income group. There were proposals then to impose VAT at 18 per cent from zero on clothing and footwear, and to remove food subsidies. Surely any mature person will understand, and accept, that such measures would have a serious and detrimental effect on the standard of living of workers who are struggling to survive from day to day.  That is why I expressed the view that of those who have contributed to the debate this morning Deputy Sherlock was the only one who has been consistent in his point of view. He was critical of the Government and the Coalition and I accept the argument he put forward with regard to the falseness of the amendment put forward by Deputy Bruton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill implements the budget proposals introduced by the Minister for <Col N="1477" /> Finance in March.  It contains some alterations which will lead to greater equity. Most of the provisions have been debated at great length in recent weeks here and in the media.  The tax provisions must be viewed against the general economic background which exists.  The Government introduced financial proposals at a time of unprecedented crisis in our balance of payments situation.  It was agreed by all sides here, and accepted by the public, that the budget deficit must and should be reduced, that the gap between what the Government take in in revenue and the amount spent should be reduced substantially.  The Coalition gave cognisance to this fact, but the steps taken by them in that infamous January budget were so drastic across the board that they would have caused a huge reduction in spending power of all classes, the poor, the middle class and the rich.  The proposals would have hit the poorer sections hardest.  Fortunately, they were not accepted by the House and the Coalition Government paid the price by being defeated and forced to hold a general election.</P>
    <P>The Government are involved in a continuing review of public expenditure. There are many areas where public expenditure can be controlled without resulting in a real reduction in social services.  Many of us are only too well aware of the number of Departments, and services, that are not as efficient as they should be.  For example, they are not subjected to as close a scrutiny and efficiency examination as a private company would be.  They are not as cost-conscious as far as the utilisation of staff is concerned as a private company must be.  As far as efficiency is concerned, it is accepted and realised that in order to survive a private company must be efficient in the utilisation of its facilities and services.  That is where the big difference lies between private enterprise and the public service.</P>
    <P>In the case of a private company if the running costs accumulate to a great extent the directors cannot go back to the shareholders seeking further advance of capital or additional funds.  Unfortunately, as far as the State service is concerned <Col N="1478" /> that psychological threat of having to survive within a certain budget is not hanging over its head.  Security is the key word and employment is not affected.  Services must continue and the additional finance required must be made available and that can only be done by the Government increasing taxation or borrowings.  There is no other way of raising additional finance.  At the end of the day social services can only be improved in the same manner.  That cannot be done in any other way.</P>
    <P>There was agreement on all sides about the need to close the gap between revenue and expenditure and that public spending at any time in the future could not be cut back to such an extent that the Government would not have to increase taxation.  It is hypocritical of Opposition speakers to endeavour to whip the Government because of the decision to impose additional taxation through various channels, including the PRSI system. The Opposition have been dishonest on the question of PRSI because the increases introduced by the Government are identical to those proposed by the Coalition in the January budget.  Unlike the Fianna Fáil Government the Coalition did not propose to introduce an additional taxation allowance of £312 per annum in order to ease the burden on those paying PRSI while awaiting the report of the Commission on Taxation.</P>
    <P>It was dishonest of the former Taoiseach and Tánaiste to publicly condemn the Government in the course of the recent by-election campaign over the PRSI increases when viewed against the background of the January budget in which identical increases in PRSI were proposed.  It is that type of political dishonesty that makes the public cynical about politics and politicians.  It should be remembered that it was the Coalition who had the public brainwashed into believing that we were on the verge of bankruptcy.  The Coalition told the people that not only was belt-tightening necessary but that in order to survive our people would have to endure a certain amount of choking also.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the Coalition proposed the introduction of <Col N="1479" /> new taxation in the form of VAT on clothing and footwear.  That is why I described their budget as an attack on the poor, middle class and the better-off in our society.  Greater validity may be found in other lines of argument and disagreement which would bring a debate such as this to a more constructive and useful level rather that the type of criticism we have heard up to now.  There is a level of agreement that public spending of any type in the future &mdash; certainly at present &mdash; cannot be cut back sufficiently so that the Government will not have to increase taxation.  Increased taxation is not something neutral or something that any Government or party will willingly impose without a great necessity to do so, because the methods by which millions of pounds of tax revenue can be raised have profound social and economic as well as political consequences. For that reason alone no Government or party wishes unduly to increase taxation beyond what is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>Taxation is now probably the most powerful tool of economic policy.  It is a tool of economic management and curtailment and the method by which taxation is raised will, of course, have consequences for the lives of our people, our jobs, our standard of living, the future development of our economy and so on. Since there was agreement on the need to increase taxation, what must be examined then is whether the methods by which this is implemented are socially just and fair and economically sound. Often the achievement of what is right socially and what is sound economically are contradictory and the only solution, therefore, is that of balancing one against the other in the best possible manner to suit our people and our economy, and that can be a very difficult task.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill proposes changes in the method of collecting corporation profits tax and the method of collecting VAT.  While this does not impose any additional burden financially, with the exception of the increased VAT rates, it serves the express function of creating for the Exchequer vast additional revenue at <Col N="1480" /> a much earlier date and within a much shorter period.  This is equivalent to the raising of additional revenue in an indirect way without taking it from the consumer because, firstly, it makes additional funds available to the Exchequer. This saves the Exchequer vast interest rates on borrowing, for example.  The collection of VAT at importation point will also serve to catch the defaulter and the evader who have been getting away for many years without paying VAT. During my budget contribution I said that a realistic estimate of the loss of revenue to the Revenue Commissioners in terms of VAT was something in the region of £100 million to £150 million.  This scale of evasion is, however, so large that anybody's guess could be more realistic, but certainly the figure is not lower than the amounts I have mentioned.  This is a great loss to the Exchequer which must be made good by the rest of the tax-paying public and by those traders who carry on their business in a legitimate fashion, paying their way honestly and fully in every respect.  I regretted also the fact that the new system of collecting VAT at point of importation would hurt and injure to some extent the legitimate traders in so far as they would now have to make provision through their banks, finance houses or whatever at a rate of interest to pay their VAT in advance. However, I am glad to note from public advertisements that appeared during the week and since the budget proposals were announced that the Revenue Commissioners have revised this aspect of taxation collection and are making provision for a deferred payment system on presentation of a bond or a direct bank debit. I applaud this system and I hope that the Minister will ensure that, if this is so, every legitimate trader who has been paying his way over the years honestly and diligently will receive this facility on application.</P>
    <P>I also mentioned previously that I understood that this type of measure to counteract abuses of the system in the payment of VAT had been proposed by the customs authorities to the collector general many years ago.  Whilst the new system will be difficult for many traders, <Col N="1481" /> I am glad that at this stage something is being done in an effort to assist legitimate traders and at the same time make it difficult for the other type of trader to participate in VAT evasion.  It must always be remembered that the legitimate trader is contributing in a very big way to the Exchequer, to our employment situation, and he is paying his taxation by way of his corporation profits tax, his own income tax and his PRSI. The contribution made to the Exchequer in this country over many years by the many thousands of small traders and traders not so small has been invaluable. Every encouragement should be given by the Government to such traders because to do so will bring about increased activity within their own business and, naturally, this will result in the creation, we would hope, of many new jobs in those types of trades.  Indeed, I think that the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister will be very pleasantly surprised at the end of the full year at the additional revenue they will collect from VAT.</P>
    <P>I also hope that the Revenue Commissioners will continue to be on the alert and on the look-out for the tax evader, because, irrespective of what system is introduced at any time, there will always be those who are capable of beating that system and finding the loopholes.  Unfortunately, quite a number of experts are employed in this field to scrutinise such legislation in very close detail and to examine the possibilities of finding ways around the system.  This has been done very successfully over the years and, whilst every attempt is now being made to close off loopholes, I hope that the Revenue Commissioners will be very aware that these possibilities will still exist and that they will be pursued with great vigour by those who wish to take advantage of them.</P>
    <P>In respect of VAT we will have to be particularly cautious to ensure, for example, that correct documentation is produced with correct pricing, bearing in mind that VAT will be charged on the value on the documentation.  The improper listing of goods, for instance, which will show a reduced value on documentation for lower payment of VAT is <Col N="1482" /> an example of what we must look for. There are so many areas of tax evasion and tax dodging here that if there was a European league of nations for tax evasion we, as a small country, would qualify to be very much in the running for honours in such a league.  That statement may seem very harsh, but when one looks at the abuses of various systems one would be forgiven for having such bad thoughts about our community as a whole.  A great many people have very peculiar ideas when it comes to meeting their debts to the Revenue Commissioners and there are all sorts of gimmicks and attempts to flout the taxation laws. I have already referred to the VAT system and we are all aware of the methods employed by tax experts on behalf of their clients to delay payments over a number of years.  This costs money to the Exchequer and that same money must be found from other sources.  Eventually the burden falls on those who pay their fair and honest share of taxation.</P>
    <P>There is also abuse of the social welfare system by many of the unemployed. Proof of this is the huge number of motorists who arrive weekly at the employment exchanges to sign on.  They appear to be in a position to eat, drink and be merry and generally have a good time.  Many hard-working people complain that it seems to be much better to be unemployed because those without jobs seem to be able to spend more money and have a better time than those who spend all day at work.</P>
    <P>It was reported recently that approximately 160,000 people are not paying their radio and television licence fees. This year the loss to the Exchequer will be in region of £8 million.  According to the same report, the Exchequer has lost over £30 million through non-payment of licence fees during the past ten years. That money could have been utilised by the Minister in many different ways. Many more millions have been spent on campaigns to persuade people to pay their licence fees but these campaigns have not had the desired effect and the situation continues to deteriorate very rapidly.  Once again the same limited <Col N="1483" /> number of people are paying for a service which is being enjoyed by many more.</P>
    <P>The method of collecting licence fees must be changed.  Surely with the modern means available it should not be too difficult to devise a method whereby nobody could purchase or rent a television receiver without first producing a licence. Once the names of such persons were recorded on computer a small staff only would be required to follow up on those who did not renew their licences.  This would seem to be a simple solution and I cannot understand why such a scheme has not been devised by the Department. Experience justifies taking away from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs the onus of collecting licence fees and giving the task to perhaps, another Department such as the Department of Finance, through a collection authority, or to an outside independent body.  Either solution would be a vast improvement because the present position is grossly unsatisfactory and discriminatory to those who are fulfilling their obligations. In this respect the Department of Posts and Telegraphs must stand seriously indicted because of their ineptitude and inability to carry out such a simple function as the collection of radio and television licence fees.</P>
    <P>Regarding corporation taxes, one of the basic weaknesses over the years has been the non-extension of tax allowances on capital expenditure.  I accept that there are many items of capital expenditure which are written down over a period and consequently an allowance is applied to a written down amount.  I have in mind the acquisition of new buildings which become necessary in order to up-date or expand business.  To enable a business to carry on it is often necessary to up-date premises and a tax allowance on this type of capital expenditure would encourage the creation of a better atmosphere for business development which would in turn create more employment.  That must be our ultimate objective in view of our large unemployment problem.  It is generally recognised that expansion means more employment and consequently greater returns to the Exchequer.  It is <Col N="1484" /> also recognised that private enterprise must be encouraged to bring about the creation of more jobs.  If we are to allow private enterprise to develop and to solve the problems of unemployment, we must also remove the inhibitions, restraints and disincentives which are now hindering private enterprise.  The only alternative is to allow the State to create employment and to develop the economy and this would mean State investment and involvement in industry on a scale never before contemplated by Irish politicians.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the average employer now feels that he is slowly but surely being imprisoned in a glass bowl.  Taxation is increasing; the PRSI contribution is almost 12 per cent of his total wage bill.  He is an unpaid tax collector and has to invest capital in people and equipment to look after the collection of tax.  I have already referred to the VAT obligations of an importer.  He will now have to pay VAT well in advance of the sale of his product and this will cost him money which could be put to better use in developing his business and creating more jobs.  We have probably reached the pinnacle in regard to the taxation of employers and if they are pushed any further many of them may decide to pack it in and invest their money where they can receive a guaranteed return with less trouble and no outlay, while probably leading a happier and easier life.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Finance Bill provides for an incentive to companies to increase employment and takes the form of a deduction to be allowed against trading profits chargeable to corporation tax. This is granted to companies in respect of an increase in their levels of employment in the period 1 July 1982 to 30 June 1983 over levels of employment in the same period during the previous 12 months. The deduction will be £10 per week per employee.  This type of incentive has been available to employers for a few years, and while it is a contributory element on the part of the Government to create more jobs in private enterprise it does not play any great role in the overall creation of employment.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately unemployment continues <Col N="1485" /> to be the greatest festering problem we have and there is no sign at present of any spectacular drop in the unemployment figures.  This week we have the grim prospect of over 42,000 young people sitting the final stages of their examinations and approximately 30,000 of them will be seeking their first job.  Only a minority of those seeking jobs will succeed in present circumstances.  The latest figures of unemployment for people under the age of 25 years is in the region of 28 per cent of the total number unemployed.</P>
    <P>The unemployment problem is a universal one and is not something special to this country.  In the US, millions of people are unemployed.  Strong European countries which had not expereienced unemployment since the War, such as Germany and France, now have an unemployment figure as high as 6 per cent.  It is recognised in the EEC as a serious problem affecting all member states.  Those statistics do not solve our problem or help our young people who are unemployed, but it must be remembered that in the overall context of the world's economic climate it would be unrealistic to expect that we should avoid the unemployment plague which has hit other European countries during the recession or that we should not experience a rise in unemployment on a large scale.</P>
    <P>Work experience programmes sponsored by AnCO have been most successful. They claim an 80 per cent employment rate for young people after they leave the six-month training course.  However, the number of places is not sufficient to cope with the number of applicants. Many employers take on young people coming from AnCO on work training programmes and after one person has completed the course he or she is replaced by another individual for a further six months and so on.  This gives the employer a very cheap labour force and is an aspect which has caused a great deal of concern to the trade union movement. Many of the companies concerned are not unionised.  The training authority and the Minister for Labour should have a good look at the situation to ensure that <Col N="1486" /> such unfair advantage of what is basically a very good scheme is not taken by employers at the expense of providing more full-time employment.</P>
    <P>While the initial prospects for young people of obtaining employment are rather bleak, recent economic forecasts suggest that while they suffer the disappointments of unemployment their long-term prospects are quite good.  The economists point to the number of young people on the live register which indicates that two-thirds of those aged between 20 and 24 years find employment within five months.  It has been estimated that over 80 per cent find full-time employment at 10 months.  Thus the flexibility and prospects for young people are more optimistic than for those who are unemployed in their later years.  A further reason for optimism about the long-term prospects for young people is borne out by a school leavers survey carried out by the National Manpower Service.  Government sources maintain relative optimism for last year's school leavers.  While cautious optimism can be maintained, the average rates of unemployment among young people in Europe as a whole is a source of major concern to all Governments.  While there is such a serious work shortage, every means must be employed where it is thought that the employment prospects for even a small number of people can be improved.</P>
    <P>In present circumstances it is wrong to have people in safe and secure employment who can obtain 20 or 30 hours a week overtime, thus more than doubling their basic weekly pay, while there are 147,000 people who cannot obtain employment at all.  I am pleased that the Minister for Labour has recognised this as an area which requires immediate and urgent attention and has indicated that he will introduce legislation soon to restrict the amount of overtime available to those in full-time employment.  Some years ago we discussed in the House the possibility of work sharing as a method of creating more jobs.  It is true that there are many people in full-time employment who would not accept any cut-back in their existing terms of employment even as an emergency effort to help those who <Col N="1487" /> are less fortunate and cannot obtain employment.  The present serious situation should be brought home to everyone and there should be recognition that something of an emergency nature must be done to achieve more jobs.  There must be an atmosphere of acceptance of the reality of the situation we have at present.</P>
    <P>Recently I read with great sadness of a bakery in Dublin closing down with a loss of 250 jobs simply because agreement could not be reached between management, unions and workers to introduce an acceptable system of night work. Negotiations had been going on for almost two years and in the present economic climate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-Central):</i> I hope all those involved in the creation of employment, from the Government to trade unions and workers, are prepared to encourage those fortunate enough to have jobs to give a little in some way.  I hope that all those involved, particularly the trade union leadership, will be seen to lead from the front rather than from behind.  They must help in the area of industrial relations, because when there is unrest in industry it upsets the confidence of investors and causes problems for existing employment.  If we do not succeed in doing that the consequences <Col N="1488" /> will be even worse than they are at the moment and everyone in the country will be affected.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the Government's plan to introduce taxation on certain derelict sites, and to refer in particular to the following paragraph in the Minister's statement:</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that during the course of my financial statement of 25 March last I indicated the Government's intention to introduce taxation on derelict sites and on certain office developments with a view to ameliorating dereliction in urban areas. </P>
      <P>The Minister stated that a Bill to deal with the matter would come before the House shortly.  I hope it will be effective in curbing what has become a very bad situation in our capital city.  There are too many derelict sites around the city.  Many of them were purchased years ago by land speculators and have been left in a shocking condition.  Not only are we losing the benefit of utilising such valuable land for industry, warehousing, office development or housing but we are also creating an ugly eyesore for our tourists.  I hope the measures to be proposed by the Minister will be effective in providing a solution. This matter has been discussed frequently at city council level.  Dublin, our capital city, has been decaying for a number of years and any measures by the Minister in the form of taxation that would help to resolve the problem would be welcomed by all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about the so-called Gregory deal but, as a Dublin city Deputy, it is necessary to say that, any deals apart, much work has to be done in the Dublin city area.  Housing has been particularly bad for a number of years. The appearance of the city has deteriorated considerably and any government, whether coalition or Fianna Fáil, have an onus to do something about rebuilding the city, irrespective of any alleged political deals.  Therefore, it is wrong for any political grouping, and particularly for representatives of the constituency involved, to come here and decry any attempts to provide better housing for the people in the area, to create more employment or to have a better environmental <Col N="1489" /> situation in Dublin city.  It ill behoves those Deputies who represent the area to decry the attempts being made to do something about the matter.  I applaud any action that the Government will take and any investment to make Dublin city a capital city of which we can be proud.  We spend much money in encouraging tourism.  Some 95 per cent of tourists wish to visit the capital city but when they drive through the main thoroughfares we cannot be proud of the Dublin they see.  Apart from other social and economic reasons, for that reason also I hope that the plans to rebuild the city centre will be expedited.</P>
    <P>With regard to borrowing, in his statement the Minister made the following comment:</P>
    <P>I am not advocating unrestricted borrowing for capital development as this would be entirely wrong.  We must be selective but we must at the same time be prepared to borrow at a substantial level for sound investment projects which will strengthen our economy and provide a worthwhile return in due course.  I want to emphasise the need for greater selectivity. </P>
    <P>I agree fully with the policy being pursued by the Minister in this respect.  As a Government we have been criticised strongly for so-called excessive foreign borrowing.  If we are to develop our economy and our infrastructure, if we are to build schools and develop our housing and job-creation programmes, of course we will require substantial funds.  It is generally recognised that as far as taxation is concerned we have almost reached the maximum scale of taxation charges that can be imposed on any sector.  Therefore, the only way to obtain the substantial funds necessary for the type of work we must carry out is through foreign borrowing. We have been borrowing at very attractive interest rates in the past few years.  With the availability of such low interest rates abroad it would have been very foolish and neglectful on the part of any government not to have used that facility.  In some cases interest rates were as low as 3 or 4 per cent, and when that is compared with the rate of inflation it <Col N="1490" /> made good sense to have borrowed to such an extent.</P>
    <P>If we had that type of interest rate for borrowing abroad available to us all the time we would certainly be assured of a reasonably high inflation rate here over the next few years.  Weighing that against the interest rates available abroad it is a sound and wise policy on the part of any Minister for Finance to borrow where he can and what he can, but to ensure that that borrowing is used for capital expenditure, to build up the areas I have mentioned, infrastructure, schools, housing, jobs and so on, because we have a growing young population so that measures of a different nature from those taken over the previous years are demanded to make this country a better place for people to live in in the future.  The planning envisaged by this Government will certainly take all those aspects into consideration and I have every confidence that with the full support and co-operation of all sections in the community we can do that and again make this country a very good country for everybody to live in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is more or less a rehash of the budget debate.  I did not contribute to the budget debate because I believe that until the Finance Bill is circulated we cannot see exactly where the chages will take place.  One gets a better chance of dealing with the areas one is interested in on the Finance Bill.  It is for that reason that I did not contribute on the budget debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important event of the year so far as the administration of the Dáil is concerned is the budget.  A budget should stimulate, consolidate and help to develop the economy.  The Finance Bill which we are discussing at the moment is to give effect to the provisions of the budget.  Coming from a constituency like Wexford I am worried about what the budget and the Finance Bill hold for that constituency and for the country as a whole, because I believe that the three men closest to the Taoiseach &mdash; the Ministers for Finance, Agriculture and Industry &mdash; are being influenced by him.  This is worrying not alone to me but to most <Col N="1491" /> people who have a stake in the economy of this nation.</P>
    <P>I want to speak specifically about the economic policy being pursued by the Government.  We have heard a lot about the social policy.  But if we have not got a good economic policy we cannot secure the moneys to provide for a social policy. Nobody denies that the Coalition Government in the short space of seven months were able to alert the country to the depths of recession and debt into which it had been plunged by the previous administration.  So well did the Coalition Government of the time present their case to the country that when the general election was called the country was willing to accept the reality of the situation as outlined by the then Government.</P>
    <P>The country was and still is ready to face hard economic policies.  But in spite of the general acceptance of our economic difficulties, in spite of the willingness of the public to face the consequences of the situation into which Fianna Fáil plunged the country and in spite of an understanding that financial rectitude is a prerequisite to continued support from overseas bankers, the day of reckoning was once again postponed and for a considerable time.  We got promises in the general election of 1981. We got promises in the February election of 1982, from the Taoiseach in particular, of stop-gap patching up operations&mdash; that is the only way I can describe it &mdash; wherever problems were clearly enough identified by Fianna Fáil at the time.  The Taoiseach went around the country in advance of these general elections doing favours for people, giving an nod here and a nod there.  Now Fianna Fáil are back in office on the strength of these financial gimmickries and mortgaging of millions to the future &mdash; all to obtain a couple of votes and one vote in particular, the vote of one Independent in a Dublin constituency.</P>
    <P>What will be the final bill at the end of 1982?  I am not prepared to accept the accounts as presented because they seem to change from day to day.  Still, as the pressure groups arrive on the streets, the <Col N="1492" /> Government are prepared to yield when there is no need to do so.  That was the policy prior to the 1981 General Election. No matter who cried wolf the Government stepped in and paid the bill with borrowed money.  It is pointless to hope that the harsh world of reality will pass us by because we are unique, because we are Irish.  The harsh world does not care whether we are Irish or American or Argentinian or French or German.  If we borrow money on the world money markets we must repay it with interest.  The previous speaker said that money was borrowed at 3 per cent.  I would like to know when money was borrowed at 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>One of the measures taken in the budget, and now in the Finance Bill, was in regard to paying VAT at the source of entry.  The Minister for Finance said that he was making provision for the people needing this money to borrow from the ICC.  But he did not tell us the interest rate.  We now find that it is about 22 per cent.  Those are the harsh realities of borrowing money.  Those are the harsh realities of the meaures taken.  Those are the harsh realities which face the industrial arm of our economy today.</P>
    <P>Our ability to service and repay our debts depends on our ability to negotiate fresh productive lending for the country. In a speech to the Economic Club in New York some months ago the Taoiseach suggested that Coalition efforts to bring public finance under control had damaged Ireland's reputation in the United States.  Yet in a recent survey it was found that approximately one quarter of our overseas industries located in Ireland would go elsewhere if they were to make another investment.  This disenchantment springs from problems resulting from bad government over the four years from 1977 to 1981.</P>
    <P>I have the height of praise for the work of the IDA down through the years. Everybody will admit that great economic strides have been made over the past ten years, but the present economic policies being pursued are seriously damaging that success.  We talk about attracting industries, but we must create good conditions &mdash; low interest rates, low inflation <Col N="1493" /> rates, good labour relations, stable government, ease of communication and, above all, industrialists must be assured that they will be able to make a profit.</P>
    <P>That brings us to the question of competitiveness. At the moment many industries are not competitive even on the home market.  The previous speaker mentioned borrowing money and interest rates.  I am not, and never have been, against borrowing for productive purposes. But I strongly oppose borrowing to meet day-to-day expenditure, and that is what is happening here.  All the handouts over the past two to three years were on borrowed money.  Every member state of the EEC is interested in its own problems and the concessions got by the Irish Government are very small. That does not affect the other member states and they are satisfied as long as the benefits flow in their direction.  If we borrow we must repay with interest.  If we do not repay we will reduce our own credibility on foreign markets.</P>
    <P>I believe the provisions of this Bill are completely inadequate to stimulate growth in the economy and to encourage foreign and home investment.  While we have an inflation rate of 22 per cent and interest rates at 20 to 22 per cent we cannot expect investment from the home market or from abroad.  There has been a great deal of cricitism about the budget introduced by the Coalition Government in June 1981.  That Government introduced a budget in January 1982 which resulted in a general election but the provisions in that budget were necessary and people do not deny that fact.  This was borne out at the Dublin by-election. During that by-election I had my first chance to meet Dublin people&mdash;the very poor, middle-class and the very well off &mdash; and over those three weeks I learned just how these people are thinking.  If they can see the light at the end of the tunnel they are prepared to take harsh measures and to make their fair contribution.</P>
    <P>It has been widely stated that this Government are causing confusion and uncertainty by changing their minds from one week to another, and even from day to day.  As our amendment says, there <Col N="1494" /> are serious changes in this Bill from what were proposed in the budget.  Our economy will not improve until the inflation rate is reduced.  Let us look at our neighbour, Britain.  Her interest rate is around 12 per cent while ours is from 20 per cent to 22 per cent.  How can we compete for new industries when we have such a high interest rate?  That is the harsh reality.</P>
    <P>I object to the payment of VAT at the point of entry.  I accept there is a great deal of tax evasion but it is the function of the Department of Finance to tighten up their regulations.  To have to pay this VAT at point of entry is a very damaging blow to industry, which must import large quantities of raw materials to create jobs and carry on business.  Industrial development over the past ten years has made great strides but this imposition will put a tremendous strain on cash flows for industry.  Irrespective of whether the people concerned have to borrow from the banks or the ICC, they will still have to pay the exorbitant interest rates of 22 per cent.  No doubt the cash flow situation in all sectors of the economy is serious, but not more serious anywhere else than in the manufacturing industry.  This imposition of 18 per cent will create further redundancies.  Even in the last 24 hours we have seen industries closing and we are still not at the end of the road. The Government have imposed this measure to collect £140 million, but I believe that at the end of the year they will not have collected that amount.  All that will have happened is that there will have been more redundancies and further closures.  This is a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the question of income tax appeals procedure.  A taxpayer not satisfied with an assessment or a determination of his tax-free allowance made by the inspector of taxes is entitled to appeal against that assessment or determination by giving in writing notice to the local inspector.  The appeal commission hold hearings on a regular basis in each tax district.  The decision as to which cases are listed for hearing rests solely with the inspector and, in the normal course of events, only a small proportion <Col N="1495" /> of the total cases under appeal will be heard at any particular sitting of the commission.</P>
    <P>Normally, cases listed will have been under appeal for a considerable length of time, which usually suits both the revenue people and the taxpayer or his agent. However, a small number of cases under appeal need a speedy hearing to avoid financial hardship.  If the Inspector decides not to list these cases, the taxpayer has no adequate means of redress other than making repeated requests to the inspector which may or may not be ignored.  To eliminate this imbalance, the appeals provisions should be amended to ensure that a case will be listed for hearing at the next regular appeal hearing in the District Court following a formal written request by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of such a provision would also ensure that a submission to the inspector would be dealt with within a reasonable time.  At present, it is not unusual for the Inspector of Taxes to take over 12 months to reply to submissions, although that does not happen in all cases.  The taxpayer should have some rights and at the moment he has not.  He can only go to his TD or local representative to try to bring pressure on the Minister concerned.  This is most unsatisfactory, particularly in the present difficult cash flow situation.  People must get their tax situation in order.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister for Finance is the problem involving sub-contractors' certificates.  This first came to my notice over two years ago.  I have since taken up the matter privately with the Minister, with no result.  The system of sub-contractors' certificates was originally intended to counter tax evasion by fly-by-nights. However, the regulations and the manner in which they are applied are so severe that they are financially damaging to honest and genuine sub-contractors. Particular hardship is caused where the contract includes a large percentage of material.  In these cases, deductions of tax at 35 per cent and subsequent delays by the revenue people in dealing with repayments have caused crippling cash <Col N="1496" /> flow problems.  The present restrictions should be relaxed.  It should be sufficient for a sub-contractor to have an established place of business and a residence owned by him in order to qualify for a certificate, without the additional existing requirements.  The provision regarding sub-contractors' certificates states that the sub-contractors who are not in possession of such certificate and who may have a large contract for a county council or a private firm will be charged 35 per cent of the money from that job.</P>
    <P>In my own county, the Collector-General has been most reasonable, but there have been many problems and I see no reason for having to spend hours on the phone trying to get these problems solved.  That is the function of the Department of Finance, who should ensure that these measures do not seriously damage sub-contractors financially. I accept that the fly-by-night must be dealt with, but am not prepared to accept that the local Inspector of Taxes cannot identify those people.  It is important that he differentiate between the fly-by-night and the genuine sub-contractor. I make a very strong appeal that this issue be dealt with immediately.  I must put on record that over the past two months in several cases of this nature the Collector-General acted very reasonably. Unfortunately one case broke down and the man had to make his entire staff redundant.  This staff took action into their own hands, put a picket on the tax office concerned and then the certificate was issued.  That type of action should not be necessary and the situation is very serious.  In two other cases, the Collector-General himself had to step in to solve the problem just in time.</P>
    <P>The problems of borrowing became apparent in the debate on the budget and will appear in the debate on the Finance Bill.  It was interesting to hear the previous speaker saying that we could and did borrow at 3 per cent interest.  I do not know what year he was talking about.  I have the available figures in front of me. The interest paid on the national debt in 1976 amounted to £268 million.  For 1977, it was £339 million, the capital repayments amounted to £315 million and the <Col N="1497" /> interest from outside the State was £99 million.  The expected figures for 1982 are as follows: Interest payable on national debt, £1,300 million, capital repayments on the national debt, £1,116 million, interest paid outside the State &mdash; and this is very intersting &mdash; £528 million.  Would anyone in his right senses think that this escalation from 1977 is not damaging to our economy?  Of course it has done irreparable damage.  We are continuing to borrow because we want to build an airport at Knock and want to keep open factories at Tuam and elsewhere.  These are all parasites.  The sooner the better for our people that the Government realise that the day has long passed when we could continue to borrow on this scale, and be committed to pay so much in any one year.  Those are the harsh realities.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the Taoiseach has not changed his policies since he was in office 18 months prior to the 1981 general election.  I feel sorry for the senior officials of the Department of Finance who must be asking what the Taoiseach will do next, where will he spend the next £25 million, where are they going to collect it.  The PRSI protestors took to the streets and there was another £46 million between the budget and the enactment of the Finance Bill for which no provision was made.  What will our current budget deficit be at the end of this year?  We cannot trust the figures, because we cannot trust Government policies.  These have created uncertainty and redundancies. These policies are creating an inflation rate of 22 per cent and an interest rate also of 22 per cent.  This country cannot continue to develop under those conditions.  We are in reverse at present in no uncertain manner.  People are beginning to accept that as the harsh reality.</P>
    <P>I now turn to an area in which I am very interested&mdash;that of the county councils.  These councils provide essential infrastructural development, such as roads, water, sewerage and housing.  In some cases, they play a very important development role in their county.  Unfortunately, the present deterioration in finances, not for one county council but <Col N="1498" /> for all, has had serious repercussions on the local community.  This rot started with the Fianna Fáil action in 1979 of restricting the county council incomes to 10 per cent.  At the same time they knew perfectly well that the statutory demands on all councils for wages, health contributions and so on were in the region of 35 per cent.  We are now in the position that the majority of county councils are on the verge of bankruptcy; their development role has ceased; the number of houses being built has decreased and there is deterioration in roads and a decline in installations of water and sewerage in practically every county.</P>
    <P>In our own county council in 1979 in Wexford we had to our credit and invested approximately £1 million.  It was reported by the county manager on Monday last that he was asking for approval from the council for current expenditure overdraft accommodation of £2 million. The most unfortunate part of it was that he was refused accommodation by the bank with which the county council have carried on business since 1922.  We have to resort to the money lenders.  When county councils must resort to money lenders for cash to run the county services it is a really pitiful situation.  That is the only way I can describe it.  We have to pay 22.25 per cent for that money.  That is far away from what the previous speaker spoke of, three or five per cent. This will have a very serious effect on our council programme for the next financial year.  It means a reduction in the development role of the council, a reduction in housing and in expenditure on roads, a reduction in the installation of water and sewerage facilities which are so necessary because they were neglected through the years.</P>
    <P>I regard the housing situation as the most serious.  In 1980 Wexford County Council built 117 houses; in 1981, 100 houses; in 1982, 85 houses and in 1983 it is projected that we will build 75 houses. This is as a result of the policies pursued by the Government not only in the past four months but over the period from 1979 to the present time.  I accept that we were in office for seven months but we were taking the necessary remedial <Col N="1499" /> action to put the state finances right. Within three months the present Government &mdash; and it is in this Finance Bill &mdash; have put them in further jeopardy.  This rubs off on the county councils.  I believe it is the moral obligation of any State to house its people if we are not to have numerous social problems.  The county councils are the housing authorities and they cannot house the people if they cannot get the money.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the Gregory deal about which we hear so much, particularly from Dublin Fianna Fáil Deputies, Dublin is not all Ireland.  I do not object to our capital city getting reasonable money for expenditure.  We feel proud of our capital but we must look at the situation as to why that deal was done for Dublin.  It was the buying of a vote; it was carrying on the policy which the the present Taoiseach has adopted since he became Taoiseach in December 1980 of doing deals of one kind or another but doing them at other people's expense &mdash; that is what is important.  He is not spending his own money but the State's money.  He has not the right to do that but we have the right here to state categorically and clearly for the people outside Dublin that the reason for the reduction in housing in Wexford is that all the money has to go to Dublin city.  This situation is most unsatisfactory for the council.  It will have long-lasting effects on the infrastructural development of every county and the Fianna Fáil Party and Government are totally responsible, particularly from 1979 to date.</P>
    <P>I come to an area in which I am very interested and in which I operated as Minister of State in the previous Government &mdash; agriculture which is so important to our economy.  For the past three years farm income has declined drastically and as a result agricultural production has fallen.  It should be a national priority to maximise agricultural production.  I say this not only in the interests of the farmers but of the entire community.  Maximising agricultural production can have a dramatic effect on the employment situation. There is tremendous employment potential in agri-business.  The enemy of <Col N="1500" /> agriculture has been and still is inflation. During the term of the Coalition Government of seven months, while we were debating the measures to be taken in the budget regarding agriculture the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture state that with the policies pursued by that Government inflation could be brought down to 12 or 13 per cent by the end of 1982.  I have no doubt that this was possible had the January 1982 budget gone through the House.  If that had happened the benefits to agriculture and the country generally would represent about 7 or 8 per cent of an improvement.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about the increase in agricultural prices in Europe.  We got about 10 to 11 per cent but it is very little benefit to the farming community if inflation stays at 18 to 20 per cent.  Judging by the policies being pursued by the Government, with inflation at 17 to 18 per cent for 1982, with interest rates likely to stay around 20 per cent, with the 10 per cent increase from the EEC &mdash; the only increased income farmers will get &mdash; I believe that at the end of the financial year there will be a further reduction in real terms in agricultural income of 4 to 5 per cent.  That adds on to a decrease in income over the past three years of 50 per cent.  Would any other sector of the economy accept such a situation, income continually dropping over a four-year period and seriously damaging a basic section of the economy, agriculture, which is the only real asset we have as regards income which does not involve continued importing to produce exports? Is any other sector of the economy prepared to accept the conditions which the farming community have to accept now?</P>
    <P>I question also whether the Government realise fully the conditions prevailing in agriculture, and I am concerned seriously that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance may exert too much influence on the Minister for Agriculture.  I shall be giving that Minister a chance before criticising him, but after a month or so we shall be very critical of him if he fails to take the necessary action to ensure that farmers' incomes are brought up to a <Col N="1501" /> realistic level.  The first big task facing the Minister is the implemetation of the tax-based lending scheme, and that scheme, incidentally, was drawn up more or less by the Coalition Government.  It is a very important scheme because it follows on two other schemes &mdash; the national interest subsidy scheme of 5 per cent and the development interest subsidy scheme of 5 per cent as well as on the European Investment Bank loan at a fixed interest rate of 14 per cent.  While it was my responsibility while in office to put those schemes into operation I found that there was too much interference from the Department of Finance.  I appreciate that that Department are only doing their job and that they have a difficult job to do especially with the Government now in office, but they must recognise clearly that these schemes are absolutely necessary if we are to make any attempt to pull agriculture out of its present state of recession.</P>
    <P>Agriculture represents 50 per cent of the goods sector of this economy, and that has been the situation for the past 25 years.  Despite the fact that we have put huge sums of money into industry we are having great difficulty in bringing about a situation in which agriculture represents less than 50 per cent of the goods sector.  At the moment its potential is about 55 per cent but under present conditions development is at a standstill and will remain so while present conditions prevail.</P>
    <P>I understand that the 5 per cent national interest subsidy scheme is doing quite well, as also is the development loan arangement, but the European Investment Bank loan operated through the ACC at 14 per cent fixed interest for 12 years is not doing as well as had been expected.  This is because of the numerous restrictions attached to the loan. When the scheme was introduced I experienced tremendous difficulties with the Department of Finance in regard to having some of those restrictions removed, but when the scheme is being put into operation we find even more restrictions being imposed by the EEC. It is the job of the Department of Finance to ensure that if we are getting concessions <Col N="1502" /> from the EEC, these concessions are operated properly at home.  The EEC should not be allowed to impose restrictions which to my mind should not be imposed.  It is difficult enough to get concessions from the Community, but if there is an overloading of restrictions the concessions cannot be operated properly. On the 14 per cent loan is a 5 per cent interest subsidy also.  I appeal to the Department of Finance to ensure that the scheme is operated with our 5 per cent for the first four years.  I had great difficulty in trying to have that accepted but I am glad that it is being accepted now though I am still concerned about the tax-based lending scheme being put into operation.</P>
    <P>Among the conditions govering that scheme is one which provides that all applications must be submitted through the appropriate lending agency and that that agency will have primary responsibility for assessing the eligibility of applicants for the scheme.  It is provided that all participants must sign an agreement, authorising the lending agency to make all relevant documents and information available to the Department of Agriculture. I am not against that in any way but I am opposed to the next part of the regulation, which stipulates that the documentation and information must be made available also to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit purposes. Surely a scheme of this kind is for the benefit of agriculture and why, then, ask the CAG particularly, who is in charge of the companies regulation legislation, legislation under which some accounts have not been submitted for four or five years, to audit what is a rescue package?  This situation will damage the scheme to a great extent.  I am not suggesting that the farmers should hide anything but I am saying that the CAG should not step in where there is a rescue package involved. If we were talking about a scheme that was lucrative it would be appropriate to bring in the CAG, but that is not the case.  The Department of Agriculture will have available to them all the necessary documentation, and that should be sufficient.</P>
    <P>I must call on the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1503" /> and on his Minister of State to ensure that when the scheme is being put into operation they do not allow the lending institutions to have complete control. I say this because during my negotiations with these institutions I found that while they were very interested in solving their own problems they were not concerned about solving the problems of farmers. We must ensure that, though they must have a say in the arrangements, the authority must rest with the Department of Agriculture.  We must ensure that the banks do not merely solve their own problems.  They have a duty under this arrangement to solve the farmers' problems. We must ensure that the banks do not merely reduce their own liability and that whatever benefits come from the scheme are not channelled only to them.</P>
    <P>I question also the sincerity of the Minister for Finance.  In his budget speech he said that a final amendment of current expenditure provisions which he should mention related to the reduced interest rate scheme for farmers in severe financial difficulties and was due to come into operation on 1 April.  The Minister said that the State's contribution to this scheme would be made mainly through the tax code but that some direct Exchequer repayments were required.  He went on to say that the original provision for these repayments was £4 million but that this could be reduced to £1.5 million for this year because of the late starting date. That was a misleading and incorrect statement, and one can only be horrified that the Minister should have seen fit to make it.  In our budget we proposed a provision of £4 million in this respect. This amount was absolutely necessary to compensate the ACC for their contribution to the scheme.  There is no point in the Minister coming here and misleading the House.  Does he think the people are fools?   Had we remained in office the scheme would have been in operation by 1 March and he was speaking about a situation in which it would come into operation on 1 April.  Does he believe that one month's delay would make a difference of £2,500,000 in a provision of £4 million?  On numerous occasions I <Col N="1504" /> described this man while he was Minister for Agriculture as having a live-horse-and-you-get-grass attitude.  He has not changed.  I am warning the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister of State of this provision.  If the ACC are not to be allowed the £4 million that we proposed, they will not be in a position to operate the scheme.  Therefore, they must be given the full provision.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the ACC get £4 million so that the scheme is operated properly.  I will be contacting our spokesman, Deputy Bruton, about this issue with a view to framing an amendment to this effect.  We will be having a discussion with the Minister on this issue.  He is not fooling anybody when he states that a later starting date of one month will mean that the provision can be reduced to £1.5 million.  We are all aware that the ACC are not in a position to make this money available.  They do not have great profits and any they have is needed.  We must remember that the ACC is a non-profit making organisation.  The Minister should restore the £4 million because otherwise it will not be possible to operate the scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme £70 millions of capital will be grant-aided through the ACC and £120 millions will be made available for grant purposes through the commercial banks.  According to the figures that are available the total indebtedness of agriculture is about £1,300 millions.  A total of £6 millions is being made available for the subsidising of the 5 per cent development loan and that will subsidise approximately £120 millions of capital.  A similar amount will apply under the national interest subsidy scheme of 5 per cent.  That will subsidise £120 millions of capital.  The provision of £190 millions in capital for the ACC and the banks leaves us with a figure £430 millions of capital to be subsidised.  If one subtracts that from the amount of the indebtedness in agriculture one is left with a figure of £900 millions.  I argued before that that figure is inadequate, and I repeat that view.  I accept that those figures were submitted to us by the banks and the ACC, but if we will be subsidising only approximately one-third of the total indebtedness of our <Col N="1505" /> farmers the efforts being made by the Government will be of minor benefit to the industry.  I should like to point out to the Minister for Agriculture that when the applications are in &mdash; I understand that a week ago 2,000 applications had been received but I believe the figure will rise to about 7,000 by closing date at the end of June &mdash; and it is found that there is a shortfall he is in duty bound to approach the Minister for Finance seeking an increase in the capital allocation for the scheme.</P>
    <P>We were careful when drawing up this scheme because it was essential to help the 6,000 or 7,000 lead farmers who are producing three tons of grain per acre, 1,000 gallon cows and have a stocking rate of 9 per cent per acre.  They were advised by the Department to develop their holdings and increase production so as to boost exports and help our balance of payments.  They are now caught in this situation.  There should not be any opposition by the Minister for Finance.  I do not trust that Minister as far as agriculture is concerned, because he has a very narrow view of the industry.  His emphasis was on handouts to a small number of farmers.  He forgot about the producing farmers and the importance of bringing up the level of production so as to create jobs in the agri-business.  We are all aware of the importance of the local creamery, provision and hardware stores to our small provincial towns.  They are vital.  There is no doubt that if this tax-based lending scheme does not get adequate finance it will fail.  I am worried about the decision of the Minister for Finance to reduce the amount for the scheme from £4 million to £1.5 million. Is the Minister sincere about that scheme?  If there is a shortfall will he make it up?</P>
    <P>The lending agencies will be the greatest beneficiaries under the scheme.  We have heard a lot about bad borrowing. Financial institutions are always quick to tell us about bad investment and bad borrowing, but we must not forget that if there was bad borrowing there was also bad lending.  For that reason the financial institutions must carry some of the penalties attached to bad lending.  Those penalties <Col N="1506" /> should not all be loaded on our farmers.  Senior executives are quick to tell us about bad investment but they must carry some of the responsibility.  I have noticed that in the last six months the ACC, and the banks, have returned to penalty interest charges.  If the Minister intends making money available under the Bill to the banks he should ensure that they do not pile penalty interest on farmers while at the same time they collect grants from the Government and the taxpayers.  We appealed to the Minister before about this decision of the financial institutions to charge between 2 per cent and 6 per cent on top of 22 per cent.  If a borrower is not able to meet his commitments he must face that additional interest charge.  The Minister should not permit the lending institutions to use the system for their own benefit. The scheme is to benefit agriculture and for that reason farmers should not be charged those penalties.</P>
    <P>The ACC have now got into the habit of imposing penalties.  That organisation should be careful about the amount of pressure they impose on farmers.  The ACC, or the financial institutions, cannot expect a sudden uplift in farm incomes. There will be problems up to 1984 if remedial action is not taken in regard to the greatest enemies of agriculture, high interest rates and inflation.  The ACC, a semi-State body, are doing an excellent job but they should not lose sight of the fact that their primary purpose is to help agriculture.  By calling in receivers here, there and yonder they are not helping the farming community.  There is serious concern about pressure being exercised before every avenue is explored to see if there is a chance of getting farmers out of their difficulties.  Before any serious action is taken the ACC should ensure that all options are looked at.  I appeal to the Minister to take a serious view if undue pressure is exercised by the ACC or the banks.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of unemployment.  It is interesting to note that according to the latest information 147,672 people are unemployed and that this figure is still rising.  While I was holding a clinic in my constituency <Col N="1507" /> recently two people came to see me.  The first was a man who was in receipt of pay-related benefit.  He had a wife and five children and he received £106 per week.  In the budget he got an increase of 25 per cent but it seems that the Department of Social Welfare left him short about £4 or £5 and his complaint was that he was not getting the benefit he was entitled to.  I made representations and, fair enough, they gave him an extra £3 or £4 and that man ended up with £127.50.  That was his benefit after his problem was sorted out.  The same night another man came to see me and his position was identical with that of the first man in that he had a wife and five children.  He was travelling to work and his wages were £117.  His take-home pay was £106.  He had received a 6 per cent increase which was the first phase of the wage increase, but he received only £4 and he claimed he should have got £6 or £7.  When I looked it up I found that PRSI had taken £2 extra from his wages. The man with pay-related benefit ended up with £127 while the man who was travelling 15 miles a day to his work ended up with £110.  This situation is a disincentive to work and will have serious repercussions right across this country, as indeed has happened already.  I am prepared to accept that some people are on very low incomes as far as social welfare is concerned, but when you have a situation such as I have described you cannot encourage people to go to work.  With that prevailing we have a serious problem as far as short-term benefits from social welfare are concerned.  It is disheartening for good, genuine, honest people who want to work and who are not interested in going on either pay-related benefit or the dole unless they are forced to do so, when they find that their neighbour is in a more advantageous financial position than they are although they are working while that neighbour is not working.</P>
    <P>The 25 per cent benefit came up in our budget, but remember that it was in compensation for the tax on clothes and short-term social welfare benefit and the food subsidies.  The Government came along and operated the 25 per cent but <Col N="1508" /> lost the compensation of approximately £140 million.  Those are the policies which are being pursued.</P>
    <P>I have stated and I continue to say that the present Government must get their economic policies right, and nothing in that Finance Bill will put their economic policies right.  The unemployed now number 147,000 and that number will rise at the end of this year.  We will see a difficult situation at the social end also. Economic policies are one thing, social policies are another.  If you have not good economic policies you cannot afford good social welfare policies.  It is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the leadership of the present Government.  They have not learned anything as far as policy is concerned, and that is the most serious point. They are continuing with the same policies.  The by-election in Dublin indicated clearly to them how the people are thinking in regard to the hypocrisy and pretence under which the Government operated for 18 months under the present Taoiseach in their previous term of office, yet they are continuing the same policy.  The people have, in plain language, copped them on in that the people know that the Government's present economic policies are not for the benefit of the economy.</P>
    <P>The Government in their wisdom have the Finance Bill, 1982, before this House for ratification.  Deputy Bruton's amendment is before the House also.  It is reasonable to believe that the Bill will be carried, but it has been pointed out clearly in Deputy's Bruton's amendment that the better-off will get benefits from the Bill while the less well-off will have to pay more.  If they think that that situation can lead to better policies they are wrong.  I support Deputy Bruton's amendments, as will our party, in the interests of perhaps persuading the Minister for Finance to change his mind on certain aspects in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Before delving into the Finance Bill I would like to comment on one of the aspects which Deputy D'Arcy brought up, and it is the question of sub-contractors' certificates.  I have come across quite a number of these in the last couple of years and I have seen the difficulty that subcontractors have in obtaining their certificate.  I support Deputy D'Arcy's appeal to the Minister for Finance and I appeal to the Minister to look seriously at the position relating to the banking of subcontractors' certificates. The granting of these certificates has become extremely difficult and this is causing extreme hardship to people who are honest, who are paying their taxes and are being penalised by the excessive administrative steps being taken by the tax inspectors at the moment.</P>
      <P>I move now to the Finance Bill.  On 25 March the budget was brought forward by the Minister for Finance and now we have the Finance Bill which sets out to implement statutorily the proposals.  The budget set out to do three things.  The first was to help those least able to help themselves, the second was to reduce the current budget deficit, and the third to reduce overall Exchequer borrowing requirements.  As everybody is aware, it is not possible to cut off foreign borrowing in one fell swoop; likewise it is not possible to reduce the current budget deficit within one, two, three or four years without causing very severe distress to those least equipped to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government have set out to prepare for the management of the economy a long-term plan which is necessary if we are to overcome this question of budget deficits and excessive borrowing and the evil that is besetting our society today, the scourge of unemployment. Unemployment is evident to everybody today.  It would be morally wrong for any one of us, no matter which party we belong to, to try to win political points and make political capital out of the problem of unemployment.  Only yesterday thousands of young people commenced their leaving certificate examination and for many of them the future does not look very bright, as it does not look bright for those on the dole at this time.  What <Col N="1510" /> can we do about it?  How are we to bring down unemployment?</P>
    <P>We must accept that many of our problems have been created outside this country and are due to the world recession and we must be willing to accept certain constraints at home.  Employers and business people must realise that returns will not be as large as they would be during a boom period and they must make sacrifices and take a smaller return.  Workers must accept that living standards will not improve at the same level as in recent years and they too must make sacrifices in order to protect their jobs.  There is much talk about reducing overtime working and job sharing and this matter must be seriously examined.  Many people who work a seven-or eight-hour day have the opportunity to work overtime at weekends while others are unable to obtain any jobs.</P>
    <P>Capital investment is vitally important and resources must be concentrated on sustainable projects which will yield worthwhile returns.  Infrastructural facilities are basic to the building up of any society and urgent attention must be given to the improvement of our roads. Juggernauts are tearing up the road surfaces, breaking down bridges and crashing into houses and much of this damage could be avoided by the more extensive use of railways.  The condition of the roads is such that travel from one part of the country to another is very difficult.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy stated last week that the appalling condition of the roads in Youghal has cost Waterford Co-operative something in the region of £9,000 during recent weeks.  Youghal is a most important centre in East Cork but road conditions there are disastrous and traffic cannot travel through the town, I appeal to the Minister for the Environment to look into the matter and to ensure that the roads will be repaired as soon as possible.  The town is also a tourist resort and there will be a great loss to traders during coming months if the work is not completed immediately.</P>
    <P>Telecommunications are also vitally important.  When Deputy Albert Reynolds was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs he made great strides in improving <Col N="1511" /> this area.  There was a slide back during the period of the Coalition Government and I hope that we will soon see a resumption of the growth initiated by the Minister, Deputy Reynolds.  Businessmen must be able to communicate easily if they are to carry on their business efficiently.</P>
    <P>Capital investment is also needed in the fishing industry.  We have many fine harbours but they have not the necessary facilities to enable our fishermen to reap the maximum rewards from the rich seas surrounding us.  Harbours such as Bally-cotton in County Cork do not have facilities for storing fish and the catch must be brought to the market the following day.  However, the size of the catch does not make this an economic proposition and the provision of a refrigeration plant or refrigerated containers would be of great help.</P>
    <P>In the past the IDA concentrated on attracting large foreign industries which would give employment to many people. I feel that they did not give adequate support to small, indigenous businesses which could have been built up over the years.  Throughout the country there are many capable people who have business acumen and ingenuity but who lack capital. If they had been supported by the IDA or some other body they would have been able to give employment to several people, and such businesses tend to last in spite of recessions.  I am glad the IDA have at last realised this and are putting more emphasis on helping these small industries.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see the Minister providing a decent increase for those on social welfare, particularly widows and those receiving invalidity and disability pensions.  There is an outcry against the abuse of social welfare.  This is something which must be closely monitored.  It must be spelled out to those who abuse the system that they are stealing from those of us who are paying high rates of PRSI. They are leeches on society.  We all know people who abuse the system, and it is only when we stand up and are willing to be counted that the widespread abuse will be reduced.  The number of referees <Col N="1512" /> available to deal with abuse should be increased, and this would also help to reduce instances of abuse.</P>
    <P>Many people do not realise that the benefits they receive are paid for by society. Employees contribute 25 per cent, 50 per cent is paid by employers and the balance of 25 per cent is paid by the Exchequer.  The Exchequer has to borrow money in order to pay the balance, and if there was less abuse there would be less borrowing.  This in turn would reduce our deficit.  Until it is accepted that it is the people who pay for these benefits the abuse will not be reduced.</P>
    <P>The rent relief proposal for persons aged 65 and over in respect of private tenancies is welcomed.  Taxation is always a sticky problem.  Nobody likes to pay tax and everyone feels the other person is not paying his fair share.  Since taxation was introduced there has been trouble and hassle about it.  There are people who are not contributing their fair share and this places a great burden on those who are.  The Minister should make an all out effort to catch tax evaders. They are leeches on society and we must squeeze the blood out of them.  As regards tax bands perhaps the Minister might consider having a special band for widows which would be half way between the first and second band, the first £1,500 at 25 per cent.  This would facilitate widows who are still rearing children.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister said he would do away with tax relief on personal loans.  At the time I did not think this was a good proposal and I am glad this was changed.  Many people have to get loans.  They do not use them for luxuries but, for example, to send children to university and so on.  These young people will build our society in the future. If they did not get proper education it would be to the detriment of society. People also get loans to improve their houses, and if the position regarding relief had not been changed many would not bother to improve their homes.  I commend the Minister for changing the position.</P>
    <P>In the budget it was proposed to tax benefits in kind at a high rate.  The figure of 25 per cent to 40 per cent mentioned <Col N="1513" /> was harsh.  I am glad the Minister reconsidered that matter.  In the past many people who had benefits in kind were not taxed on them.  This was wrong.  Corporation tax has been increased from 45 per cent to 50 per cent for a normal sized company and from 35 to 40 per cent for a small company with a low rate for special companies.  The date for payment of tax has been brought forward.  I hope companies will make a profit and so enable them to pay the tax.  I agree with bringing forward the date of payment, but in times of difficult trading there will be liquidity problems.  I hope this will not lead to further closures and unemployment. There is an increase in the interest charged on delayed payments of PRSI and PAYE from 1 1/2 per cent to 2 per cent per month.  This is good because many companies do not pay tax in the relevant period.  They deduct the payments from their employees but do not pay them over for some time.  Rather they tend to retain these moneys for a considerable period, using them to finance their operation while, in the meantime, the Exchequer must borrow abroad.  It is good that these companies be forced to submit these moneys to Revenue at an earlier date.  If not they will then be paying a higher rate of tax than heretofore.</P>
    <P>Turning now to farming, agriculture is still our most important industry.  However, over the past three or four years it has been experiencing considerable difficulty. Farmers' incomes and productivity have fallen.  They have experienced bad winters and summers when conditions were very bad for them generally. Of late I think their position has improved somewhat.  It is essential that agricultural industry does well for the overall good of the country.  Indeed the provision to increase farmers stock relief to 110 per cent is an excellent one because it will act as an incentive for them to build up their stock.  As their stock was reduced over the past couple of years we will have noticed that the meat industry and factories went through lean times.  It is only when farmers increase their stock that meat factories are enabled to work at full production, so employing more people. Farming is now big business.  It is no <Col N="1514" /> longer the thing to give one's farm to Johnny, sending Joe to school and keeping Johnny at home.  Farming business is so large and intricate now that it is necessary that all farmers be trained not only in agriculture but in the business aspects of the industry as well.  The removal of stamp duty for two years on gifts to young farmers is to be welcomed.  It is important that older farmers hand over to their trained sons, nephews or nieces.  It is vital also that we have educated, trained persons in our farming industry.  I note also that the capital acquisitions tax upper limit of £50,000 has been increased to £200,000, which is a special agricultural limit.  This is especially welcome when one remembers that £50,000 was so small in comparison with the price of land in recent years, thereby rendering the relief almost valueless.  Indeed in general the limit of £50,000 should be increased.  That limit was set six or seven years ago and, with inflation, amounts now to very little. Therefore the Minister should consider increasing its upper limit generally.</P>
    <P>The construction industry is most important for our economy overall.  If builders are in trouble then manufacturers, their suppliers, and so on will be affected also; it percolates down the line. I am glad to note that the Minister has made some provision for building up that industry again.  House prices increased enormously between the years 1977 and 1979, one of the main reasons being that building land rose out of all proportion. I am glad to note also that the price of building land is being examined.  There must be some control exercised in order to keep land prices at a respectable limit, thereby rendering house prices reasonable for so many people now seeking houseing. The restoration of the £3,000 new house subsidy for single people is very welcome also.  Anybody who has any connection with the building industry will have realised that its abolition by the Coalition Government considerably reduced the number of single people buying houses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock spoke earlier about private enterprise in this country.  I consider that private enterprise is just as essential as State enterprise.  If our society <Col N="1515" /> becomes a complete social welfare one, a communistic society, then we shall not be worried about the North of Ireland, about the Falklands but rather about how we shall feed ourselves.  That is what has happened in Russia, where moneys are spent on arms rather than on the necessities of life.  I might add that I consider Fianna Fáil to be the workers party and, since 1932, we have been receiving the majority of votes.  One might ask from whom do we receive these votes &mdash; from the workers.  The Fine Gael Party also receive some workers' votes. The Labour party receive votes from workers but I have not yet worked out from whom Sinn Féin the Workers' Party receive theirs.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to refer to the people who founded this State.  They were selfless in their dedication and fight for freedom.  They sacrificed much. Today we should follow their example in the running of our affairs so that we may build up this country into one we shall be happy and proud to pass on to our children without fear for their future whether on the economic, social or political front.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Michael Ahern on his masterly maiden speech.  I made mine here recently and had the unfortunate experience of not knowing how long I had to speak.  However there were some issues raised by Deputy Ahern to which I shall have to take some exception.  That will be in the general context of discussion of the Finance Bill.  I was happy to hear him refer to the difficulties people see in the fact that some people have several jobs while others have none.  It is undoubtedly a feature that some people feel they must supplement their low incomes by holding other jobs or by doing overtime.  This makes a refreshing change from the accusation very often levelled only at married women working.  It is said that it is only married women working who upset the <Col N="1516" /> job market.  Therefore, I was glad to hear Deputy Ahern widening that debate.</P>
      <P>Tax evasion and avoidance have bedevilled this society and the attitude of society towards it.  Deputy Ahern described people who do not pay their taxes as leeches on society from whom the last drop of blood must be squeezed.  That was rather strong language.  We would not need to squeeze blood out of those people: we just need to put them in jail. I do not think any Government here have faced up to the responsibility to demonstrate to those who are paying their taxes that we are serious about penalising those who do not.  However, I draw the line at squeezing blood from them.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill was greeted with a certain amount of tired surprise, if surprise can be tired.  I do not think people seriously thought there would be such major changes between a budget and a Finance Bill.  The fact that the surprise was muted was a demonstration of how low politics has sunk in Ireland, when cynicism about depending on Government measures seems to be everywhere. That lack of surprise about the major changes between the budget and the Finance Bill is a demonstration of the size of the problem facing us on this side of the House, which is the basic one of restoring the good name to politics and the science of financial management.</P>
      <P>There is a very bitter flood of recrimination and bad feeling against politicians in Ireland, and a great part of that stems from the total unreliability of Fianna Fáil Governments in their budgeting and financial planning.  On this side of the House we have a responsibility to stem that flood of recrimination against politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One feature of that bad feeling, of the feeling that reliance cannot be placed on them anymore, is the number of people seriously talking about leaving the country and taking their enterprises and skills with them.   That is a growing feature and it must be deplored.  We must try to restore a concept of partnership between Government and people and between Government and interest groups, instead <Col N="1517" /> of the jousting and deceit that are going on all around.</P>
    <P>Even if this party were to restore the trust and confidence of the people in political parties, the problem of dealing with the country's finances is still vast. The questions are almost too enormous to be contemplated and there is no guarantee that the country can be brought back quickly to an even keel.  A Finance Bill should not raise such fundamental questions but this Bill is such a very special one that it provokes them.</P>
    <P>It is an indication of the barrenness of Fianna Fáil's financial strategy.  It is a valid question whether it is this Finance Bill which caused the outburst of a former Fianna Fáil Tánaiste and Minister for Finance last week.  Was this Bill the last straw in a series of provocations which began with the abandonment of financial planning in December 1979 and culminated once more in the extraordinary wheeling and dealing in the measure before us?  It has a long and undistinguished ancestry of jiggery-pokery in the financial world.  It has been going on since before 1979.</P>
    <P>People are sometimes inclined to label the beginning of our serious financial woes as December 1979.  Of course they really began in 1977 with the publication of some extraordinary plans.  There was a time when the idea of plans and strategy was new here, in the days of T. K. Whitaker and Seán Lemass, and it is a source of great regret to me that Dr. Whitaker is not a Member of the Oireachtas any longer to give us his wise counsel.  In those days when we began serious financial and development planning, we could rely on them; we knew where we were going because the leadership had the courage to stick to that line.</P>
    <P>In 1977 we found ourselves fouled up with plans in the economic period of the present Minister for Education, Deputy O'Donoghue.  Unfortunately, planning then did not have the restraining, practical, non-academic hand of a Dr. Whitaker to keep us all in line.  Now the time has passed for believing that Fianna Fáil will ever produce a financial plan.  In his introduction to this Bill, the Minister for Finance said that the Government's overall <Col N="1518" /> approach to the economy and budgetary and taxation strategy will be contained in a medium-term economic plan now being prepared.  I do not think anybody places much credence on this Government's medium, long or short-term economic plans.  On 25 March we had an economic plan in the budget and we had another one published with the Finance Bill on 3 June.  That is not a very long period for a plan to last.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the outburst of the previous Tánaiste and Minister for Finance was an example of a bitter realisation by someone with little to lose that after all those years the philosophical cupboard is bare for Fianna Fáil.  It has been bare for a long time and Fianna Fáil were particularly shocked when they lost office in 1973.  Any serious political or financial philosophy went out the window in Fianna Fáil's all-out attempt to regain power and to keep it.  That was another milestone in Fianna Fáil's road of arrogance.</P>
    <P>I discussed this Finance Bill with a friend of mine who, despite our friendship, is a Fianna Fáil supporter.  He felt that the Bill is an example of the kind of thinking in Fianna Fáil that anything is all right as long as it keeps Fianna Fáil in Government; that any Government which is not a Fianna Fáil Government get there by some strange aberration, by some slightly undemocratic process, and therefore that it is the divine right and good luck of the Irish people to have Fianna Fáil in government, and anything goes to keep them there.  This was partly exemplified by the assertion of the Taoiseach when he was on this side of the House after June 1981 that it was a quirk of PR and nothing more.</P>
    <P>It is a pity one has to make this kind of introduction to a discussion on a Finance Bill, which should be a serious part of the structure of the financial planning of a progressive Government.  We should not have to discount this Bill as yet another short-term, desperately vote-seeking piece of Fianna Fáil opportunism.  We should be able to debate across the House the merits of a Bill, particularly when the country faces the crisis it faces now.</P>
    <P>The amendment which our party have <Col N="1519" /> tabled to the Bill is not something which was undertaken lightly or in any mischievous or politically opportunist frame of mind.  It is a very carefully worded amendment which states quite clearly the reasons why this party feel we cannot support the Finance Bill, despite the fact that the general public might say: &ldquo;For heaven's sake let us not rock the boat, the country is in a very serious state&rdquo;.  It would be shirking our responsibility if we voted in favour of a Bill which we perceive is grossly irresponsible in order to pour oil on the country's troubled waters. We know why the waters of the country are troubled.  We believe we have a very solemn responsibility to restore the country to responsible Government.</P>
    <P>We state in our amendment that we urge Dáil Éireann to decline to give the Bill a Second reading on two main grounds, social injustice and economic responsibility.  We go on to expand on that.  In the first part of the amendment we discuss the departure of the Finance Bill from the terms of the budget, as outlined by the Minister for Finance in March 1982.  It confers concessions solely on the relatively well-off by not giving any equivalent concessions to the low paid, as was proposed in the family income supplement provisions to the budget presented to the House in January 1982.  As Deputy Bruton said in his opening remarks on this Finance Bill the words &ldquo;relatively well-off&rdquo; in our amendment are important because there are not that many people in the country who are very well off.  There are a great many people &mdash; the number is growing by the day &mdash; who are extremely badly off and who need to be helped, particularly people who are in very low paid employment and who are weighing up in their minds the advantages or disadvantages of staying in their jobs or throwing themselves on to the financial mercy of the State.</P>
    <P>The changes in the Finance Bill do not do anything at all to help the people who are truly at the bottom of the barrel.  This is one of the reasons why we would find it impossible to support it.  It might have been a different matter if the changes in <Col N="1520" /> the Finance Bill had been specifically aimed at helping those in the very poor sections of the community, but this budget sets out to help people who, badly off as they are, are still able to manage, are not in a poverty situation, who still can get by as the majority of people must do in the present economic circumstances without a great deal of hardship.  If the Finance Bill had set out to help the people who are really troubled by poverty and insecurity it might have been a very different kettle of fish.</P>
    <P>Our amendment also refers to the tax provisions to offset the PRSI increases. Of course, PRSI is a great burden for all workers.  The particularly aggravated grievance people feel about the present state of PRSI would not have been felt to such an extent if they were aware that there would be some genuine and far-reaching reforms of the tax system generally, which was undertaken by our party in the January budget.  The lack of such a tax reform system has made people feel quite hopeless about any real changes in what they suspect to be a situation in which they are unfairly caught in paying very high amounts to support the poorer sections in our society. In the absence of any genuine attempt to reform the tax structure it is impossible to go along with the Government's extraordinary decision to find another £45 million out of apparently nowhere to meet a situation which they caused.</P>
    <P>There are other elements touched on in our amendment, such as the payments in advance of the VAT and corporation tax.  That was fairly substantially covered in the debate on the budget and was referred to by other speakers in this debate.  It is obviously a grossly counter-productive and damaging set up for the country at this time.</P>
    <P>Our final reference in our amendment is to the lack of any long term reform of the PAYE system.  We also refer to the Finance Bill's failure to seek other sources of revenue by abandoning any proposal to reduce tax avoidance through discretionary trusts.  It is a very carefully thought out amendment put down with a sense of responsibility to the country. <Col N="1521" /> with a sense that even though the country may be weary of economic and political turbulence, it is nevertheless our duty to oppose this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a most irresponsible measure. When I spoke on the budget debate I was very worried about the very severe duties on people who have company cars. That has been relaxed in the Finance Bill. I also spoke at length on the damaging effects of the short-term capital gains taxes on the Stock Exchange and thereby the flow of funds to Irish industry.  That has been alleviated to some extent.  This stop-go changing system, to put it mildly, causes a lack of confidence in the business community.  The capital gains provision in the budget caused panic among members of the Stock Exchange, who spent an enormous amount of time, which could have been more profitably spent in working for the country, running around, desperately trying to see TDs, issuing press statements, mounting an unprecedented campaign to try to change the course on this tax.  It was changed, but it should not have been there in the first place.</P>
    <P>It was another measure showing lack of thought and economic irresponsibility. It brought home to me the kind of reaction there was to the acceleration of tax on imports and the corporation profits tax.  During the recent by-election in Dublin West, I was working in an area where there are many people who are businessmen and employers, the life blood of the country.  They are people who give employment, and the deeply felt resentment among that section of the community about these taxes had to be seen to be believed.  Whenever I met these people it was not a very difficult canvass because they were quite bitter about the imposition of these taxes.</P>
    <P>While Fianna Fáil and the Minister for Finance seem unable to face up to the responsibilities of Government, young people crowd the pool rooms.  They stun themselves with drugs and with the wilder aberrations of punk and mod and all the other modern trends.  They try to forget what they suspect lies before them.  The tourist industry stagnates as we price ourselves out of the market.  People who ten <Col N="1522" /> years ago felt that a family-run tourist business, a small hotel or restaurant, would be a growing industry find themselves in deep trouble now with very few tourists arriving.  I heard that Aer Lingus have cancelled their usual summer schedule from London to Shannon because of lack of tourists.  Enterprise and management are stifled because of the uncertainty of the financial climate.  Factories and businesses are closing almost daily.</P>
    <P>Another serious aspect of our present problem is that Irish and foreign investors are hesitating before they invest in a country where they cannot rely on proper economic planning.  That is why Fine Gael felt they must put down this amendment to the Finance Bill.  It signals our dissatisfaction and refusal to accept the easy way out.  There are signs that our people know they cannot take the easy way out and that they will support a Government and a party who show them the other options.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Kildare):</i> In welcoming the introduction of the Finance Bill, I would like to think it is an honest attempt to tackle our economic ills and I hope it will be the foundation for better things in the not too distant future.  It would be naive of me to suggest that every Member of this House would agree and support the Bill.  Some will fault it for no good reason execpt political expediency, and others will fault it because it will satisfy different supporters or pressure groups.  But, if they were honest with themselves, they would recognise that the Bill is a step in the right direction.  It will build up confidence which has been sadly lacking since last summer.  It will again show that there is a future for the country.  Before a Government can draw up an economic plan, they must see that the people have confidence in the future and confidence to achieve their own potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Tánaiste's intention to publish a medium term economic plan. There are some areas that are causing grave concern to the people of my constituency and to the country at large, such as the lack of equity in the taxation system, lack of incentive for people to work, unemployment among young people, <Col N="1523" /> and housing.  In relation to the lack of equity in the taxation system &mdash; this is an area where all parties can agree &mdash; it is not something that can be solved overnight. As the Commission on Taxation are deliberating at present, it would not be practical for the Tánaiste to make drastic changes in the present Finance Bill.  However, he is making efforts to ease the burden on the PAYE workers while at the same time seeing that other people who can afford to pay taxes pay a fairer share.  I am glad to see the attempt to stamp out tax avoidance and evasion and to close the loopholes which allow this.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Commission on Taxation have produced their first report.  It would be silly to think that the Minister could reform the whole PAYE system as suggested by the Opposition when the commission have not given their final report.  I hope the report will be forthcoming shortly and that the commission will bear in mind the law of diminishing returns, especially in certain areas of discretionary spending.  In Kildare the racing industry is being hit very severely by a tax on betting of 20 per cent.  The result is that an enormous amount of money is being sent out of the country and the bets are being placed in Northern Ireland and England by telephone. This is a loss of revenue and, if the tax was a little bit more realistic, people would place their bets at home.  It is one of the simple pleasures which many people have and they should be allowed to enjoy it.</P>
    <P>The price of drink is coming to the stage where the law of diminishing returns is also operating.</P>
    <P>I find the lack of incentive to work a very worrying feature.  There are many instances where certain people find it more profitable to draw social welfare payments than to go to work.  We all know the social welfare system is designed to help unfortunate people who are unable to work for one reason or another, because of redundancy or those who just cannot get a job.  This society has an obligation to see that these people are properly looked after and that they <Col N="1524" /> have a proper standard of living, which means that people who have jobs and a secure standard of living have an obligation through taxation to pay for social welfare benefits.  When people who abuse the system can earn more money and have a higher standard of living than those who are working and paying for the system, action should be taken.  Honest, hard-working people are becoming demoralised by the trend and I hope the Government will take the necessary steps to rectify this situation.  These abuses are taking place in several areas, such as doing &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; while drawing social welfare benefits and the three-day week system where people get more money for working a three-day week than if they were working a full week.</P>
    <P>The issuing of doctors' certificates is also questionable, as members of the IMA said recently.  We have a problem in the social welfare area when compared with other developed countries.  An unduly high proportion of our population is either under or over the productive age span.  Of those in the productive age span, 150,000 are unemployed and 300,000 are in the public service.  This means that a small proportion of the population is called upon to support others.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> It would be helpful if I gave the information to the House that on 250 days during each year, that is excluding Sundays and holidays, 50,000 passengers per annum would represent 200 passengers per day. It seemed reasonable to assume that even during peak periods the level would not exceed 600 passengers per day, that is, five or six plane loads.  Even if it is assumed that each passenger would generate one vehicle trip &mdash; that is, using cars rather than buses &mdash; the additional traffic which would be generated would be unlikely to exceed 100 vehicles in a peak hour which is well within the level of spare capacity.  The capacity of the improved section of the N17 is at least 8,000 vehicles per day and it would tolerate up to 1,000 vehicles in a particular <Col N="1530" /> peak hour.  Present traffic volume in the vicinity of the airport site is approximately 1,000 vehicles per day, leaving a high level of spare capacity.  I share the Deputy's view that it will generate a lot of traffic within the area but, given the information available to me.  I am left in no doubt that the road will be able to cope with the situation.  If it is found that the traffic will be greater than that, further improvements will be made if necessary.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> The Deputy implied I was not <i>au fait</i> with the Roscommon situation.  I am now to give him the fullest information I can.  Roscommon County Council wrote to the Department on 22 February 1982 requesting the allocation of a special grant of £30,000 to meet 50 per cent of the cost of installing warning bells and lights on two of the level crossings mentioned.  The balance of the cost was to be met by CIE who would undertake the work.  While a reply has not issued to that request, engineering advice is that the normal method of financing would apply, that is own resources and a block grant contribution by the road authority is appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Transport submitted <Col N="1535" /> draft orders providing for the automation of the level crossings.  For this Departments's observations on 9 November 1979 and 21 February 1980 respectively, these orders are proposed to be made by the Minister for Transport under section 22 of the Transport (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1971, which requires consulation with the Minister for the Environment before the orders are made.  When consulting with this Department the Department of Transport indicated that Roscommon County Council had also been consulted.  This Department considered that, before giving observations on the draft orders, it would be desirable to see the comments of the county council, and the Department of Transport were informed accordingly. The views of the council have not yet been received in this Department.  It has been confirmed by the Department of Transport that orders have not been made in these cases.</P>
    <P>Section 23 of the Transport (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1981, provides that where an order has been made under section 22 of that Act, the relevant road authority shall recoup CIE 50 per cent of the cost incurred by the Department in providing and maintaining any works required by that order.  It should be noted however that where CIE decide on their own initiative to improve a level crossing no cost would fall on the road authority.</P>
    <P>The question of lights and bells at crossings is currently under consideration by a working group consisting of representatives of the Garda, the Department of Transport, CIE and this Department. It is understood from the engineering section that agreement to the general introduction of such crossings is not likely in the immediate future.  In 1969 this Department indicated they had no objection in principle to the provision of lights and bells by CIE at seven locations, including Barrymore.  It is unlikely therefore that this Department would object at this stage to the Barrymore installation but any further extension of these installations should await the outcome of the working groups consideration of these <Col N="1536" /> crossings.  That is as thorough a reply as I can give.</P>

Since 1969 the Department of the Environment and the Department of Transport have been wrangling about this problem with Roscommon County council like a fool in the middle waiting for a reply.  In the meantime nothing has been done to make the level crossing, which is over a public road and owned by a State body, CIE, less dangerous.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> In the period 1974 to 1976 allocations were made from FEOGA to aid 63 public water supply schemes in rural areas.  The relevant regulations required that work on the schemes should commence within two years and be completed within five years.  I am informed that the European Economic Commission is now considering cancellation of the allocations made in respect of 18 schemes which had not commenced when a progress report was submitted last November.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture, as the authority responsible for transmitting claims and supporting documents, has been asked by the Commission for an opinion on the matter.

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I am not aware of any serious or urgent need for an investment of the order of £150 million on the immediate development of essential services in Letterkenny.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that an investment of this order would represent some 7 per cent of the total Public Capital Programme for a town with a population of less than 0.2 per cent of the national population.  I am, of course, fully aware of, and have made adequate provision for, the development needs of Donegal including Letterkenny.</P>
      <P>I have already made an initial allocation of £152,700 to Letterkenny for sanitary services as against £48,000 in 1981 while the corresponding capital allocation to Donegal County Council is £1.781 million as against £1.371 million in 1981. The Letterkenny sewerage scheme, phase 1, commenced in July last and is due for completion by Donegal County Council this year.  Letterkenny Urban District Council's sewerage improvement scheme is also due for completion at a cost of £82,000 this year.  On 29 April I issued sanction to Donegal County Council to a loan of £90,000 for a drainage survey of the River Lennon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>National roads and main roads in the urban district are the responsibility of Donegal County Council to whom I have made allocations for road works totalling £4.9271 million as against £2.898 million and £4.475 million in 1980 and 1981 respectively.  The first stage of the road programme for north Donegal as recommended by consultants is being implemented in full.  In particular allocations made provide for work on the Letterkenny-Derry road and on the Stranorlar-Letterkenny route.  In addition, strengthening works at various locations on the Lifford to Sligo and Donegal to Stranorlar via Letterkenny national primary routes, the provision of road signs on national primary routes and improvement of regional routes are being financed.  Numerous improvement works <Col N="1553" /> are in progress or at planning stage for inter-urban roads.</P>

      <P>At the outset I would like to congratulate Deputy O'Keeffe on his appointment as health spokesman for Fine Gael and to say that I look forward to speaking opposite him in the future.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Private Notice Question, I am aware of the industrial action referred to by the Deputy, which I would point out is unofficial.  The problem at the centre of the dispute is a matter appropriate to the CEO of the Western Health Board and I am satisfied that the CEO has abided by all the proper procedured available to him in a matter like this.  I understand that a temporary injunction has been obtained this morning which has resulted in the pickets being moved from the Western Health Board institutions and I am hopeful that this will enable those staffs who had refused to pass the pickets to return to work.  In the meantime nursing, medical, clerical and administrative staff at the two hospitals affected by the dispute are ensuring that essectial services are maintained and I am satisfied that no hardship is being inflicted on any of the patients in these hospitals.</P>

      <P>Naturally, I would prefer if a dispute did not exist and if the particular incident had not occurred there, but I am satisfied from my inquiries that the health and safety of the patients are quite assured in the present circumstances. Needless to say, I would certainly hope that the normal procedures will be resorted to, and I understand the union would also like to see those procedures adopted so that that the services can be totally restored at the earliest possible time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this is a case in which a member of the staff is alleged to have physically assaulted his supervisor.  The normal procedure has been adopted in this case whereby the member of the staff was suspended and given a written notice of his suspension and given seven days within which to answer the charges which were made.  In the meantime a full investigation is proceeding under the normal procedures and my Department are keeping in very close contact with that investigation.  As I mentioned in my initial reply, the temporary injunction has been granted to the Western Health Board and it is to be hoped that the staff will return to work then and allow the procedures to continue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I will.  I might add that the pickets have been withdrawn since the temporary injunction was obtained.  I certainly will be very anxious <Col N="1561" /> that the matter would be resolved as early as possible and through my officials I will be keeping in constant contact with the situation.</P>

    <P>The Government believe that it is necessary now more than ever in these difficult times for our economy that the operations of companies in the public sector should be looked at objectively and critically by the elected representatives of the real shareholders, the Irish public.  This necessary scrutiny will, I am <Col N="1596" /> sure, be undertaken, as in the past, in a constructive and understanding spirit.</P>
    <P>The boards, executives and employees of the commercial bodies will now be familiar with the work of the joint committee and will, I feel confident, accept that the efforts of the committee are bent in the same direction as their own: towards an effective, efficient, employment-generating public sector. Indeed the dialogue between representatives of State bodies and members of the committee may be seen as affording those bodies a unique opportunity to explain their operations and problems to public representatives in a public forum in a far more direct and forceful way than is possible in the cold prose and statistical columns of an annual report.</P>
    <P>This in turn makes possible more informed public discussion and debate which should help to avert the negative effect on morale within public bodies of ill-informed criticism.  Too often, perhaps, it is forgotten that some State-sponsored bodies which we classify as commercial are required nevertheless to provide services which a private company would close down as unprofitable.  Due regard must be had to this social element in the operations of certain bodies and the studies by the joint committee should help to highlight cases where unprofitability is genuinely a result of providing socially essential services.</P>
    <P>On the other occasions on which motions have been debated to establish the joint committee, my predecessors have taken the opportunity to pay tribute to the enormous contribution which has been made by the various State-sponsored bodies over the years.  In doing likewise, I hope that I will not be accused of merely observing a ritual.  Over the half century and more since the first State-sponsored bodies were founded, State enterprise has spread into many sectors and manifested itself in many forms.  A strong State sector has undoubtedly contributed to stability both in terms of employment and output.  The Government recognise the importance of this contribution to our national well being which comes about through the dedication of the many able men and women <Col N="1597" /> who serve in the State sector.  Some of the bodies in which they work are very much in the public eye, others &mdash; some of them notable success stories &mdash; are less well known.  Perhaps the work of the joint committee will in time rectify the position in relation to these.  Where faults are found, as they are bound to be, it is ultimately in the interest of all that these be recognised and put right.</P>
    <P>The only changes proposed from the previous Orders of Reference are to the Schedules listing the bodies to be examined: a new body, the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, has been included for the first time and Gaeltarra Éireann has been replaced by Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Because of major changes in their role in recent years arising from a ruling by the European Court, the Pigs and Bacon Commission cannot as matters stand be regarded as a commercial State-sponsored body, and for this reason has been deleted from the schedule.</P>
    <P>I will not take up much more of the House's time.  The motion would essentially restore the position which existed in relation to the joint committee before the dissolution of the 21st Dáil.  The matter has, therefore, been the subject of debate and discussion in both Houses on a number of occasions in the past and I believe that there is a broad consensus favourable to the continuance of the committee's work.  This is as it should be for, irrespective of our party allegiances or independence of such allegiance, we are all parliamentarians committed to the strengthening of parliamentary institutions. The joint committee was first established to fill a gap in the relationship of a part of the public service to the Oireachtas and, as I said in my opening remarks, it has been a notably successful innovation.  We should now take the necessary steps to allow the committee to get on with its work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Before Schedule A to add the following paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(10) That the Joint Committee may in any report request either <Col N="1598" /> House of the Oireachtas to debate the contents of such report.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and to add to Schedule A:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Industrial Development Authority&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of this motion to re-establish the joint committee.  As the Minister points out, the work of the committee made heavy demands on the time of Members and I speak from personal experience in this regard, although I was in the other House at the time and demands on Members of that House are not as heavy as demands on Members of this House.</P>
    <P>I should like at the outset to pay tribute to the chairman of the committee, Senator Eoin Ryan.  The way in which he conducted the business of the committee was a major factor in their being able to get through such an amount of work.  His wisdom and perspicacity at all times and on many difficult and sensitive occasions was quite outstanding.  I should also like to pay tribute to the staff of the committee, the clerk and the permanent consultant whose work was outstanding.  In addition, the committee from time to time had the valuable assistance of outside consultants on a contract basis and invariably the committee were well served.  I should like to record the committee's appreciation of that work.</P>
    <P>When the committee were first established there was some apprehension in the minds of the chairmen and executives of State-sponsored bodies as to how the committee would operate and whether it would turn out to be some sort of witchhunt. At this stage I can say confidently that those apprehensions were very quickly removed and there was a very harmonious and co-operative relationship between the committee and any State-sponsored company which came before them.  The committee reported on 18 companies and, having regard to the fact that some of those are large and complex companies such as CIE, Aer Lingus and NET, the House will understand that the committee get through quite an amount of work.</P>
    <P>The inspiration for the setting up of the <Col N="1599" /> Committee came from the frustration over the years in this and the other House at the lack of contact or control by Parliament over these bodies who are funded by public moneys but not directly accountable to the source of that funding. The practice had grown up &mdash; properly, too, I suppose &mdash; that Ministers when asked questions about the operations of a State-sponsored company indicated that they did not have responsibility for the day-to-day operations of these companies. That convention had been expanded to avoid answering questions even on the general principles behind the operations of these companies.  This was a perfectly understandable stance but it left a gap in the relationship between the Oireachtas and the companies and the committee was seen as providing the necessary link between the Oireachtas and the people spending Oireachtas funds or controlling Oireachtas property.</P>
    <P>The full potential of the committee in closing that gap was not realised because their reports were not debated in this House or debated sufficiently in the other House.  Towards the end of the life of the committee, the other House adopted a Standing Order which enabled it on being requested by the committee to give time for a debate on the report.  Two or three debates took place in the other House. No such debate took place in this House and there is little point in having a committee which is to bridge the gap between this House and State-sponsored bodies unless the activities and fruit of the work of the committee is debated in a real way and attention paid to it.  It was frustrating for members of the committee.  I am sure former members of the committee will agree with me that there was a feeling of operating in a vacuum when all the long sessions with companies and long preparation and drafting sessions were ignored by the main House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I put down the amendment seeking to have it written into the motion setting up the committee that the committee would have specific power to request a debate in either House of the Oireachtas.  The committee cannot direct either House to amend or provide <Col N="1600" /> in Standing Orders for that debate but one assumes that such a change in Standing Orders would follow automatically so that a request of the House's own committee could be complied with in this area.  It is an important step that must be taken.</P>
    <P>The amendment also seeks to include the Industrial Development Authority within the ambit of the committee.  They were excluded originally because there was room for argument as to whether they were trading or commercial.  They are spending enough taxpayer's money and in so far as the rationale for the committee was to provide the Oireachtas with a function to oversee the final destination of that money, they should be included.  At the present time, when their activities are the subject of an outside consultancy report and when they are coming more and more into the public eye, it is important that they be included within the ambit of the committee.  I ask the Minister to agree that they should be added to the list of bodies which can be reviewed by the committee.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for introducing the motion to reconstitute the committee. I welcome it and hope the Minister will be able to implement the changes I suggest, namely, have a debate in the House after the committee reports and include the IDA among the bodies to be examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Cooney's amendment.  I welcome the decision to re-establish this committee.  It has been far too long since the committee operated.  The fact that it is almost a year since it has been in operation is regrettable. I know circumstances were abnormal given that we have had two general elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between 1978 and 1981 the committee produced 18 reports.  I was not a Member of the House during the lifetime of that committee but I was impressed to see from the reports the extent to which the activities of the companies were delved into.  The work of the members was thankless and generally unpublicised.  It reflects great credit on those who worked so hard.  On reading through the reports <Col N="1601" /> one must be impressed by the work of two members, Senator Ryan, who was chairman, and Deputy Cooney.  One must include the secretariat in the tributes on the performance of the committee.</P>
    <P>I was not aware until recently that there was an amendment.  The amendment gets to the nub of the problem which is the lack of effectiveness of the committee to date.  I believe that because there was not sufficient publicity not enough attention was paid to the important nature of the work done by the committee. I strongly support the first part of the amendment.</P>
    <P>There are other ways in which the committee can be effective.  I should like to ask the incoming committee why it should confine its investigation to semi-State bodies engaged in trading activities. There are many other State-sponsored bodies, some 123 of them, all in receipt of State funds.  They all exist as a result of some policy decision.  If we turn the spotlight of investigation on some of them, we may find that they serve no real purpose today and might be amalgmated elsewhere or go out of existence.  In this area of high public expenditure, it would be no harm if Parliament could carry out the odd lightning raid into the activities of State-sponsored bodies.  A frequent review of their work could be useful and might result in some bodies being wound up.  Why not?  There is not much point in having them if the original purpose for which they were created is no longer relevant. They drain away valuable State resources.</P>
    <P>I take the Minister's point about the spirit in which the committee was set up. It is to help State-sponsored bodies and see that they operate for the public good. It is not to carry out a witchhunt against them but rather to help them.  The committee might look into the working of the Arts Council, AnCO, Bord na Gaeilge, Córas Tráchtála, the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies and so on.  Is it proper that the State should treat this institute as a State-sponsored body?  Could it be amalgamated with some other area of higher education?  These are questions to which the House could turn its attention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1602" /> I should like to see the committee widening its terms of reference.  This would mean having a bigger committee and would also mean having a greater secretarial service and backup resources. However, it would be worth while, as it would strengthen the principle of parliamentary accountability.  It would strengthen the powers and responsibility of the House.</P>
    <P>Health boards could also be included as they are great spenders of taxpayers' money.  Many Members are uneasy about the huge amounts of money they spend at present.  I ask the new committee to insist that State-sponsored bodies adopt some uniform accounting procedures for their annual reports.  There is too great a variation at present and we cannot avoid the impression that some reports are designed to conceal rather than reveal the true state of things.  The committee should insist on greater frankness about how the bodies treat each other.  Who knows the true relationship between the ESB, An Bord Gáis, the Irish National Petroleum Company and Bord na Móna? There is a merry-go-round situation with the reality concealed from all but the trained eye.  I should like to see the committee move away from the specific details of individual companies and examine the whole philosophy behind State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>Since the establishment of the Electricity Supply Board in 1927 State-sponsored bodies have been a most important part of our public life.  We are all very proud of the innovation they represent in this country, an innovation which has been copied in many other countries.  But the very fact that we are so involved means that perhaps at times we have not examined the fundamental principles underlying State-sponsored bodies.  I hope that the new committee will take time off from details to ascertain whether State-sponsored bodies constitute the best method of achieving a specific purpose.  For example, they might examine the whole concept of what is meant by efficiency, fair returns and social responsibility in these State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>If I may revert to the principle involved <Col N="1603" /> in the setting up of this committee, I should say that I see this as an extension of the whole principle of public accountability, an extension I should like to see carried into other areas of the work of this House and indeed the Seanad.  For example, I should like to see similar committees set up to examine some of the Estimates, to scrutinise them in a calm, detailed manner rather than having the farcical gallop through of millions of pounds of Estimates at the tail end of a session, as we are now doing.  I hope that this Dáil, if it lasts long enough &mdash; a question on which we all have doubts &mdash; will turn its attention to the major problem of reforming its structures in this way.</P>
    <P>On a practical note might I recommend to the new committee that they begin their work by turning their attention to Údarás na Gaeltachta, a most important State-sponsored body and one over which a great cloud hangs at present.  I do not know whether the allegations made against them are true or false.  This would be a very useful role for this new committee and a very appropriate place for such investigation to be carried out. I hope the committee will undertake an immediate investigation into the activities of Údarás na Gaeltachta so that whatever doubts exist may be dispelled or allegations proved or disproved as the case may be.</P>
    <P>The new committee might also consider the idea of having its chairman drawn from the Opposition parties.  I am not in this respect casting any aspersions on the quality of chairmanship of Senator Eoin Ryan, which I believe was impeccable and above approach.  But it might be no harm that the principle applicable to the Committee of Public Accounts &mdash; that of appointing an Opposition chairman &mdash; be that adopted in respect of this committee.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to establish this committee and strongly support the two amendments of Deputies Cooney and Deasy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Power) Patrick Power">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Cooney and Manning for <Col N="1604" /> their contributions.  I am aware of the sterling work done by the chairman, Senator Eoin Ryan and Deputy Cooney.  I should like to join them in tributes to the staff involved in the work on that committee. I must say that any committee of the House with which I have been associated has received the same attention from staff.  The comments here today indicate a great degree of party co-operation in the work of the committee.  I am sure that when the committee was first established we all shared the feelings expressed by Deputy Cooney that there was a degree of apprehension felt among the bodies likely to be investigated.  It cannot be said that a witch hunt of any kind was pursued but rather definite good work on behalf of the public.  I think it can be said that it proved to be an effective committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with the amendment put down by Deputies Cooney and Deasy to the effect that the Joint Committee may in any report request either House of the Oireachtas to debate the contents of such report.  We should realise the thinking that went into the setting up of that committee.  I am sure it was realised that this House could not afford the time to deal with matters such as this. The committee system was introduced to save the time of the House, to enable in-depth discussion to take place and examinations of such bodies be carried out.  If we reach the stage where joint committees would refer their reports back to the House to be discussed, I believe it would defeat the very purpose for which these committees were set up. Also we would then have reached the stage at which the parent body, which is the House, having set up a sub-committee to report back to it, would receive a request from that minor body to have their work discussed in the House.  That to me would smack somewhat of our allowing the tail to wag the dog.  As matters stand at present any Member of the House can put down a motion to have the report of the committee, which must be laid before the House, discussed in the House in his own time.  I hope the Deputies will not feel this is an attempt to cover up anything.  My thinking is that committees <Col N="1605" /> were intended to make time and, if this motion were accepted, it would have the opposite effect because we would then have lots of work done at committees pushed back into this House. As far as committees are concerned, we are at an infant stage.  Indeed, I might add that other committees which I hope will be set up might adopt the same attitude. For instance, the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the Euro pean Communities could well ask that their reports be pursued in the House.  I think that would not be very effective.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that the Industrial Development Authority be added to Schedule A, I should say that they are not a commercial body and do not come under the terms of reference of this motion.  There is nothing to prevent the Minister, if he wishes, from having a name added later on.  If we decide that non-commercial or semi-State should be added later, that can be done.  My suggestion is that at least we allow the present committee to come into existence and see how they work before deciding to load any more onto any other committees.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manning mentioned that he was not too happy at the fact that the committee had not met for almost a year. The Deputy cannot really blame us for that.  There was opportunity afforded during the term of office of the previous Government for seven or eight months. We do not accept any blame for the fact that that committee was not reconstituted. We have acted reasonably quickly. We resumed office in March only, we are now mid-way through June and the fact that this committee is being reconstituted is an indication of the serious view we take of it.  I am sure Deputies will appreciate that it is not a standing committee of either House of the Oireachtas, that it is not automatically re-established and that there must be a motion put down for its re-establishment.  We are intent on so doing.</P>
    <P>The question raised about the re-establishment of a joint committee of the Oireachtas on non-commercial State-sponsored bodies is being investigated. <Col N="1606" /> Such a committee was not established during the term of office of the 22nd Dáil. Indeed, the committee we are seeking to establish today, in its present form, was not re-constituted in its present form during the term of office of the previous Dáil.  I would appeal to members to allow us to get the joint committee on commercial State-sponsored bodies off the ground immediately and then allow us to examine the non-commercial one. Údarás Na Gaeltachta has been added in place of Gaeltara Éireann.  There was the suggestion of Deputy Manning, which we shall bear in mind, that Údáras Na Gaeltachta may be the first body to come under the scrutiny of the new committee. B'fhéidir gur féidir linn a rá, &ldquo;Tosach maith leath na hoibre&rdquo;.  Although he did dilute his remarks later, Deputy Manning mentioned the doubts and allegations about Údáras Na Gaeltachta.  I hope the Deputy is not pre-judging the situation before the committee attempts to examine in depth the affairs of Údarás Na Gaeltachta.</P>

    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give the Bill a Second Reading on the grounds of social justice and economic responsibility, and in particular because&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>(a)</i> in departing significantly from the terms of the Budget as outlined in the Financial Statement by the Minister for Finance in March, 1982, it confers concessions solely on the relatively well off, while giving no equivalent concessions to the low-paid as was proposed in the Family Income Supplement provisions of the Budget presented to the House in January, 1982,</P>
    <P>
      <i>(b)</i> in granting concessions in regard to P.R.S.I., it does so in such a way as to give maximum benefit to the wellpaid, and little or no benefit to the low paid,</P>
    <P>
      <i>(c)</i> it aggravates national economic difficulties by measures, in regard to payments in advance of Value-Added Tax and Corporation Tax, which will cause losses of jobs in many vulnerable businesses, and will worsen the national budgetary situation for 1983 by using up revenue that would otherwise be available in that year, and</P>
    <P>
      <i>(d)</i> it does not provide for any long-term reform of the P.A.Y.E. system as was contained in the proposal for the introduction of a system of tax credits in the January Budget, while it fails to seek other sources of revenue <Col N="1608" /> by abandoning any proposals to reduce tax avoidance through discretionary trusts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&mdash;(Deputy J. Bruton)  </P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-KE" hpid="Mr. Brady (Kildare) Mr. Brady (Kildare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Kildare):</i> Before the adjournment for Question Time I said that the Finance Bill is the base on which we can build a better future for the country and for our people.  Possibly, it will alleviate certain ills which are bothering many people at the moment, particularly the lack of incentive to work, unemployment and the inequities in the taxation system.  I said earlier that we have a particular problem in relation to social welfare. Compared with other developing countries Ireland has an unduly high proportion of its population either under or over the productive age span, and of those in the productive age span, 150,000 are unemployed and almost 300,000 are in the public service.  This means that a small proportion of the population is called on to support the others.  For that reason the special tax free allowance of £312 to people who pay full PRSI rates will narrow the gap between employers in and outside the public service.  That is a welcome step.</P>
      <P>The most worrying aspect about unemployment is the number of young people who are not working.  The highest proportion of the unemployed are young people, and we have 42,000 people sitting for leaving certificates of whom 30,000 will be coming on the job market and 25 per cent will go on to third level education. Those young people are educated, willing to work and to play their parts for a better future here and every effort to provide jobs for them should be encouraged. Efforts made by the Tánaiste and the Government should be applauded, whether it be employment incentive schemes, work experience programmes or youth employment schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we do not provide jobs for our young people I shudder to think of the consequences in five or ten years.  The majority of our people appreciate the problems youth unemployment can cause.  Apart from the demoralising effect on the young people, it gives rise to crime, vandalism, <Col N="1609" /> drug taking and many other ills. Therefore, all responsible people will welcome the 1 per cent element in PRSI because it will help to reduce the number of unemployed young people in particular.</P>
    <P>We all agree that successive policies to combat unemployment depend to a considerable extent on active co-operation between workers, employers and the Government, and we should try to achieve sustained non-inflationary growth as a basis for returning to full employment.  We should try to achieve labour market flexibility in the light of rapid changes in technological areas, and the more equitable distribution of employment opportunities.  We might also look at the possibility of redistributing working time without increasing production costs thereby.  We hope the Finance Bill will help to reduce unemployment and the problems caused by it.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is in order to refer to housing and to loans to provide houses for our people.  Lack of housing is a terrible problem, and the provision of loans is very important, particularly for those who want to build their own houses.  I am glad to see the restoration of the £1,000 grants and the mortgage subsidies for single people.  That will have a spin-off effect which will help the building industry.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Housing Finance Agency loans, I hope the Minister concerned will modify the scheme because it will pose problems for young people.  The memorandum on it is anything but good. It does not mention any of the problems that the loan can cause because after five to eight years young people will not be able to buy secondhand houses or bigger type houses, and this will mean problems for the building industry.  Therefore we should advise the use of these loans with caution.  In supporting the Finance Bill I regard it as a positive step towards solving our problems and bringing confidence back to the private sector which is imperative if we are to realise the potential we know we have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>In my short time in politics I have not seen a Finance Bill <Col N="1610" /> introduced in a time of greater economic uncertainty.  I can go back four or five years and I think this Finance Bill is before us at a time of the greatest instability. Therefore, in the next few minutes I will try to pinpoint why this great uncertainty exists.</P>
      <P>Everywhere you go these days, it does not matter which sphere or profession you are in, you meet uncertainty.  The people seem to have their own expert views on why this should be.  They blame inflation, crippling interest rates and a spiralling unemployment rate.  We also have grave worker dissatisfaction.  It seems to me there is great sectional bitterness. Particularly in the past two years, it has appeared that sectional interests are getting greedier by the hour. Factories are being closed at an unprecedented rate and we have the farming community, including agricultural workers, virtually on their knees because of crippling repayments and low incomes.</P>
      <P>It is against that uncertain background that we are discussing the Finance Bill. What relevance has this Bill to the problems I have outlined?  Can we say this Bill will bring any hope, joy or comfort to an unemployed father of a large family, to a farmer who has over-borrowed, to a hard-pressed PAYE worker, to the mother of a young family or to the thousands of young people taking their leaving certificates?  Can we say the Finance Bill will bring a glow of joy to local authorities because they will get more money into the coffers?  Will this Finance Bill solve the financial problems, or go part of the way to doing so, of local authorities in any part of the country, bar one in a certain part of Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot say, having seen the budget or the Finance Bill, that local authorities will be able to build more or better roads, that group water schemes will be initiated or even that council employees can look forward to a full year of employment.  Most important of all, will this Bill give people the will to work, a most important factor in social recovery anywhere?  Will it give back to Irish people their reputation for giving an honest day's work for an honest day's pay? Will it create a genuine redistribution of <Col N="1611" /> wealth between the haves and the have nots?  Will this Finance Bill change the social welfare system whereby a man who works for three days a week and draws the dole for the remainder of the week is far better off in the end than the man who works a full week?  We know, listening to Deputy Brady a few moments ago and other speakers over the last few months on all sides of the House, that this particular thing is wrong.  We have the problem pinpointed but we do not seem to be able to tackle it.  The man who has to go out to work for five or six days a week cannot be too happy with his neighbour who has more money at the end of the week for doing half as much work.  Would it not be the normal thing for the Government of the day to ensure that this loophole is closed?  We seem, for some strange reason to shy away from this problem.  The previous Government tried to close that loophole, but we know the result of the election.  It appeared in the run-up to the general election that Fianna Fáil would drop the particular provision we had.  If we are serious about the recovery of our economy it is points like that that should be acted on.</P>
    <P>I believe the Finance Bill we are discussing will not give the type of commitment, comfort and future we would like. I vividly remember, on the night the previous Dáil was dissolved, that the Taoiseach, who was then Leader of the Opposition, told the nation he was prepared to lead a Government who would be a strong Government, that they would go ahead with the policies which are necessary to steer the nation away from national bankruptcy.  I remember on that occasion and in the following weeks there was a lot of talk about the budget deficit and that, basically, the intention of the then Leader of the Opposition was to ensure there was no slippage from the type of deficit the Coalition Government were budgeting for.  Fianna Fáil proposed to restore credibility to politics, industry, agriculture and tourism.</P>
    <P>It is difficult at the best of times to do this type of thing.  I want to place it on the record that I do not believe it is <Col N="1612" /> something which can be done by anyone overnight.  It is important to make a genuine start in the right direction.  However, the Government, with the budget and the Finance Bill we are now discussing, have done exactly what the last Fianna Fáil Government did as well.  It appears to me that it is popularity at all costs and the acid test appears to be that it is not exactly what is done but what is seen to be done that counts, so long as whatever measures being brought in are greeted in a popular way.  Every sensible person in the country knows that it is the Government's job to legislate for the common good and that this can be introduced by checks and balances that are deemed necessary at the time.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is any sense of balance in the Finance Bill as there was not in the previous Fianna Fáil Administration. I assumed the Government would hold the line on the budget deficit. It was evident in the television chat shows leading up to the election that this was something both Administrations had almost in common with each other.  It appeared that a certain level of deficit for the 1982-83 period was justifiable and anything above that would not be in the national interest.  I believed at the time that the then Leader of the Opposition and his party would have stuck to that line.  However, it was not until the Finance Bill was published that the same old story was seen to be on the rounds again.  Fianna Fáil gave a commitment to the electorate that they would carry out certain things which were absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>When the PRSI contributions were increased there was naturally an outcry from a lot of people who were finding it very difficult to live.  The answer Fianna Fáil had, within a few days of any type of opposition to this on the street, was a £45 million subsidy against this cost.  That brought relief to a lot of people but it did not answer the question where we will get the money from.  I have listened attentively to a number of speakers on this Bill and during the budget debate but I am unaware of where that £45 million will come from.  Where will it be levied?  Will we borrow that again?  This is the question <Col N="1613" /> a lot of people in the Dublin West constituency answered in a very positive way.  Most of them were net beneficiaries under the £45 million.  Anybody who gets relief will be thankful for it, but it is true to say that people realise we are in a very bad financial mess and, no matter what Government are in power, if they decide to give relief they must be absolutely clear and spell out for the electorate where they will get the money.</P>
    <P>It appears that the philosophy of this Government, as was the case with the previous Fianna Fáil Government, is to plan one thing and execute another.  This is very dangerous because at best it can be seen as a cynical exercise.  Look at the Gregory deal.  This was something on which the Taoiseach and a few of his supporters spent weeks pleading and playing a cat and mouse game with an Independent Deputy up and down the backstreets of Dublin until finally a certain deal was made.  As far as the inner city of Dublin is concerned I am sure that any money spent on it is money well spent.  I accept that it is past time something was done about it.</P>
    <P>I was a member of a deputation from Galway County Council, who have very serious problems with finance, and we were told that there was nothing that could alleviate our problems.  It appears, whether one is a Fianna Fáil TD or a Fine Gael TD, that the Government's distribution of the resources is not fair because we are not getting our share of the cake. I assume most of the other 27 county councils in Ireland are thinking on the same lines.  I believe that makes for poor government.  It certainly makes a very bad headline.  I cannot understand in a party like the Government party, who have always boasted they have a crosssection of people in their party, how that would be allowed to happen because you cannot decide, for one reason or another, to pump the entire resources of a year into one area.  It is very important that the redistribution of the resources should equalise the imbalance that is obvious because of this Bill.  Deputy Brady mentioned the importance of paying ioans to single people.  I agree with that.  I never believed that this should have been withdrawn <Col N="1614" /> by the previous Government and I said so publicly on a number of occasions. However, now that single people are entitled to loans, the money is running out.  In the county council with which I deal, if applications are to be met in a reasonable way we will have many problems before the end of the year.  I would have thought that if we change the structures whereby single people were entitled to local authority loans, the necessary, vital and important aspect would be to match it with extra finance.</P>
    <P>Contributory and non-contributory old age pensioners over the age of 66 will now automatically qualify for medical cards.  This is to be welcomed, but as far as I am aware, only £2 million have been allocated for it.  This means there will be a huge shortfall at the end of the year in so far as this matter is concerned.</P>
    <P>One of the most disturbing aspects of the Finance Bill was the decision by the Government to impose VAT at the point of importation of goods.  People involved in industry say this is the most severe measure which has been introduced for a long time.  The tragedy is that it is hitting our importers and industralists on a very wide range of products.  By virtue of the fact that we are getting this VAT six months earlier than we would normally the Government will collect additional revenue as planned.  You do not have to be an expert to know that when the first six months period is up, VAT will only come into the same degree and at the same speed as it would normally come. This should be spelled out in great detail. The VAT on point of importation will be paid only once.  We brought forward a colossal sum of money on the basis that it would be forthcoming all the time.  It will not.  It is directly related to the amount of imports at all times but this year we are getting it six to 12 months earlier.  What will we do next year?  Will we have to borrow it?  When we try to balance our books there will be a huge shortfall.  I hoped that this type of under-the-counter accountancy would not have been brought into Government. I firmly believed that a genuine attempt would be made to cure our economic ills. Much had been made of some of the <Col N="1615" /> provisions of the Coalition Government and there was a hue and cry about VAT on footwear and clothes.  No one would like to pay that but who knows over the next six months what every citizen will be asked to pay?  If there is a dramatic slippage in the budget deficit &mdash; and some people say we have come to it already &mdash; when the books are calculated at the end of the year we might be facing the same problems we faced 12 months ago. We will then have nothing to fall back on and that is why I have grave misgivings about this Bill.  It has not, cannot and will not solve the problems.</P>
    <P>If we look at agriculture, one sees that the Government have divorced themselves from the problems that have beset our farmers.  No other section of the community suffered as much in the last three years.  Their incomes halved but, unfortunately, many farmers borrowed very heavily and found they had not enough money to live on if they were to honour their commitments and repayments to the ACC and the banks.  It was accepted that something would have to be done and Deputy Dukes and Deputy D'Arcy spent long hours trying to negotiate a deal whereby a rescue package would be put together to help farmers.  They met with opposition and I assume the present Minister is also meeting opposition.  This was really a three-concerned contest between the Government, the Department of Agriculture and the banks. Everybody came out well from the deal except the farmers.  When the rescue package was finally announced it appeared that the banks won the day and that their interests were very well protected. I am very disappointed at the progress which has been made by all the rescue agencies in so far as they relate to agriculture.</P>
    <P>The House should note the interest subsidies schemes that are being currently implemented.  If this subsidy is not given quickly to farmers, at the end of the year the 5 per cent national interest subsidy will be of little use to anybody.  I cannot understand why farmers will not benefit from this immediately.  I understand <Col N="1616" /> that there are very stringent qualifications&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I cannot see the relevance.  With the exception of someone making a maiden speech I have been at pains to remind Deputies that we are required to discuss the taxation measures which are proposed in the Bill or to suggest others that might be in the Bill. The Chair has given the opportunity to people to establish the base from which they can move into this area but I ask the Deputy to concentrate more on the actual provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the subsidy scheme will be paid quickly.  At this stage I wish to deal with the provision regarding stamp duty.  A problem seems to have arisen here in that a certain category of young farmers will be exempt from the stamp duty arrangements that existed heretofore.  Basically that meant that transfer of a family farm from a parent to a son or daughter qualified for 1 per cent stamp duty but in its own way this has contributed to many problems over the years regarding the inheritance of Irish farms.  The former Government proposed that a certain type of farmer should be eligible for a free transfer and I still think that was a good proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Finance Bill there are three categories of farmers to whom the provision will apply.  The first category concerns the son or daughter who must be under 35 years of age.  The second provision is that they have some recognised agricultural college training, whether they be a degree-or diploma-holder in agriculture, whether they have completed the 100-hours EEC course in agriculture or have some certificate from a committee of agriculture or the CAO that they had completed some course.  I should like to <Col N="1617" /> see that provision extended.  If a farmer has spent a number of years in a responsible position in Macra Na Feirme or if he ran a good farming operation with his father, I believe he should qualify.  One could argue that certain people could be highly qualified technically, might even have a degree in agriculture, but that would not mean that they were good farmers.  Account must be taken of the ability of the farmer to make a decent living on the farm for himself and his family.  It might be argued in certain parts of the west that the limit of 35 years is too low, that where there is late inheritance a farmer aged 40 would be regarded as a young farmer.  It might be said that to extend the age limit to 40 years would help the process of inheritance.</P>
    <P>There is one worrying aspect about the stamp duty proposal in that transfers from father to son will be at the rate of 3 per cent and not 1 per cent as heretofore. This will create many problems for farming families.  If one takes land values, even at their present depressed level, at £1,000 per acre and if one takes the example of a farm of 50 acres, under the 1 per cent levy the amount would be £500 but when this Bill becomes law it will be £1,500.  On next Stage I hope we will take a closer look at this provision.  It is well known that were it not for the qualifying age limit of 66 years for an old age pension there would be very little inheritance or transfer of land from father to son. There will be little progress on any farm unless the young people on the farm are given the necessary authority and responsibility to manage it.  Vitality and youth are important and I am afraid that this particular aspect of the Bill will do more harm than good.  I agree that many young farmers will benefit but I still ask that the 3 per cent figure be considered again as it will penalise unduly many families.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not go any way towards solving the huge problems that have been referred to by speakers in this debate.  It will not motivate Irish people in the way that is needed.  The trends evident in the Finance Bill are not trends I like to see. I am deeply disappointed at the situations that have developed which have led us into our present position.  We are not sure <Col N="1618" /> about the amount of the budget deficit. This Finance Bill will not encourage people to believe that this is a good country in which to live.  It will not encourage them to believe we are striving for youth employment and that we are prepared to redistribute what we have to ensure that others get a reasonable bite of the cherry. I hope to have more to say on the Bill on Committee Stage.  This Bill is not acceptable to the House and that is why we have tabled our amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedBrennan" hpid="Mr. N. Brennan Mr. N. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall make my comments under three headings: the economic climate, the proposals for investment in central Dublin and the question of tax reform.  This Bill is about the creation of confidence in the business community, among the young and in society as a whole.  This State was founded on the philosophy of self-reliance, on Sinn Féin, but it is now in danger of foundering on the rocks of cynicism, selfishness and pessimism.  Pessimism about our ability to tackle our problems is rife.  Economic commentators and journalists, and politicans on the other side of the House thrive on it.  Whoever, in the 19th century, christened economics as the dismal science must have known Deputies FitzGerald and Bruton in another life.  I have heard more doom and gloom preached in the last year than at any time since 1957 when Deputy Bruton was in short trousers and a previous Coalition despaired of their ability to solve the country's problems and adopted draconian measures to get the books right. Fianna Fáil got the country out of that crisis.  They had to restore confidence again in the mid-seventies after another Coalition had lost their way.  Incidentially, the EEC economic and political commentators who write about our 1977 manifesto have conveniently forgotten the times in which it was written, the failures of the Coalition Government of the time, the despair of the business community, the flight of capital and the radical turnaround of fortunes which occurred immediately on Fianna Fáil's return to office.  There was rapid growth for two years which was only halted by <Col N="1619" /> the onset of the international recession which, alas, is still with us.</P>
      <P>But while there are problems in the economy it is not right that a Government, in trying to solve them, should sow doubts about the viability of the economy or the currency or our national capacity to provide our own solutions to our own problems.  This, the last and thankfully short-lived Government, did to such a degree that initiative and enterprise were discouraged and national confidence was damaged.  That is treason on a smaller scale.  No captain, going out on the field, doubts his team's ability to win.</P>
      <P>Yet, the captain went on an on about problems and said nothing about opportunities. Their Minister's budget speech contained not a word about prospects for growth in the economy this year or next or of the impact which the budget itself would have on these.</P>
      <P>I was glad to see that in a recent speech to business leaders in Limerick the chief executive of the ESB tackled the problems of Ireland, its woes, its doleful news and darkened skies.  He listed achievements &mdash; an end to emigration, greatly improved standards of living, improved housing, health and education services, an enlarged industrial base and modernisation of our agriculture.  He also sketched out for the business men present the necessity for a positive approach which would take courage from our achievements and generate a national pride.  The least our generation can do is to provide opportunities.</P>
      <P>There is one particular telling paragraph in his speech I want to quote:</P>
      <P>The glass is half-empty or half-full depending on how you look at it.  The half-empty viewers have the stage at present and they have so exaggerated the political, social and economic shortcomings of our society that our national confidence is shaken to the point that we have lost, almost, the will, the determination to tackle our problems with hope of solving them.  I see the glass half-full. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Ceann Comhairle, I could not agree more.  The knockers, the doom peddlers, have had more than enough column <Col N="1620" /> inches.  The budget introduced by the Minister, Deputy MacSharry, has shown that problems could be solved without harsh measures such as the removal of food subsidies, taxing of children's clothes and social welfare benefits.  The Fianna Fáil Government would show in the coming months in their economic plan how to overcome and profit from adversity and would provide the positive approach demanded by the ESB's chief executive.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the development of the inner city which has been made possible by the decisions of the Government.  As a city councillor for many years I was very fully aware of the problems of the inner city and painfully aware of the lack of resources of the corporation to deal with it.  Parts of our capital city were and are unmatched for dirt and ugliness this side of the Iron Curtain.  I was ashamed as a city councillor of our inability to tackle these problems better because of the shortages of cash and the slowness of the compulsory acquisition procedures. I did go on record, however, and made myself unpopular in certain quarters, by suggesting that the priorities within the corporation budget were mistaken, that moneys voted for all sorts of esoteric purposes would have been better devoted to housing.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for saying that these new capital allocations should have been made to Dublin Corporation years ago or for saying that the need of Dublin, this nation's capital, are greater than that of any other part of the country.  I want to put it on record, however, that Fianna Fáil's concern for the development of Dublin and its inner city in particular is not new.  We alone of the political parties prepared a special manifesto for the local elections in 1979 on Dublin and its problems. Sadly we have never had enough members elected to the councils in the Dublin area to have our policies implemented and it has required Government intervention to ensure proper development of the city.</P>
    <P>I want to quote from that manifesto:</P>
    <P>Dublin requires an additional programme of work and effort appropriate to its status as the capital city...  The <Col N="1621" /> condition of central Dublin demands action....  The decay caused by planning blight must be halted by clear and public decisions on Dublin's future living patterns....  The time has come for a positive investment of resources in Dublin as the country's capital city. </P>
    <P>I do not accept people from around the country and other Deputies saying that Dublin should not get this injection. Dublin is your city as much as it is mine. It is the show-piece of the nation.  It is the shop window of the nation for visitors coming here and I make no apologies for saying that we should not be afraid to look into it.  I see, as I speak here today, 2,000 acres of derelict sites.  Those must be tackled and developed.  Even if this injection of money into this city does nothing more than that it will be serving this city well.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory is not alone in his concern for Dublin's inner city or in his emphasis on housing as a priority.  We in Fianna Fáil share these concerns and I was very glad with the outcome.  It means extra houses in the inner city where all the infrastructure, such as shops and schools and so on, is already there.  It means 500 new jobs in areas where the father, the grandfather and the great-grandfather never had a job.  Those are the problems we must face up to today rather than being parochial and saying Limerick and Cork and other places have the same needs.  They have not got the same needs.  One-third of the population of this country are resident in this city and its suburbs.  One-third of the problems of this country are in this city and its suburbs.  The fact is that this city is yours as much as it is mine.  It is your capital city.  You come up here to football matches, for jobs.  People come up from the country to stay here.  It is no use coming along&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Also, the Chair has given ample opportunity to <Col N="1622" /> speakers to lay the foundation, as it were, or to prepare the fire that they were going to light when they would come to the provisions of the Finance Bill and I am anticipating that you will be more relevant in a few minutes time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedBrennan" hpid="Mr. N. Brennan Mr. N. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, however, one item of detail I would ask the Taoiseach to have another look at.  The 1979 manifesto I already quoted from places great emphasis on constructing new roads, on re-directing traffic away from residential areas which were never designed to cater for present day traffic and on limiting the flow of heavy industrial traffic through the city centre.  In pursuance of this policy the Fianna Fáil members of Dublin Corporation fought long and hard to get some agreement on a plan which would channel traffic for Dublin port away from the city centre and residential areas.  We met with the most extraordinary and obstinate opposition from Fine Gael and Labour who were not prepared to take the long-term correct decision for the development of the city in the hope of gaining short-term political advantage.  They even opposed the building of the slip road from Clontarf to East Wall where there were no houses to be knocked down.  When the press are looking, in the future, for examples of political decisions taken for short-term gains, I suggest they look at the Coalition's voting record on these issues.  I am slightly worried that the road development schemes I am talking about will be delayed or postponed in the present circumstances.</P>
      <P>I turn now to the question of tax reform.  Unhappiness with the tax system has been widespread for many years.  Its first manifestations were the clamour for the reduction and eventual abolition of domestic rates.  Since then we have had the PAYE tax marches and more recently demonstrations against PRSI.  I will deal with this latter question first and then go on to discuss the general fairness of the tax system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the minds of civil servants who operate it, PRSI may be an insurance scheme.  Indeed, the insurance aspect of it may have been widely understood and <Col N="1623" /> accepted by workers when it was first introduced or in its earlier form of the insurance stamp.  However, I do not believe that most workers now regard PRSI as an insurance scheme.  To most of them it is just another tax, levied at quite high rates with little possibility of evasion. The insurance aspect makes even <Col N="1624" /> less sense to employers.  To them it is a straight payroll tax, an overhead for the use of labour and an incentive to replace labour with machines on which there is no tax.</P>

      <P>In connection with his claim to unemployment assistance the person concerned was recently assessed with weekly means of £65.00.  He appealed against the assessment but the appeals officer, whose decision is final, upheld the deciding officer's decision.  As the amount of his weekly means exceeds the maximum amount of £63.75 unemployment assistance appropriate in his case, it is regretted that unemployment assistance <Col N="1580" /> is not payable to the person concerned.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been assessed with means of £6 a week for unemployment assistance purposes.  He is receiving £19.45 a week unemployment assistance, which is the maximum rate of £25.45 appropriate in his case less the weekly means of £6.  This is the maximum amount that can be paid under the regulations having regard to the means assessed.  In this respect he has applied for a revision of his means and inquiries are at present being made in relation to this aspect.</P>
      <P>Supplementary welfare allowance is a matter for the health board which is responsible for day to day administration in the case of individual claims made to it and for determining the amount of a payment, if any, to be made.</P>

    <P>Following inquiries by an Inspector of the Department it has been ascertained from claimant's employers that she is still absent from work due to illness.  Accordingly a cheque for the amount of disability benefit due from 12 May 1982, fourth <Col N="1581" /> day of incapacity, to 9 June 1982 was issued on 9 June.

      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 847, 848 and 849 together.</P>
      <P>Dublin County Council are reviewing speed limits in their areas generally and I understand that among the proposals which they intend to submit for my consideration is a review of the current limit on the Sandyford Road.</P>
      <P>The provision of traffic signs, including pedestrian crossings, is a matter for the road authority acting with the consent, or at the request, of the Garda Commissioner. The commissioner has requested Dublin County Council to provide a &ldquo;pelican&rdquo; light controlled crossing near the Parkvale junction and the council intend to do this within the current year.</P>
      <P>I understand that public footpaths have been provided on both sides of Sandyford road between Dun Emer Estate and Clonard Lodge and that Dublin County Council intend to carry out further improvements to them in the current year.  The timing and execution of those works are for the county council.</P>
