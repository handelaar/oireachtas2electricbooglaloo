      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the large number of jury actions awaiting hearing; and the steps he intends to take to expedite these cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there is a large number of High Court jury actions at present awaiting hearing and I understand from the President of the High Court that, in an effort to reduce the backlog, he has arranged special jury sittings of the High Court, the first of which was held in Naas on 14 June and the next in Trim on 5 July, yesterday, at which actions that, in the ordinary course, would not come to trial in Dublin before October next have been offered a hearing.  He also proposes to arrange additional jury sittings in October at those venues outside Dublin where the High Court on circuit normally hears such actions.  These measures have been made possible following the appointment last March of two additional High Court judges.</P>
      <P>The increase in the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to £15,000, in contract and tort cases, with effect from 12 May 1982, can be expected to divert a substantial number of pending High Court actions to the Circuit Court and this will help to prevent a further build-up in the arrears of jury actions.</P>
      <P>One of the jury courts in the Four Courts was destroyed by fire in October of last year.  This courtroom is at present being reconstructed and is expected to be ready for use by the commencement of the Michaelmas Term in October next.</P>
      <P>Later this year it is proposed to move some High Court offices from the Four Courts to alternative accommodation in order to make space available in the Four Courts for the provision of two more High Court jury courtrooms which, it is hoped, will be provided in 1983.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the large number of uninsured vehicles being driven <Col N="1029" /> at present and of the serious consequences of this situation for road users; and the action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am greatly concerned at the high incidence of uninsured driving. The Garda Síochána are, of course, conscious of the problem and are active in their efforts to detect offenders and to enforce the law.  Because the relevant prosecution statistics cover not only the offence of driving without insurance but also that of failing to produce a certificate of insurance at a Garda station within the period of ten days prescribed by statute, it is not possible to say precisely how many prosecutions are brought in respect of the offence of having no insurance. However, the Deputy may take it that, in recent years, the number of such prosecutions has been of the order of 30,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>It is public knowledge that the high cost of motor insurance is one of the factors that prompts many people to take the risk of driving uninsured vehicles.  As the Deputy is doubtless aware, this aspect of the problem has been mentioned in the course of the inquiry which is at present being conducted into the cost of motor insurance by the body established by the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  While it is clear that there is no easy answer to that particular difficulty, it may be that the outcome of that inquiry will go some way towards suggesting a solution for what is undoubtedly a problem of great concern to all of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of his reply that the matter of enforcing the law is one for the Garda, has the Minister any proposals for changing the law in the sense suggested by Deputy Cosgrave's question, namely, to ensure that the identification of an uninsured vehicle would be facilitated by a rule requiring a driver to carry on his windscreen a certificate, or disc, indicating that that particular vehicle is insured in the name of that particular driver at that particular time?  Has he or has he not got such proposals?  Has he or has he not pressed the Minister for the Environment, whose business it is, apparently, to supervise this corner of administration, to promote a change in the law to that effect?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that it could be well worth his while to examine the way this system operates in some continental countries.  Do not mind what the English do.  The English do not have this system and naturally the &ldquo;Pats&rdquo; do not have it either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that frequently the penalties imposed by the courts are such that there is an incentive to drive without insurance? The penalty is often less than one year's premium.  Would he take that matter up with the courts and with the prosecuting authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>How is it that the Minister is prepared to give Deputy Taylor's question favourable consideration, notwithstanding <Col N="1032" /> that it would necessarily imply a severe breach of private affairs in regard to the motorists concerned, but is not willing to consider for a second, and has no opinion about, the disc system Deputy Cosgrave suggests?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the outcome of the meeting which the Taoiseach and he had with Garda chiefs in Dublin at the beginning of April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the meeting in April was to review the serious crime situation, particularly in so far as Dublin city and its environs are concerned, and to decide on measures necessary to tackle the problem effectively.</P>
      <P>The meeting examined a wide variety of matters including such items as Garda strength, recruitment and deployment, Garda equipment &mdash; including Garda communications, computer facilities, aerial and additional mobile capacity &mdash; the civilianisation of certain Garda posts, the provision of additional staff and equipment for the forensic science laboratory of the Department of Justice and pressures on prison accommodation.</P>
      <P>A further meeting was held on 19 May to review progress made under these various headings and I would refer Deputies to the statement which was issued by the Government Information Services following that meeting.  I have had a copy of the statement placed in the Library.</P>
      <P>Measures have been taken to accelerate Garda recruitment procedures and the training centre at Templemore now has in training the maximum number that it is currently possible to accommodate there.  In addition, the Office of Public Works have provided extra accommodation for a further 200 recruits.  This will bring the overall recruit training capacity to almost 500 and will enable a total of approximately 1,000 recruits to be appointed in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, with a view to releasing <Col N="1033" /> as many existing gardaí as possible for police duties, the process of civilianising certain posts has been speeded up.  One hundred and one additional gardaí will be available for garda duties as a result. All are expected to have taken up their new duties by the end of July.</P>
    <P>Additional personnel are being provided for the Probation and Welfare Service and arrangements for their recruitment are proceeding.  They will be engaged on intensive supervision of persons who can safely be released from prison thereby reducing the pressure on custodial accommodation and helping to ensure that persons who ought to remain in prison do not have to be released for lack of sufficient accommodation.  Additional staff are also being recruited for the Forensic Science Laboratory.</P>
    <P>The question of changes in the law in areas affecting crime control is also being pursued with all possible speed.  I expect to be in a position to bring proposals for amending legislation before the Government in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Did Garda chiefs discuss with the Minister his present publicity campaign which is costing the taxpayer £150,000?

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>A review of intoxicating liquor legislation has been carried out with special reference to the serious problem of under-age drinking and I am at present considering what specific amendments I might recommend to the Government.  If the Government decide that amendments should be introduced, they will, of course, come before the House in the normal way.</P>
      <P>Provisional figures obtained in respect of the year 1981 indicate that, in that year, there were 19 convictions for the offence of knowingly supplying or selling intoxicating liquor to persons under the age of 18 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that his reply is entirely unsatisfactory? This is a serious problem but there have been only 19 convictions in the past year and the Minister has not given a firm date to introduce legislation to control the sale to teenagers of alcoholic liquor by publicans and supermarkets, and it is causing intense problems certainly in Dublin city and county and probably throughout the country.  Will the Minister give the House a definite date for what he is proposing and will he state when the House is likely to see such legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the number of convictions in this area is very low having regard to the number of complaints received by all Deputies about this matter.  However, I must make the point that, as Minister of State, I had a memorandum ready for Government when I left office but it lay with my predecessor for eight months.  I have now reactivated preparation of that legislation and I am at this time taking into consideration additional views that have been communicated to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>

Would he consider a scheme for age identification of young drinkers? This is successful in parts of the country and many publicans are looking for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>

Will he agree that in this instance it would be appropriate that a conviction should follow where a publican has failed to exercise due care in determining the age of the would be customer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>To begin with, I should say that my understanding is that the intruder did not in fact escape through the college gates. Subject to that preliminary point, the matters complained of are at present the subject of investigation by the Garda authorities and, as soon as I am informed of the outcome, I will communicate with the Deputy.  The visit to the college Chaplain was undertaken as part of the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate to the House why the gardaí, having been notified by the Reverend Chaplain that a robbery was in progress, took two days to present themselves at the college?  Will the Minister not agree that there was something radically wrong, that when the gardaí responded and as the gate was being opened to admit <Col N="1040" /> the patrol car the thief escaped with a large sum of money?  Will the Minister tell the House why the gardaí did not turn up at the college until two days after they were notified by the Reverend Chaplain of the problem?  Why did they not come immediately when they were invited to do so by the Chaplain?  It was an extremely urgent matter as there was a thief in the college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is a very serious matter.  I wish to make two points.  First, I am informed the intruder did not escape through the gate.  I am informed the gardaí arrived the next day, not two days later.  All of the matters raised by the Deputy are being investigated at present by the gardaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a most serious view of the matter.  I want the Minister to indicate where he got the information that the gardaí turned up on the following day because that was not so.  It was communicated to me by the Reverend Chaplain that they did not come until two days afterwards to make inquiries.  It is now six weeks since I put this question on the Order Paper but the inquiries which the Minister states are in progress have not been completed.  I wish to know why the gardaí called on the Reverend Chaplain immediately after I tabled the question.  Is it not a fact that they called to ask the Chaplain to make an alteration in the statement he made previously in which he stated the gardaí did not call to the college until two days after being informed of the situation?  Is there anything on the Minister's file stating that the gardaí originally notified the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána that they could not go to the college immediately because there was a fog and that the patrol car could not travel from Portlaoise to Mountmellick in the fog?  I put it to the Minister that there was no fog on that night, on the next day or two days afterwards.  Finally I put it to the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Minister state where he got the information that the thief did not escape through the gate which was opened to admit the patrol car?  The Reverend Chaplain saw the thief going out the gate.  This is one of the reasons why the Garda authorities called on the Chaplain to get an alteration in his original statement to save them the disgrace of what happened.  I ask the Minister to say when it will be possible to have the results of the full investigation into this grave and serious matter.</P>

I ask the Minister to request the Commissioners of the Garda Síochána to inquire why there is no Garda sergeant in Mountmellick. The Garda sergeant lives in Partarlington and has refused to occupy the Garda barracks in Mountmellick.  This is a total disgrace and it is the reason so many strange things are happening in the locality.  There should be an immediate inquiry by the Commissioner and the Minister for Justice to investigate this serious crime.  I will deal with it in this House at a later stage.</P>

On being questioned they informed the gardaí that they were working for the organisation in question.  The gardaí subsequently called to the residence of the principal of the organisation to verify that the information which they had been given was correct.  The Garda authorities state that, having checked that the information was correct, the members concerned, far from warning the principal about the persons he was employing as is stated in the question, in fact complimented him for his involvement in the rehabilitation of ex-prisoners.</P>

      <P>The recommendation relating to straying animals is one of a number made by the Law Reform Commission in its recently published &ldquo;Report on Civil Liability for Animals&rdquo; which has been presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>In connection with the publication of this report and of another report which is not my Department's responsibility, the Government issued a statement on 11 June welcoming the reports and saying that they would be fully considered by the Departments concerned.

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that this is a matter of urgency since the Law Reform Commission first produced a working paper in 1977 on this matter of immunity?  Since the Chief State Solicitor's Office made submissions to the Law Reform Commission on both working papers, it seems to imply that it is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, if not to introduce the legislation, at least to favourably recommend that that legislation be introduced, by whatever Department, as a matter of urgency?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to provide the Garda Síochána with their own aerial capacity stands.  Because of the many and complex technical problems that are involved in selecting the right type of machines for Garda needs, as well as selecting the equipment to go with them and providing the necessary back-up facilities, it will take some time to complete the planning for the new aerial wing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is none.  The Garda Síochána are provided with sufficient official transport to cater for their overall needs and the number of cars allocated to individual stations is a matter <Col N="1054" /> for decision by the Garda authorities, who do not accept that any stations can be described as being short of transport at present.  It is, of course, inevitable that in an organisation the size of the Garda Síochána there will be on hands and under assessment at any given time &mdash; as indeed is the case at present &mdash; a small number of applications from individual stations to Garda headquarters for the allocation of transport.  However, until an application has been assessed by the Garda authorities, the station concerned cannot be treated as being short of a squad car.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of recent publicity given to this case, I have to say more than I would normally wish to about an individual defendant.  The man in question has not, of course, been convicted of any offence.  He was charged with &ldquo;attempting to have unlawful carnal knowledge of a female against her will&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>He was committed to Mountjoy Prison on remand in October 1976.  He was certified by two doctors to be of unsound mind in November 1976 and transferred to the Central Mental Hospital by order of the Minister for Justice, under section 13 of the Lunatic Asylums (Ireland) Act, 1875 as amended and extended.  His case has been considered in court on numerous occasions since then and has been adjourned.  The court has had the benefit of psychiatrists' opinion throughout.</P>
      <P>The medical authorities at Dundrum had made several efforts to have him accepted in a local psychiatric hospital and in other institutions.  None of the institutions approached was prepared to accept this man as an in-patient.</P>
      <P>In mid-1981 his treatment programme was intensified with a view to speeding up his gradual return to a life in the community.  Following a recommendation by the psychiatrist who was treating the offender in Dundrum, the then Minister for Justice approved the daily release of the patient to a unit for the mentally handicapped where he began a re-training course on 2 June 1981.  He continued on this course until 3 March 1982, when his temporary release had to be terminated because he failed to abide by conditions and his conduct gave cause for serious concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case came before the courts again in early June 1982 when it was again made clear to the court that institutional care <Col N="1056" /> in an institution other than the Central Mental Hospital was still not available. At the court hearing on 17 June 1982, the district justice stated that he would adjourn the case to 24 June to enable me to make an appropriate order in the case. It was far from clear what type of order was required.  Having regard to the length of time the defendant has been on remand and the number of the issues involved, the notice given me to deal with a very cryptic message from the District Court was, in my opinion, unrealistic.  On 24 June the court struck out the charges.</P>

      <P>Taking the last part of the question first, I have already initiated an urgent examination of the report, with particular reference to the conclusions and recommendations section of the report.  Consultations will obviously be necessary with other Departments, local authorities and staff interests, with regard to the recommendations and conclusions. As a result of that urgent examination I will then be taking the action to which the Deputy refers.  I would remind the Deputy that considerable action has been taken in a number of the main areas dealt with in the report, such as staffing, training, building regulations and financial provision.  I shall develop further proposals on these matters in the light of the recommendations before us at this stage.</P>

Having regard to the constraints of time imposed on the House, might I make the following suggestion to the House for consideration?  I understand from the Whips that we are scheduled to take the amending legislation for local government planning.  The critical point as far <Col N="1210" /> as the public are concerned is the administration of the national draft building regulations.  Following consultation with the Whips, might I suggest to the House, on the Order of Business, that the Minister would give a full report in the course of the Second Stage debate on the Bill indicating what is the position in regard to the system of administration of the building regulations?  In that way the Opposition spokesperson would be properly briefed on order to respond within the constraints of parliamentary time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a long and interesting debate on this subject of the appropriate rent relief to be allowed people against their income tax liability in view of the fact that people who are buying their own houses can receive rent relief on interest payments whereas people living in rented accommodation can get no relief whatever in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said before, my party believe that we should aim ultimately at having a comprehensive system of tax relief for rent payments available to everybody to remove the present distortion in the tax <Col N="1216" /> code against renting accommodation.  We also believe that this would help a group who, generally speaking, have a lower income and are in a less fortunate position in relation to housing than those living in their own houses.  I refer to people who are tenants.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory introduced an amendment originally to the Finance Bill, which would have extended this idea of income tax relief on rent to about 53 per cent of the total tax paying public by extending it to people with taxable incomes of less than £4,500.  I stated during the course of the debate on that amendment that my party were in favour in principle of doing something to help the lower income group but we felt, in terms of the cost of the amendment and also because it was helping more than half of the tax paying public if they were in rented accommodation, that Deputy Gregory's amendment was going further than we could afford to go and, perhaps it would be desirable to go at this time.  We considered the matter carefully in the meantime and we have come to the conclusion that the appropriate relief, which would give practical expression to the principle which is accepted by all sides of the House that the low income groups should receive some relief on their income tax in regard to rent, is to propose a relief which is certainly very modest but which would extend solely to those with taxable incomes of less than £1,000.  This relief would extend to approximately the 10 per cent lowest paid of all income tax payers. The cost would be nil this year, about £3.5 million in 1983 rising to a full cost probably in 1984 of around £5.5 million.</P>
    <P>I believe this is a modest amendment designed to help exclusively the low income group and in particular that segment of that group who are living in rented accommodation and whose situation, in addition to income consideration, is diminished because they do not live in their own houses but are living in insecure accommodation.  I believe, while the proposal costs some money, it must be stressed that it will not cost anything at all this year and, therefore, does not affect the current budget deficit by one penny.  It will cost something next year <Col N="1217" /> but we have the time to make provision for it between now and next year.  I believe, because it is confined to the low income group and confined to the lowest 10 per cent of all income tax payers, that it is a proposal which is very selective in the way in which it will operate and represents a concession in principle to the idea of assistance to the lower paid in this matter.</P>
    <P>Obviously I do not rule out the possible extension of this concession in future years.  That will depend on available finances in future years.  This proposal is a modest one which will not cost anything this year, will cost £3.3 million next year, will help the low paid and is consistent with the policy my party sought to implement in Government of extending income tax rents relief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke previously on this matter I referred to the gross inequity in the present situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> people who are tenants and people who are house owners in relation to the income tax concessions to which they are entitled and the degree of deductability of the rent they pay in the one case and the mortgage payments they pay in the other case as allowances against their income tax.  I want to deal now with the position of what must be quite a substantial category of people, people who are neither house owners nor tenants but would be prepared to take up tenancy if they could find suitable accommodation at a rent they could afford.  There are many families, some with children, who are on the local authority housing lists who would be anxious to take up tenancy of premises if they were available for them at a rent within their means.  The present situation is that the rent they have to pay is money they have to find after they have suffered fully from deductions made under PAYE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a person setting out to buy a house that person examines his or her financial situation, looks at the price of the house and the deposit he or she has available.  That person looks at how much the monthly repayments would have to be on a mortgage.  That person takes into account the fact that the mortgage <Col N="1218" /> repayments will be allowable against income tax.  That has the effect of producing an improvement in that person's income and expenditure situation. The other person who is not in the position to go out to buy a house is looking around to see if he might be in a position to rent accommodation for himself and his family and he is debarred from doing that at the moment because the full rent he has to find has to be on an after tax basis.  That produces a glaring inequity. If that were to be remedied in whole or in part, as is sought by the amendments put down, it would have an immediate effect of enabling many people to obtain for themselves and their families a rented dwelling, a house or a flat.  They would be put in the position, by reason of having that income tax allowance against that rent, of being able to afford to take up the tenancy of a premises which under the present position they could not afford.</P>
    <P>The Government have said they are very anxious to stimulate the building industry generally.  Everybody in the House would very willingly and very readily subscribe to that objective.  If the Minister conceded the amendment in whole or in part, or if the House accepted it, it would provide a stimulus to the construction industry because it would mean a large group of people would be in a position to rent and obtain houses and flats which they cannot afford to do under the present situation.  It is the same concession that is accorded to people who set out to buy.  It is reasonable and equitable that at least an equivalent concession should be accorded to the person who sets out to rent.</P>
    <P>The situation works inequitably in another way also.  In the case of a person who obtains a mortgage and makes repayments to a local authority, building society or whatever, for the most part those mortgages and the rate of interest applicable are at a fixed rate of repayment. I am aware that there are some variations from time to time in the case of building society mortgages but, by and large, not by more than 1 or 2 per cent and, on the whole, the interest payable <Col N="1219" /> on foot of a mortgage remains static during the period of the mortgage. Undoubtedly house purchasers find it extremely difficult to meet repayments in the first few years.  But it is also undoubtedly true that as the years go by and if the person's earnings rise in proportion to inflation the burden of the repayment reduces substantially in real terms arising from the effects of inflation.  It continues to do that with the very high and unacceptable levels of inflation we have.  The position improves very much as far as the house purchaser is concerned.</P>
    <P>What is the position regarding the tenant? It is quite the reverse.  He has to find his rent on an after-tax basis throughout, which is a serious burden.  To enable him to pay a rent of £100 a week, he must earn £130 or £140 a week and suffer a deduction of tax before he meets his rent. As the years go by the position is that, far from his rent reducing in real terms, it increases with inflation.  He will find that his rent is upped to take account of the inflationary situation.  That argument has particular force now that the whole question of rent control has been thrown into disarray and a question mark hangs over what the ultimate situation will be regarding rent control.  The tenant sees his rent maintained at the same level of inflation whereas the house purchaser is in the reverse situation.  This highlights in another way the imbalance and inequity which exists between the two categories.</P>
    <P>I do not have the relevant statistics &mdash; perhaps the Minister has or perhaps the Minister for the Environment would be the appropriate person to have them &mdash; but there was very little if any house construction undertaken over the last few years for the purpose of renting.  If that is the position, it is to be regretted.  The Minister should take steps to encourage such building.</P>
    <P>I was concerned about a provision in a previous Finance Bill which gave a tax concession to a developer who developed housing for rent and found that the income derived from that would come to him tax free.  That is putting the effect of a tax free concession at the wrong end &mdash; at the lessor's end rather than at the <Col N="1220" /> tenant's end.  Quite clearly the tenant is in far greater need of it.  If this concession is given to him, it would stimulate the house construction industry and would enable many people to enter the rental market and obtain dwellings for themselves and their families.  There is no shortage of people in that situation who would be anxious, ready and willing to rent houses and flats if they could afford to do so.  If the House accepts the amendment, many families who are not at present in a position to find accommodation for themselves under any category will be able to do so.  They are not in a position to buy or rent and they find themselves on the long finger on local authority waiting lists.  I ask the Minister to make some concession in this regard or alternatively, that the House pass the amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 33 (b) has been moved.  The amendment to the amendment has been moved.  They are the only two but, in so far as amendment No. 33 (c) and amendment No. 33 (d) pertain to the same matter, for the purposes of debate they are being discussed with the other two.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  I do not want to repeat what I said the last day when we had a full discussion on this section.  It must be accepted that these amendments are unworkable in their present form.  The amendments would not give a married couple double a single person's allowance.  That must be taken into account.  There is no provision for marginal relief in either of these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1221" /> At the request of a number of Deputies the last day, I said I would be prepared to have a look at the points made, without commitment, between now and Report Stage, because of the wording of them and the fact that the figures do not take account of particular items.  I am sure Deputies do not wish for hours' more discussion on this point.</P>
    <P>In relation to the comparisons Deputy Taylor gave there is no answer to them or argument against them.  This is a new scheme.  It is implemented as outlined originally in Deputy Bruton's budget. Obviously its implementation and operation and the experience gained from that will lead to pressures to have it extended in one form or another.  I have said that the kind of amendments before me are unworkable.  The major point could be that they do not take account of the judgment in the Murphy case where a married couple must get double the single person's allowance and there is no provision for marginal relief for which in any such issue of taxation there is provision.</P>
    <P>It is easy for Deputy Bruton to say that this will not cost any money this year. But I recall in debates here and many times in public Deputy Bruton saying that it was not so much what the budget deficit might be in this financial year but what it would be in the following year arising from actions this year.  Deputy Desmond has also made that point on numerous occasions.  One cannot just transfer the £3.5 million or £7 million, whatever it might be, into next year because it is not a cost this year and say that it is so much further down the road and that we do not necessarily have to be as restrictive as we might be in relation to acceptance.  I made the points on this the last day and have repeated some of them today.  I request the Deputies to withdraw the amendments in the context of what I have said.  I can have another look at them between now and Report Stage without commitment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a fair point in saying that I have at all times expressed concern not just about this year's deficit but also about the deficit next year and in subsequent years.  I <Col N="1222" /> agree that the fact that this amendment would not cost anything this year is not a compelling reason on its own for accepting it.  On the other hand we are talking about perhaps one of the most deserving groups in our society &mdash; people on low incomes who are living in rented accommodation. I believe that the amendment I am proposing is one that we should be able to find the money for next year. There are many other areas where economies could be made, and if they are made in order to help low income people in private rented accommodation the net balance must be favourable in terms of social justice.  Even in difficult economic circumstances we must seek to reform our tax system in the interests of social justice.  When very generous allowances are given to much more prosperous sections of the community in the form of interest relief and other reliefs on the income tax code &mdash; reliefs I was seeking to reduce but which the Minister said for technical reasons he has not been able to reduce &mdash; it is no harm to try to help people who are not being helped, as my amendment seeks to do.  Between now and next year perhaps the Minister will have overcome the difficulties referred to in regard to interest relief and may well be able to find sufficient money from that source which will more than outweigh the small cost that will derive from the very limited amendment I am proposing, which is less than one-quarter as generous as what Deputy Gregory-Independent originally proposed and only half as generous as what Deputy Desmond proposed. It is in real terms merely a token provision for the lower income private rented tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that we have almost exhausted the debate on this amendment, but I want to bring in one final comment from my party's point of view with regard to this amendment.  Private tenants are the one unsubsidised housing section in our community, yet they pay the highest fraction of their income on housing.  Figures from the latest household budget survey, which each Deputy should have, show that mortgage householders pay 11.4 per cent of their <Col N="1223" /> income on housing, local authority tenants pay half of that rate &mdash; about 5.7 per cent &mdash; of their income on housing, but private rented tenants on average pay 15 per cent of their income on rent.  I will give the figures again.  Mortgage holders pay about 11.4 per cent of their income, local authority tenants 11.5 per cent and private rented tenants about 15 per cent of their income on housing.  Private rents in 1979 averaged, according to the national household budget survey, about £11.14 a week.  Today rents range from a minimum of £ 15 to £20 per week for a flat or between £40 and £50 a week for a three-bedroom house, and for a family that would not be great housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I make the double-barrelled point which has been made by colleague Deputy Taylor, that we are asking for a subsidy of about £4 million.  That is peanuts in the context of other relief provisions we have.  We subsidise mortgage interest for house purchasers to the tune of £40 million or perhaps £50 million a year and we give £4,000 grants to such purchasers.  On top of that, lest I be accused of having a comment in just that area, we also subsidise local authority tenants to the tune of £90 million a year. Contrasting these subsidised sectors and the very modest £4 million proposal which we have here for those whose housing payments are the heaviest, I think this is a reasonable amendment.  I do not think there is a differential between Deputy Bruton's amendment and mine, but in the event of mine not being acceptable to the House I would be prepared to support Deputy Bruton's amendment. However, I feel obliged to press mine. The amount of money is very small and we have spent an inordinate amount of time discussing the amendment.  What I am proposing is very simple.  Everybody earning up to £115 per week, provided such person is married and has two children, will get a degree of rent tax rebate. Deputy Bruton's amendment would bring it down to £95 a week and in the context that average earnings here are around £140 to £150 per week, persons earning that would not get such relief.  I am talking about male adult, transportable <Col N="1224" /> goods industry sector average earnings of roughly £148.50 a week.  Therefore, our proposal is a very modest one of relief and I press it.  If I am still in the land of living with so many amendments to the amendment, 33b is my amendment that would be taken first, or would it be the one for the lesser amount?</P>

That is the amendment to the amendment. Additionally we have other amendments, 33c and 33d, one in the name of Deputy Gregory and the other in the name of Deputy Bruton which because they are alternatives are being discussed together.  The question that will be put after all that is the question on the amendment to the amendment tabled by Deputy Desmond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> It is difficult to understand the minds of some Opposition Deputies.  As the Chair rightly said, the first amendment we had was one from Deputy Gregory asking that £4,500 per annum be considered.  I can see that these amendments are very laudable, something we would all welcome but I can also see the problem at this time in our present financial conditions.  We all agree that rented dwellings particularly in this city, but also throughout the country I am sure, are offered at exorbitant rates.  I listened to Deputy Taylor speaking of a previous Finance Bill when he said that the concessions probably put the cart before the horse as regards development of flats.  In my opinion the best way to bring down the price of rented accommodation is to increase the supply.  So long as there is a scarcity, no matter what we do in regard to giving concessions without doubt it will be eaten up in increased rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would welcome &mdash; I know it has already been put into a Finance Bill &mdash; the encouragement of developers to ensure that the supply is equal to the demand.  When we have sufficient rented accommodation, the high prices now been charged will come down.  Naturally, when there is scarcity prices rocket.  The important thing is to increase the supply of rented accommodation.  I defend the previous Finance Bill which gave concessions and encouragement in respect of private rented accommodation; this is something we have not encouraged through the years as we should have done.  We see a massive influx of students into this city at the start of the university year each year and there is no accommodation <Col N="1227" /> for them.  Without doubt the prices charged are exorbitant but that is in consequence of the scarcity.  That is what we must tackle so as to encourage the provision of more private rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what section of the community Deputy Bruton is aiming at in his amendment when he speaks of taxable income of £1,000.  I doubt if he would alleviate the hardship of very many people who would be paying for rented accomodation.  I believe that the majority or at least a substantial number of low incomes in rented accommodation come into the category of rent-controlled accommodation.  As we know a landlord and tenant Bill is going through the House and I think it will embrace many of those people.  I understand there are about 35,000 tenants in that category. When they are covered by the new Bill which will be signed very shortly into law, their rents will increase substantially and at a future date when a proper rents tribunal is set up and a proper register taken of the number of rented dwellings, I would consider it appropriate to give some concession then in the nature of setting rent against income tax.  As has been pointed out, a similar concession is enjoyed at present by house purchasers. I think it is a big concession but we should look at it in a broader context and see if we can get a proper register of rent controlled houses.  Then we can see the standard of accommodation.  If we pass any of these three amendments now, there is the danger that always exists that landlords will increase rents while we have no proper register.</P>
    <P>I should like to have a comprehensive survey carried out on the whole question to see what is the appropriate number of rented dwellings, how many can be properly regulated and perhaps supervised in the future.  I doubt if giving an <i>ad hoc</i> concession would entirely benefit the people we want to benefit.  We have the concept enshrined in this year's Finance Bill in regard to those over 65 who will qualify for such relief.  I believe that will be the first step in trying to establish some <Col N="1228" /> form of register of private landlords.  The information that the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister will have gathered in the implementation of the concession for those over 65 will be of considerable help in designing a future budget.</P>
    <P>I can see merit in all these amendments and there is no doubt the Minister is also sympathetic to them.  It would be unwise at this time to press these amendments because I do not believe they have been properly researched as to how many dwellings will be taken into consideration. This is something this House should take into consideration when discussing future Finance Bills and future budgets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a vote, I understand the first vote will take place on Deputy Desmond's amendment which will reduce the figure in Deputy GregoryIndependent's amendment from £4,500 to £2,000.  That is purely amending the form of the amendment and will reduce the cost.  That is hardly something to which anybody would object.  The next amendment will be &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand&rdquo;.  If that is passed, all attempts at rent relief for low income people, except for those over 65 years of age, will be rejected and the other amendments, including Deputy Desmond's, Deputy Gregory-Independ-ent's and my own, will be ruled out of court.  That is not an acceptable proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument put forward by the Minister, apart from that of cost which is not very significant, is that he will consider this matter between now and Report Stage.  He said that last Thursday and there were two and a half working days in which he could have considered it. Between now and Report Stage we have only one working day.  If he was to bring in any concession, he could as easily come up with it now as he could on Thursday. Between the end of this debate &mdash; 7.00 p.m. Wednesday night &mdash; and the opening of the Report Stage on Thursday morning, I do not believe he will come up with any blinding flash of insight as to how he might get around what is now impossible.  If he was going to do that, he <Col N="1229" /> would have come up with his suggestions by now.  He has had more time since the last time this was discussed than he will have between the end of Committee Stage and the beginning of Report Stage. While I do not wish to impute a lack of sincerity on the part of the Minister, in practical terms there must be some doubt about his assurance that he might be able to do something on Thursday that he is not prepared to do today, Tuesday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to quote what Deputy Bruton said last January when he was talking about an extension to cover all tenancies.  He said it could not be afforded and in order to focus first on the area of greatest need the allowance would be made available to taxpayers aged 65 and upwards who lived in private rented accommodation.  That is exactly what is contained in section 5 of this Bill.  When Deputy Bruton questions my sincerity, he should recall what he said last January.</P>

      <P>We have debated this subject for two days and we have all become convinced that it is possible to do now what one might not have thought possible last January, that is, to frame an amendment which would help low income people only so far as rented accommodation is concerned.  My amendment helps the lowest of the low income people.  It is not generous relief; it does not go very far.  If debate means anything, it is that we must learn from it. I have learned from this debate that such an amendment is possible, at a not unreasonable cost.  I did not realise it was as feasible as it is, given the cost elements that have come into focus.  Therefore, I believe it is reasonable to make that amendment given that there has been very wide consensus right across the House that something should be done in this area.  If debates of this sort mean anything, they should lead to constructive conclusions.  My amendment is a constructive conclusions to a long and basically agreeable debate.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows, <Col N="1230" /> as a former Minister for Finance, that these are budgetary matters.  I have said, as have other Fianna Fáil Deputies, that one can accept the principle of doing something in this area but the three amendments in their present form are unworkable, do not make any provision for marginal relief and would be flying in the face of the constitutional questions raised in the Murphy case because they would not give the married couple double the single person's allowance.  I have made those three specific important points which are relevant to this discussion. I have been asked by a number of Deputies over the last weekend and again today to look at the outcome of this debate and the content of these amendments, and I said I was prepared to do so between now and Report Stage.</P>

In regard to the Murphy case, I am not making the same proposal as Deputy Gregory-Independent because I accept what the Minister said as being a reasonable interpretation of the Supreme Court decision.  The Minister said that this amendment was impractical because of the absence of marginal relief.</P>
      <P>Under subsection (5) the Revenue Commissioners have power to make regulations for the purpose of giving effect to this section with respect to the allowance granted by the section or to any matter ancillary or incidental thereto.  There is a power in this section for the Revenue Commissioners, if the Dáil accepts one or other of these amendments, to make whatever arrangements are necessary in regard to marginal relief. To argue that on technical grounds it is not possible to accept this amendment is not correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the House in regard to the matter will be made clear if the amendment is adopted. The section says that the Revenue Commissioners may make regulations for the purpose of giving effect to this section with respect to the allowance granted by this section or to any matter ancillary or incidental thereto.  I believe the marginal relief issue is ancillary to the basic question. It is not the intention of the House that a person with a taxable income of £1,001 would be far worse off than the person with a taxable income of £999.  To ensure that did not happen would be ancillary to the intention of the House as expressed in whatever amendment is passed.  I believe the regulation-making power is sufficient to get over whatever technical problems the Minister may be reasonably worried about.</P>
      <P>If the Minister had come forward on Committee Stage with an amendment, he could have got over whatever problems there were with all the expertise available to him in the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  He has not done so and all we can rely on is the regulation-making power which is in the section.  That is an adequate rebuttal of the argument in regard to marginal relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go on repeating the arguments I presented in this discussion last week.  At the time my principal point was to suggest that my motivation in putting down the original amendment was to try to direct income tax concessions to a section of the community that is in great social need.  I was hoping a more equitable approach would be introduced in the section by identifying those tenants most in need. For that reason I put down two alternative amendments to stimulate discussion and to produce a consensus approach to what everyone who has participated in the discussion so far has accepted is a major social problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context it is logical that following <Col N="1232" /> discussion on the various contributions I should welcome Deputy Desmond's amendment to my amendment. While I welcome the further discussion which resulted from that, I cannot help but feel that if we ever get to the stage where we begin to discuss Deputy Bruton's further amendment some other Deputy will circulate yet another amendment reducing the taxable income level even further.  I wonder if a ruling from the Chair is in order in this regard.  Can Deputies, <i>ad infinitum,</i> go on circulating amendments while discussion is already in progress?  In Deputy Desmond's case the discussion on my amendment was virtually completed when a further amendment was circulated.  Is there anything in Standing Orders governing this problem?  I can see a situation arising during this week when we could have innumerable amendments all directed towards the same principle and towards the same attempt to bring about the same remedy but getting nowhere.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I can help the Deputy.  There is a requirement that two days' notice should be given with regard to a proposed amendment. On the other hand, there have been departures from that in the past. Personally I do not know if word has been conveyed to Deputy Bruton that his amendment has been accepted.  Perhaps it has, but I must point out that it is not I who makes that decision.  When I came to the Chair references were made to the amendment and while it had not been moved discussion was taking place on it. I cannot say to the Deputy if the amendment will come before the House formally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am to take the spirit of my own amendment, that it is largely an attempt to identify tenants most in need of assistance, I must welcome Deputy Desmond's amendment to my amendment which effectively reduces the taxable income level to £2,000, which is less than half of the income level I suggested.  The principle here is all-important.  I set out to start that process in motion and I think Deputy Desmond's amendment does that. Indeed, other speakers have gone further, and should the Minister be prepared to move even part of the way towards this amendment I believe he would have the support of all Members judging from what the various speakers have said so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect of the debate has caused me a certain amount of concern, namely, the failure of the Minister and his officials to give any indication of the amount that would be gained by way of taxation on the previously undeclared income of <Col N="1234" /> many landlords.  Equally, there has been no indication of the amount of taxation presently accruing from the taxation of landlords despite the statement of the Revenue Commissioners that significant progress had been made in the past few years and that a campaign had been carried out to tax landlords to ensure that this source of income did not go untapped.</P>
    <P>Despite that statement there appear to be no figures at all, either for Dublin or for the rest of the country, as to the amount of taxation now coming from that source and what the projected taxation would be should any of the amendments before the House be introduced.  If, as has been said, there are indications of success in the taxation and the tracking down of landlords, where is the evidence and where the figures?  Surely they must exist or the indications would not be there.</P>
    <P>In speaking against the amendment the Minister referred continually to the potential cost but the amount the amendment would yield by way of landlord taxation has been ignored.  Yet, this is the crucial element in the whole question. The whole process the amendment would set in train would be a two-way operation. The amendment sets out to subsidise the poorer tenants by taxing the untapped incomes of landlords.  I do not know if we can get further information today from the Minister on this aspect.  I do not see any reason why figures cannot be made available which would give us a clearer view of this whole area.  Even at this late stage I hope the Minister will make some type of commitment to the House.  If, as he says, the amendments before the House are not workable, perhaps he has a mechanism in mind which is workable, which would not cost any money this year and which he could reduce to a minimum next year.  If there were any general indications that the Minister had in mind bringing in on Report Stage such an alternative mechanism based on the principle of the amendment we would all withdraw our amendments.  In the absence of any such commitments, I fully support the amendment <Col N="1235" /> to my amendment which seems to be a reasonable compromise.</P>

      <P>In relation to this question, I said last week that it would be some time before any benefit would accrue to the Exchequer.  The regulations contained in subsection (5) will be broadly administrative and allowances of any kind must be contained in legislation, in particular marginal relief allowances, which are already contained in section 1 (1) (b) and section 2 (iii) of the Finance Act, 1980.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no basis for saying that.  My legal training is that no parliament can bind its successor.  If the Constitution says that marginal relief may not be made by means of regulation then, clearly, that would be the case but the fact that another Act of the Oireachtas passed in 1980, which has no more status than this document, says that, makes no difference whatever.  This section <Col N="1236" /> says that the Revenue Commissioners may make regulations for the purpose of giving effect to this section with respect to the allowance granted by this section or to any matter ancillary or incidental thereto.  In my view, that enables the Revenue Commissioners to make regulations governing marginal relief.  If the Minister wishes, we can circulate another amendment to put in after &ldquo;incidental thereto&rdquo; in brackets, &ldquo;including marginal relief in respect of ...&rdquo; whatever subsection this is going to be in.  Perhaps the Minister thinks that such an amendment would make it more explicit.  However, I do not think it is necessary.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34a:</P>
      <P>In page 17, subsection (2), lines 50 to 53, to delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) In this subsection &lsquo;the relevant limit&rsquo; means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) in the case of a claimant (not being a widow or widower) who is entitled to a deduction under section 138(a), £1,000,</P>
      <P>(ii) in the case of a person being a widow or widower (and but for being a widow or widower would be entitled to a deduction under section 138 (a)), £1,000, and</P>
      <P>(iii) in any other case £750.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 138(a) of the Income Tax Act refers to married couples only as being entitled to the income tax concession involved.  We all accept that widows and widowers are a very weak and disadvantaged section of our community and yet they would not be entitled to this concession. I consider this to be an anomaly in the Income Tax Act and have introduced this amendment to bring widows and widowers into line with married couples for income tax concessions.</P>
      <P>Under (iii) I have asked that in any other case the amount involved be increased from £500 to £750, on the basis that £500 is inadequate.</P>
      <P>The arguments which have been heard at length, both last week and earlier today, in relation to the several other amendments put before the House are also relevant here.  The principle behind the various other amendments is the extension of concessions to the weaker sections of the community in private rented accommodation.  The arguments already put forward are equally relevant here.  I do not intend to delay the business of the House by going yet again through those arguments, but ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to increase the amount of rent on which relief could be claimed from £500 to £1,000 in the case <Col N="1244" /> of a widowed person and from £500 to £750 for a single person.  There would appear to be constitutional difficulties about accepting this amendment.  In the Murphy v. the Attorney General 1980 case, the Supreme Court held that a married couple may not, under the Constitution, be liable for more tax than a corresponding unmarried couple in similar circumstances.  If this amendment were accepted, a married couple paying £2,000 in rent would be allowed only £1,000 and would then pay more tax than an unmarried couple in similar circumstances who share the rent.  For those reasons I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34b.:</P>
      <P>In page 17, subsection (2), after line 53, to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;<i>(c)</i> A claimant, in order to prove entitlement to a deduction under this section shall on making a return provide information as to the identity and address of the person from whom he holds the tenancy and the identity and the address of the person to whom he has made payment on account of rent during the year ending on the 31st December prior to the year of assessment.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1245" /> When arguing the case for the original amendment I made the point that the whole process involved was intended to bring about a situation in which the undeclared, and previously untapped, income of landlords would become liable to taxation and that that, in turn, would subsidise the income of tenants in very poor circumstances.  To enable that to happen I felt that a mechanism should be spelled out whereby an efficient register of landlords could be compiled so that their income might be properly taxed.  To do so I have suggested, in this amendment, that for a tenant to prove entitlement to a deduction he or she shall, on making a return, provide information as to the identity and address of the person from whom he or she holds the tenancy and the identity and address of the person to whom he or she has made payment on account of rent during the year ending on 31 December prior to the year of assessment. The amendment speaks for itself. It is simply a mechanism to establish once and for all something very badly needed, an efficient register of landlords, so that the income accruing to those landlords can be effectively taxed.  I do not think this will be a controversial issue.  I am sure it will be accepted on all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>In the regulations which it is proposed will be made under subsection (5) as soon as the Bill becomes law, provision will be made for the proof of the payment of the rent by the tenant. The regulations will provide that to prove his claim the tenant must furnish certain information to the inspector of taxes.  The information required will be broadly on the lines suggested in the proposed amendment.  Imposing the requirements of the new subsection (c) on tenants was considered in the course of preparation of the Bill.  It was felt that many old persons who paid their rents to rent collectors might not know the name of the landlord and that it would be a hardship for them to be refused relief because they did not have the information available. Accordingly, the genuine inability of the claimant to produce the information <Col N="1246" /> would not be regarded as acting as a bar to relief.</P>
      <P>From the operational point of view the main difficulty anticipated in administering the rent relief is that of arriving at a workable system of proof of rent paid. For this reason the legislation relating to vouching the payments is reserved by the Bill to regulations so that they can be readily amended annually, if necessary and as experience dictates.  As Deputies will know, the regulations will be laid before the House, but I can say that, broadly on the lines suggested in the Deputy's amendment, the regulations will contain the points about which the Deputy is concerned.</P>

      <P>If I understand him correctly the Minister is arguing against this amendment on the basis that there might be circumstances in which the tenant would not be able to identify the landlord and, therefore, could not get the relief if Deputy Gregory's amendment were accepted.  While I am not saying that such cases do not exist, I would be a bit surprised to find they do.  At least an approximate indication should be known.  There may be a situation where the official landlord is acting on behalf of somebody else and is a man of straw.  I would have thought that in all cases at least the tenant would be able to give the name of the man of straw.</P>

      <P>That may be, but as the Deputy knows some people have rent collectors, agents or auctioneers to collect the rents or the actual premises may change hands during the course of any given year.

      <P>All that Deputy Gregory's amendment asks is that information be provided in relation to the identity and address of the person from whom he holds the tenancy.  If the person gives all the information he or she has, that person would be complying with the terms of Deputy Gregory's amendment and it would not be really necessary for that person to provide the definitive name and address, including the address on the Cote D'Azur, where the so-called landlord is living.

      <P>We are talking about people over 65.  There may be procedures which have built up over the years.  I know of tenants who do not know who their landlord is.  Some other agent collects the rent on behalf of the landlord. I am sure the Deputy knows of such cases.  There is absolutely no disagreement between what Deputy Gregory wants and what we intend in the regulations. The question is the necessity of embodying this in the legislation.  I am satisfied the regulations will contain regulations broadly on the lines of the points raised by Deputy Gregory in his proposed amendment.</P>

      <P>I fail to understand what the Minister means despite his clarification.  My amendment seeks to ensure that when a person is applying for entitlement the person should give information as to the identity and address of the person from whom he or she holds the tenancy and the identity and address of the person to whom he or she gives the rent.  If that is what the Minister intends to do I do not see there is any difficulty in accepting the amendment. The amendment is essential to begin a process whereby we will establish a proper register of landlords.  Everybody agrees it is absolutely essential.  I am most reluctant to withdraw this amendment.  If there is no contradiction between the content of the amendment and what the Minister intends to do then surely the Minister can accept it.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to accept that there will be cases of people who cannot give information &mdash; that is all the amendment asks &mdash; as to the identity of the person they give their rent to.  The amendment does not say that the people have to establish a case as to who the landlord of a certain property is.  It states that they should give whatever information is available as to the identity and address of the people involved.  I do not see anything controversial in this.  I do not see anything in it that will raise major problems for tenants.  After all, the amendment is being introduced to benefit tenants and not to work against them.</P>

      <P>There is no difference between us at all but in relation to the Deputy's amendment I am trying to avoid people being barred from getting the relief.  The amendment states clearly that a claimant, in order to prove entitlement to a deduction under this section, shall do certain things.  If we legislate in that way, then people who are not in a position to provide this information &mdash; there are people like that &mdash; will be deprived of their relief.  Such matters, broadly on the lines of what the Deputy has suggested, <Col N="1249" /> would be in the regulations which may be changed, updated and modernised from time to time.  If such suggestions are put into legislation certain individuals may be barred from getting relief because they may not be in a position to provide the identity and address of the person from whom they hold the tenancy and the identity and address of the person to whom they have made payment on account of rent.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gregory's amendment states that it will be necessary to provide information as to the identity and address of the landlord, not necessarily the identity and address if the person has not got it.  Information that would put the Revenue on the right track would be sufficient to comply with the terms of the amendment.  The amendment does not require people to provide the name and address down to the precise box number or the number on the street where the landlord lives.  All that is required is information to that end and in my view that is something that could easily be complied with.  All people are being asked to do is to give whatever information they have, no more.</P>

      <P>Surely a tenant is entitled to know who his or her landlord or landlady is?  That is a modest request.  It would enable the Revenue Commissioners to get income tax from landlords by having a central register compiled.  The purpose of the amendment is twofold, to help tenants find their landlords or landladies and enable the Revenue Commissioners to collect taxes from landlords who do not pay tax now.  I do not know what the Minister is making a song and dance about.  This appears to be a simple matter. Landlords, if they are people of straw or wealth, should have their names made <Col N="1250" /> known to tenants and that should be a basic civil and human right.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> There is little difference in what the Minister has in mind and what is suggested by Deputy Gregory in his amendment. If it were enshrined in the Bill we would have a very rigid operation.  The Minister is suggesting that this be done by regulation because then it could be amended through trial and error.  If we adopt Deputy Gregory's amendment and in three or four months' time when we are faced with an anomaly not thought of when the amendment was being framed we will have to change it in a Finance Bill.

I do not know if it is possible to do that at this stage but we need to know what the Minister proposes. Deputy Gregory's amendment deals with the question of disentitlement of a tenant to make the deduction.  Will the Minister say if he has considered whether the Revenue Commissioners will be entitled under subsection 5 to make a regulation going that far, in other words to actually disentitle tenants from the deduction?  It seems to me that the powers given to the Revenue Commissioners in that subsection would not go so far as to entitle them to disentitle the tenant to make the deduction.</P>

The Revenue Commissioners would make regulations under the various headings as outlined in subsection 5.  Deputy Kemmy said I was making a song and dance about this but I am not.  I am telling the Deputy that what is contained in the amendment will be broadly in the regulations governing this section.  My fear is that if this is <Col N="1251" /> enshrined in legislation people will be debarred from getting the allowance. That is the position and there is no song and dance about it.

The Minister, in answer to Deputy Taylor, said that it was precisely to avoid having to debar people from getting rent relief that he was not putting in a section in the Bill requiring that this information be provided.  If that is his intention what power will the Minister have to get the information at all?  If the regulation is not going to bar people if they do not provide the information and the section does not bar people if they do not provide the information, then nobody will be required to give the information. If that is the case people will not give the information and if they do not give the information money will not be saved.</P>

That is clear but the alternative is also true, that unscrupulous landlords could hide behind faceless agencies or rent collectors to avoid paying income tax in that area.  It would be difficult for anybody to find out, behind a layer of front men, who the landlord is.  Judging by the difficulty that has been encountered in the past by the Revenue Commissioners in pursuing landlords I would be very reluctant to support the Minister in this matter. I do not see any great effort being <Col N="1252" /> made to galvanise the commissioners into going after this type of hidden income.

      <P>I support Deputy Bruton's proposal if Deputy Gregory would consider it.  What we are trying to avoid is the problem where some people do not know who their landlord is.  All they have is the name of an estate agent or solicitor. It would be unfair to deprive somebody of their entitlement because they did not have the landlord's name.  My two colleagues have handled this more than adequately and the purpose in my rising to my feet is that I have had experience of houses which changed hands on numerous occasions but the tenants remained the same.  They do not know who the landlord is.  At best they know the agent when the rent is collected, that is, if it is collected.  That will change on 25 July.  If we want to go after potential sources of new revenue we must be able to identify the landlords.  It should be the name of the agent, landlord or rent collector and the Revenue Commissioners could go after them.</P>

      <P>In page 18, subsection (4), line 29, to delete &ldquo;year of assessment&rdquo;, and to substitute &ldquo;year&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These are textual amendments to the section introducing relief for persons aged 65 years and over.  The amendments are necessary because this relief is to be allowed for rent paid in the year ending 31 December prior to the year of assessment rather than the previous income tax year.  Thus in section 5 (4) which deals with the attribution of rent payment for the particular year for the purpose of relief the relevant period is that running from 1 January to 31 December, that is a year, rather than a year of assessment which runs from 6 April to the following 5 April.  It is necessary to relate the allowance for the tax year, that is 1983-84 commencing 6 April 1983, to the rent paid in the year ending the previous 31 December, that is 31 December 1982 in relation to the 1983-84 year, so that there will be time to include the correct figure on the certificates of tax-free allowances which may be issued to employers to give time to them to operate the certificates on the first pay-day in the next new year. Under the Interpretations Act, 1937 the word &ldquo;year&rdquo; when used without qualification means a period of 12 months beginning on the first day of January in any year.</P>

      <P>In section 5 paragraph (b) on page 17 is an interpretation paragraph which limits the definition of a tenancy by excluding from the concession granted to tenants under the section people who are tenants of a Minister of the Government, the Commissioners of Public Works or a housing authority.  Tenants in that category are excluded from having a right of deduction under the section.  I can understand to some extent why that should be so in the case of a housing authority because there is already an element of subsidisation from public funds <Col N="1258" /> in that situation, but I fail to see why an unfortunate tenant who by some quirk of chance happens to be a tenant of a Minister of the Government or of the Commissioners of Public Works should for that reason be deprived of the same right of deduction in respect of his rent against his tax as any other tenant.  Could the Minister explain why a special situation was put in there?</P>

      <P>It is conceivable that it might be so in the event, for instance, that the OPW acquired a stately home or some such place.  I have a case in mind where An Foras Talúntais own Johnstown Castle and somebody who is a tenant is living in the building and I presume is paying a commercial rent.  In the event that the OPW were, say, to acquire a castle somewhere in the west and were to re-let a flat in that castle to someone or other at a commercial rent or in return for services, the fact that the OPW are the landlords would seem to exclude the tenant from claiming the relief.  I would have thought it would be better, rather than simply ruling out people who are tenants of the OPW or a Minister, to do it on the basis that if the rent is subsidised it is ruled out but in the event that it is not subsidised the tenant could claim the relief.  If you go ahead with this you are precluding the OPW perhaps from charging an economic rent and you are saying almost that the OPW must subsidise any rent to anyone availing of their premises, and perhaps that is not what is intended. The Minister might like to look at this between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have another point for information only.  I note that a tenancy is any period up to 50 years.  I would have thought that <Col N="1259" /> 50 years was rather longer than the average tenancy.  Perhaps it is over-generous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of detailed information, my advice is that, generally speaking, tenancies of this kind are subsidised and that is why this is mentioned here similarly to the local authority subsidisation schemes.  That is all I have to go by but, as the Deputy has suggested, I will have another look at it and see if I can get more detailed information on it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 43:</P>
      <P>In page 20, subsection (2), between lines 4 and 5, to add the following proviso:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that in a case where an individual's total income for the year 1982-83 is of such amount that he is not liable to be charged to income tax, the deduction of £312 (proportionally increased by the percentage figure as represented by the Consumer Price Index to mid-February for each intervening year) shall be carried over to the next subsequent year of assessment in which that individual's income becomes so liable.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is concerned with introducing tax relief for people in respect of pay-related social insurance contributions. I have criticised the way in which the money available for this relief is being used in that by seeking to relieve the burden of PRSI contributions by means of a tax relief one gives disproportionate benefit to those first who are paying tax, those who are paying PRSI and those who are paying no tax get no benefit. Those who are paying tax at a relatively low rate because they have a relatively modest income get a small tax relief and those who are paying tax at a very high rate because they have a very high income will get a much greater benefit <Col N="1260" /> from the tax relief in respect of PRSI contribution.  I believe this is not the right way in which to give relief in respect of PRSI.  That is not to say that I do not believe there is a case for giving relief in respect of PRSI but if there is I think the way to do it would be to exempt some categories of low income workers from PRSI altogether and give to those who are at the bottom of the income scale rather than giving proportionately more to those who are at the top.  That is my general view of this matter.</P>
    <P>I am trying in this amendment to mitigate somewhat the unfavourable way in which the system is going to work.  At the moment if a person has a low income, so low that he does not pay income tax, or so low that the income tax is so little that he cannot fully use up the tax allowance he is given for PRSI in the section, if he cannot claim it this year either at all or in full he is not allowed to carry it forward into next year or any subsequent year when he might have an income sufficiently high to enable him to pay income tax and thereby use the relief.  What I am saying in the amendment is that if you do not use the relief this year, you can carry it forward to next year.  That will specifically and solely help people on low incomes.  It is only those people who will benefit, those who are working this year but do not use the allowance because their income is too low.  They are the only people with any interest because people who have sufficient income this year will use the relief this year and to carry forward would be of no benefit to them. This amendment is designed to help low income people in respect of PRSI by allowing them to claim the allowance in subsequent years.  It is a reasonable amendment.  It will cost nothing at all this year and if it costs anything it will be next year and it will be very little then.</P>
    <P>I concede that the number of workers who have taxable incomes but who are not in fact paying tax because their incomes are so low is not very great.  The number who are on very low incomes this year and who will be on an income high enough next year to need the tax relief will also not be very great.  Therefore the cost next year will not be very much but <Col N="1261" /> it is a concession towards the low paid and in this context it is reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment provides for the carrying forward only of the full allowance and does not cater for the situation where an individual could benefit from part of the allowance in 1982-1983. That is one of the first things wrong. We had some discussion on this when the motion was going through the Dáil and I have considered the proposal since it was first put forward by Deputy Bruton and I have concluded that I must continue to oppose this amendment.</P>
      <P>What the amendment proposes would be in conflict with a principle that is basic in relation to personal allowances in the income tax code, that is that allowances and reliefs are available only for a particular tax year and if unused they are not available to carry forward.  If an unused PRSI allowance were to be carried forward it would be difficult to resist the carry-forward of other personal allowances and this would lead to considerable confusion and would give rise to manipulation of income.  The proposed amendment also introduces the concept of indexation of income tax allowances. Acceptance of such a concept would greatly reduce budgetary flexibility and deprive the Minister for Finance of an important discretion in making budget decisions in subsequent years.  When this matter was discussed in May and the £45 million PAYE/PRSI concession was introduced, the Government and I at that time said that we were moving to ease the burden caused for many people by increases in the level of PRSI.  Mainly arising from discussions with the Congress of Trade Unions and others the double taxation element of PRSI was the major bone of contention.  We said we are moving in that direction by giving this allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also said that it was for this year as an interim measure and that the whole PRSI system will be subject to a review. Hopefully by next year a much fairer system will be in operation.  Taking those things into account I think the House should accept my word in that regard and <Col N="1262" /> that Deputy Bruton should withdraw his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made two contradictory arguments.  He said this allowance was only an interim measure, which would presumably mean that it will not apply in subsequent years.  Then he said that any changes that we might make, even though it is only an interim measure, might be a precedent and cited in other instances.  I cannot see why he should be so worried about precedent if he is only talking about amendments to a measure which he has said is only an interim one and therefore not introducing a permanent element into the income tax code.</P>
      <P>The only argument he adduced against this amendment is that it would be new, it had not been done before and therefore should not be done now.  That does not convince.  We must recognise that this is an exceptional type of proposal &mdash; to give tax relief in respect of tax.  Soon we will have a situation where we will be proposing tax relief in respect of tax relief in respect of tax; it is reaching that degree of absurdity that we shall have to amend the tax code in order to iron out something we have done elsewhere in another form of revenue raising activity.  However I think the net point is that this proposal assists the low-paid, the people who have such low incomes that they cannot claim the allowance this year.  It enables them to claim it in subsequent years.  It will not cost anything this year and very little next year.  It assists the low-paid workers.  I do not see why the fact that it has not been done before should stop the Minister from doing it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some difficulty with this amendment in that I do not see entirely Deputy Bruton's point that it would help only the lower paid.  I say this because if a person had a substantial tax free allowance, made up perhaps by way of substantial interest payments up to the maximum and by reason of his having a large family, by carrying the allowances forward we could equally be helping people on higher incomes, that is, if their allowances were of sufficient order to bring them up to the limit.  In other words, we would not necessarily be providing relief for the lower paid.  By carrying the allowances forward, as is proposed by Deputy Bruton, we could be helping those people who could not avail of the relief in one year to use it in the second year and these could well happen to be people on substantial salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other difficulty I have in regard to <Col N="1264" /> the amendment relates to the whole principle of carrying forward personal allowances because if once accepted this is a principle that could lead to all sorts of demands from virtually every Deputy in the House to do the same in respect of much more deserving cases.  In the case of people who incur large interest payments and who have large families, their salaries may not be big enough for them to avail of the maximum amount of allowances. If we were to accept Deputy Bruton's proposal, why not carry forward allowances in respect of children, marriage allowances and so on, in the event of the people concerned not being in a position to avail of them in a particular year?  But if we were to agree to this principle I could think of a long list that would be ahead in terms of urgency so far as tax allowances are concerned.  If we are to talk about carrying forward allowances, I would be thinking of the various personal allowances but if we were to break the principle as suggested by Deputy Bruton, we would be running into extreme difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If people are in the situation described by Deputy Brennan that is that even with seemingly high incomes they would not have large taxable incomes we must remember that this is one of the problems about our tax code that we might very well have regard to. I do not wish to follow Deputy Brennan on the philosophy of carrying allowances forward.  The Deputy is probably aware of the work being done by NESC about the cycle of family poverty.  This shows that at certain points in the family cycle, when there are a large number of young people, the same family in the same position and at the same level are much worse off than when they did not have children or when the children had grown up.  There is a case for trying to even out this rather abrupt cycle whereby people, because they take on family responsibilities, are dramatically worse off and where they become better off once their children go out to work.  That is simply because of the way in which the tax code operates, taking one year on its own and considering a family's responsibilities for <Col N="1265" /> that year.  I realise that to meet that sort of situation the tax code would have to be a lot more sophisticated than it is but there is a case for doing something in this area.  I still adhere to my view that in real terms the people who would benefit from my proposal are the lower paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> Deputy Bruton has made some of the points I intended making also but he is opening up a totally new field here.  We know that people can get fairly substantial tax reliefs if they are in a position to avail of the various allowances though they may have substantial salaries.  However, I do not think that what Deputy Bruton is proposing is the best way of giving relief to those about whom Deputy Bruton is concerned.  I would much prefer to see the money being paid back by way of children's allowances.  It would be very difficult for the Minister to confine the principle contained in Deputy Bruton's proposal to the lower paid.  I could not agree with Deputy Bruton that his proposal if accepted would not cost anything this year.  It is wrong that we should be writing sections into a Finance Bill that would have the effect of building up debts for next year.  We had it in the previous section and we are doing it again here.  We should draft a Finance Bill for the year in question and then budget for it.  I do not agree that everything is all right because whatever we are legislating for will only happen in 1983 or 1984.  We should budget for whatever cost is to be incurred this year.  I agree with the Minister that the whole field of PRSI will have to be looked at.  We all know that there are some hardships but we should be able to look at this whole area with a view to giving relief to the lower paid workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer by far to grant this amendment and reduce the extent of the relief, most of which will go in bulk to people who are well off, in order to help the less well off.  If the Minister wishes to have a nil-cost amendment I am prepared to go along with him in reducing the overall effect of the relief by whatever amount is necessary to enable <Col N="1266" /> it to be carried forward so as to help the lower paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If one examines the tax rates one finds that at least £15 million of the £45 million benefited those earning more than £9,500 per year.  Only those who are earning up to that income are liable for PRSI in the first instance. Therefore, the net effect of that relief of £45 million, regardless of whatever device by which it was worked out, is as I have indicated.  I have reason to believe that the whole process by which the relief was granted was a wholly haphazard piece of representation and negotiation and that it was not thought through in any way.  Undoubtedly, Deputy Bruton's amendment is far more progressive than even the existing provision of the £312. We are faced with a considerable problem here.  The Minister has told us that the provision was a once off situation and was in response to the double taxation element within PRSI.  What is implicit in that statement is that it is all to be absorbed next year into the general provision of taxation.</P>
      <P>I would have argued that if I had £45 million to give away by way of relief I would give it to large families, with special relief in respect of the third, fourth and fifth children.  It is amazing what £10 million or £12 million would provide by way of relief.  I would have given it by exempting the first £2,000 of taxable income from PRSI.  That could have been done.</P>
      <P>I do not blame the Minister for Finance.  I blame the Taoiseach who panic-stricken said &ldquo;Let us do something about PRSI&rdquo;.  The people who are most vocal about PRSI for the most part are most capable of paying it.  They got the greatest relief.  In Ireland it is not a question of whether you are well off or poor. It is a question of political muscle.</P>

      <P>I got a belt over the head from some of my close colleagues every time I surfaced on it.  If you are giving relief, and I favour giving relief, you give it to those in greatest need. Deputy Bruton's amendment is almost what I would call a retribution amendment. If people mess around like that with taxation relief, inevitably this type of amendment is provoked.  I do not know what the Minister will do next year. Presumably he will absorb the £45 million in the personal allowances, or endeavour to do something of that nature.  Perhaps he will abolish it altogether and, if he does, all hell will break loose after next year's budget.</P>
      <P>The amendment has highlighted the anomalous position of PRSI and the appalling mess created by the granting of £45 million relief, which effectively reduced workers' contributions from about £200 million a year to £165 million, or thereabouts.  That was a fair old shift in liability, but it did not do much good in the long run.  The Minister has my sympathy.  If I know his mind, originally he would not have done this, by-election or no by-election, representations or no representations.  The ground was pulled from under his feet by the Taoiseach who wanted to give them something to keep them quiet, and the wrong people got the benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much to add to what I have already said.  It is no harm to remind Deputy Bruton and the House that the youth employment levy was introduced when Deputy Bruton and Deputy Desmond were members of the Government last December.  Some months before that they talked about having a minimum limit to help the lower paid workers about whom we have heard so much over the past few weeks.  When the youth employment levy legislation was passed in the Dáil last December the 1 per cent levy was right across the board, <Col N="1268" /> with no minimum exemptions and no limits. I do not know how they can justify that as compared with the bleeding from the heart they are doing now for some sections of the community.</P>
      <P>What I have said is positive.  We moved because of the impact of the PRSI increases, which were identical to what was passed in December, proposed in the 27 January budget and passed by the Dáil before 25 March, and to ease the burden on many people.  I had representations from and contacts and discussions with ICTU and because of the double taxation element involved in PRSI we introduced the £45 million concession for those paying the high level of PRSI.  The whole PRSI system will be reviewed and I hope we will be able to have a much fairer system in operation after the next budget.</P>

When he did that, he gave most to the best off and least to the less well off.  He has nothing to be boastful or superior about in his record on this matter.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to what I think is the heart of the amendment.  I take some of the points Deputy Bruton is making in a broader sense about the PRSI structure.  The House is faced with very specific wording which asks specifically for a carry forward of allowances to which I have already referred.  At the very centre of this amendement is a request for indexation of allowances.  It is tucked away innocuously at the centre of the amendment.  If we are to improve and reform our taxation system, which I hope will be done as soon as possible, it should not slip through as part of an amendment to the Bill.  It is much broader than that.  For many years Ministers for Finance &mdash; I cannot recall whether Deputy Bruton was one of them but I suspect he was &mdash; read out pages and pages of reasons why we cannot index allowances such as marriage allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I never did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Bruton would tell us that in principle he <Col N="1270" /> supports the indexation of allowances. My recollection is that most Ministers for Finance saw the reality of the situation that once you start to index allowances to the cost of living, you are getting into a fierce spiral which will lead to quite severe financial difficulties for the Exchequer.  If Deputy Bruton believes that indexation as a principle does not bother him, and that he will be happy to look at it if his day ever comes again, the House should be told that.  It should not creep in innocuously in this way.</P>
      <P>It is a much broader and deeper question. It raises the whole question of social welfare allowances being indexed at some time.  Irrespective of the points made about PRSI, we are stuck with the wording of the amendment in which the whole area of indexation is introduced. If we are for it in this amendment we have to look at it over a broad list of areas across the board.  I do not think it should creep in in this fashion.  If we are to look at the indexation of allowances, we should do it more calmly, across the board in a more comprehensive manner. I do not think we can accept this amendment as a once off allowance, which, by its nature is obviously a temporary one.</P>

      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>Go n-iarrann Dáil Éireann ar an Rialtas fiosrúchán breithniúnach a bhunú, mar ábhar práinne, maidir leis an modh ina ndearna Údarás na Gaeltachta agus a fhoireann a fheidhmeanna a chomhlíonadh faoi fhorálacha an Achta um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls upon the Government to establish as a matter of urgency, a judicial inquiry into the manner in which Údarás na Gaeltachta and its staff have carried out its functions under the provisions of the Údarás na Gaeltachta Act, 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is é seo ceann de na díospóireachtaí is tábhachtaí a tháinig os comhair an Tí le déanaí.  Brathann an tÚdarás agus na tionscail faoi leith atá sna Gaeltachtaí ar an toradh a thiocfaidh as an díospóireacht seo.  Mar sin, sílim go bhfuil sé antábhachtach ar fad.  Tá sé sách deacair orm labhairt amach anseo go rí-láidir agus Aire na Gaeltachta as mo bhaile féin agus mo dháil cheantar féin agus mo <Col N="1274" /> chontae féin i láthair.  Má bhíonn gearán agam faoi seo, ba mhaith liom a rá nach gearán pearsanta atá ann; nílim ag lochtadh an Aire.</P>
    <P>One of the principal reasons put forward in the Minister's amendment is that the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies could properly assess this case.  I would point out that the committee became defunct in May 1981 and have not sat since.  The committee was not reconstituted.  Although the members worked effectively up to that time, they had not debated any aspect of government or of the State-Sponsored Bodies which were referred to the committee initially.</P>
    <P>If the committee was reconstituted now it would probably be next October before its first meeting and it would probably be at least six months before any result would issue from its deliberations. It could well be 18 months or two years before any conclusive findings were published. Because of that I consider the suggestion of referring this matter to the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies is not relevant in view of the serious allegations and the deep cloud of suspicion that has descended over Údarás na Gaeltachta, not through the fault of any of their hard-working people.  I wish to debate those issues this evening.</P>
    <P>Ritheadh an tAcht i 1979 faoi chúram Aire as mo chontae féin, an Teachta Gallagher agus bhí díospóireachtaí ar siúl anseo ar feadh seachtainí.  Bhí mé ag léamh na ndíospóireachtaí sin an lá cheana agus ní fhaca mé óráid ar bith ón Aire atá ann faoi láthair i dtaobh Údarás na Gaeltachta nó faoin mBille a bhí ag dul tríd an Teach ag an am sin.  Feicim anois go bhfuil grá íontach faighte aige don teanga agus don Údarás.</P>
    <P>Ba é cuspóir an Achta nuair a ritheadh é go ndéanfadh an tUdarás caomhnú agus leathnú na Gaeilge mar príomhmheánchumarsáide sa Ghaeltacht a spreagadh, agus go gcinnteodh sé gurb í an Ghaeilge a úsáidfí nuair a bheadh an tÚdarás ag comhlíonadh a n-aidhmeanna. Sílim go ndéantar é sin agus go bhfuil muintir na nGaeltachtaí agus lucht Údarás na Gaeltachta ag plé a nithe as <Col N="1275" /> Gaeilge chomh maith agus is féidir. Cuspóir eile an Achta, in alt 10:</P>
    <P>Chun tionscail agus scéimeanna táirgiúla fostaíochta a bhunú, a fhorbairt nó a chothabháil sa Ghaeltacht, beidh cumhacht ag an Údarás, faoi réir an ailt seo, cúnamh airgid a thabhairt (lena n-áirítear deontais a thabhairt, scaireanna a cheannach agus caiteachas a thabhú ar fhoirgnimh nó eile) ar cibé téarmaí agus faoi réir cibé coinníollacha is cuí leis.</P>
    <P>Cuspóir eile an Achta ná go ndéanfadh Údarás na Gaeltachta faoi alt 10 nationscail agus na scéimeanna táirgiúla fostaíochta a bheadh ar siúl a rialadh nó a bhainistí agus, díreach nó indíreach go gcuirfí ainm Ghaeltarra Éireann isteach san Údarás.  Bhí toghcháin le bheith ann de réir mar a fhorordófar le rialacháin ón Aire.</P>
    <P>The Act provided for the establishment of a body for the purpose of promoting the linguistic, cultural, social, physical and economic development of the Gaeltacht, an tÚdarás shall have, in addition to the functions specified in this Act, apart from this section, such powers as are conferred on it by order made by the Government, agus mar sin, bhí an áis ann go mbeadh cumhachtaí eile ag an Údarás dá mba rud é go raibh siad ag teastáil.  Bhí nithe eile acu freisin chun a gcuspóir agus a n-aidhmeanna a chomhlíonadh.</P>
    <P>Since the first day the Údarás na Gaeltachta Bill was circulated and since the Údarás came into being, it has been dogged at different intervals by a spate of very bad publicity emanating from different sources.  This has culminated in a series of events that have precipitated this motion and resulted in the public perception of the Údarás as being under deep suspicion, which warrants looking into.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the Údarás in 1979 and since díospóireachtaí took place on it in this House, one of the principal allegations of the Fianna Fáil Government is that the Fine Gael Party, at different intervals, have not been the guardian <Col N="1276" /> of the Irish language and have tried to do away with the Údarás by the introduction of some other board which would take its place and introduce a different type of development for the Gaeltacht regions.  That is not true and, as party spokesman for the Gaeltacht, I wish to state categorically that I respect Údarás na Gaeltachta, its members, workers and people of the Gaeltacht.  We want to see the Gaeltacht developed in the fullest way possible.  We want to see a love generated for the Irish language, ár dteanga dhúchais, in a realistic manner, and not just lip service paid to it by adopting the hypocritical attitude that has been shown to it down through the years by different people in the Government.  It is a very serious issue.  The survival of the Gaeltacht rests upon the shoulders of the Minister and he must take action accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Commission for the Gaeltacht was set up by Mr. Cosgrave in 1926 with the late Deputy Mulcahy as its head.  From that until 1956, when the Department of the Gaeltacht was founded, nothing of real advantage or progress took place in Gaeltacht areas.  It was not until 1973 that the Coalition Government saw fit to appoint a full Minister for the Gaeltacht, an t-iar Aire Tomás O'Donnell a bhí in a Aire le ceithre bliain go leith, an téarma is faide a bhí ag Aire na Gaeltachta ar bith.  When he was appointed Minister he brought a new image to the Ministry of the Gaeltacht, increased its workforce approximately from 1,800 to 4,000. There were industries set up which were not successful but, by and large, he brought a new awareness of the Gaeltacht areas and the Irish language to our people.  He fostered an insight and a love of things Irish that has not been in evidence since.  The 55,800 residents of the different Gaeltachtaí went to the polls in December and the election that took place was democratic in so far as the members of the Údarás going forward for election were returned to their various positions.  The Minister of the day made appointments, and some of these people were very hard working and had a genuine awareness of the needs and problems of the different Gaeltachtaí throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> When iar Aire na Gaeltachta, an Teachta Geoghegan-Quinn, took over on 15 December 1979 <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial said that the authority must not become an organisation of wranglers with area representatives fighting for the maximum benefits for their parties, a glorified county council in fact.  Silim féin go dtárla sé sin ó shin agus go bhfuil cuid de na baill tofa ag troid in aghaidh a chéile i gcóir na gceantar as a dtagann siad féin.</P>
    <P>The article went on to say that the Gaeltacht authorities should be a step in the right direction and that it would be watched with extreme interest in other parts of the country in that it was the first occasion when development could take place by elected people from the Gaeltacht itself.</P>
    <P>On 24 December 1979 an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> questioned whether the Údarás would protect the unique character of the Gaeltacht and went on to describe the various problems arising in relation to planning permissions, factories, despoliation of high amenity areas and the necessity for caution and care in consideration of planning permissions going before it.</P>
    <P>On 5 January 1980 a supplement to <i>The Irish Times</i> stated that the new Gaeltacht authority had held its first meeting. At that meeting the Minister said that with the commencement of the eighties we relied on An tÚdarás to provide full employment for Irish speakers as soon as possible.  He said that the Údarás na Gaeltachta Act, 1979, contained all the powers held by Gaeltarra, and more.  He also said that stronger emphasis than ever was placed on the Irish language in the new Act.  Those aspirations have not been fulfilled and could not be fulfilled as the Údarás only came into operation shortly after that date.  The Minister went on to state that if Údarás na Gaeltachta requested further powers or further authorities for itself she would be quite willing to consider those and would sympathetically consider how she might satisfy the Government in having these powers granted to Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>On 7 January 1980 in the same newspaper the headline read &ldquo;Gaeltacht Authority Picketed&rdquo;.  Ceart na nGael, a <Col N="1278" /> pressure group down there, called for further powers for Údarás na Gaeltachta similar to those of the Highlands and Islands Board in Scotland which has extensive powers which the present Údarás does not have.  On 24 April 1980 in the same newspaper a headline read &ldquo;Lack of Údarás Activity Claimed&rdquo;. Questions were asked in the Dáil by Deputy Begley who objected to foreign people buying land in rural areas who were often fronted for by Irish people and there was a series of other questions asked by him.</P>
    <P>On 6 June 1980 in the same paper the question was asked again by Deputy Begley in relation to the appointment of the chairman of the board of Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The then Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, said that she had appointed him on a temporary, whole-time basis to give him more time to understand the complexities of the job. I want to say in defence of the chairman of Údarás na Gaeltachta that he is my county manager; he is also a director of the Connaught Regional Airport and in fairness to him, it has been bandied about by different people that he was a purely political appointment by Fianna Fáil.  I have no such complication in my mind in relation to his appointment.  The appointment of the chairman initially was on the understanding that there would be approximately two meetings per month. But the events that have taken place within the Údarás since have passed out the ability of any single person to manage effectively all of the meetings that are involved between being manager of a county council and all the commitments that that involves and the very onerous tasks of having to chair the board of Údarás na Gaeltachta when allegations and bad publicity and criticism abound throughout the country.  I want to say that in his defence.  It is not easy for him to make up his mind at this stage what the position really is.  Again, in fairness to him, he has not made any public comment, good, bad or indifferent to the media about the events that have taken place in recent times and nobody would know better than he of these events.</P>
    <P>On 14 August 1980 a headline in the <Col N="1279" /> same newspaper read &ldquo;Údarás Criticised over Layoffs&rdquo;.  Údarás na Gaeltachta was criticised on that occasion by the Labour Court for the way in which it had laid off nine building workers in the Connemara Gaeltacht.  The story of that was given in the paper.</P>
    <P>On 2 October 1980 a newspaper headline read &ldquo;Údarás Faced with £800,000 Loss&rdquo;.  This referred to the Sinteis Éire Teoranta factory in Carraig in County Donegal and the then chief executive officer said that it was one of the worst collapses that the Authority had ever had to face and involved a large number of jobs in an area that had been starved of employment and ravaged by emigration. The fact that it depended upon the sales ability abroad has similar connotations today.  The chief executive officer was clearly upset by the action and indicated the concern of the Údarás at the time to make some amends and to take shares in the operation but the then industrial chiefs wanted the Údarás to take full shares in the industry and it was not felt feasible to do that and so it closed down with the loss of £800,000.</P>
    <P>On 21 October the Minister for the Gaeltacht announced new jobs for the Gaeltacht with seven new industrial projects having a potential of 300 jobs in different areas in Gaeltachtaí throughout the country.  That was very welcome news indeed.</P>
    <P>On 16 December in an article, again in <i>The Irish Times</i>, the new Authority was referred to.  The article stated that it was the first move to involved the people of those shrinking areas in Galetacht politics and would be watched with fascination by everybody who believed that local people should be able to play an important role in what emerged as a whole.  It went on to say that the western areas had suffered on for years and that the last thing they needed now was unfulfilled promises, that this had been the stock in trade for years but now at least we had national official recognition of the existence of the Gaeltacht.  Údarás na Gaeltachta has not been given the opportunity to function as effectively as it can.  With a little more inspection of its structure, <Col N="1280" /> with a little more recognition by the Government of the need for proper public relations within the Údarás and the Department of the Gaeltacht and its effectiveness, it could be made into a very important and very real body respected by people throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
    <P>On 1 March 1979 when the Bill was circulated all of these matters were debated and different speakers indicated that the Údarás did not have the necessary powers to do its job, that it was merely a fulfilment of a promise given by the Government prior to that in the 1977 manifesto, that it merely retained the functions of Gaeltarra Éireann under a different guise.  Údarás na Gaeltachta has never been allowed to flourish effectively and in so far as I represent the interests of this party I want to see that it gets that chance.  As time goes by I hope that we will be able to implement that.</P>
    <P>In an article on about 11 April &mdash; I do not have the exact date &mdash; the chief executive of Údarás na Gaeltachta attacked mischievous people who were trying to do down the Gaeltacht.  This was at the formal launching by the Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, of the Údarás na Gaeltachta foundation for linguistic and cultural development which had come about after an anonymous individual had donated £25,000 to the Údarás to be used in the fostering, development and protection of the language and culture of the Gaeltacht and the enterprises assisted or operated by the Údarás.  This allocation of £25,000 by an anonymous individual for such a laudable scheme was very welcome. Údarás na Gaeltachta have not really concentrated on that aspect of their work and the cultural, linguistic and social development of the Gaeltachts have never been advanced either.  The Údarás has become bogged down in the competition with the IDA to bring industrial development into the Gaeltacht in an attempt to provide suitable employment based on either foreign or local raw materials for the young people of the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>On 11 April 1981 the then chief executive officer of the Údarás resigned and took up a position with a Japanese <Col N="1281" /> machinery firm.  At that time rumours abounded about this firm and as to how machinery had become available to different co-operatives and factories along the western seaboard.  The resignation of the chief executive officer was greeted with dismay by everybody and he was duly congratulated for the 15 years of dedicated service he had given to the building of the Gaeltacht areas as the head of Gaeltarra Éireann.  I say in his defence, that the people now working in factories and industries set up by Gaeltarra Éireann have to be thankful for his energy and devotion to duty at that time.</P>
    <P>The new executive of the Údarás took over on 23 June 1981.  Since then the queries and the rumours and the allegations have flourished.  I have no doubt that that chief executive officer and his staff were faced with enormous problems on taking over the new Údarás because of the effects of the oil recession, international competition and the IDA being unable to bring in the necessary amount of industry to the Gaeltacht areas.  They were faced with enormous problems. Looking at the lame ducks which had previously been brought into the Gaeltacht areas, sooner or later a decision had to be taken either to close down these factories or make an effort to keep them going even under half steam.  When the change of Government came and the Coalition Government were appointed, queries came before the then Minister for the Gaeltacht, Deputy O'Toole, for tuille airgid, he in his turn began to raise questions as to why this so often should be the case.  On 26 January 1982 subsequent to an announcement by the Coalition Government on 8 December 1981 that a public inquiry would be held into the affairs of Údarás na Gaeltachta, a headline appeared in the newspapers concerning the fraud squad being sent in to examine the books and accounts of certain companies under the auspices of Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The announcement of an investigation was greeted with dismay in many quarters and questions about it were raised in this House.  When the present Aire na Gaeltachta came into office to Roinn na Gaeltachta, dúirt sé nach raibh téarmaí tagartha ar bith le fáil aige, <Col N="1282" /> agus nach raibh fhios aige cén caoi a ndeárna an iar-Chomhrialtas an earáid sin go mbéadh fiosrúchán i dtaobh an Údarás.</P>
    <P>On 26 January, <i>The Irish Times</i> had a headline that the inquiry must clear doubts on Údarás Fianna Fáil.  It continued:</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil spokeswoman on the Gaeltacht, Mrs. Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, said yesterday that if there was a hint of fraud involving Údarás na Gaeltachta, then any investigation of that body should be handled by the gardaí.  &ldquo;Who else would be capable of investigating alleged fraudulent activities in the Údarás&rdquo; she asked.  The government called in the Fraud Squad in the Érin Foods case after allegations were made.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn sharply criticised the proposal by the Government to investigate the activities of the Údarás, though now that doubts had been sown, the investigation must go ahead, she said.</P>
    <P>The point that the investigations must go ahead is the important point of my argument. A cloud of suspicion has descended on Údarás na Gaeltachta which has stulted and impeded its effectiveness and has not allowed its executive board or its members to function properly, or even the Minister himself.  Of all the Ministers for the Gaeltacht who have ever come into this House, the Minister sitting opposite me has surely the most subtle verbal skills of the lot.  He is the most vociferous exponent of the art of verbal self-defence when necessity arises.  The Irish language supporters can be proud that they have somebody who can talk his way out of any corner if put to it, and often as he has proved in the past, he does not even need a microphone.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly, Údarás is potentially very effective, but has not been allowed to do its duty as it should and no member of that board could even attempt to bring an industrialist into a Gaeltacht area to set up because of the trouble with banking loans and so forth.  Once allegations, rumours, or even doubts are heard by potential industrialists, they are gone like <Col N="1283" /> the wind.  It is difficult enough even for the IDA to bring industrialists into the country at present, but faced with the geographical locations of most of our Gaeltacht areas, with their very poor infrastructures, their road systems, power system and water system it is immensely more difficult.  The effectiveness of the Údarás is not being helped by the clouds of doubts which have descended on it.</P>
    <P>That article went on to state that the criticism of the Údarás had begun with allegations made concerning land deals and innuendoes of fraud against a Gaeltacht newspaper.  Since then these issues have been raised on different occasions and they are causing a great deal of concern.</P>
    <P>On 27 January, nuair tháinig sí isteach anseo, chuir sí ceist ar an iar-Aire, an Teachta O'Toole, faoin fiosrúcán a bhí le cur ar bun ag an iar-Chomhrialtas, dúirt sí &ldquo;If the Government believed that there was fiddling going on, the sooner the inquiry got under way the better.&rdquo; Bhí a lán ceisteanna eile aici le cur ar an iar-Aire faoi na téarmaí tagartha a bhí ag an fiosrúchán, faoí na cumhachtaí a bheadh aige agus na baill a bheadh ag freastail air.  D'iarr sí freagra ionnas go mbeadh an Teach in ann é seo a phlé.</P>
    <P>On 9 and 10 April of this year, <i>The Irish Times</i> again gave a headline that the fraud squad were investigating four Údarás companies.  These companies were named and one in particular was dealt with in some detail.  The question of the former Minister for the Gaeltacht modifying his stance on the original Government proposal was also dealt with there, as was the fact that the present Minister for the Gaeltacht had given no indication that he would go ahead and a statement has been made by the present Taoiseach that no public inquiry was necessary and as such, that he would not see fit to conduct one.</P>
    <P>Ar 18 Aibreán i mbliana chuir an Teachta Begley ceist ar Aire na Gaeltachta faoi na monarchana sna Gaeltachtaí atá follamh.  San freagra, tugadh an t-eolas go bhfuil 26 ann.</P>
    <P>Most of those factories could not really <Col N="1284" /> be called factories as they are quite small. Others have potential projects in view and there are at least ten or 12 which are empty.  In that context, the Minister's recent announcement that he intends to curtail the building of advance factories is welcome.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Amárach</i> issue of 4 June under the tideal &ldquo;Cúl Caint&rdquo; there was the gratuitous defamation of a former Minister of this House, Paddy Lindsay, and on 25 June there was a complete retraction and total withdrawal of the remarks made about this former Minister.  Is it in order for a publication receiving some State assistance to participate in that kind of defamation of former Ministers and then issue full-scale apologies?</P>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton on 15 February 1979 asked the Minister the action taken in respect of shortcomings and disparities in the accounts of semi-State bodies and recommendations for their improvements, agus tugadh an freagra go raibh áird tugtha orthu sin.</P>
    <P>A letter to a Rights Commissioner from Beirtreach Teo. dated 31 May, mentions that the Government have not given the redundancy payments recommended by the Rights Commissioner. This was for the first time.  The letter states:</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that Beirtreach Teo. is a subsidiary company of Údarás na Gaeltachta and as such depends on the Údarás for finance.  The Údarás in turn is funded by the Government and consequently any finance granted to Beirtreach must have prior Government approval.</P>
    <P>We had been directed by the Government at the time of the Beirtreach redundancies not to offer monies in excess of the statutory obligation in respect of redundancy payments where such monies would have to be provided by the State.  Consequently, I must advise you that the company is not in a position to comply with your recommendation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> on 30 June indicated that the former Minister for the Gaeltacht sat for months on a file which he produced in this House some time ago with reterence <Col N="1285" /> to allegations of break-ins and so forth.  The former Minister was well able to answer for himself in that instance.</P>
    <P>The <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 4 July had a headline &ldquo;Balance Sheet gap of £8 million Puts Ministers on the Rack&rdquo;.  It refers to Údarás na Gaeltachta's first annual accounts published some 18 weeks ago which showed a discrepancy of approximately £8 million and asked the question: are there others yet to be revealed?  It went on to question the fact that again Deputy Begley wanted to know whether the liability was £41,791,000, as contained in the finance accounts, or was this reduced by £6.954 million according to the Údarás Annual Report.  It went on to query the methods used by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>As I have said, public perception of Údarás na Gaeltachta has really been sharpened and brought to light by the recent RTE &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme which dealt with the history of the Gaeltachtaí, the history of the Údarás and went into detail on some land speculative deals particularly in the south of Ireland.  Questions were asked of people who had served as Ministers, as members of the Údarás, people who had been involved in co-operative movements and development societies for the Gaeltacht and so on.  The fact that over £100 million had been spent by Gaeltarra Éireann over the last 20 years in attempting to industrialise the Gaeltacht is a source of concern.  The kernel of this programme seemed to circle around the buying of a portion of land in the south of Ireland for £150,000; whether this was a method of paying individuals to keep liquidity in companies is something I am not quite sure of.  The allegations and rumours that abound about this particular land deal need to be clarified by the Minister whose responsibility this is.</P>
    <P>The introduction by the Minister last evening of a special preas agallamh i gContae na Gaillimhe, áit a raibh plean an-tábhachtach leagtha amach aige do fhorbairt na Gaeltachtaí sna bliana atá le teacht, was nothing short of really trying to pre-empt discussion in this House.  I felt he could have waited 24 more hours to announce his plans for the Gaeltachtaí <Col N="1286" /> for the eighties and bring it into this forum where it should be announced by any Minister.  The fact that a speedy press conference was called in County Galway and this development announced &mdash; which is really a continuation of what was said before with some slight changes &mdash; makes one wonder whether the Minister is going back on his initial defence of his position.  Indeed it brings into question his reason for putting down an amendment to the motion at all.</P>
    <P>I also want clarification from the Minister on whether he is entitled to do this with Údarás na Gaeltachta as, under the Act as laid down, I feel that the Údarás is somewhat independent of the Minister in its activities.  One could query the ability of the Údarás to function effectively, whether it is reasonable to have the Secretary of Roinn na Gaeltachta serving as a member of the Údarás itself.  It may be worth bearing in mind that the Industrial Development Authority function in a different manner, that they have an executive body, the chairman of the board of which is a member of the executive and the executive is responsible to the board for overall decisions.  I want absolute clarification from the Minister on this in his reply.</P>
    <P>On the RTE 1 programme &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; on 27 June, when asked about the concern about financial malpractices within the Údarás the Minister said that it did concern him a great deal that publicity had been given to it and that he believed that certain aspects warranted investigation by the fraud squad. The Minister's defence of the judicial inquiry call was that it would cause at least two years paralysis of the Údarás, that there would be resultant job losses, and that it would be of enormous cost to the State. The Minister is right in one aspect of that. The Government would do well to look at some sort of interim judicial inquiry in respect of this.  The depth of concern of people throughout the length and breadth of the country, their feeling and perception of the Údarás is such that nothing short of a judicial inquiry, with very strict terms of reference, time and cost limits, would be effective.</P>
    <P>I want to see Údarás na Gaeltachta as <Col N="1287" /> an effective body able to promote the cultural, social and linguistic development of our Gaeltacht areas as is envisaged in the motion put to the European Parliament this morning by the former Minister for the Gaeltacht, Deputy Tom O'Donnell, indicating an action plan for the Gaeltacht which I certainly should like to see implemented and which I should like to see Údarás na Gaeltachta being able to implement.  However, they cannot do so under present circumstances. It is simply not fair for any member of the Údarás to have to bear the burden of suspicion, doubt and personal innuendo cast against him in a very competitive area while trying to provide jobs for young people in our Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Gaeltacht challenged the former Minister as to the dates of certain documents, whether he was going to do something about them.  I will leave the former Minister to answer that for himself.  The Minister then went on to say that the whole thing was double-dealing and double standards as far as Deputy O'Toole was concerned.  Beidh an tiar Aire ag caint leis an Aire faoi sin.  The Minister said that new regulations have been drawn up which would mean that in effect there would be no unauthorised purchases or sales of land.  Does that mean that there was unauthorised purchase or sale of land previously?  Does it mean that there was political jobbery to some extent involved in land dealings and transactions by Údarás na Gaeltachta? Does it mean that, on the whole, there were unethical practices carried out by the Údarás on behalf of some people?</P>
    <P>I want to remind the Minister that the survival of the Gaeltacht and the language is his responsibility.  Accordingly he must respond in defence of himself, in defence of the workers and the people of the Gaeltacht and in defence of the Údarás body which can prove in time to be a really effective body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Gaeltacht (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I dtús báire, ba mhaith liom an leasú im ainm atá os comhair na Dála a mholadh. Tairgim:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1288" /> Go ndearbhaíonn Dáil Éireann, mar gur léir di gur gá leanacht le tacaíocht a thabhairt do na Gaeltachtaí agus lena bhforbairt agus gur cás léi an phoiblíocht le gairid faoi oibriú Údarás na Gaeltachta, go bhfuil sé caothúil go ndeánfadh an Comhchoiste um Chomhlachtaí Stát-Tionscanta scrúdú ar ghnóthaí Údarás na Gaeltachta mar ábhar práinne agus go ndéanfadh sé moltaí chun feabhas a chur ar fheidhmiú Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Is amhlaidh a ghlacaimse leis go bhfuil dualgas orm féin mar Aire na Gaeltachta féachaint chuige go mbeidh Údarás na Gaeltachta ag feidhmiú chomh héifeachtach agus is féidir agus nílim ag iarraidh éalú ó aon dualgas atá orm.  Lena chinntiú gur mar sin a bheidh an tÚdarás ag feidhmiú ní foláir na beartais, na treoirlínte agus cuid de na modhanna oibre a scrúdú go mion chun feabhas a chur orthu más gá agus, ó ceapadh mar Aire mé, tá scrúdú mar sin ar siúl agam. Bím i gcomhairle go rialta le hardoifigigh an Údaráis agus táim sásta go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh againn agus go bhfuil ceachtanna foghlamtha ónar tharla roimhe seo.</P>
    <P>Dá mheasfainn go gcabhródh fiosrúchán breithiúnach liom chun an dualgas atá orm a chomhlíonadh chuirfinn fáilte roimhe.  Ach is deacair dom a shamhlú go bhféadfadh fiosrúchán dá leithéid an cuspóir atá romhainn a bhaint amach go tapaidh.  Mar shampla, d'fhéadfadh amhras éigin a bheith ann faoina mbeadh le déanamh ag an Údarás i gcúinsí áirithe agus, i dtreo go dtiocfaí ar an réiteach is fearr, is ormsa a bheadh an cúram pointí a shoiléiriú &mdash; le cabhair ó mo Roinn féin agus ó fhoinsí oifigiúla eile.  Níltear ag iarraidh a chruthú go raibh oifigeach éigin &ldquo;ciontach&rdquo; toisc go raibh dearcadh ró-dhóchasach aige nuair a rinne sé moladh áirithe.</P>
    <P>Is maith is eol dúinn cheana gurb iad géarchéim an fhuinnimh agus an cúlú eacnamaíochta ar fud an domhain &mdash; rudaí nach bhféadfaí a chur san áireamh roimh ré &mdash; ba chúis le dúnadh na dtionscal ní amháin sa Ghaeltacht ach in áiteanna eile chomh maith: d'fhéadfaí tionscal a fuair <Col N="1289" /> a lán poiblíochta sa Teach seo seachtain ó shin a lua mar shampla.</P>
    <P>Cén chiall a bheadh le fiosrúchán breithiúnach chun nithe atá ar eolas againn cheana féin a léiriú dúinn?  Ina theannta sin nach mbeadh ar ardoifigigh san Údarás agus i mo Roinnse a lán ama a chaitheamh ag ullmhú don fhiosrúchán agus ag freastal air &mdash; am arbh fhearr é a bheith á chaitheamh go díreach ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht?  Ní foláir dúinn bheith sásta glacadh leis go dteipfidh ar thionscal anois agus arís.  Is amhlaidh nach mbeidh forbairt tionsclaíochta saor ón bhfiontar nó on bpriacal go deo mar ní féidir bheith lánchinnte roimh ré go n-éireoidh go maith le tionscal áirithe. Ach tig linn a chinntiú go mbeidh caighdeán chomh hard agus is féidir ag baint leis na modhanna ina ndéanfar scrúdú ar thogra sula gceadófar é: is é sin atá ar siúl agamsa mar ghnó práinneach agus is ar éigean a bheadh cúnamh le fáil go luath agam ó fhiosrúchán breithiúnach dá mbunófaí é le téarmaí tagartha a bhainfeadh leis an modh ina ndearnadh feidhmeanna a chomhlíonadh le 24 bliana anuas &mdash; mar a bheadh i gceist faoin tairiscint agus an leasú atá molta ag Teachtaí eile.  Dála an scéil, ní dóigh liom go bhféadfaí teorainn sé mhí a chur leis an bhfiosrúchán sin mar atá sa leasú.</P>
    <P>D'fhonn aon mhíthuiscint a sheachaint is mian liom a dheimhniú gurb iad na bealaí ginearálta ina gcuireann an eagraíocht chun oibre is mó atá i gceist ina bhfuil ráite agam.  Dá mbeadh caimiléireacht in áit ar bith san eagraíocht ba mhaith liom go dtabharfaí aon fhianaise don Gharda láithreach i gcaoi go bhféadfaí an dlí a chur i bhfeidhm sa ghnáthshlí.  Má tá aon rian den chaimiléireacht ag baint le gnóthaí an Údaráis teastaíonn uaimse go nglanfaí amach gan mhoill é.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar a luaigh mé ag an tús, tá scrúdú ar siúl agam, ó ceapadh mar Aire mé, d'fhonn feabhas a chur ar na beartais, na treoirlínte agus modhanna oibre i gcaoi go mbeidh an tÚdarás ag feidhmiú chomh héifeachtach agus is féidir.  Tá roint leasuithe déanta cheana féin agus ghlac mé le deis i nGaillimh inné chun iad a fhógairt.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh mé a chur in iúl don <Col N="1290" /> urlabhrai ar an dtaobh eile go bhfuil na socruithe nua seo as toradh de chuid mhaith cruinnuithe a bhí agamsa le cúpla mí anuas leis na hardoifigigh ins an Údarás agus seo toradh na sraitheanna cainte a bhí agamsa le tamaillín anuas. B'fhéidir nach raibh na sraitheanna cainte céanna ar siúl ag an iar-Aire nuair a bhí seisean i réim i Roinn na Gaeltachta. Ba mhaith liom na leasuithe seo a lua arís anseo: Maidir leis an Ghaeilge athdheimhneoidh an tÚdarás an dualgas reachtúil atá orthu i leith na Gaeilge trína gclár forbartha teanga a neartú.  Ta cúram na hoibre sin curtha ar leas-phríomhfheidhmeannach. Tá treoir tugtha don Údarás freisin úsáid na Gaeilge a leathnú sna tionscáil faoina scáth.  Is é an rud atá mí-cheart i gcás na Gaeltachta agus i gcás na Gaeilge chomh maith ná go bhfuil na Ranna Stáit agus na heagraíochtaí Stáit atá ag plé le Gaeilge agus leis an Gaeltacht ag déanamh faillí ar an nGaeilge agus ar an nGaeltacht.  Tá sé riachtanach mar sin dualgas soiléir a leagadh ar gach Roinn Stáit agus ar gach eagraíocht Stáit atá ag plé leis an nGaeltacht freastal éifeachtach a dhéanamh ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus freastal orthu trí Ghaeilge.  Ba chóir go mbeadh rialacha foirmeálta ann a chuireadh iachall ar na húdaráis go léir atá ag plé leis an nGaeltacht a ndualgais a chomhlíonadh agus ba chóir go mbeadh seasamh ag Údarás na Gaeltachta ar structúr a chuirfeadh na dualgais sin i bhfeidhm.  Bheadh sé i bhfad níos eascaí socrú oifigiúil den chinéal sin a chur i bhfeidhm ná cumhachtaí breise a thabhairt don Údaras.</P>
    <P>Ta sprioc leagtha síos don Údarás 5,000 post nua a líonadh sna cúig bliana atá romhainn, agus tá géarghá fostaíocht seasmhach fad-téarmach a chur ar fáil dos na daoine a bhfuil sásta fanacht agus oibriú agus a shaol a chaitheamh sna Gaeltachtaí.  Sin atá romhamsa agus níor mhaith liom go mbeadh duine ar bith in aghaidh sin.  Tá an clár tógála do réamhmhonarchana curtha ar fionraí ach críochnófar oibreacha atá ar siúl agus ní miste dul ar aghaidh le cnuasaigh de mhionmhonarchana in ionaid le seirbhísí oiriúnacha.  Sin atá i gceist agamsa.  Tá líon maith monarchana folamha sna Gaeltachtaí agus an líon iomlán atá ann <Col N="1291" /> ná 148 monarchana.  Tá cuid acu folamh faoi láthair ach tá cuid acu leagtha ar leataobh do thionscail atá le teacht go luath.  Tá díospóireachtaí ar siúl maidir le deich gcinn eile agus mar a dúirt an urlabhraí ar an dtaobh eile, monarchana beaga atá i gceist.  Tá mise ag iarraidh leanúint ar aghaidh leis na cainteanna atá ar siúl le tionsclóirí agus na daoine atá sásta infheistíocht a chur ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí chun na monarchana sin a líonadh.  Tá thart ar 600 postanna nua faoi láthair i gceist agus is é fáth nach bhfuil mé in ann na postanna sin a chur ar fáil anois díreach ná gur fhág an t-iar Aire gantannas airgead ann de réir cuntaisí caipitil chun an polasaí sin atá romhamsa anois a chur i gcrích.</P>
    <P>Beidh tograí do thionscail mhóra le breithniú ach iad a bheith glanta leis an Aire.  Sin an cás atá ann faoi láthair agus tá mé chun leanúint ar aghaidh le sin.  Tá treoir tugtha don Údarás díriú go speisialta ar mhiontionscail agus go háirithe orthu siúd a bhfuil baint acu lenár nacmhainní nádúrtha e.g. iascaireacht agus turasóireacht.  Ó tharla gur theip go minic ar thionscnaimh inar glacadh leis an gcothromas iomlán seachnófar fothionscail a mbeadh na scaireanna uile ag an Údarás iontu.</P>
    <P>Cothófar ceangal níos fearr idir Údarás na Gaeltachta agus an Údarás Forbartha Tionscail, mar shampla trí úsáid níos leithne a bhaint as oifigí eachtracha agus áiseanna forbartha atá ag an UFT.</P>
    <P>Tá cúram curtha ar leas-phríomhfheidhmeannach de chuid an Údaráis comhoibriú níos dlúithe a bhaint amach idir an Údarás agus gluaiseacht na comharaíochta sa Ghaeltacht.  Caithfidh mé a chur in iúl freisin taobh amuigh den phríomh-chuspóir, caomhnú agus cothú na teanga, a bheith ar an Údarás tá sé mar chuspóir freisin i gcónaí ag an Údarás forbairt eacnamaíochta na gceantar Gaeltachta trí bhunú tionscal nua. Táimid ag iarraidh comhoibriú a fháil ón IDA i leith na gceantar Gaeltachta, na ceantair is deacra sa tír ó thaobh forbartha. Tuigeann gach duine é sin.  Tuigeann muintir an eagrais sin; tuigeann muintir na Gaeltachta é; tuigeann muintir lucht tionscail é sin agus caithfimid iarracht faoi <Col N="1292" /> leith a dhéanamh leis na heagrais sin chun tionsclaíocht a mhealladh go dtí na Gaeltachtaí. Is gá structúr eagraíochta a chothú a chuireann ceangal foirmeálta ar an IDA faoi thograí a mhealladh dos na ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Chomh maith is cóir cóid údarú tograí a chur ar bhun a crothóidh do phobal go bhfuil an caighdeán céanna i gceist sa Ghaeltacht agus atá taobh amuigh de na Gaeltachtaí.  Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil an tÚdarás ar a laghad chomh cúramach agus chomh coinsiasach agus atá aon eagras forbartha eile.  Ach an deacracht atá ann ná nach gcreideann an pobal é sin.  Tabharfaidh an leasú atá ar intinn agamsa an seans don phobal féachaint díreach chomh héifeachtúil is a ndéanann siad a gcuid oibre.  Déanfar athstruchtúrú cuí freisin ar thionscail atá i mbaol ach a bhféadfar iad a chur ar bhonn slán ach dúnfar fothionscail nach bhfuil seans réasúnach go n-éireoidh leo.  Tá freagracht ar leith curtha ar leas-phríomhfheidhmeannach chun tionscail atá i mbaol a aithint go luath d'fhonn iad a tharrtháil.  Bainfidh sé feidhm as comhairleoirí mar is gá.</P>
    <P>Tá a lán tagairt déanta do cheannacht agus díol talún agus faoi nós imeachta nua atá tugtha isteach maidir le talamh agus maoin eile a cheannach.  Beidh an fhreagracht ar an gcathaoirleach agus ar an bpríomhfheidhmeannach tar éis luacháil neamh-spleách a fháil agus beidh toiliú an Aire le lorg.  Beidh an nós imeachta i gcoitinne cosúil lena bhfuil i bhfeidhm ag an Údarás Forbartha Tionscail agus eagraíochtaí eile.  Bunóidh an tÚdarás oifigí réigiúnacha mar is gá sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Tá pleananna sonracha á n-ullmhú do na ceantair ar leith. Caithfidh mé rud éigin a chur in iúl do chuile dhuine maidir leis an méid talún atá i gceist ag an Údarás.  Tá sé ráite mar fhreagra ar Cheist Dála dom le déanaí go bhfuil 3,884 acra ag an Údarás, ach portaigh ar chuid is mó des na hacraí atá i gceist agus níl ach 544 acra saor do fhorbairt tionscail.  Tá an méid acra sin scaipthe in ionad maoin 46 cheantar thar timpeall na tíre seo, agus ceannaíodh an chuid is mó den talamh sin ar luach níos lú ná £30 in aghaidh an acra.  Sin an fhírinne maidir leis an scéal sin.  Tá gá leis an méid <Col N="1293" /> talú atá acu faoi láthair chun forbairt ceart a dhéanamh as seo amach agus creidim nach bhfuil an iomarca talún forbartha acu nuair a chuirtear san áireamh nach bhfuil ach 544 acra acu i 46 ionad thar timpeall na tíre seo.  Bunóidh an tÚdarás oifigí réigiúnacha mar is gá.  Tá pleananna sonracha á n-ullmhú do na ceantair ar leith.  Creidim go bhfuil géarghá leis na hoifigí sin a bhunú.</P>
    <P>Tá an-dochar déanta d'obair an Údaráis ag cuid áirithe de na meáin chumarsáide.  Déanfar iarracht speisialta, más ea, chun léargas níos fearr a thabhairt ar na deacrachtaí a bhíonn le sárú agus ar an dul chun cinn atá déanta agus á dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Le filleadh ar chúrsaí an Údaráis i gcoitinne, is fíor nár éirigh le roint tionscal sa Ghaeltacht agus gur beag an toradh atá fágtha ar airgead poiblí a caitheadh orthu.  Ach níl eolas ar bith á cheilt ina dtaobh: tá sonraí an chaiteachais le fáil sna tuarascálacha agus sna cuntais atá foilsithe.  Is féidir teacht ar na híocaíochtaí a rinneadh le gach uile thionscal agus, i gcás na bhfothionscal agus na gcomhthionscal ina mbíonn scaireanna ag an Údarás, luaitear na cinn ina mbíonn infheistíochtaí díscríofa.</P>
    <P>Ar 31 Nollaig 1980 bhí na suimeanna seo a leanas a airleacadh faoi Achtanna éagsúla ag dul don Státchiste ón Údarás:</P>
    <P>&mdash;£41,791,000 a tugadh do Ghaeltarra Éireann roimh 1980 agus</P>
    <P>&mdash;£10,500,000 a tugadh don Údarás féin i 1980.</P>
    <P>Tá an dliteanas sin leagtha amach go soiléir i gclár comhardaithe an Údaráis ar an 31 Nollaig 1980 agus sna cuntais airgeadais a fhoilsíonn an tAire Airgeadais agus níl laghdú déanta ar aon cheann acu. Bíonn an Teachta Begley agus daoine eile ag iarraidh a thabhairt le tuiscint go bhfuil easaontas éigin idir na figiúirí, ach níl bunús ar bith leis sin.  Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil amhras á chothú d'aonghnó nó an amhlaidh atá míthuiscint á baint as an tslí ina leagtar amach figiúirí éagsúla &mdash; nach mbaineann go díreach lena chéile &mdash; sa chlár comhardaithe a bhfuil an tArd-Reachtaire Cuntas agus Ciste féin sásta leis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1294" /> Tá feachtas aisteach den chineál céanna ar siúl maidir leis an teorainn £50 milliúin a luaitear in alt 23 (4) den Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979.  Tá deimhnithe agam arís agus arís eile &mdash; agus léigh mé amach comhairle dá réir ón Ard-Aighne sa Teach seo &mdash; gur le hairleacain chun an Údaráis amháin a bhaineann an teorainn sin.</P>
    <P>Cé go bhfuil mo dhícheall déanta agamsa, ó ceapadh mar Aire mé, lena dheimhniú go mbeidh an tÚdarás ag feidhmiú chomh héifeachtach agus is féidir, is cosúil go bhfuil amhras éigin fós ar Theachtaí áirithe agus ba mhaith liom comhoibriú leo dá bhféadfainn chun an t-aer a ghlanadh i gcaoi go mbeidh deis ag an Údarás luí isteach ar an obair arís le díogras agus le dúthracht ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge agus leis an nGaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá sé socraithe agam freisin maidir leis na comharchumainn go bhfuil baint faoi leith agus riachtanas faoi leith ag dul le forbairt na gcomharchumann.  Tá cainteanna ar siúl faoi láthair agus beidh an cinneadh déanta agam maidir leis na comharchumainn agus forbairt agus pleananna in aghaidh na comharchumainn agus go mbeidh an plean seo a thabhairt amach agam go lua, agus caithfidh baint a bheith ag an Údarás le forbairt na gcomharchumann freisin. Caithfidh siad seirbhísí bainistíochta a chur ar fáil do chomharchumainn agus do na mion-tionscail freisin.  Tá na seirbhísí sin soiléir agus traidisiúnta agus caithfear a chinntiú nach bhfuil seirbhísí bainistíochta an Údaráis ag glacadh freagraíochta as an bainistíocht ach go bhfuil siad ag cuidiú le bainistíocht agus ag cur comhairle ar bhainistíocht, ag tabhairt oiliúna do bhainistíocht agus go bhfuil freagracht agus údarás ag an tionsclóir nó ag an bainisteoir comharchumann.</P>
    <P>Ní fhéadfadh duine réasúnach ar bith cur i gcoinne an leasaithe atá á mholadh anseo.  Idir na blianta 1973 go 1977 a rinneadh na fothionscail agus na comhlachtaí a bhí ag déanamh an chaillteanais is mó agus is ag an am sin aistríodh go dtí fothionscail iad.  I rith na blianta sin bhí an Comhrialtas i réim.  Sin an t-am a cuireadh tús leis na fothionscail atá an caillteanas is mó ag dul leo anois.  An <Col N="1295" /> amhlaidh an bhfuil siad ar an dtaobh eile anois ag déanamh athbhreithnithe ar an dearcadh a bhí acu féin ag an am sin. Caithfidh mé a chur in iúl daoibh gurb é an Freasúra a chuir suas an infheistíocht chun go mbeadh na comhlachtaí sin ag leanúint ar aghaidh agus anois tá siad ag déanamh clamhsáin nuair atá deireadh leis na fothionscail céanna agus nuair atá gá leis an infheistíocht a dí-scríobh.  Sin é an dearcadh diúltach a bhí acu riamh maidir le cúrsaí teanga agus cúrsaí Gaeltachta sa tír seo.  Caithfidh mé rud eile a chur in iúl dóibh freisin, agus aontaím leis an méid a dúirt an t-urlabhraí ón dtaobh eile maidir le cúrsaí poiblíochta atá ag dul leis an Údarás le tamaillín anuas.  Aontaím leis an Teachta Kenny go gcaithfidh an tÚdarás iad féin a chosaint ar an droch-phoiblíocht agus tá sé ar intinn agamsa freisin córas poiblíochta níos fearr a chur ar fáil don Údarás ionas go mbeidh siad in ann iad féin a chosaint ar an droch-phoiblíocht, na ráflaí agus an cúlchaint atá curtha amach ag daoine éagsúla le tamaillín anuas; agus tá cuid acu anois díreach os mo chomhair.  Tá siad ag teacht isteach anseo ag cur amach ráiteasaí go bhfuil rudaí eile le rá acu. Bhí seans acu go minic le déanaí n-intinn a nochtú os comhair na Dála, nó chun ráiteas poiblí a chur amach, ach ní raibh siad sásta fiú amháin ráiteas amháin a chur amach ó thosaigh an rud seo.  Tá seans eile acu anois agus beimid go léir ag súil go mbeidh rudaí íontacha le rá ag an Teachta Begley sa díospóireacht seo. Tá áthas orm go n-aontaíon urlabhraí Fhine Gaeil go gcaithfimid seans a thabhairt don Údarás iad féin a chruthú.  Is é sin an seans atá mise ag tabhairt dóibh faoin leasú seo atá os comhair an Tí, agus tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Teach tacaíocht a thabhairt dom an rud sin a déanamh. Ón méid atá ráite ag an Teachta Kenny, is léir domsa go n-aontaíonn sé le gach rud atá déanta agam ó tháinig mé i réim. Tuigim ón méid atá ráite aige anocht nach bhfuil sé ag tréaslú, san tairscint atá os ár gcomhair agus a ainm leis, leis na daoine eile sa taobh sin a bhí ag plé leis an cheist seo le tamaillín anuas.  Tá a lán litreacha agam i dtaobh seo ón Teachta Begley agus an Teachta O'Toole&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Ná bíodh imní ort, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Táim in ann mé féin a chosaint.  Is é mo thuairim láidir nach n-oirfeadh fiosrúchán breithiúnach ar chor ar bith don chás seo.  Is léir go bhfuil spéis ag Teachtaí sa chás agus, ó tharla go bhfuil Comhchoiste an Oireachtais um Chomhlachtaí Stát-Tionscanta ann &mdash; atá comhdhéanta de Theachtaí agus de Sheanadóirí ó gach taobh ten Teach &mdash; ritheann sé liomsa go bhféadfadh an comhchoiste sin scrúdú práinneach a dhéanamh ar chúrsaí an Údaráis.  Ar an mbealach sin bheadh deis ag Teachtaí ó chuile thaobh ceisteanna a chur ar fheidhmeannaigh an Údaráis agus iad féin a shásamh.  D'fhéadfaimis bheith ag súil le moltaí fiúntacha ón gcomhchoiste le féachaint chuige gurb éifeachtaí a bheadh a fheidhmeanna á gcomhlíonadh ag an Údarás feasta.  Ba chóir go mbeadh muinín ag Teachtaí ó gach taobh den Teach as an gcomhchoiste sin agus iontaobh acu as cibé moltaí a thiocfadh uathu.  Is ar an mbonn sin atá leasú á mholadh agam ar an tairiscint agus tá dóchas agam go nglacfaidh an Dáil leis an leasú sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Caithfidh mé a chur in iúl don urlabhraí ar an taobh eile nach mbeidh moill ar bith ag baint le feidhmiú an comhchoiste sin.  Tá na socruíthe go léir glanta ag an Teach seo agus ag an Seanad chun an <Col N="1297" /> comhchoiste sin a bhunú.  Im thuairim, bheadh sé sin i bhfad níos sciopaí ná bheith ag fanacht ar an sort fiosrúcháin atá leagtha amach san tairiscint atá os ár gcomhair, téarmaí tagartha a leagan síos, cásanna a chloisteáil ó dlíodóirí, cursaí dlí a phlé le chuile dhuine, fianaise a ghlacadh, agus rudaí den tsórt sin.  Im thuairim, bheadh sé i bhfad níos sásúla an rud go léir a phlé ag Teachtaí agus Seanadóirí san chomhchoiste.  Bheadh siad in ann chuile rud a scrúdú go mion. Bheadh siad in ann an fhianaise a fhoilsiú agus chuile mholadh a bheadh ag dul leis an scrúdú sin a chur os ár gcomhair.</P>
    <P>Táimse chun an scamall a ghlanú ón Údarás.  Gealladh an tacaíocht domsa nuair a cheapadh mé mar Aire na Gaeltachta. Tá an t-am tagtha chun an gheallúint sin a chomhlíonadh.  Le cúnamh an Tí, beidh an gníomhíocht déanta, agus déanfaidh mé dul chun cinn go han luath maidir leis an teanga, na Gaeltachtaí agus chuile rud atá faoi chúram an Aire maidir le forbairt na nGaeltachtaí agus Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt do fhocal scoir an Aire i dtosach, faoin Ghaeilge, an Ghaeltacht agus cúrsaí na Gaeltachta agus, dar ndóigh, tacaíocht na Gaeltachta.  Bhí suim agam sa Ghaeilge agus sa Ghaeltacht le fada an lá.  Tógadh le Gaeilge mé, rinne mé céim i nGaeilge, tá suim agam san teanga féin mar theanga.  Níl aon rud pearsanta ag baint le seo.  Glacaim leis an méid atá ráite ag an Aire agus tá súil agam go nglacfaidh seisean uaimse nach bhfuil aon rud pearsanta ag baint leis an méid atá le rá agam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Táimid ag caint anseo faoi fhiosrúchán bhreithiúnach, faoi mholadh nach dtagann os comhair na Dála go ro-mhinic.  Tá an-tábhacht ag baint leis.  Tá deacrachtaí ag baint leis.  Tuigim go bhfuil an-tion-char ag moladh dá leithéid, cibé cén eagras go bhfuil sé ag tagairt dó, ach ní thagaim leis an Aire nuair a deireann sé go gcaithfidh chuile rud stopadh fhad is atá a leíthéid ar siúl.  Tá an-chás déanta ag an Aire ar son na Gaeltachta agus ar son na Gaeilge, ach níl tada ráite aige faoi na cúiseanna go bhfuil an moladh <Col N="1298" /> seo os comhair na Dála anocht.  Ní chuireann sé pioc áthais orm bheith ag seasamh anseo ag iarraidh fiosrúcháin dá shaghas i leith Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Is é an fáth atáim anseo ag moladh fiosrúchaín mar seo ná go gceapaim go coinsiasach go bhfuil na ráflaí atá ag dul thart faoin tír i mbéal muintir na hÉireann agus is beag áit a dtéann tú, má tá baint agat leis an rud seo, nach bhfuil daoine ag tagairt dó.</P>
    <P>Táim ag iarraidh na ráflaí seo a chruthú, más féidir iad a chruthú, nó iad a chaitheamh amach más sin atá le tarlú. Má tá an tAire sasta nach bhfuil tada dá laghad cearr leis an Údarás, má tá sé sásta nach bhfuil caimiléireacht ar bith ag baint leis an Údarás nó le haon ball den Údarás, cén fáth a bhfuil faitíos air a leithéid de fhiosrúchán a ligean faoi lán tseoil?  Ba cheart ainm an Údaráis a ghlanadh.</P>
    <P>Bhí replay againn anocht de phreasagallamh an Aire i nGaillimh inné, ach níor chuir sé íonadh dá laghad orm bheith ag éisteacht leis an Aire ag insint a chás faoin phreasagallamh, agus céard a bhí ar siúl aige?  Bhí sé ag iarraidh, mar a dúirt an Teachta Kenny, an sting a bhaint as díospóireacht na Dála anocht.</P>
    <P>The Minister in having a dry run of what he intended to do in the House today in Galway yesterday has pretty well scuttled any element of surprise which might have been in what he had to say. Looking through the proposals it reminds me of somebody on the Titanic rearranging the deck furniture.  It will not make one iota of a difference to the actual position that the Údarás unfortunately find themselves in.  The Minister has done nothing to allay or dispel the fears or suspicions that beset many minds in the country today.</P>
    <P>I was not the one to start the rumour. The Minister in his speech said:</P>
    <P>Níltear ag iarraidh a chruthú go raibh oifigeach éigin &ldquo;ciontach&rdquo; toisc go raibh dearcadh ró-dhóchasach aige nuair a rinne sé moladh áirithe.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of throw-away remark which is put there to confuse the confused. The Minister will blame the media for confusing the public in matters relating <Col N="1299" /> to Údarás.  As far as I am concerned, nobody on this side of the House has accused anybody of being over-optimistic in relation to an industry or of having lost money.  Nobody ever mentioned that and the Minister should not try and pull that red herring in at this stage.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister also said:</P>
    <P>Ní foláir dúinn bheith sásta glacadh leis go dteipfidh ar thionscal anois agus arís.  Is amhlaidh nach mbeidh forbairt tionsclaíochta saor ón bhfiontar nó on bpriacal go deo mar ní féidir bheith lánchinnte roimh ré go n-éireoidh go maith le tionscal áirithe.</P>
    <P>That is acceptable.  The IDA have failures. Every developer and promotion agency in the world has failures.  What I set out to do &mdash; I say this for the third time in this House &mdash; was to ensure that the public would get value for money and that the Údarás would be helped in every way possible to carry out their functions as a promotion agency in the Gaeltacht. What does the Minister say?  Major industrial proposals must get ministerial approval.  For the Minister's information, this has always been the case.</P>

The initial investment was put there in good faith, and the weakest argument I have ever heard from any Minister in this House was, &ldquo;Well, anyway, they were Fine Gael promotional projects the first day so they failed.  You in Fine Gael cannot complain about that&rdquo;.  That kind of remark is gratuitous. It gets us nowhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Land purchases will now need clearance by the Minister.  I hope the Minister will have more success than I had with the Údarás in getting their co-operation. I question the viability of the Minister's proposals because under section 8 of the Act the Údarás are an autonomous body doing things as they think fit and the Minister will find that out if he reads the <Col N="1300" /> Act.  In other words, the Minister has no right to interfere in the land purchases proposals by the Údarás.  Section 8 (7) states:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this section An tÚdarás shall have power to acquire, receive on transfer, hold, sell, mortgage, lease, let, or otherwise dispose of land, buildings, markets, premises or plant and to erect, alter or maintain buildings, markets, premises or plant.</P>
    <P>The land referred to previously tonight was bought by the Údarás in west Cork. From the very beginning I expressed my view, in relation to that proposed purchase, to the Údarás, the Department and all the people concerned because of its cost at £15,000 an acre, yet that Údarás bought against my wishes, and they had a perfect right to do so under the Act.  I hope the Minister will have more success in getting his ideas across than I had.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>They went ahead and purchased that land and in a very short time afterwards the company to whom they were paying this money went into receivership.  On the television programme relating to this deal the fact that the company is in receivership and was in receivership when this deal was closed did not come across.  I brought this to the notice of the secretary of the Department and to the chief executive of Údarás na Gaeltachta who accepted that in these circumstances the deal should not be closed, yet the deal was closed and the money transferred on 14 March when that company was in receivership.  I emphasise that one of the conditions attaching to the closure of this deal was that the money got by the vendor would be invested in a company in the Gaeltacht, in a mill which was under the jurisdiction of the Department and the Minister, yet when in receivership, as the Minister knows, that condition could not be fulfilled.  That deal was closed under a Fianna Fáil Minister and the board in principle took the decision despite my best efforts to stop them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What made me really sad &mdash; not mad <Col N="1301" />&mdash; last night was that towards the end of the interview the Minister after his press conference made the statement that he would have to revamp the PR aspect of Údarás na Gaeltachta, taking a leaf from his leader's copybook, no doubt.  If public relations could win the day, many thousands of pounds have been spent by the Údarás on PR and they have a perfect right to do that.  I did not provoke Údarás na Gaeltachta into getting up on my back. I was five weeks in office when in the case of Gael Crann Teo., Ruma, Rí, I met at their request the workers who were about to be laid off in that factory.  They put certain proposals to me.  I gave them an assurance in the presence of officials from the Department that nothing would happen to them until I got their proposals in writing and these were scrutinised and examined.</P>

      <P>Deputy Liam Kavanagh has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of Ardmore Film Studios.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It may seem strange that we are here again talking to two Ministers who have been involved in the decision about the closing of Ardmore Studios.  On 28 April we discussed on the <Col N="1302" /> Adjournment the closure of Ardmore Studios which had occurred a few days beforehand.  A Labour Party motion which I moved on 15 June 1982 stated:</P>
      <P>That, having regard to the preservation of essential skills for servicing the film industry in Ireland, Dáil Éireann requests the Government to take whatever steps are necessary to maintain and develop the studio facilities at the National Film Studios of Ireland, Ardmore, Bray, County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>On the first day of the Private Members' motion the Minister for the Gaeltacht, Deputy Flynn, in place of the Minister for Industry and Energy who was unavailable for that debate on either of the two days, moved an amendment.  I am glad that tonight the Minister has come in and I hope will tell us something good, not me personally but the people of Bray and the people of the film industry in Ireland.  Nevertheless, I think we must pursue the Minister here to see that a motion which was accepted by his Government, accepted unanimously by the House is put into effect because the amendment was.</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;industry&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and the proposed disposal of the National Film Studios of Ireland Ltd. by the liquidator, Dáil Éireann requests the Government to take all reasonable steps to maintain the studio facilities at Ardmore, Bray, County Wicklow.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows that in his absence a great deal of effort was put into getting me to accept that amendment.  The Minister of State and the Whip and myself had discussions to see if the amendment could be altered in any way to secure a favourable result to the motion.  I was not able to accept the changes proposed by the Minister of State, nor was he able to accept my motion.  On the following day when it was quite clear that the motion was going to be carried against the Government and that Independent Deputies and The Workers' Party Deputies <Col N="1303" /> who had maintained and are maintaining the Government in office were probably going to support my motion, the Government saw that the best way out was to accept the motion which was carried unanimously.</P>
    <P>On the following Sunday the Minister arrived back from America and was available practically off the plane to go into the RTE studios and tell them that it did not matter about a motion being passed in the House &mdash; a motion that said the Government were going to take whatever steps were necessary to maintain and develop studio facilities at Ardmore &mdash; he would go ahead and sell the studio. Accepting our motion, he said, had no bearing on the decisions that were to be taken by his Department.  In fact the motion itself lent some weight to the decision that he was already discussing with unnamed people.  There were discussions with a view to selling the studio to some American buyer &mdash; we are not sure who it was.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that approach because when one looks at the fine print of the Government amendment and looks at the motion in the Labour Party's name there is a very important difference.  Had I accepted the amendment two important words would have been omitted from the Labour Party motion.  The original motion said &ldquo;...having regard to the preservation of essential skills for servicing the film industry in Ireland...&rdquo;. Nowhere in the Minister's amendment are the words &ldquo;in Ireland&rdquo; included.  It was therefore obvious that the preservation of the skills and the servicing of the film industry in Ireland were not of importance to the Minister since he had left those words out.  It means that the motion which was accepted by the Government binds the Government to maintain those skills, the experience and the knowledge gained over many years in this country in making films and specifically the skills that are present and available now, the technical expertise, the equipment and all that is available at Ardmore Studios.</P>
    <P>There was a subtle but very important difference.  If the Minister was in the middle of a deal with some buyer, those <Col N="1304" /> words &ldquo;in Ireland&rdquo; would mean difficulty. He had already suggested to the Ardmore workers that a covenant to the effect that the skills would be maintained would be useless in any contract.  It is not much use to us tonight to be told that some covenant will be included in any deal providing that these skills will be kept in Ireland.  We want more guarantees than that.  The arrangement must be stronger and sounder and it must ensure what we understood to be the position after the Dáil vote.  I left the Minister for the Gaeltacht who was standing in for the Minister for Industry and Energy in no doubt as to what my motion meant.  I quote from column 214 of the Official Report of 15 June 1982, when I said:</P>
    <P>I am pleading with the Minister to reverse his decision, to think again about what he has done to County Wicklow, to think again what he has done to the industry, to consider that there is another way of going about this, that there is an Irish film industry which can operate from this studio.  If it is possible at this stage, will the Minister remove the liquidator and appoint a receiver?  A liquidator is put into a premises to liquidate an asset, to liquidate a company such as the National Film Studios.  Is it not possible to put in a receiver who will manage the studios while some new arrangement can be arrived at?  If that is not possible can the liquidator not appoint a manager to run this studio for a period while there is a re-think of Government policy on it?</P>
    <P>I know this decision was taken in haste and that there was not enough thinking behind it.  I know there has been a considerable backlash against the Government because of this very thoughtless act.  I suggest to the Minister that the studio should remain under Irish control.  I agree with Sinn Fein's&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I should have said The Workers' Party</P>
    <P>amendment that public ownership is the best solution to control the film industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I suggested that the Film Board, the IDA <Col N="1305" /> and RTE take shares in the new company and control the film studios at Ardmore. There was no doubt in my mind and neither should there have been any doubt in the Minister's mind as to what was involved in the acceptance of the amendment. Later when the Minister came in he simply rejected that motion and went ahead and proposed his own amendment. He would not have done so had the motion been acceptable to him at that time but faced with the situation of the following day when I could not see that his amendment meant the same as my amendment and where those important words, &lsquo;maintaining the film industry in Ireland&rdquo; were being left out, I could not accept that.  The Minister realising that the Government would be beaten on the motion, accepted <i>in toto</i> what we had been proposing.  Afterwards he came back but refused to accept what had been done in the House and only last evening in the <i>Evening Herald</i> we read that what we had been proposing could happen, that these studios could be made to work and to make money.</P>
    <P>If the report in that paper is correct and if the Minister has not denied it, it appears that an American group who were travelling to Ireland in order to learn the skills of the industry were being told not to come because the industry was being sold.  The threat of a £1 million action against the Government resulted in their reversing that decision and I am glad to say that those young people are coming here to learn the skills of the film trade.  They maintain that Ardmore is the best studio in Europe for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will regard what I am proposing as being the best way forward for our film industry and that he will take note of the other points I raised about County Wicklow.  There is the over-all employment situation, the fact that more than 150,000 people are out of work but in Wicklow the unemployment figures are higher than average.  Again, unfortunately, the Minister refused to meet a deputation from Arklow who wished to tell him about their unemployment problems.  I appeal to him now to give the people of Bray some hope, to give some hope to the people who work <Col N="1306" /> in the studios.  The sacking of the chief executive of the studios after the motion had been passed here was very disappointing to everybody concerned but now that we have raised the problem here again I look forward to some assurance from the Minister that there has been a change of heart and that something is being done to maintain the film industry in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank my constituency colleague for allowing me some of his time so that I might intervene in this debate.  This is the second Adjournment motion about the Ardmore studios, the first having been on 29 April.  Since that date there has been a great change. Obviously, the most significant change has been as a result of the motion agreed by the Government on 15 June.  If the Dáil and its deliberations mean anything, the agreement of the Government to that motion must have changed significantly this whole issue.  When the Minister for the Gaeltacht spoke during the first session of that Private Members' motion, he indicated the Government's awareness of the significance of the motion.  He said the Government had proposed an amendment to the motion because they could not accept in any circumstances the Labour Party motion.  What he said was that after arriving carefully at the exact opposite position as the Labour Party motion, the Government could not accept it as the appropriate conclusion because it would be both inconsistent and seriously wrong.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the Minister for the Gaeltacht, representing the Government on that evening, made it clear that the Government saw the significance of the wording of the Labour Party motion, a motion which this party supported.  The following evening the Government, as Deputy Kavanagh has pointed out, having consulted with the mover of the motion and with myself decided to withdraw their own amendment.  So far as we were concerned this changed everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no wish to reiterate the arguments that have been made so often in the House on this matter.  Suffice it to say that, as I made clear on the last occasion <Col N="1307" /> on which I spoke here on this question, I did not see a situation in which the studios would continue exactly as before. There was no question of that.  Basically, the position my party took on this issue was that it was important that the studio facility be retained, if necessary only on a four-walls basis for the moment so that it would not be lost for the development of the Irish film industry and so that the basic corps of technicians who are vital to the running of the studios would be retained in this country and in the studios. For a variety of reasons relative to the artistic, technical and economic future of an Irish film industry it is necessary to keep those studios.  It is important to point out that the chief executive and members of the Irish Film Board are in no doubt as to the necessity of maintaining the studio facilities at Ardmore. I am sure the Minister has listened very carefully to his own film board.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the range of protests and demands surprised many people who had not really considered the Ardmore studios until the announcement of the decision to close.  The workers' propositions have been researched carefully and thoroughly and I should like very much if the heat could be taken out of the debate and if the sort of hypocrisy charges that were made against me on 29 April could be left out also so that we might examine the whole question calmly and clearly in the light of developments since then.  I am not interested in victories, moral or otherwise, but I am interested in the retention of an asset which so many people, having substantial expert knowledge in this area, consider to be absolutely essential to the Irish film industry.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to acknowledge that all steps were not taken in the past to put everything right at Ardmore and I would not consider it right to stand here and demand that money be poured into some bottomless pit but I am here to request a re-think of the whole question so that what is necessary in the public interest will be achieved and the studio facilities developed and maintained in accordance with the wishes of the Dáil as expressed here on 15 June.</P>

      <P>I do not suppose that any issue has brought me into this House as often as has the one before us.  At the outset I must say that I am amazed at the totally dishonest presentation of the various facts.  Deputy Hussey comes here trying to make a case for the retention of the studios despite the fact that when her party were in Government they did nothing about the situation.  Now the Deputy is trying to be all things to all men.  However, after the way Fine Gael voted on the Fieldcrest motion last week, I would not be surprised at anything they would do.  Deputy Kavanagh says he agreed with The Workers' Party motion but is it not reasonable, then, to ask the Deputy why he did not support that party's motion, a motion which specified clearly what the position was, what I believed they agreed with on the night.  However, because of political dishonesty they were not prepared to take their courage in their hands and take the road they felt in their hearts and souls that they should have taken.  Now they are trying to play with words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's acceptance of the motion put down by the Labour Party and adopted by the Dáil on 16 June does not represent any departure from the action already being taken to dispose of the studios to a purchaser who is prepared to maintain and develop film making facilities there.  This has been my objective since I first announced the Government's intentions regarding the future of the studios back in April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is already aware that the Government took the decision to dispose of the studios in the knowledge of the substantial losses that had been incurred by them in the past and because there was no reasonable prospect that these escalating losses could be eliminated by the National Film Studios of Ireland, Ltd. The amount of losses incurred by the National Film Studios and the level of State support which the company <Col N="1309" /> received since their establishment in 1975 is already on record.  So I see no point in repeating these now.  However, I would like to stress once again that the studios' continuing and increasing losses were being financed by bank borrowings which had to be guaranteed by me as Minister for Industry and Energy.  As the legal limit set to my powers to guarantee loans in this case had virtually been reached, and as no moneys were provided in the 1982 Estimates to aid the company, the Government had no option but to take the decision to dispose of the studios otherwise their future could have been taken out of the State's hands, if any of the company's creditors put in a receiver. That is a matter of record.  That is a matter of fact.  The outgoing Government knew exactly what the position was and were not prepared to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>As I have said on previous occasions, it is the view of all sides of the House, as expressed by the Public Accounts Committee, in their report of November 1979 that:</P>
    <P>It appears to the Committee that public moneys are being spent on keeping alive a business which simply would not survive in the private commercial field.  Furthermore, since it is commonly known that studios of this kind throughout the world are closing down, what is being done in this case could possibly be regarded as more in the nature of a public relations operation than the creation of a viable industry. The question which therefore concerns the Committee is the extent to which public moneys should continue to be spent on prestige and status and it feels therefore that because of the grave doubts as to the viability of NFSI, a speedy decision must be made as to the future involvement on the State in this enterprise.</P>
    <P>The present action of the Government is a natural sequel to such an opinion and the Estimates decision of the previous Government not to provide funds for NFSI in 1982.  The Labour Party motion asked for necessary action to maintain and develop the facilities in question.  It <Col N="1310" /> did not ask that such action should be done in the context of public ownership. If it had intended that, I can only presume that the motion would have been worded accordingly.</P>
    <P>In fact, it was The Workers' Party which proposed an amendment which would have required maintenance and development under public ownership and this amendment was lost through lack of support.  Therefore, I am right in my assurance that the Dáil has not expressed support for public ownership of the studios.</P>
    <P>The liquidator, I understand, is negotiating with interested parties who are clearly intending, if successful in purchasing the studios, to preserve the film making facilities there.  I am hopeful that it will be possible to conclude a successful deal with one of them.</P>
    <P>When this happens we will have studios which are owned by people who have suitable business commitments for them and whose interest in business will represent an assurance that the facilities and, therefore, the skills of the film workers will be used.  This will be a solid advance over the position which existed up to this when activity at the studios was, for the last year or so, almost nil.  I consider that in an industry such as the film industry, private enterprise is an indispensible motive force.</P>
    <P>What I have said illustrates quite clearly, I think, what my plans for Ardmore Studios are.  In brief, they are that they will be sold to a purchaser who will be obliged under covenant, in the contract for sale, to maintain film making facilities there.  I believe that this objective can be achieved more certainly through private enterprise on the part of persons who have had valuable entrepreneurial experience in the industry, in the areas of procuring financial backing for their ideas and also in the distribution field.  Such ownership should, without doubt, give results from the points of view of both the workers and the State, far better than those of the NFSI over the past seven years.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would once again emphasise that my decision is totally consistent with the views expressed by the board of NFSI <Col N="1311" /> as set out in the chairman's letter of 29 March 1982 to me.  That letter confirmed the board's view and mine that the Exchequer should not continue to subvent the continuing substantial costs of the company and that even capitalisation in full will not solve the company's problems.</P>
    <P>They are the people charged with responsibility and they said that any money spent in the area of the National Film Studios should be spent by the National Film Board.  It is not true to say that the Irish film industry stands or falls on the filming facilities available out there.  They are a contributory factor and will be maintained as such.  That is precisely what I have stated here tonight. There is a bigger factor in the development of film making in Ireland, the development of a film industry in Ireland, to which neither Deputy referred.  I will reserve my comments on it.  It is a question of policy in the responsibility of another Minister which has a major contribution to make to the development of film making in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputies should not try to be all things to all men.  If they do not know where they are going they can take any road. This is a political exercise in hypocrisy, and there are no better disciples of that policy than the people over there.  Last <Col N="1312" /> week they voted for Fieldcrest.  They lecture the Government about financial rectitude and how public money should be spent.  They are asking the Government to provide money for an operation which they know is not viable.  In Government their own parties were not prepared to provide money in the Estimate for this operation.  They knew exactly what the position was and they were not prepared to do anything about it.  They repeated this exercise last week on the Fieldcrest question.</P>
    <P>They want us to pour more and more public money into an area which is not viable.  They should tell the people the facts.  I am prepared to do that and I will continue to do it.  To suggest that at a meeting with the workers I said they would be retained indefinitely in Bray is not in accordance with the facts.  They recognised the position.  They knew how bad the situation was for many years.  The Opposition were not prepared to listen to them.  I listened to them and I took action.  They are interested in the development of the film industry in Ireland.  So am I.  We are all on the one road and the Opposition must realise that, while they may cod some of the people some of the time, they cannot cod all of the people all of the time.</P>

      <P>As far as the first part of the Deputy's question is concerned, the decision of the Irish national soccer team to tour a number of Latin American countries was a matter for the Football Association of Ireland.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, Ireland's stand on the question of human rights in Chile has been forthright and consistent. We have voted for and frequently cosponsored, the United Nations General Assembly resolution on Chile every year since it was first tabled in 1974.  The record of the Chilean Government has been condemned in this House by my predecessors and others on many occasions, and I have no hesitation in adding my voice to that condemnation.</P>
      <P>However, the question of sport has not been linked with the human rights policy of the Chilean Government as, for example, is the case in South Africa, nor has the issue of sporting contacts with Chile arisen at the United Nations.</P>

    <P>The Government, therefore, did not feel that it was appropriate to express reservations to the Football Association <Col N="1066" /> of Ireland about the inclusion of Chile in the tour.</P>

The council came under the aegis of my Department in 1981 for funding purposes.  Prior to that, funding came from the Vote of the Department of Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>The grant-in-aid for the council in 1977 was £60,000 and in 1981 it was £289,000, an increase of 381 per cent.  Government expenditure over the same period increased by 148 per cent.</P>
      <P>(2)  The National Board for Science and Technology &mdash; This board was established on 5 April 1978.  Its functions, set out in The National Board for Science and Technology Act, 1977 are as follows:</P>
      <P>Advising the Government or the Taoiseach on policy for science and technology; co-ordination of activities in science and technology in the public sector; making recommendations via the science budget mechanism on financial allocations for science and technology; pilot and promotional activities.</P>
      <P>The National Board for Science and Technology did not come to be funded from the vote for my Department until 1981.</P>

    <P>The grant-in-aid for the NBST was <Col N="1070" /> £1.121 million in 1978 (the first year of its operation) and in 1981 it was £3.249 million an increase of 190 per cent. Government expenditure over the same period increased by 101 per cent.</P>
    <P>3.  An Chomhairle Ealaíon/The Arts Council: the function of this council is to stimulate public interest in the arts, to promote the knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts, to assist in improving the standard of the arts and to organise or assist in organising of exhibitions (within or without the State) of works of art and artistic craftsmanship. The council was established on 8 May 1951.  While the council comes under the aegis of my Department for administrative purposes its grant-in-aid forms a separate vote and is not included in the Department's budget.  The grant-in-aid for the council in 1977 was £1,200,000. The grant-in-aid in 1981 was £3,750,000. This represents an increase of about 212 per cent.</P>
    <P>4.  An Ceoláras Náisiúnta/National Concert Hall: the National Concert Hall was established on 27 March 1981 to provide a prestigious national concert hall for the promotion of concerts and recitals of musical works of artistic, educational or cultural value.

For this reason inspecting officers do not accept, in County Mayo or elsewhere, AI certificates as proof of dates of birth except in borderline <Col N="1078" /> cases.  Calves are rejected if, in relation to their breed, their size, weight and general appearance clearly indicate they were born before 20 May 1982.  The inspecting officers of the Department are experienced in handling livestock and have been deciding the ages of bovine animals under the headage schemes since 1975 without complaint.

      <P>The statutory rights of consumers under contracts for the supply of goods or services are set out in the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, and in the earlier Act of 1893.  A basic feature is that a consumer is entitled to goods of merchantable quality and this extends to goods supplied in the course of a contract for services.  These are matter of civil law and it is up to the consumer in each case to pursue his rights under the legislation as appropriate.  The Director of Consumer Affairs has no legal function in this area, nor has my Department.  I am of course concerned that consumers should be able to get satisfaction in regard to unsatisfactory products or services and to this end, <Col N="1085" /> that systems of redress for consumers should be as effective as possible.</P>
      <P>As a result of the work of the Director of Consumer Affairs consumers are now more informed about their rights and equally there is a much greater willingness on the part of manufacturers and retailers to entertain legitimate complaints. The position is, however, far from perfect.  I believe existing systems of redress are capable of improvement whether through the introduction of codes of practice or otherwise and this is something that is being pursued, as resources allow, by the Director of Consumer Affairs.  I have also taken this matter up with the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>A number of occasional surveys, mainly on the subject of labour availability, carried out by my Department in various areas of Dublin give information on the numbers seeking work and, in some cases, sufficient data to calculate unemployment rates.</P>
      <P>Since 1979 surveys on labour availability were carried out in Rialto and the Dublin inner city area to ascertain the level and characteristics of the available labour supply.  The Rialto survey identified 350 people (184 males and 166 females) who would take up employment in the Rialto area if jobs were available. The Dublin inner city survey identified 1,111 people (715 males and 396 females) who would take up employment in the Dublin inner city area if jobs were available. Neither survey, however, provided information on unemployment rates in the areas covered.</P>

      <P>All apprentices notified to AnCO as having lost their jobs are written to by AnCO advising them to contact a specified AnCO training centre, usually the centre nearest their home address. AnCO then try to place these apprentices on suitable training programmes either within AnCO itself, within the educational system or with employers while efforts are being made through special apprentice placement committees based in the centres to find alternative full-time placements for them with other employers.</P>
      <P>While on this interim training the income of the apprentice is maintained, accommodation is subsidised if necessary, and the period spent in training is credited to the apprentice's period of apprenticeship.  For the 12 months referred to a total of 1,148 apprentices were accommodated on such programmes. I am satisfied that, in general, lay-off of apprentices by employers has been due to the recession and that every possible effort is being made by AnCO and my Department to help redundant apprentices who wish to do so, to complete their apprenticeship.</P>

      <P>Payment of redundancy lump sums to workers under the Redundancy Payments Acts is primarily a matter for the employer.  However where the employer fails to pay, the payments may be made from the Redundancy Fund established under the Acts.  Applications from a number of workers in the firm concerned for payment of redundancy lump sums from the fund have recently been received by my Department.  These are being investigated as a matter of priority by the Department and arrangements will be made to pay any lump sums to which the workers are entitled under the Acts.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 577 to 593, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The loss of telephone service in the area is due to the main cable being flooded.  Because of the number of such faults, which require attention by specially trained staff, I regret that there is delay in repairing them, but I expect that all the service will be restored to all concerned within the next few days.  A programme of preventive maintenance is in hands throughout the 01 area with a view to reducing the incidence of cable outages through flooding and, as I indicated in reply to Question No. 442 on Wednesday 30 June 1982 from the Deputy, a special examination of measures to reduce the incidence of flooding in this particular area is being undertaken.</P>

      <P>Circular F36/'82 was issued in accordance with normal practice to inform vocational education committees of the situation in relation to the provision made in the Vote for vocational education in the relevant year and making reference to the position in regard to the charging of tuition fees for certain courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committees were informed that the financial allocations made to them for 1982 were made on the basis that tuition fees as appropriate to 1981-82 for all full-time third-level students as well as full-time day courses in respect of which <Col N="1130" /> fees are charged, will be increased by 25 per cent with effect from 1 September next and that fees for part-time courses will similarly be increased by 25 per cent with effect also from the commencement of the 1982-83 session.</P>
    <P>It was requested that in the case of adult education classes a system of minimum hourly rates be introduced as from the 1982-83 school-year and such rates, ranging from 80p per hour to 130p per hour, were specified in the circular.  In deciding on the rates to be specified regard was had to the information available in regard to the rates already being charged for various courses by different committees.  It was considered desirable to have standardised minimum rates so as to lead to more uniformity of practice as between the committees.  The amounts of such minimum rates of fee to be charged had regard to the provision made for the service of vocational education in the vote for 1982.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid <Col N="1142" /> disability benefit from 18 December 1980 to 2 January 1982.  He was not entitled to payment from 4 January 1982 as, according to the records of the Department, he had not the required minimum of 26 paid or credited contributions in the contribution year 1980-81 which governed his claim from that date.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy has intimated that payment was discontinued from September 1981, inquiries made have revealed that cheques which issued to the claimant from September 1981 to 2 January 1982 were cashed in his name.  It is proposed therefore that an inspector will call on the claimant at an early date to afford him an opportunity of inspecting the cashed cheques.  The matter will be reviewed on receipt of the inspector's report.</P>
      <P>The claimant again claimed disability benefit from 30 March to 26 June 1982, after which date he was certified fit to resume work.  As this claim was also governed by the contribution record in 1980-81 he was not entitled to payment. In this connection he was requested on 15 December 1981 and on 2 April 1982 to furnish particulars of his employment record in the contribution year 1980-81 (April 1980 to April 1981).  He did not reply to either of those requests.</P>

      <P>Provided she is available for work she may qualify for receipt of unemployment benefit or assistance.  Unemployment benefit is payable to persons who satisfy the required contribution conditions and entitlement to unemployment assistance is based on means.

      <P>The person concerned applied for a non-contributory old age pension in March 1979.  On 22 September 1979 the local pension committee decided that he was not entitled to any pension as his means exceeded the statutory limit.  His means, consisting of capital and the weekly value of a holding were assessed at £42.17 per week.  Notification of the pension committee's decision was sent to the claimant on 22 September 1979.  He <Col N="1144" /> did not appeal against the decision and there is no trace of a repeat claim for old age pension having been received from him since.  If his circumstances are such that he now considers he is entitled to the pension he should re-apply and the claim will be forwarded to a social welfare officer for investigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the introduction of the old age contributory pension scheme in 1961 there was widespread publicity as to the qualifying contribution conditions for the receipt of such pension.  These conditions are included in a booklet and in a separate leaflet on old age contributory pensions, both of which are available free of charge at all offices of the Department throughout the country.</P>
      <P>When the salary ceiling for non-manual workers was removed in April 1974 many such workers who had previously been insured under the Social Welfare Acts re-entered insurance.  During the years when they were not compulsorily insured, it was open to them to keep their insurance effective by becoming voluntary contributors.  Such contributions are reckonable for old age contributory pension purposes and many insured persons have in fact qualified for the pension on the basis of these contributions.  It was a matter for the persons concerned whether or not they opted to become voluntary contributors.</P>
      <P>The requirement of an average of 20 contributions paid or credited between 1953 or the date of entry into insurance, if later, and the date of attainment of pension age was considered to be a reasonable minimum level of contribution for entitlement to pension.  As normally the minimum period of insurance required for old age pension purposes is ten years, an average of 20 contributions paid or credited over that period would give a total of 200 contributions.  A person could therefore qualify for pension on this with a relatively low record of contributions.  Under the regulations persons who could not qualify for an old age contributory pension by reason of late entry into insurance are entitled to a refund of the pension element of the contribution.</P>

      <P>An application for free electricity allowance from the person concerned was disallowed in April 1982, as his son who was not a person who came within the excepted categories for satisfying the living alone condition of the scheme was also residing with him.  If the pensioner considers that he now satisfies all the qualifying conditions of the scheme, he should reapply for the allowance through his local ESB office.

A further application received on 16 April 1982 was approved <Col N="1166" /> as her son is no longer living with her. She has been awarded a living alone allowance with effect from 5 March 1982 and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have been asked to apply the free telephone allowance to her account from 1 March 1982.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 23 June 1979 and was paid to 1 December 1979.  Payment ceased as from that date in the absence of continuing medical evidence of incapacity. The claimant again submitted medical evidence from 3 October 1981 and has been paid disability benefit to 10 July 1982.  In view of the fact that she failed to submit medical evidence of incapacity from December 1979 to October 1981 she was not entitled to be paid disability benefit in respect of that period. Under the regulations payment of disability benefit cannot be made in respect of any period more than six months prior to the date of receipt of the medical evidence of incapacity.</P>

      <P>Insured persons who furnish to the Department medical evidence of incapacity for work are entitled to payment of disability benefit provided that they satisfy the statutory governing contribution <Col N="1167" /> conditions and obey the rules of behaviour provided for in the appropriate regulations.  The fact that such persons receive payment under an occupational sick pay scheme during illness does not affect their entitlement to disability benefit.  In the circumstances it is not necessary, before payment of benefit is made, to take any action in such cases to ascertain whether the claimant is receiving payment under such a scheme.</P>
      <P>In practice it is invariably a condition of sick pay schemes operated by institutions such as banks, that the employees are required to surrender to the employers the amount received by way of disability benefit or are only paid wages or salary equal to the difference between normal wages or salary and the appropriate weekly rate of disability benefit.</P>

The remaining one-third sign once weekly at signing centres, mainly Garda stations, throughout the country.  If all those attending local offices were required to sign daily additional staffing and ancillary costs estimated at about £3,000,000 per annum would be involved.

      <P>The person concerned has not claimed unemployment benefit.  He did, however, claim occupational injury benifit from 14 March 1980 under his old insurance number and was paid from that date, to 11 September 1980 when his entitlement to injury benefit was exhausted as he had been paid for the maximum statutory period of 26 weeks.</P>
      <P>The claim from 12 September 1980 was treated as one for disability benefit and he was paid to 10 September 1981, when his entitlement was exhausted as he had less than 156 paid contributions to his credit since entry into insurance.  On reviewing his position at that stage it was discovered that he had been claiming disability benefit concurrently under his RSI number from 9 February to 19 August 1981 and from 24 August to 25 September 1981.  He accordingly received payment of disability benefit amounting to £1,463.22 to which he was not entitled and the Department have written to him about this.</P>

The rates of flat-rate injury benefit and pay-related benefit payable in the period from 5 March 1982 to 5 July 1982, date of latest medical evidence received, are as follows:</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 6 January 1982. He was not entitled to payment as according to the records of the Department he had not the required minimum of 26 paid or credited contributions in the contribution year 1980-81 which governed his claim.</P>
      <P>It was subsequently established that he was claiming unemployment assistance during the contribution year 1980-81 and therefore had sufficient credited contributions to qualify him for payment of disability benefit at the appropriate maximum rate for a single person.  All arrears of disability benefit due from 6 January 1982 to 3 July 1982 have now been paid to him less the amount of supplementary welfare allowance which he received from the South Eastern Health Board in that period.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance on 25 January 1982.  Following the completion of inquiries which were necessary to determine his means he was granted a qualification certificate with nil means which qualified him for unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £20.35 increased to £25.45 from 31 March 1982.  These are the maximum rates payable to a single person with nil means living in a rural area.  All arrears due to him will be paid this week and weekly payments will continue to be made as they fall due.</P>
      <P>In connection with his claim to unemployment benefit, the person concerned was unable at the time of his claim to furnish evidence of employment in this country since his return from the UK which is required under EEC regulations for the purpose of aggregation of his contributions in both countries.  He recently furnished the local office with his income tax from P.45 and the Department of Health and Social Security in Newcastle-upon-Tyne have been asked to give details of his UK contributions for the purpose of his claim to unemployment benefit.  When the required information is received his entitlement will be determined without delay.</P>

To qualify for unemployment assistance a person must be the holder of a qualification certificate which is a statement of the person's means.  He failed to disclose his means and accordingly he was refused a qualification certificate by a deciding officer on the grounds that he had failed to show that his means were within the statutory limits.  It is open to him to <Col N="1179" /> appeal against the decision of the deciding officer if he is dissatisfied with the decision in his case.

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit in respect of an accident at work on 22 December 1981.  Following inquiries regarding the accident his claim for injury benefit was allowed from 22 December 1981 at the maximum appropriate rate and payment was made to 3 April 1982.  As from 5 April 1982 the weekly rate of disability benefit in this case was greater than the rate of injury benefit which would ordinarily be payable.  In the circumstances the claim was treated as one to disability benefit from that date.  On the changeover to disability benefit payment was inadvertently suspended.  The matter was subsequently rectified and all arrears of disability benefit due for the period from 5 April 1982 to 15 May 1982, after which date he was certified fit to resume work, were included in cheques for £390.60 and £23.40 which issued on 18 May and 26 May 1982 respectively.</P>

Two of these are permanently headquartered in the Department's Galway office and the others are strategically headquartered to meet the needs of the area and to allow for the necessary degree of mobility within the inspectorate.  Provided inspectors comply with the headquartering arrangements in force, the location of their residence is entirely a matter for themselves and it would not be appropriate for me to give any details concerning the residence of any inspector.

      <P>The introduction of a special disc similar to the car registration disc has been considered on a number of occasions, but no practicable system has emerged.  One of the difficulties is that while car registration must cover a particular vehicle to the end of a specified period, and this can be clearly indicated on the car registration disc, car insurance can cover a driver for varying periods and is not necessarily related to the car being driven.  The person actually driving the car may not, in fact, be covered at all for civil liability.</P>

      <P>Records are not maintained in such a way as to provide particulars of the average number of gardaí serving at particular stations in any year and compilation of the information would involve a disproportionate amount of Garda time.  Particulars of the number of gardaí of all ranks assigned to the stations mentioned in the question on 31 December in each of the last ten years and of the number of official cars allocated to these centres on the same dates are, however, available and are given in the following statement:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the action he proposes to take on complaints in relation to the display and sale of improper literature; the steps that have been taken to prevent entry into this country of such literature for display or sale; if he will consider amending the present legislation to make the law more effective; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Doherty) Sean (Longford-Roscommon) Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information that there is a problem in relation to the display and sale of such literature.  Under section 42 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, the Revenue Commissioners may prevent the importation of any indecent or obscene book or other article.  It is a matter for the Censorship of Publications Board in accordance with the Censorship of Publications Acts, 1929 to 1967, to decide whether the sale and distribution in the State of any publication should be prohibited and it is open to any member of the public to make a complaint to the board about any particular publication. If these provisions were shown to me to be insufficient to deal with any problem that might arise, I should, of course, be prepared to consider amending legislation.</P>
