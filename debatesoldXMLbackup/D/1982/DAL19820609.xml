      <P>It is proposed to take item No. 5.  By agreement there will be no Private Members' Business today. Also, by agreement, the Dáil will meet on Friday at 10.30 a.m. and will adjourn not later than 4.00 p.m.  Business will be confined to Estimates for the Public Services.  If a division is demanded on an Estimate the division will be postponed until 8.30 p.m. on the next Wednesday on which the Dáil sits until that hour.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, as the Taoiseach is travelling to New York later today with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I wonder if I might inquire whether he would think it appropriate before he goes to give some account to the house of our position on the Israeli invasion of the Lebanon and in particular how this is to be reconciled with the &ldquo;traditional policy of neutrality&rdquo; about which we heard so much last week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I see a difficulty for the Taoiseach and the Minister, leaving as they are shortly.  But the House would wish to get an updating of the position and assessment of the situation of the UN forces and the Irish contingent.  I recognise <Col N="1160" /> it is something the Taoiseach will probably be discussing in New York.  But, in view of the nature of the situation at present, to leave this over until next week would be a very unhappy situation for the House.  Perhaps some consideration could be given to a statement being made on that even in the Taoiseach's absence. I see the difficulty about it but I feel that we ought not to leave it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is being compounded by the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has to go to Bonn today.  There is a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Community in Bonn today to discuss the situation in the Lebanon.  So I would be in an even greater difficulty making a statement to the House before that meeting takes place in Bonn.  I appreciate that the situation is a very tense one from our own point of view and from the point of view of the world at large and I would very much like to be in a position to give the House the latest information available to me about the situation.  But, unfortunately, as Deputies know, I have to leave almost immediately for New York.  I will certainly undertake that, as soon as possible on my return, I will make a statement to the House about the various issues.  Unfortunately there are many of them surfacing at present.  Indeed, perhaps I might be able to keep the leaders of the Opposition parties informed from New York of anything of significance that arises there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Taoiseach for that.  We have to show understanding for his position.  But, if the Minister is going to Bonn today, would it be possible for him to make a statement to the House tomorrow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the Minister was going to New York but then I thought that Bonn was replacing that. Perhaps some other Minister could bring us up to date on the situation tomorrow <Col N="1161" /> because an awful lot can happen in a week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the situation is changing so rapidly from moment to moment confronts us all.  Any information I might give here this morning would probably be out of date this afternoon. So the best thing to do is to undertake to have the matter raised here in the House as soon as I return and to keep the Opposition party leaders informed of any significant developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With the position changing from minute to minute, as the Taoiseach says, may the House take it that, rapidly though it is changing, there is one fixed point on the political horizon, namely, our &ldquo;traditional policy of neutrality&rdquo;?  All I want to discover from the Taoiseach is &mdash; and surely he can tell me this off the top of his head &mdash; are we neutral in the conflict between Israel and Lebanon? And, if not, why not?  And in what respect do the considerations differ from the position which we were hearing about last week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Both are situations of conflict and, as I have explained on many previous occasions, we believe that our best endeavours should be made through the UN and particularly now through our membership of the Security Council.  In both of these areas of conflict the principles are the same and really I could summarise them by saying that we are endeavouring to bring the conflict to an end as soon as possible and in the most expeditious way available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope they can both be reconciled with the people's policy, whatever that is, and in a manner which is comprehensible to free men.  We want a foreign policy which free men can understand, not one fit only for sleeveens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the Government propose to make their position on this issue clear and distinct in advance of any position that might be arrived at by way of the European political co-operation?  If <Col N="1162" /> the answer is yes then surely, having regard to the reports received from our Defence Forces in South Lebanon plus the points made by our representative Mr. Dorr in the UN, the Government are able to announce their position on this matter independently of whatever common position is adopted in Bonn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our position is quite clear and had been made clear in the Security Council.  We deplore, as trenchantly as we can, the invasion of Lebanon and we urge the withdrawal of the Israeli forces and we also condemn the civilian casualties which are taking place there.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kelly, we cannot have a debate on it now.  You have been given an assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two points that the House should be concerned about. One is to have the assurance about the position of the Irish forces there and the UN forces generally and clarification of the position.  I wonder whether we might consider, in consultation with the Whips, whether the Minister for Defence might be in a position to give factual information on this to the House, perhaps tomorrow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy that information at the moment.  The position in regard to our forces there is that they are in no danger.  As a Government statement yesterday explained, their mission there is a peace keeping one, not a peace enforcement one.  They did not have any role to prevent an invasion, neither did they have the force to do so.  They discharge their responsibilities effectively, and at the moment the Army authorities assure us there is no military danger to our forces there, but naturally we are keeping the situation under constant observation.  We are also in touch with the Secretary-General and the other troop-supplying countries about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not seeking an <Col N="1163" /> instant statement from the Taoiseach because this is not the moment to go into detail.  What we will be looking for is a statement saying what role has been played by our forces and the differences alleged to exist between how the Norwegian, Nepalese and Irish forces have treated the invasion, and as to the rationale of that.  There are problems of public understanding here and a statement from the Minister of Defence might clarify the facts.  We might look to the Whips to discuss that.  Secondly, I would like to know whether there is a possibility of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs committing us to make a further exercise in peace-keeping in the present very difficult and dubious conditions before the House meets again to have an opportunity to consider it?  Could the Taoiseach give an assurance on those points?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair will bear with me, this is on the Order of Business.  The Taoiseach indicated that next week he will make time available to make a statement on our Middle East policy.  Would he consider allocating time to debate our policy in this area to give Members an opportunity to discuss it?  Could he arrange to have resolutions which are relevant not only to the Middle East situation but generally and to which this country is a party circularised to Members? It is very unsatisfactory that we learn through the media of resolutions to which we are attaching the name of the State.  This is a facility which should be <Col N="1164" /> accorded to Deputies on all sides of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be disorderly, but with the permission of the Chair perhaps I could reply to both points.  I would favour a debate rather than a simple statement and I agree that the circulars should be circulated.  I will arrange to have that done.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1982: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill confirms the taxation changes which I announced in my budget statement of 25 March and I am also using the opportunity to introduce some improvements in the tax code which are aimed at achieving a fairer and a more efficient system.  Some of the new tax measures proposed in the budget, though perhaps of relatively minor importance in the overall context, involve substantial changes in existing tax provisions.  These changes are incorporated in the Bill and I will clarify them for Deputies in the course of this speech.</P>
      <P>Before I speak on the details of the Bill, I would like to refer briefly to the budgetary and taxation strategy which is being followed by the Government.  I do not intend today to give a comprehensive account of the Government's overall approach to the economy.  This will be contained in the medium-term economic plan which is now being prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of my budget statement I said that the Government's principal concern was to achieve a proper balance between reducing our borrowing needs and improving employment.  I also underlined our commitment to a fairer system of taxation.  We are making progress this year in reducing borrowing for day-to-day <Col N="1165" /> purposes.  In our budget projections we are within the limit for the year recommended by the EEC and I am hopeful that these projections can be realised. The PRSI tax concession of £312 which was introduced in April will reduce tax revenue by £45 million this year.  I have said previously that this has to be made good.  A major review of departmental expenditures has recently been completed and the results of this review are now being evaluated in my Department. It is hoped that this will provide substantial savings but, if there is still a shortfall on the £45 million, then I will consider taxation options.</P>
    <P>As regards the budget targets, I would like to remind the House that the quarterly figures this year do not give an accurate reflection of the trend in the current deficit.  The pattern of the deficit this year is unusual in that the budget was delayed and interest payments were higher than normal in the first quarter, while a significant proportion of the additional revenue raised in the budget will not accrue until the final quarter.  The deficit at the end of March was 58 per cent of the projection for the year as a whole and was in line with expectations.  As estimates of receipts and expenditure are not built up on a quarterly basis, it is not possible to make firm forecasts of the precise level of the deficit in each quarter. Broadly speaking, however, the deficit by end-June should be of the order of 100 per cent of the figure for the year as a whole and this figure should be significantly exceeded by end-September.  As I have said, the real impact of extra tax receipts will not be felt until the final quarter of the year particularly because of VAT on imports.  In that quarter revenue should significantly exceed expenditure and thus ensure that the budget targets for the year as a whole are achieved.</P>
    <P>Borrowing for capital purposes must be viewed in a different light.  I am not advocating unrestricted borrowing for capital development as this would be entirely wrong.  We must be selective but we must at the same time be prepared to borrow at a substantial level for sound investment projects which will strengthen <Col N="1166" /> our economy and provide a worthwhile return in due course.  I want to emphasise the need for greater selectivity.  There is a growing concern that much of our capital investment in the past has failed to produce an adequate return and we must be more cautious in future about the uses to which this borrowing is put.  In short, there will have to be much more exhaustive analysis of proposals for capital investment.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned already the Government's concern to achieve a fairer system of taxation.  I expect that the first report of the Commission on Taxation will be published shortly.  The commission have been conducting a comprehensive examination of our taxation system for the past two years; they are representative of different interests within the community and their recommendations should provide a basis for substantial changes in the tax code.  The commission's terms of reference require them to make recommendations which will achieve an equitable incidence of taxation. While we are making progress towards a fairer system, the present arrangements leave much to be desired. We must ensure, more so than at present, that the heavier burden falls on those who are in the best position to pay and that the tax net is more widely spread.</P>
    <P>This must not be confused, however, with the issue of the overall level of taxation. Many people feel that there is simply too much taxation and this attitude is understandable.  While the overall burden of taxation here is high, it is not out of line with taxation levels in other European countries generally.  Comparisons are difficult because of the problems of matching statistics from various countries but the general indications are that our overall tax revenue is set at a reasonable level.  One of our problems is that the base for collection of this revenue is too narrow.  This base has to be broadened and this means that we have to find new tax sources and that those who do not make a fair contribution at present will have to pay more.</P>
    <P>More fundamentally, however, there is now a wide imbalance between the levels of expenditure and revenue.  Either <Col N="1167" /> expenditure is too high or taxation is too low.  If the overall level of taxation in the broadest sense has virtually reached its maximum potential, then the only conclusion is that the level of Government expenditure is too high and must be reduced and policies must be directed to this end.  There is no other option.  In this regard I would like to emphasise in the strongest possible terms that there is no question of public expenditure being out of control.  Public expenditure is high because of deliberate policy decisions taken by successive Governments.  As I have already implied, the reality must now be faced that this high expenditure is at the core of our present financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to individual items in the Bill.  Some of the proposals in the budget have been modified and I will draw special attention to these changes.  I will also deal at some length with items of significance which were not spelt out in any detail in the budget.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 to 3 are concerned with the changes announced in the budget in the income tax exemption limits, allowances and rate bands.  Let me clarify once again the purpose of these changes.  They are designed to have substantially the same effect, for individual taxpayers, as the tax credit proposals of 27 January.  A comparison of the two approaches shows this very clearly.  Both the tax credit proposals and the budget changes involve a redistribution of the income tax burden to the benefit of lower and middle-income groups.  In the case of the proposals of 27 January, this was to be achieved by tax credits.  In the budget it is achieved by improvements in the personal allowances and adjustments to the 35 per cent rate bands.  The budget changes have substantially the same effect as the tax credit proposals of 27 January, but without the administrative difficulties associated with tax credits.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the benefit-in-kind from the use of a company car and here there is an important modification of the budget proposal.  For the future, the benefit to an employee from the private use of a company car will, for income tax <Col N="1168" /> purposes, be calculated as a percentage of the original market value of the car. The percentage will vary from 12½ per cent, where the car only is supplied, to 20 per cent, where all costs are met by the employer.  Tapering relief will be available where the business mileage exceeds 10,000 miles.  Where the business mileage exceeds 25,000 miles there will be no chargeable benefit.  In the case of bona fide car pooling arrangements, there will be no charge to tax in respect of any incidental private use.</P>
    <P>The proposal to grant income tax relief to elderly persons in respect of private tenancy rents is contained in section 5. Relief will commence in 1983-84 and will be based on the rent paid in 1982.  The maximum amount of rent on which relief will be granted is £500 in the case of single or widowed persons, and £1,000 in the case of married couples jointly assessed. The special PRSI allowance of £312 for those who pay PRSI contributions at the higher rates is confirmed in section 6.</P>
    <P>There is a concession in section 7 for those who are obliged to pay excess life assurance premiums because of ill-health. Section 8 deals with loans to employees at preferential interest rates. I gave notice in the budget statement of my intention to look at the tax provisions relating to preferential loans.  If no changes were made, those with low interest loans would have a considerable extra advantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> persons borrowing at commercial interest rates.  Besides, there would be an extra risk that low interest loans would be used as a means to circumvent the new interest provisions and the new benefit-in-kind provisions for motor cars.  In future, the benefit from a preferential loan, that is, the difference between paying interest at the preferential rate and at the specified rate of 12 per cent, provided for in the Finance Act, 1979, will be charged to income tax.  The borrower will be treated as having paid interest at the specified rate and will qualify for income tax relief on the interest, subject to the normal rules.  Ordinary employees with preferential loans should be largely unaffected by these changes. For example, the new arrangements will not increase the income tax liability of a <Col N="1169" /> married man with a preferential housing loan of up to £40,000.</P>
    <P>Section 9 exempts, with effect from 1980-81, military service pensions paid to veterans of the War of Independence, their widows or dependants.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 and 11 bring the limits which deal with recovery of tax from defaulters into line with the new jurisdiction limits of the District and Circuit Courts, and section 12 extends for a further year the residence-related employment scheme which was first introduced in 1979.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 to 16 deal with the measures announced in the budget relating to the taxation of farming profits.  The rate of stock relief available to farmers in respect of increases in the value of their stock is being raised from 100 per cent to 110 per cent.  The special arrangements for payment of income tax in two instalments by full-time farmers is being extended for another year.  The credit for rates against tax on farming profits in 1982-83 will be one-half of the rates paid for 1981 and the remainder will be treated as a deductible expense in computing taxable profits.  This follows from the reduction in rates.  The tax allowance in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the construction of farm dwelling houses is being removed.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the abolition, from the date of its inception, of the agricultural resource tax, which was discontinued last year.  The tax which has been collected in respect of the year 1980-81 will be refunded.  Payments under the employment contribution scheme and grants towards employment in the service industries are exempted from tax under section 18, and section 19 gives effect to the budget proposal to provide tax relief for the cost of repairs to buildings which are of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest.  This relief is conditional on reasonable access to the building being allowed to the public.  Section 20 disallows business entertainment expenses incurred on or after 26 March as a deduction for income tax or corporation tax purposes.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements for interest <Col N="1170" /> relief are set out in sections 21 to 23. Because of the serious technical difficulties to which they would give rise, it was not possible to implement in full the earlier budget proposals.  Apart from transitional arrangements in respect of loans in existence before 26 March or 6 April, as appropriate, relief will in general be confined to interest on borrowings to purchase, improve or repair the taxpayer's sole or main residence.  In the case of other loans, no relief will be allowed for interest on the amount by which the borrowings exceed the specified limits. These limits are £5,000 for married couples, £3,600 for widowed persons and £2,500 for single persons.</P>
    <P>For overdrafts and credit card facilities, only the amount of the debt balance on 25 March will qualify for relief and then for the current tax year only.  Special provisions will, however, apply where overdrafts or credit card facilities in existence on 25 March are replaced by loans. The existing overall limits on the total amount of interest qualifying for income tax relief will continue to apply.  As an anti-avoidance measure the new arrangements are also being extended to companies in respect of their non-trading interest.</P>
    <P>Section 24 continues stock relief for a further year.  Under the following section, the special arrangements between the Revenue Commissioners and the building societies for determination of tax due on interest and dividends are, broadly, to remain unchanged for 1982-83. However, following the recent agreement on mortgage interest rates between the Minister for the Environment and the building societies, provision is also being made for a decrease in the overall tax payable in 1982-83 by societies which maintain certain interest rate levels on housing loans.</P>
    <P>The basic rate of corporation tax is increased from 45 per cent to 50 per cent in section 26.  There are consequential adjustments in the small companies' rate from 35 per cent to 40 per cent and in the low rate applicable to certain bodies from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.  These increases will take effect as from 1 January 1982 onwards.  This section also ensures that <Col N="1171" /> the 10 per cent rate for manufacturing companies will remain unchanged.  In section 27, the due dates of payment for corporation tax are brought forward by three months and the period of grace during which interest is not charged on overdue corporation tax is reduced from two months to one month.</P>
    <P>Arising from the scheme announced by the Minister for Agriculture on 31 March for aiding farmers in severe financial difficulty, there will be a tax credit against the corporation tax payable by the two main banks, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland.  The other participants in the scheme &mdash; the ACC, Ulster Bank and Northern Bank &mdash; will receive a direct grant and provision has already been made for this in the budget.  Section 28 now makes provision for the tax credit.</P>
    <P>Chapters VI and VII of the Bill contain the sections relating to the various capital gains tax changes.  Section 30 provides for the abolition of tapering relief and for the increases in the general rates of capital gains tax announced in the budget, including the special higher rates for short-term gains.  These rates are applied to companies, for corporation tax purposes, in section 31.  There has been loud criticism from some quarters about the increases in the rates of capital gains tax and especially the new high rates on short-term gains.  The yield from capital taxation has been much too low and substantial increases are fully justified.  In section 32, the position of small investors is recognised and there is a substantial concession for them.  The present annual exemption limits for capital gains tax are being increased fourfold and the new thresholds will be £2,000 for an individual and £4,000 for a married couple.</P>
    <P>Section 33 speeds up the collection of capital gains tax due on disposal by non-residents by bringing forward the tax assessment and payment dates.  The procedures relating to the withholding of part of the proceeds on the sale of land and certain other assets are spelt out in section 34.  The 30 per cent deduction which came into force on budget day in respect of disposals of development land was an interim measure and will not be <Col N="1172" /> continued after the enactment of the Finance Bill.  Instead, the pre-budget criteria for clearance certificates will be restored and such certificates will be issued automatically to Irish residents. The section also provides for refunds in regard to the special deductions made since budget day where no liability to capital gains tax arises or to the extent that any deduction made exceeds the capital gains tax liability.</P>
    <P>Sections 36 to 40 contain the provisions dealing with the taxation of disposals of development land.  The provisions will apply to disposals made after 27 January, the date on which the measures were first announced.  The rate of tax applicable to transactions which took place between that date and 26 March will be 45 per cent.  The new 60 per cent and 50 per cent rates will apply as and from 26 March. Special provision is made for the disposal by an individual of small sites where the total consideration for all such disposals in any one year does not exceed £15,000. These disposals will be taxed under the general capital gains tax rules rather than under the special development land arrangements.</P>
    <P>Indexation relief will apply only to the current use value of development land on the date from which the gain is computed. Roll-over relief will not apply in the case of disposals of development land but an exception is being made where the land in question is being disposed of by sports clubs.  While these clubs will continue to be allowed to avail of roll-over relief, they will otherwise be subject to the arrangements for development land transactions.  Only development land losses may be set off against development land gains.  Losses on other disposals may be set off only against gains arising on non-development land disposals.  This prevents the manipulation of losses to reduce the special tax liability now being imposed on disposals of development land.  In addition, companies will be charged to capital gains tax rather than corporation tax on gains from development land disposals.  If a disposal constitutes trading in development land by a builder or land-developer, the tax charge <Col N="1173" /> will, as at present, be to corporation tax or income tax and the new provisions relating to the special capital gains tax on development land will not apply to this situation.</P>
    <P>Chapter VIII makes provision for the establishment of the employment incentive scheme.  The sections in this chapter provide that a deduction of £10 a week will be allowable in computing profits chargeable to corporation tax for each week in which a new employee, taken on by a company between 1 July 1982 and 30 June 1983, is retained in employment. The base period for measuring the increase in employment will be the previous 12 months, that is from 1 July 1981 to 30 June 1982.</P>
    <P>Sections 49 to 57 make provision for the scheme of income tax relief announced in the budget, for shares given to employees under profit-sharing arrangements.  The sections provide that ordinary shares appropriated to an employee up to a maximum value of £1,000 in any one tax year will qualify for tax exemption if they are held for seven years.  If the shares are disposed of within seven years the full tax charge may be reduced depending on the number of years they are held.  This is an entirely new development and I hope that it will make a useful contribution to the evolution of a better industrial relations environment.</P>
    <P>There was a strong commitment in the budget to deal more effectively with tax evasion and tax avoidance.  In accordance with this commitment, the rate of interest charged in back duty settlements is being increased from 1.25 per cent to 2 per cent from 1 November next and section 58 provides for this.  The monetary penalties for a range of offences are being increased in section 59, and section 60 is designed to strengthen existing measures which counter tax avoidance through dividend-stripping.</P>
    <P>I announced in the budget that the proposal of the previous Government to impose a charge of £20 on each person leaving the State on a chartered aircraft would not be implemented.  I announced that it was proposed instead to spread the tax over all fare-paying travellers by <Col N="1174" /> applying a charge of £2 per passenger on cross-Channel sea routes and £3 per passenger on all other sea and air routes. Section 62 of the Bill implements the proposal which will apply to tickets purchased in the State on or after 1 September 1982.  The charge will, however, not apply to travellers going to Northern Ireland.  As regards disabled persons, the charge will not apply to those who because of physical handicap are transported in wheelchairs or on stretchers, and invalids in general will be exempted when travelling to a recognised place of religious pilgrimage.</P>
    <P>Section 63 confirms the budget increases on petrol, road diesel and auto-LPG.  It provides that the increase will not be passed on to scheduled road passenger services and that excise duty will be repaid on oil contained in goods which are exported.  The section also extends the present duty repayments scheme for excise duty on oil used by the horticultural sector, by providing on a temporary basis for repayment of the total amount of excise duty.</P>
    <P>The rate of duty on motor vehicle parts and tyres is reduced by one-third from 1 October 1982 in section 64.  The reduction should help to encourage a higher standard of maintenance of the existing motor vehicle stock, adding to its useful life and improving safety levels.  I am happy to be able to propose the implementation of this constructive measure which is expected to cost about £5 million in a full year.  At the request of the trade, I am reviewing the proposed arrangements for implementation.  In section 65 the rate of duty on dance hall licences is reduced.  The duty is reduced from £100 to £75 for the annual licence and from £15 to £10 for the monthly licence.  This should be of benefit to community halls in particular.  I would like to remind Deputies that for dances where drink is served after normal hours the budget in fact provided for a substantial increase in the duty on special exemption licences. This is provided for in section 70 below.</P>
    <P>Section 66 increases penalties for betting duty offences.  The penalty is increased from £500 to £800 for non-payment of duty or for breach of regulations <Col N="1175" /> and for unlicensed bookmaking.  The penalty of £50 for obstructing an officer of customs and excise in the course of enforcing betting duty provisions is being increased to £500.  Penalties for excise duty offences may be mitigated by the courts to one-quarter of the full penalty at present and, in section 67, this threshold is now being raised to one-half.  These changes are being made to take account of the fall in the value of money and to maintain the impact of the penalty provisions.</P>
    <P>Sections 68 and 69 provide for the changes in road tax announced in the budget and for increases in the fines for certain road tax and vehicle registration offences.  In section 70 a number of orders made under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957 are being confirmed in accordance with the required procedure including the orders made by the Government which came into effect on 13 March increasing various excise duties.</P>
    <P>In the value-added tax provisions in the Bill there are no significant changes from the budget proposals.  Section 72 provides for the application of the 18 per cent VAT rate to auctioneers' and estate agents' fees in respect of the purchase and sale of land and buildings.  Section 73 is a technical provision relating to the application of VAT to barristers' fees. Section 74 confirms the budget increases in the VAT rates, as from 1 May, from 15 and 25 per cent to 18 and 30 per cent respectively, and maintains the 3 per cent effective rate on building and certain agricultural contracting services.  It also extends, from 1 September 1982, this 3 per cent rate to auctioneers', estate agents' and solicitors' fees relating to the purchase and sale of agricultural land and farm accountancy and farm management services.  Section 75 confirms the increase, from 1 May 1982, in the flat-rate addition for farmers from 1.5 to 1.8 per cent, maintaining the compensation to farmers for the increase in VAT rates on their business requirements.</P>
    <P>Sections 76 and 77 provide for the imposition of VAT on imports.  The Revenue Commissioners have already issued an advance public notice giving details of <Col N="1176" /> the new system which will take effect from 1 September.  The essential feature is that it will apply to all goods whether for immediate use or for warehousing. Sales of goods in warehouse will also become liable to VAT in the normal way. While the new system will to some extent increase the working capital requirements of industry, its dampening effects on economic activity generally will be far less than that of the alternative of increased taxation.  It will also help to curb losses from tax evasion, arrears and insolvencies and will remove the advantage imported goods are seen to have at present over domestically produced goods.  These arguments apply to consumer and industrial goods alike which is why no exceptions to the scope of the new measure have been allowed.  In line with this change, the ordinary domestic system of charging VAT will apply to sales by registered persons in Shannon to persons elsewhere in the State.  The monetary penalties for VAT offences are increased in section 78 in line with similar increases for other taxes.</P>
    <P>Sections 79 to 81 amend the various schedules to the VAT Act, 1972 to give effect to the decisions to apply VAT to fees of the legal and accountancy and related professions from 1 September, and the reductions in VAT on furniture and joinery, furnishings, floor coverings and books from 1 May.  The reductions have been extended to include the application of VAT at the 18 per cent rate to a number of minor items with effect from 1 May.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in section 82 for the deferment until next January of the increase in the 15 per cent VAT rate in respect of tourist services to non-residents in accordance with fixed price contracts entered into before 1 January 1982. This concession is expected to cost nearly £1 million and should be of considerable benefit to those sections of the tourist industry with long-term commitments to overseas tour operators.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn briefly to the sections in the Bill dealing with stamp duties.  Section 83 provides for the imposition of the levy of £20 million on the banking sector.  The base for the levy will <Col N="1177" /> be, as last year, the current and deposit accounts of each bank, subject to certain adjustments.  The duty will be calculated by reference to the average level of accounts at stated dates in September, October and November 1981.  The rates of duty will be 0.2 per cent on the first £100 million of taxable resources and 0.35 per cent of the remainder.  A levy of 1 per cent on certain insurance transactions is introduced in section 84.  The base for the levy will be gross direct premium income of insurance companies from within the State with certain specified exemptions. There will be no levy in respect of insurance business written abroad as this would affect competitiveness in foreign markets.</P>
    <P>Stamp duty on gifts of land to young trained farmers is being removed for a two-year period under section 85.  In order to avail of this concession, which will apply from the date of enactment of the Finance Bill, a farmer must be under 35 when the deed of transfer is executed and be in possession of an appropriate training qualification.  It is hoped that the concession will go some way towards ensuring that land will pass more quickly into the hand of those who are best equipped to work it with maximum efficiency and skill.</P>
    <P>In section 86 provision is made for various increases in stamp duties as well as for the introduction of a fixed duty of £1 for all new insurance policies other than policies of life insurance.  Transactions between close relatives, which are at present liable to a maximum stamp duty of 1 per cent, will in future be liable at half the normal rates which range from ½ per cent to 6 per cent.  These changes were announced in the budget.  The following two sections provide for the continuation of two stamp duty measures which were implemented by Government orders in 1981.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill &mdash; that is sections 90 to 94 &mdash; is concerned with capital acquisitions tax.  There is a provision that the upper limit on the special agricultural relief for farmer beneficiaries will be increased by £50,000 to £200,000 in regard to gifts or inheritances taken on or <Col N="1178" /> after 1 April 1982.  Gifts and inheritances received by a beneficiary from different sources on or after 2 June 1982, the date of publication of the Finance Bill, will be aggregated to determine a beneficiary's capital acquisitions tax liability on a particular benefit.  This changes the previous arrangements whereby only gifts and inheritances acquired from the same disponer were added together.  From now on all gifts and inheritances taken by a beneficiary from all disponers of the same class will be added together for tax purposes but there will be no aggregation of benefits across the four classes in the tax.</P>
    <P>There are a few matters which do not arise in the text of the Bill but on which I would like to make some comment.  In the budget it was indicated that steps would be taken to ensure that certain earnings paid by way of fees or commissions would be subject to taxation.  This is a complex issue because of the wide variety of payment methods.  It is, however, under continuing examination and I hope to be able to introduce legislation at a later date to close any loopholes that are used for tax evasion.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that during the course of my Financial Statement of 25 March last I indicated the Government's intention to introduce taxation on derelict sites and on certain office developments with a view to ameliorating dereliction in urban areas.  The Bill before the House does not provide for these taxes.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the proposed taxes is to make a positive contribution to eliminating the environmental blight of urban areas &mdash; particularly the inner city areas &mdash; by making it less profitable to hoard unsightly areas in anticipation of development and by extracting a levy on completed office developments.  The principal public authority agents of urban renewal are, of course, the local authorities and I would, therefore, see whatever revenues might arise from these taxes accruing to the local authorities.  The Minister for the Environment, who of course has responsibility in the area of urban renewal and also for the construction industry generally, is at present examining the possibility of developing <Col N="1179" /> these taxes on the lines of local authority taxes.</P>
    <P>In line with the increase in the basic rate of corporation tax from 45 to 50 per cent, the normal tax credit will be changed from 30/70 ths to 35/65 ths in relation to distributions made on or after 6 April, 1983.  I will provide for this in next year's Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I also have under consideration the question of taxation of motor car allowances. In some instances these allowances are extremely generous by any standards.  In view of the increase in the benefit-in-kind provision where an employee has the use of a company car, it is only proper that we should consider the benefit where an employee uses his own car for business.</P>
    <P>In a few areas the Bill contains significant modifications of proposals made in the budget.  These modifications are being introduced either because of technical problems, as in the case of the interest proposals, or because on further examination it became clear that the original proposals were imposing too severe an extra burden on some taxpayers.  To put these changes in proper perspective, I should point out that their overall effect on revenue this year will amount to a reduction of approximately £2½ million.</P>
    <P>I have outlined for the House in, I hope, reasonable detail the main features of this Bill.  Because of the various important changes being made in our tax arrangements, the Bill is quite complex. As I said at the outset, I see it as a significant step forward towards a fairer tax system.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give the Bill a second reading on the grounds of social justice and economic responsibility, and in particular because&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  in departing significantly from the terms of the Budget as outlined in the Financial Statement by <Col N="1180" /> the Minister for Finance in March, 1982, it confers concessions solely on the relatively well off, while giving no equivalent concessions to the low-paid as was proposed in the Family Income Supplement provisions of the Budget presented to the House in January, 1982,</P>
    <P>(b)  in granting concessions in regard to PRSI, it does so in such a way as to give maximum benefit to the well-paid, and little or no benefit to the low-paid.</P>
    <P>(c)  it aggravates national economic difficulties by measures, in regard to payments in advance of Value-Added Tax and Corporation Tax, which will cause losses of jobs in many vulnerable businesses, and will worsen the national budgetary situation for 1983 by using up revenue that would otherwise be available in that year, and</P>
    <P>(d)  it does not provide for any long-term reform of the PAYE system as was contained in the proposal for the introduction of a system of tax credits in the January Budget, while it fails to seek other sources of revenue by abandoning any proposal to reduce tax avoidance through discretionary trusts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to open my remarks by referring to the particular items in the amendment, which I believe together constitute a very persuasive case as to why the House should not pass this Finance Bill.  First, I think there have been few Finance Bills which have departed as significantly as this one does from the budgetary statement of the Minister introduced such a short time ago.  I do not want to give the impression that I believe that Ministers for Finance should not make changes in the Finance Bill from the provisions of the budget.  It is reasonable that they should be free to do so, but if they make changes in so many respects after such a short time of discussions, it is inadequate.  It is also inadequate that the Minister should fail to give the long-term cost of the changes he is making.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> He has told us that the overall effect on revenue of these changes will be £2.5 million this year.  As he well knows, the bulk of the revenue to be derived from the original budget proposals would not have accrued in this year.  In respect of some of the changes proposed there would not have been any revenue this year because those concerned are taxed on their previous year's income and the changes therefore in respect of this year's income would not yield any revenue until next year.  Therefore, the Minister's figure of extra cost to the Exchequer of £2.5 million, though strictly correct, is an inadequate statement of the true position. I invite him, when he is replying, to let the House know the cost of these changes in 1983, 1984 and 1985.  It is only then we will get a true picture of the effects of these changes.</P>
    <P>In many respects, the changes that have been made are merely putting right mistakes made by the Minister in the March budget.  They are mistakes which should not have been made in the first place.  The Minister clearly went too far in some of his March proposals.  He did not have very long to prepare his budget but he had sufficient time to avoid making mistakes of this magnitude, to avoid having had to come back to the House to mend his hand.  If he had not made the mistakes he might have been able to make other revenue provisions which he has not now the opportunity to make.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I believe the change in strategy is one-sided, because all the concessions made will benefit people who are relatively well off.  I am not suggesting that people who enjoy company cars are all rich people by any means: many of them may have serious financial burdens. However, generally speaking, such people are not to be found among the ranks of the low paid &mdash; there are few low paid workers with company cars, as there are few low paid workers who have the opportunity to enjoy capital gains or to incur significant debt upon which interest payment can be charged against their income tax.</P>
    <P>Though it is fair to say that changes should be made in order to promote efficiency <Col N="1182" /> and incentive in our tax system so that even people at relatively good levels of income would have an incentive to earn and to produce more, if we are setting about altering the March budget now I do not think we should alter it solely for one section of the people. There is another section whose interests are ignored completely in this Bill and in the changes made in PRSI.  They are the low paid at work.  The Minister showed considerable solicitude for those who are not at work when he decided to do away with the proposed tax on short-term social welfare benefits.  That proposed tax would have removed from our tax and social welfare systems the position that exists at the moment through which many people who are low paid at work would be better off if they stopped working and claimed either disability or unemployment benefit.  Surely that must rate as one of the craziest situations one could allow to exist in our tax and social welfare systems, yet in his budget the Minister refused to adopt the first measure that had been proposed in recent times by a Government in substantive form to tackle this problem head on.  He abandoned it.</P>
    <P>Not only did he abandon that, but when making concessions in regard to the March budget he concentrated them away from those who are low paid at work for the benefit of those who are relatively better off at work.  In making concessions in relation to PRSI he did so by way of a tax allowance.  As everyone in the House knows, a tax allowance is inherently more beneficial to persons on higher incomes than those on low incomes.  If persons pay tax on most of their incomes at 60p in the £, a tax allowance is worth 60p in the £ to them.  Conversely, if a person is not paying any income tax on any of his income because he has a low income and a large number of dependants, a tax allowance which increases his tax free allowance further is not worth a penny in the £ to such a person.  Likewise, if people are moderately well off and are paying their marginal tax at 35p in the £, a tax allowance on PRSI is only worth 35p in the £ to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1183" /> So clearly the Minister's use of the £45 million which he says is available but which he has not been able to produce yet, gives maximum benefit to the well paid and, as I state in my amendment, is of little or no benefit to the low paid.  If the Minister had £45 million available for concessions in this area &mdash; until he shows us how he is going to raise it one must question whether it is available &mdash; he should have done so by exempting low income people up to a certain level of income entirely from PRSI so that the low paid at work would get direct benefit, those people who find it hard in our present tax system to make up their minds to continue to go to work at all because they would be almost better off staying at home and claiming benefit.  They are the people who should have got the benefit of the £45 million instead of those who are better off.</P>
    <P>The Minister showed a lamentable lack of imagination and of a sense of reality of what is happening in the real economy in the way he chose to give PRSI relief. He should have helped the low paid. Instead, he helped those who are relatively better off and who have less need of the help of the £45 million.  As I said earlier, we do not know where the £45 million will come from.  We should be told where it will come from.  It is not acceptable that the House is asked to adopt this Bill half way through 1982 in the knowledge that a further £45 million must be found somewhere before the end of December.</P>
    <P>We are asked to approve the provisions of this Bill as if it was the last word as far as taxation is concerned.  Of course it is not the last word.  Before the ink of the President's signature on this Bill is dry its provisions may be altered radically by a further supplementary budget.  How can we consider maturely the impact of particular provisions in this Bill if we do not know whether they will be totally altered within a couple of weeks by further taxation amounting to £45 million which must be raised?  We have been asked to consider the Bill in an unsatisfactory manner.  In failing to tell the House and the country how he proposes to raise this <Col N="1184" /> money, the Minister is doing no service either to budgetary procedures here, public understanding of taxation and the necessity for it or his own reputation as a Minister.</P>
    <P>This Bill must be rejected on the grounds that it aggravates national economic difficulties by requiring that payments of VAT and corporation profits tax, which in the normal course would fall to be paid in the first three months of 1983, will artificially and on a once-off basis be brought forward to 1982.  This means two things: by taking the money out of next year the real budgetary situation will be that much worse and also business will have to borrow the money to carry this additional burden.  Business will borrow the money instead of the Government.  I ask the Minister and the House to consider carefully, as perhaps his colleague Deputy O'Donoghue did not when he made this proposal, the state of business at present.  One does not have to search very far to find in every day's paper news of business collapsing and jobs being lost because they are already too heavily in debt and cannot meet interest payments.  Yet the Minister asks them to borrow still more to give money to him to finance artificial transactions because he will not tackle public spending and other problems in our finances.  The Minister is asking business, already on its knees, to carry the can for him.  His whole budgetary strategy for this year is based on the assumption that they will be able to come up with the money.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said he accepted that by the beginning of September we would already have a budget deficit well in excess of the deficit for the entire year and the budget deficit we will have by the end of this month will be 100 per cent of our planned deficit for the entire year.  Then he reassured us by telling us not to worry, that he would get the money in during the last three months of the year in advance corporation tax payments and VAT tax payments.  If the businesses cannot find the money, the Minister's budgetary strategy falls flat on its face.  The whole edifice of the budgetary strategy is built on the assumption that business can borrow hundreds of <Col N="1185" /> millions of pounds extra from the banks to pay to the Minister.  Has there ever been a time when one could be less confident of the ability of Irish companies to come up with money on that scale to save the Government's financial targets?  I do not believe there has been a time, possibly with the exception of the thirties, when business was in greater difficulty than it is at present.</P>
    <P>Not only does this proposal threaten the jobs of hundreds of workers who may be laid off because of financial difficulties within businesses but it means the Government's strategy could fall on its face.  We are all aware of the inability of companies to meet their tax liabilities at present.  Practically every Deputy will have experience of negotiating with the Revenue Commissioners on behalf of companies in their constituencies in an effort to get them to defer interest charges or to phase payments of already due tax over longer periods.  How many other companies are there who do not approach us but who have this kind of problem?  If business cannot come up with the money at the end of the year, the budgetary strategy will collapse.</P>
    <P>As a result of this artificial transaction of bringing forward revenue from next year to this year, the budget deficit for 1983 will be in the region of £1,100 million rather than the £800 million it would have been if we had gone ahead with the January budget.  This is a serious gap and we will not be able to escape making a serious effort to bridge it nor will we be allowed to by our partners in the EEC or those who lend money to us.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not provide any long-term reform of the PAYE system as contained in the tax credit proposals of the Jamuary budget.  The Minister said that he has been able, by restricting the 35p band and other changes, to achieve an incidence of taxation which is not dissimilar to that inherent in tax credit proposals contained in the January budget.  In abandoning the system of tax credits on what he described as &ldquo;administrative grounds&rdquo;, the Minister has abandoned an opportunity to change the whole structure of the system to an inherently fairer basis because tax credits are of the same <Col N="1186" /> benefit to everyone.  If one is paying £1,000 in tax and gets a tax credit of £500 it is worth £500.  If one is paying £1 million in tax and gets a tax credit of £500 it is worth £500.  However, with the allowance system if one is paying 60p in the pound because one is on a high income it is worth 60p and if one pays 30p because one is on a low income it is worth 30p. However, the Minister abandoned the opportunity to go ahead with tax credits and adhered to the old allowance system with all its inequalities.  The only argument he has made in favour of this is administrative difficulties.  I have no patience with Ministers who plead administrative difficulties.  Ministers are there to get things done and not to use their officials as an excuse for their own decisions.  If the Minister decided to abandon tax credits because he does not like them, he should say so and not hide behind the skirts of officials by saying that there are administrative difficulties. That is not an adequate excuse and should not be used.  The Minister made a similar plea in regard to changes in interest payments for tax purposes.  He may be right in the changes he is making but he should not use his sole argument in favour of them certain unspecified technical difficulties.  There are no technical difficulties if one sets about trying to get around them.  Any difficulties can be overcome if there is a will to do so.  In this instance clearly there was not such a will.  Perhaps the Minister was right not to want to make the changes but he should come out and defend them on the basis of policy, not on technical or administrative difficulties.  Whatever they may be he should not be afraid to defend his policies in this House and hide behind administrative and technical problems.</P>
    <P>As far as the whole of this Bill is concerned, as far as recent and perhaps even future Finance Bills and budgets are concerned, the critical problem is the fact that the public sector of our economy is costing too much money and somebody has to pay for it.  To some extent one can get foreign banks to pay for it but they must be repaid and they will not continue to pay for ever.  We have been unable in this House to come to grips with this <Col N="1187" /> phenomenon.  Perhaps I can illustrate the extend to which our public sector has grown by citing a few figures.  Since 1977, that fateful year, public sector numbers have gone up by 13 per cent while the number of people employed in manufacturing, those who must bear the burden of the cost of the pay bill of people in the public sector, has gone up a mere 4 per cent, less than one-third as fast.  Similarly between the years 1977 and 1978 remuneration has not grown in an even pattern as between the public and other sectors of our economy.  Between the years 1977 and 1980 the latest dates for which I have figures available to me, public sector incomes went up by 27 per cent, farm incomes fell by 37 per cent and the incomes of people in manufacturing industries rose by 9.4 per cent.  There is clearly a large divergence in welfare between one sector of our economy and others.  It is worth recording that public spending, spending by the Government, represents two-thirds of all spending in Ireland.  Yet, in the economy which is the most successful in the world, with an inflation rate at around 4 per cent and unemployment practically at zero, namely Japan, public spending represents 24 per cent only of all their spending, as against 60 per cent here.  There is clearly an imbalance in our economy.  It is no wonder that PRSI workers in the non-State sector of our economy feel aggrieved at the burden they are having to bear.  They are being asked to bear an unduly heavy burden when one bears these statistics in mind.</P>
    <P>Where does the fault lie?  It does not lie with the people employed in the public sector themselves because it is not their responsibility to manage public sector numbers.  Responsibility for the management of public sector numbers, for keeping public expenditure under control rests in one place only, in this House. Collectively we have failed to manage that sector of our economy for which we are responsible.  We can preach sermons to industry and tell them they should be more efficient.  We can preach sermons to people in the educational system and tell them they should be more efficient <Col N="1188" /> but, until we put our own house in order, until we manage that part of our economy for which we in this House are responsible, we have no right to preach sermons to anybody.</P>
    <P>I believe that the manner in which this House sanctions millions upon millions of pounds in public spending, in the discussion of Estimates now taking place, is nothing short of disgraceful.  I would remind the House that the Estimates we shall be considering on Friday next are for moneys more than half of which has already been spent, the rest of which is already totally committed and none of which can be changed.  Therefore the debate we shall have here on Friday about public spending will be so much hot air because we cannot change a line or a penny of those Estimates for the reason I have given.  What business, what local authority would scrutinise the spending for which they were responsible in such a foolish manner as we do in this House in our approach to the control of public spending.</P>
    <P>If we are to reduce taxation and its unduly heavy burden on people, we must take our responsibilities in this House for the management of public spending much more seriously than we do at present.  We must ensure that every item of spending for any year is approved and examined in detail in advance in this House before a penny of it is spent.  That is the way that any business, any local authority, would carry out their responsibilities and that is the way we must do it.  It was in order to provide for that to be done that the Coalition Government introduced a paper entitled <i>&ldquo;A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances&rdquo;.</i> I believe one cannot discuss a Finance Bill without discussing the issues raised in that paper.  One cannot hope to bring about a lower level of taxation without taking speedy decisions on the issues raised in that paper.</P>
    <P>However, having said some hard things about the Minister, his budget and Finance Bill, I should like to say some things which are less hard.  I welcome the fact that he has gone ahead with many of the proposals contained in the January budget, proposals of a constructive nature in which I had a deep personal <Col N="1189" /> interest and which, in many cases, were contained in the programme of my party and of the Government of which I was then a member.  I refer in particular to the reduction in the duty on motor vehicle parts which will encourage the development of a motor repairs industry in this country, thereby encouraging people to keep their cars longer rather than buying new imported ones.  I refer to the tax concession for historic buildings which will encourage people to continue to live in them and not allow them become derelict. I refer to the provision of a tax incentive for profit-sharing which, in my view, will redress a very serious problem in Irish industrial relations in which many workers feel they have no stake in the firm in which they are employed.  This will give a direct, though not sufficiently generous, incentive to involving those people directly and financially in their businesses as shareholders.  I welcome also the provision in the Finance Bill for a tax incentive to firms by way of reduced corporation profits tax to increase the number they employ.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the additional stock relief contained in the budget for farmers to encourage them to increase the numbers of cattle and perhaps other stock on the land.  We all know that one of the main reasons for our very large balance of payments problem last year and, to some extent this year, has been the dramatic decline in stock numbers on the land.  This has caused serious problems for the whole of our economy.  That measure &mdash; contained in my January Budget and brought forward into this Finance Bill by the present Minister &mdash; will give farmers in the tax net a very generous incentive to increase the numbers of stock they carry on their land and bring us nearer a situation in which at least we are utilising our land with maximum efficiency rather than having the present under-utilisation all over the country in practically all types of farming.</P>
    <P>All of the measures I have mentioned and indeed some others were contained in my January budget and had I had the opportunity to do so would have provided for them in the Finance Bill I would have introduced.  I am glad that the Minister <Col N="1190" /> has gone ahead with these proposals. They are proposals that stand on their own merits and ones that any sensible Minister for Finance would wish to introduce. I should not let this occasion pass without expressing my appreciation to the Minister for his not having adopted a partisan attitude in this regard, for not having rejected the proposals because they originated with another party.  I will be saying more about the measures later in my contribution.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that rent paid by a person aged 65 and upwards can be used by him as an expense against tax.  A similar proposal was contained in the January budget and it was designed to make a start with a provision for allowing rent more generally to be set off against tax and thereby to remedy the inequity that exists in the system in the sense that people borrowing money to buy houses which they will own can set off against tax the interest on such borrowings whereas if, instead of buying a house they decide to rent, there is no such tax concession.  We must recognise that in many cases the renting arrangement is the more flexible.  It gives greater opportunity for altering the size of accommodation in line with demand &mdash; family size and so on.  In this Bill we are going a little way towards remedying this inequity.</P>
    <P>However, what concerns me somewhat in regard to section 5 is that the people concerned can claim only if they are keeping receipts in respect of all rent paid this year.  What is provided here is that they must have been keeping receipts from 1 January 1982, but that was even before the similar proposal was announced in the January budget let alone brought into law by the passing of this Bill, if it is ever passed.  This stipulation is not giving the people concerned a reasonable opportunity to claim the relief.  Therefore, the Minister would be performing a useful exercise by asking the Minister for Justice to make available for the purpose of advertising this scheme some of the money that Minister is using currently for advertising.  Those people who are over 65 and who are paying rent should be made aware of this change in regard to tax so that they will keep <Col N="1191" /> receipts and will be in a position to get relief in terms of tax in the year 1983-84. Because of lack of publicity this scheme will not work.  Then at some future stage we will have some Minister telling us that there was no response to the scheme.  We cannot get a response to something that the people who would be involved in it are not made aware of.  This is the case particularly in respect of a scheme that is directed at older people, people who are not in the mainstream of discussions about tax changes and who are not as likely as others to be aware of their rights. In these circumstances I ask the Minister to consider as a matter of urgency arranging for some publicity in regard to this proposal and also making some arrangement whereby allowance will be made for the fact that rent receipts are unlikely to be available for the first half of this year.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 32, I welcome the increase to £2,000 in the amount of capital gains which an individual will be able to make in a given year without attracting capital gains tax.  We need to encourage individuals who have some money saved to put that money into risky enterprise, the type that could make either big sums of money or big losses instead of putting the money into gilt edged investment or to investment in property.  We need to encourage an active stock market, a situation in which the small saver becomes involved directly in the stock market in the way that the small saver was involved 20, 30 or 40 years ago.  Unfortunately the stock market today is dominated by the large institutions who are involved in practically all the big transactions with hardly any participation from the small saver.  We must encourage the small saver to put his money into productive investment instead of speculating in property, of building an extension that he does not need or of buying a second home that he does not need either.  The arrangement proposed in section 32 will help in this direction.</P>
    <P>Section 37 refers to the application of the new development land tax to small transactions.  In regard to this tax, which was contained in broad outline in the January budget, I envisaged that a farmer <Col N="1192" /> selling a site or two in order to overcome financial difficulties would not find that in order to get the bank manager off his back he would be treated for tax purposes as if he were a property developer.  Many farmers find themselves now in financial difficulties and if they sell a small number of sites they will not be in a position to enjoy the money because it will be going straight to the bank in order to put the farmer back into a lineball position.  Yet, the Minister is only exempting transactions from tax up to a limit of £15,000. This figure is too low and I should be interested in hearing of the basis on which it was calculated.  It may be calculated in such a way as to negative my criticism but I doubt if that is the case.  I would consider a figure of £30,000 or at least £25,000 to be more appropriate.  However, that is something that we shall have the opportunity of discussing during Committee Stage.  At this stage I am only giving the Minister notice of my views on the matter.</P>
    <P>I turn now to Chapter VIII, which concerns corporation tax.  What is involved here is the relief in respect of increases in employment to which I referred earlier and in respect of which there was provision also in the budget I introduced.  If that budget had been passed I would have been concerned in drafting the consequential Finance Bill that the provision in respect of this relief might be so drafted as to be insufficiently attractive to make it work.  There have been attempts in the past &mdash; I think there was such an attempt in the 1976 budget &mdash; to introduce something along those lines but because the conditions for applicability were so restrictively drafted by the careful men and women concerned in the Department and in the Revenue Commissioners there were perhaps more jobs involved in drafting the Bill than were created by its provisions. That is a danger one must guard against.  As political head of the Department it is particularly the responsibility of the Minister to ensure that that does not happen on this occasion.</P>
    <P>At this point I am not in a position to draw the Minister's attention to certain provisions in this section, provisions which could be deemed to be unduly <Col N="1193" /> restrictive but I will be applying my mind to those between now and Committee Stage and I hope the Minister will be doing the same.</P>
    <P>There is an opportunity in this regard for encouraging firms to create more jobs but we must not be too careful as to how we draft the relevant legislation.  Would the Minister not consider, for example, allowing a deduction of £20 per week per additional employee rather than £10?  A sum of £10 a week is not a lot of money nowadays in terms of the number of people employed.  When we consider the many problems that face an employer who takes on an additional worker, the fact that he has not only to make very substantial charges in terms of PAYE and PRSI but also, because of the additional rights given to the worker under labour legislation, once he has taken the particular worker on we realise he will find it almost impossible to get rid of him or her without going through very difficult procedures.  Many employers are, therefore, not inclined to take on an additional person but rather to employ a machine instead to get a particular task done.  To some extent our excess solicitude to protect workers from the depredations of the bosses has led to a situation where there are fewer workers employed and the bosses are getting machines to do the job instead of people.  I am not sure that £10 a week deduction on corporation profits tax, if the firm happen to be making corporation profits, will be enough to tip the balance.  This tax credit is no use if the firm are not making a profit.  I ask the Minister to consider increasing this credit to a larger sum although I realise it will still not be of benefit to firms who are not making a profit and we must look to some other way of tackling that problem.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to Chapter 9 of the Bill which concerns profit sharing. This proposal was also contained in the January budget.  I am worried about one angle of this proposal and I ask the Minister to look at this between now and Committee stage.  This may be used solely to benefit a few directors of companies or people at the very top level who <Col N="1194" /> will be encouraged to get a share in the company as a way of getting round having to pay 60p in the £ tax and that the profit sharing scheme will not be used for the broad mass of workers.  It is better not to have a profit sharing scheme which does not involve all the workers in a given industry because it only creates further invidious comparisons between one category of worker and another, the worker at the top who is involved in a profit sharing scheme and the worker at the bottom who is not.  If this scheme is to be used simply as a means for paying a few top executives more money without involving the mass of workers in the firm, it will not achieve the social objectives it is designed to achieve.  I would like to see the Minister looking at this to see if he can ensure that its benefits extend to all employees.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister, if he has not already done so, find out how this scheme worked in the United Kingdom and compare the section which refers to this in this Finance Bill with the section in the UK Bill?  I understand that this system has operated in the UK but that it has not been a riproaring success.  The Minister should try to find out why and if there are lessons that can be learned from the lack of success of this scheme in the UK he should apply them in this Bill in appropriate amendments.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister look at the restriction referred to in the last paragraph of this section in the explanatory memorandum dealing with this matter where it is indicated that this profit sharing scheme will only be available where the ordinary shares of a company are quoted on a recognised stock exchange?  As the Minister is no doubt aware, the majority of Irish industry is carried on by private companies whose shares are never quoted on the stock exchange.  I believe if this scheme is restricted to firms quoted on the stock exchange it will only be of benefit to a relatively small number of large firms and their employees.  It would be better if the provision could be extended to all companies, whether quoted or not.  I realise, however, that where a company are not quoted on the stock exchange it is very difficult to put <Col N="1195" /> a value on the shares.  There is no market value for the shares because they are not marketed.  That is a problem which should be overcome; it is not a problem which should overcome us.  The Minister should see if he can find ways to extend the provision to the non-quoted companies as well as the quoted companies.</P>
    <P>There are a few small things I would like to refer to in regard to the exemption of VAT.  The Minister will probably tell me that I should have thought of this when I introduced this concession.  There is an industry in my constituency which makes lampshades.  I understand that lampshades are not included as furnishings for the purpose of this reduction in VAT.  While lampshades are not absolutely essential &mdash; you can look the light straight in the eye &mdash; they have some value.  They are really analogous to the furnishings which are included and it might be worth the Minister's while including them.  If he can include coffins as furniture he can probable include lampshades as well.  I note that is the one concession he made in regard to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A coffin is absolutely essential, but it is another question of whether it is analogous to furniture.  I know the Minister received representations, the same as I did, from coffin makers since the Bill was introduced, who felt they were being unfairly treated. I am not cavilling at the Minister's concession, but as he is in such a generous mood and has been generous to the darker side of things in exempting coffins he might look to the lighter side and exempt lampshades as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to the levy on banks and the levy on insurance companies.  Although these levies were introduced by both Governments they are a very crude and inefficient way of raising revenue, as the Fianna Fáil election programme rightly pointed out.  &ldquo;These levies will ultimately be borne by households.&rdquo;  Those are the well-chosen words used in the Fianna Fáil programme.  They are not borne by banks or by insurance companies.  They will <Col N="1196" /> ultimately be passed on in higher bank charges and higher insurance premiums to the long beleagured consumers.  We should not fool ourselves that we are taxing the fat cats in the insurance companies or the fat cats in the banks.  We are just taxing people who use banks and people who use insurance companies.  It may be a useful way of geting money in the short term &mdash; and I am not denying I resorted to that method myself &mdash; but as the Minister is resorting to it in an even greater extent than I did.  In the end it is the consumer who pays.  Inherently levies are not a fair system of taxing any activity or any group of people.  I believe we must try to find a fairer system of taxing banks and taxing insurance companies if we feel they are paying insufficient tax at the moment and not resort to levies.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will use the argument that these are matters which are being considered by the very useful Commission of Income Taxation which enables us all to dodge or political responsibilities as long as it continues to sit.  I am sure the Minister was disappointed to learn that this report is soon to appear, because he will no longer be able to use it as an excuse when not taking decisions.  For the time being there is something to be said for waiting for their deliberations on how we should tax insurance companies and banks.  As soon as those deliberations are laid before us let us take decisions to tax these people in an appropriate way, if we feel they are not paying enough tax, but let us not resort to levies which in the end are just borne by the consumer.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to section 85, which is concerned with stamp duty exemption for two years on transfers of land to young, trained farmers.  This provision was contained in my January budget and I am glad the Minister has gone ahead with it.  Two things must be said about it and in this I may be speaking against the sense of some other Members who may contribute.  First, it is important that the concession be restricted to two years.  If the impression is created that the concession will continue indefinitely people will not bother to transfer land to the younger farmers.  There are far too many older <Col N="1197" /> farmers who, for some reason, possibly a sense of insecurity that is understandable, hang on to land long after they have passed the age when they are able to use it to the best advantage and do not pass it on to younger members of the family who could work the land.  If we say that indefinitely there will be no stamp duty on land transfers to younger farmers the attitude will be to put off the transfers for a few years.  On the other hand, if we say, as is set out in the Bill, that only in respect of transfers in the next two years will the stamp duty holiday apply, that will be an incentive to people to transfer land to younger members of the family.  I am confident the Minister will hold the line on this issue.</P>
    <P>It is important that young trained farmers should avail of this facility, not simply people who happen to be young and who are related to a farmer.  The fact that a person is young does not necessarily mean that he or she will farm more efficiently. Farming is like any other business, it is something that one has to learn. It is also something that one can learn about formally.  One cannot learn all aspects of farming simply by practical experience.  One can and should learn otherwise.  There may be pressure on the Minister to dispense with the requirement that such people do a 100-hour course before they can avail of this concession or have some other form of education in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The argument may be made to the Minister that there are not sufficient places available in such courses to enable all those who wish to avail of the concession to do so in time to get the transaction through within two years.  If that is the situation &mdash; I do not know because I have no way of knowing what demand there may be &mdash; the Minister should do one of two things, or perhaps both.  He should arrange with the Minister for Agriculture to increase the number of 100-hour courses in the next year or so so that people can undertake such courses before they get the land, while they are getting it or even, in some exceptional cases, after they get the land or, alternatively, he should extend the period <Col N="1198" /> within which training is available.  If it is not possible to increase the number of places in the course, arrangements should be made to extend the period during which the course may be done so that people might be able to do the course even after the transaction is completed. Of course, if they fail to do the course the duty should fall to be fully payable.  It is important that the principle of restricting the period of the concession and the principle that it be available to people who undertake a course of training in agriculture be adhered to and I hope the Minister will do this.</P>
    <P>Those are the main points I wish to make on the Bill.  It is customary at the end of a speech such as this to wind up by saying it all over again but I will save the Chair and the hundreds of listeners here the agony of listening to me repeating what I have said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Each year the Finance Bill should be, and for some years it was, central to progressive management of our nation's finances.  It should be the pivot on which economic and social progress should advance and it is on that basis that I approach this Bill. I propose to make three broad comments on it.</P>
      <P>First, there is the effect that this Bill will have and which Finance Bills in the past three or four years have had on the economic and social climate.  Secondly, I should like to outline some proposed taxation reforms as have been advocated and to point out some of their deficiencies. Thirdly, I should like to indicate some taxation reforms that could be introduced in the general national interest.</P>
      <P>We have to understand the climate in which this Bill has been introduced.  We have a hung Dáil.  We have had a period of considerable political instability in the past 18 months.  We have a Government who in relation to this Bill are wide open to political ambush in the lobbies in a few weeks' time and we could have a general election as a result of this Bill.  We have a Taoiseach whose leadership is once again questioned, but that is not the issue today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> This Bill has been introduced at a time when unemployment is at a peace-time record, when inflation here is still in the top three of the European Community. We have a Finance Bill at a time when the nation's finances are in chaos and this is a cause for real alarm.  Admittedly, there has been some recovery in agriculture but tourism is considerably in decline.  Unless we get things right in the next 12 months, despite any protestations from the Minister for Finance there will be a forced devaluation of the IR£ unless present policies are changed.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of public reaction to the Finance Bill, to taxation and to public spending.  Irish society is in a deep crisis.  There is tremendous public agitation about crime and vandalism which is on the increase.  However, the only way measures are being taken to combat crime is through a Finance Bill, through taxation measures and the provision of scarce money.  This is apart from the great need to change public opinion and education.</P>
    <P>We have a very serious housing crisis of increasing dimensions now because young people are not emigrating and want to live in their two- or three-bedroom dwellings.  A Finance Bill is the kind of measure by which the housing construction industry is encouraged to develop and by which scarce resources are allocated into that industry, and the rest of the community, those of us who are fortunate enough to have houses, assist those who have not.  A Finance Bill can reorient public finances in that direction. Finance Bills manifestly have failed to do this in recent years.  Our major suburbs in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway are starved of amenities.  A Finance Bill, if it was a real Finance Bill in terms of dealing with land speculation and measures to get money deliberately and consciously allocated into the suburbs of our communities to build up amenities for our young people, could provide this kind of money for these areas as could the budget.  Manifestly that has not happened either.</P>
    <P>Finally, in terms of the social crisis to which I wish to refer, we have a transport <Col N="1200" /> crisis and a communications crisis.  Our urban areas are choked and our cities are congested.  Economic and social life are stifled by our failure to use the taxation system to influence the question of car ownership and car parking by way of taxation of cars in urban areas &mdash; even in respect of parking &mdash; to end the chaos and nightmare which exist in transport.</P>
    <P>These are some of the issues which a Finance Bill could influence.  A Finance Bill could influence even, for example, the question of the quality of education in terms of taxation reliefs.  A Finance Bill can have a profound impact on the achievement and maintenance of full employment.  A good Finance Bill can bring about equality of opportunity at many levels.  A Finance Bill of the inspirational type which at this stage one might even perceive, can achieve a genuine overall increase in living standards especially of those on low income, particularly if the Bill has a fair distribution of income and wealth within it.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that, provided there are parallel structural reforms in society, a Finance Bill can go a good way towards having a real impact on poverty.  Therefore, it can have a profound effect on and can implement a great many policies for the betterment of our people.</P>
    <P>Having made these criticisms of what Finance Bills have not done in the past decade and what they could do, I am not at all a prophet of despair or gloom in that regard.  Some politicians &mdash; not very many &mdash; in this country genuinely hold the view that it is possible to convince the Irish people through a Finance Bill that we have a great country to live and work in and in which to rear our children and develop our nation.  Provided we take measures relating to taxation which are vital for the economic and social development of our country, I hold that belief. We have very many distinct advantages in agriculture and in our mixed economy which we could develop further in our trading capacity and in our potential for manufacturing employment.  That potential undoubtedly is there and has grown throughout the sixties and the early seventies, but in the past five, six, seven or <Col N="1201" /> eight years through successive Finance Bills we have fritted away an enormous accumulation of capacity which we would have had and we are now haemorrhaging. It has been a haemorrhage in terms of potential.  What is missing is basically honest, competent, courageous, almost not-giving-a-damn-about-the-electoral-consequences type of political management of the economy.  The only trouble about that is that one finishes up perpetually in Opposition, but at least one is honest.</P>
    <P>At the moment our country is paralysed in terms of taxation management. It has gone hither and thither with this palliative and that palliative, this reform and that reform, this stroke and that counterstroke from about 1975 onwards. We have got nowhere except to develop schizophrenia within our public sector, because any public servant trying to divine what the politicians are up to and having to reflect it each year in the Finance Bill can become only one thing, a total schizophrenic.</P>

      <P>If he did not have that capacity to become one he would have an irreversible breakdown.  Our country, therefore, has declined in leadership, and sectional self-interests and pressure groups now dominate the total political response of the political parties. In that context I come to the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will this Bill really cut the current budget deficit projected for 1983, 1984 and 1985 which seems inevitable at this stage?  The answer must be that it will hardly achieve that.  If anything it looks as though the current Finance Bill will make the opening deficit for 1983 even more severe than it was in 1982.  I do not disagree with Deputy Bruton when he says that a projected opening deficit of £1,100 million is not beyond the bounds of possibility at this stage.  Will the Finance Bill release scarce current resources to finance the public capital programme for the next decade?  Certainly this Finance Bill will not.  It is not heading in that direction.  To what extent will it assist the productive sectors of the <Col N="1202" /> economy?  There is no great evidence that this Finance Bill has a thrust in that direction. To what extent does it really fore-shadow any fundamental reforms of the income taxation system?  Any objective assessment must be that it does not aim in that direction either.  If anything, it is more regressive, and anticipation of the report of the Commission on Income Taxation is, to say the least, a poor consolation. That report will pose more questions than it can answer and will provide information greater in extent than will be the political desire to face up to the facts it may disclose.  Does the Finance Bill relate in any way to the widespread demand for the reform of PAYE and the PRSI systems?  Again the answer must be in the negative.</P>
    <P>These are some of the basic criticisms I make and I do so in the context of the statement made yesterday that 147,000 people are out of work.  A significant and disastrous feature is that 42,000 of these are under the age of 25.  If that significance does not dawn on politicians we will not be around much longer to see the impact of that figure.</P>
    <P>On the question of the taxation measures proposed in this Bill, I would submit very strongly that any country whose citizens can afford to spend £2 million a day on booze can afford to have a decent income taxation system.  We can even afford to eliminate poverty.  We are now entering the summer season and I suppose many a Deputy will appear at Ballybrit for the Galway races.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we spend £300 million a year on charter holidays.  Any country which can afford to spend about £5 million at the Galway races can afford to house all its travelling people, some of whom will be there, and relieve this major social problem.  People who own a piece of agricultural land worth about £2,500 can lodge an objection with a local authority and by virtue of a decision of that authority the land can attain a value of £35,000.  A country which can afford such things can afford to introduce major <Col N="1203" /> reforms in the taxation system.  Any country which can afford to give mortgages at three per cent or five per cent to many people simply because they work in certain undertakings can afford to build by way of taxation recoupment sufficient geriatric homes for the elderly homeless.  Such homes are urgently needed.  I am glad to see that the Minister has made a positive effort in the Finance Bill to cope with this situation.  Any country whose citizens can afford to spend £300 million on charter holidays can afford to care for the deprived children in the community.</P>
      <P>As somebody who would claim to be a socialist, not in the militaristic tradition but the social democratic tradition, I feel strongly that any country whose citizens can afford to speculate £140 million on oil exploration can afford to pay taxation so that the construction industry and other sectors can be helped.  A Government who fail to deal with these situations which are manifestly evident do not deserve to be in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a staunch defender of the principle of pay-related social insurance and of the general principle that people must pay for social services, health and education services by means of taxation, I have the greatest difficulty in facing many working people when they point out these manifestations of inequity, of tax avoidance and so on.  One has a real difficulty in talking about taxation because there is a danger that so severe is the reaction by PAYE and PRSI payers that the baby will be thrown out with the bath water and we will finish up with an emasculated taxation system incapable of providing sufficient money to run the country.  Our taxation system is inequitable and provides genuine grounds for dissatisfaction among those who claim that they are being excessively taxed.  I strongly hold that view, yet I will not give ground to the mere wiping out of, say, £200 million in PRSI contributions, or a reduction in income tax of £300 million or so.  That is not a solution.  PAYE taxpayers have a genuine point when they claim that they are required to carry an undue burden of income tax <i>vis-à-vis</i> other sections.  By <Col N="1204" />&ldquo;other sections&rdquo; I mean some of the people I have just mentioned and also the self-employed and the farming community.</P>
    <P>We need a system of taxation which will be broader than a system based simply on 20p in the £ for excise duty, 27p in the £ income tax and 20p in the £ for VAT.  We cannot run a country and provide social services on that tripod alone, on an income tax system which relates only to a relatively small number of people, a VAT system which applies generally but which is limited in scope, and an excise duty system whereby we must become a nation of alcoholics to meet taxation demands.  We know there is a severe limit on the amount which can accrue from excise duty.</P>
    <P>The present system is manifestly inequitable and we must find a means of achieving a contribution from all sectors in proportion to their ability to pay.  We must demonstrate that our taxation arrangements are scrupulously fair and are seen to be so.  The inequality in our taxation system in recent years has become a source of increasing friction between different sections of the community. It is up to us to remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>We must also examine &mdash; I had hoped that the Commission on Income Taxation would have had the report on this issue available &mdash; the central issue of which group in society gains most from the impact on taxation.  There is very little real information on income distribution here.  It is extremely difficult, even after analysing half a dozen Finance Bills, to try to assess with any degree of precision where precisely the net balance of advantage lies for particular groups in the community. The perceptions of people as to where they lie very often are wholly different. If one talks to any person on a door step while canvassing at election time one gets that response quickly.  It is arguable in some respects that there has been no great transfer from the relatively better off to the poorer sections of the community.  I am talking about those on a low income and other poorer sections.</P>
    <P>I was impressed recently reading a comment by Deputy Dukes as reported <Col N="1205" /> in <i>The Irish Times.</i> The Deputy courageously said that the average middle-class family considers that it does not get an annual return for the tax paid but, he pointed out, it was getting £5,000 worth of State services and benefits annually. Courageously enough he went on to say that the average family with two children in secondary school and one at primary school, a telephone, a car and a house mortgage conservatively was getting £5,000 worth of services on the State without getting into the social welfare area.  He estimated as follows: £700 of subsidised schooling for each child at secondary school; £400 for a child at primary school, plus drugs refund from health boards, subsidised telephone and rental charges, mortgage tax relief on the house and tax relief on the loan on the car.  Try telling that on the doorsteps of middle-class Dublin and one will get a quick reaction.  Yet, the question arises, is he telling the truth?  A very detailed analysis as to who precisely benefits from taxation relief measures in the community is essential.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with some of the other fundamental issues which arise. There is a serious issue in that in the 1981 General Election we had a major programme of taxation reform put forward by the Fine Gael Party.  The Labour Party in that general election campaign told the electorate that there was not anything available for nothing for anybody in the community.  We did not promise anything in that campaign.  We did not promise any major or massive reliefs on income taxation to the PAYE sector.  We did say that there should be substantial increases in capital taxation, and we were right. Fine Gael put forward a major tax programme which was the subject of great internal debate in the Government between mid-1981 and February 1982.  It must be put on record that that programme was untenable, was wholly, absolutely and beyond any assessment untenable.  That programme contains many proposals and with it Fine Gael in 1981 got a great many votes.  People thought they were going to get a substantial reduction in income tax in general. During the succeeding seven or eight <Col N="1206" /> months in Government I made it clear that it was far from that.  I had to do so. The cost of that taxation programme for a full year was £465 million.</P>
    <P>There was also in that programme, as Deputy Manning will recall, a firm commitment on our part to raise social welfare by 25 per cent.  That added £125 million for social welfare to the £465 million, making a total of £590 million.  That is what the people voted for in 1981. Admittedly, we said that there would be increases on pay-related social insurance. We indicated that it would add on about £175 million, leaving a balance of £415 million to be met for the introduction of the programme of tax reform.  That was to be met by way of indirect taxation.  A lot of the country voted for that in 1981. In fairness to Deputy FitzGerald, and in particular in fairness to Deputy John Bruton, it was only when they took up office that they realised the magnitude of what they were proposing.  They thought, and were advised by their then advisers prior to the general election, that the total cost would be about £200 million.  They genuinely thought that could be managed, but it worked out at twice that figure.</P>
    <P>I can recall saying in early 1982 that that taxation programme due to be introduced in the last budget, a measure on which we fell in February, was untenable and inoperable.  That is the reality, but there was the other reality right through that period: that it was counterbalanced by the pugnacious determination of Deputy Haughey, then leader of the Opposition, and the all-embracing confidence of his economic adviser, Deputy O'Donoghue, coming up to the general election.  There were equally profligate promises by the Fianna Fáil side.  On balance the electorate in 1982 was more inclined to believe the Government than the prospective Government.  In spite of the most difficult budget ever introduced in the history of the State the people said: it is terrible, it is harsh, it is vicious, but at least it is honest and we will go for it. Fine Gael pulled back from the over-expectations of their tax package twice. They had to climb down or otherwise the whole thing would have been in a shambles. <Col N="1207" /> Our people accepted that also.</P>
    <P>It is important that we note that no one side in terms of electoral promises and what they would do in government is entirely without a good deal of blame. The Labour Party, shining angels as we always are with little electoral prospects, made no promises in the 1981 General Election.  We said there was no way we could possibly indulge in this.  I wish to say the same today and it is not an exercise to ambush the Minister with amendments to the Finance Bill in a fortnight which could bring down this Government. Deputy Gregory is sounding distinctly, twitteringly nervous in the back benches at this stage and he holds the key because, presumably, the Workers' Party representatives will now enter into principled Workers' Party opposition, comforting as that may be, for a short period before the next general election.  In any event if this Finance Bill gets through, the one next year is going to be scuppered anyway as some people will discover that they want to renew their political souls with their electorate, and that is another appalling prospect facing the country along with the appalling paralysis that we have.</P>
    <P>We come to what people want in terms of taxation.  There is a universal demand to reduce the level of PAYE.  Out of about £1,300 million in PAYE tax, people want about £300 million knocked off.  They do not want the current tax bands.  On top of that the electorate are demanding the abolition of the workers' contribution to PRSI, which is another £200 million.  That is £500 million that people want by way of relief.  People resent going into the 45p in the pound band so early on and they resent paying 55 per cent and 60 per cent.  I am being badgered every day of the week by people saying that it is not worth while going out to work when one is stuck for 60 per cent tax at a relatively low income rate.  They also want a massive reduction in PRSI.  PRSI is worth £800 million to the Exchequer.  Employers pay £400 million; the State puts in £200 million and the employee puts in another £200 million. Whatever about the employer contribution <Col N="1208" /> and the State contribution, many trade unions want the workers' contribution of £200 million removed. The three fundamental demands at the moment, £300 million off PAYE and £200 million for PRSI total £500 million. In addition, every manufacturer and importer in the country wants the £140 million of accelerated back payment also removed for 1982.  There is tremendous reaction against it.  Many manufacturers and importers say they cannot afford to pay it, that they will not have the money in October to pay it.  I am referring to the deliberate bringing forward of 1983 moneys into 1982.</P>
    <P>Therefore we are faced with demands which total approximately £640 million of taxation relief.  Where is that money to come from?  Not more than about £90 million could, with a very tough regime, come from capital taxation.  For what is being accrued at the moment, about £14 million, one might as well abolish capital taxation altogether because it is not worth collecting.  I have sympathy for the number of civil service staff engaged in trying to collect it because they are not getting any money.  For example, total tax revenue for 1982 is estimated at £4,387 million.  In terms of a contribution towards that money, the few minor remnants of estate duty, which was abolished, consists of 0.02 per cent.</P>
    <P>Capital acquisitions tax became law in March 1976 and the income from that this year is estimated as a percentage of total revenue at 0.23 per cent.  A capital acquisitions tax bringing in revenue of that kind is only a joke and should be abolished; it would be a joke in a handbook of taxation measures.  Capital gains tax, as a percentage of total revenue for 1982, is estimated at 0.18 per cent.  In addition there are some remnants of the wealth tax, which was abolished, and it is estimated that the income from that as a percentage of total tax revenue in 1982 will be 0.007 per cent.  For all practical purposes capital taxation does not exist here and it is a sham to suggest that it does.  If there were major changes in capital taxation we could bring in not more than about 2 per cent of revenue, about £90 million at the most.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" /> However, we are still faced with a total demand of £640 million in tax reforms.  If we knock off £100 million which could be got from capital taxation we are left with a shortfall of about £540 million.  Where is that going to come from?  If we abolish the £200 million, the employees' contribution to PRSI, where do we get that money?  We could put 20p on the gallon of petrol which would bring in £70 million; we could put 10p a pint of beer which would bring in £50 million and we could increase the rate of VAT by 5 per cent which would bring in another £30 million or by ten per cent which would bring in £60 million.  That is the reality. We could do that or we could increase our current budget deficit from £670 million, which was proposed in this year's budget but which worked out at about £900 million, and then we could go the International Monetary Fund, inform them of what we have done and they will give us a forced devaluation.  That is all that will happen in terms of this country's future.  The alternatives are 20p on a gallon of petrol, 10p on a pint of beer, increase the VAT rate, and we could comfortably abolish PRSI.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the abolition of PRSI. I believe in the fundamental principle of an income-related, pay-related social insurance system. I have fought for that in the Dáil since my election in 1969.  I very strenuously opposed the flat rate insurance system which was manifestly inequitable &mdash; a flat rate across-the-board, no relativity to income and the only differentiation was between men, women and juveniles.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in glib solutions.  I do not agree with what has been said by many others.  An official from my union, John Carroll, is on record as saying:</P>
    <P>Workers' PRSI contributions should, however, be abolished and the amount of revenue foregone should be levied under a reform tax system on all those with the wherewithal to contribute.</P>
    <P>The issue here is the wherewithal.</P>

        <i>Liberty</i> Magazine, May 1982: PRSI System Must Be Reformed.  The total income for the PRSI fund for 1982 is about £870 million, employers' contribution £448 million, employees' contribution £162 million and the Exchequer contributes about £220 million.  Are those who want PRSI abolished suggesting that employers should be relieved of that £448 million contribution? If not, what do we do?  We put a further 30p on a gallon of petrol, or 30p on a pint of Guinness or a further 10 per cent on VAT.</P>
      <P>These are reforms I would commend to the Minister but they need not come under the ambit of the Finance Bill.  I believe the £9,500 PRSI income limit should be abolished.  Some relief for those on the very low income bands could then be generated.  That means people earning more than £9,500 would have to pay more and those on low incomes would be paying relatively less.  That would be a measure of general reform.</P>
      <P>I also believe the self-employed must be brought into the PRSI net, and broadening the taxation net is absolutely essential. There are 150,000 farmers who must be brought into the income tax and the PRSI nets.  Unless they are there will be continuous massive community reaction, one group against the other.  I have suggested three basic reforms of the PRSI system.  They do not mean the abolition of the system but the extension and the development of the system in a rational way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maximum rate for a contributory old age pension is £70.30 per week for a person over 80 years of age with an adult dependant over 66 years.  If we want to pay contributory old age pensions, that can only be done on a pay-related social insurance basis.  There is no other way to do it unless we find oil or decide to sell our natural gas at a peanut price to a foreign <i>entrepreneur.</i> The maximum weekly rate of a widows' contributor pension and a deserted wife's benefit allowance is £39.45 a week, with substantial additional payments for dependent children. <Col N="1211" /> It is important to point out that unemployment and disability benefit for a married man and his spouse is £52.15 a week, plus payments for child dependants. In addition he can qualify for pay-related supplements.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that £70.30, a contributory old age pension for somebody who worked all his life and who payed his social insurance, is a handsome amount; it is just enough for a couple to live on. I am not suggesting that a widow's contributory pension of almost £40 per week is a magnificant income.  It is not; it is on the poverty line.  Equally, a unemployed person and his wife getting £52 of £53 a week are on the poverty line.  Many Deputies should try to live on that kind of money for a few weeks and see how they would manage.  Then they would know what being on the poverty line is.</P>
    <P>There are 3,800 people signing on at the Dún Laoghaire employment exchange, an extra 1,500 over the figure for last year.  Many of them are middle income families out of work, 50-year-old sales representatives, no longer getting company cars, and living on £60 or £70 a week, between basic social welfare and pay-related payments.  We have to be very careful what we are talking about. That is why I believe pay-related social insurance is the only way to provide fundamental social insurance benefits for those in need.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of misconception and superficial propaganda surrounding this question.  I do not object to paying my pay-related contribution.  I am a voluntary contributor paying the full 6.7 per cent rate, and I have been paying full social insurance since February 1957 when I first got a social insurance card.  I do this because I want to, and must do it to protect my family.  I do not object paying, as some people do, health contributions and youth employment levies. Under the Finance Bill we have a very simple choice: either borrow the money from foreign banks &mdash; Japanese, German or American &mdash; and repay them the money so that they can create jobs in their own countries, or pay for this service ourselves.  There is no other <Col N="1212" /> choice.  The issue is how to broaden the burden so that everybody is paying his fair share.</P>
    <P>I come now to the other alternative, and it is a stark alternative.  If we want to take £300 million off income tax, as is the popular demand, we must either raise indirect taxation or make a cut-back in public expenditure.  It is tragic that some are exploiting the PRSI situation.  This puts at risk a fundamental and, in my view, socialist concept of social insurance which is shared by many Deputies, not necessarily of the Labour Party.  We must face up to the fact that this £300 million can be raised another way.  We can easily abolish pay-related social insurance and integrate the £200 million into the income tax system, but income tax will be raised by another 14 per cent, roughly speaking. The choices are either more indirect taxation, increased income tax from absorption of the PRSI amount &mdash; because PRSI is basically a form of income taxation but it is socially insured related, which is the important principle behind it &mdash; or a cut-back on public expenditure.  There are some horrific alternatives.  How does one provide the £450 million to £500 million demanded by way of relief?  Does one cut school transport, which at the moment costs £24 million.  For the sake of argument, let us abolish it &mdash; imagine the reaction.  Let us abolish food subsidies and save £140 million &mdash; imagine the reaction.  Let us reintroduce rates.  Currently, rates relief amounts to £120 million. To halve that would save £60 million.</P>
    <P>For the sake of argument &mdash; and this is purely by way of analysis &mdash; let us decide to charge, once again, for primary school education, £40 to £50 per annum per pupil, which would give us another £10 to £12 million.  Let CIE cut both rail and road services and increase fares.  That would give us another £20 million.  Let us abolish, for example, civil defence and save £1 million.  Then let us go the whole hog, on a hypothetical basis, of abolishing all pay-related social insurance and save another £50 million.  Having gone through that excruciating exercise, one can discontinue medical cards for about a third of the present users and save £15 <Col N="1213" /> million.  Finally, as a good socialist should never leave out the farmets, let us decide that all farmers will, in future, pay for disease eradication.  It is arguable that they should, in any event.  We would thus save another £20 million.</P>
    <P>Having indulged in that massive exercise cutback in public expenditure, we only gain £200 million, which still falls massively short of the £450 million demanded by way of tax relief.  We could even say to the post office workers and the Garda: &ldquo;No more overtime.&rdquo;  Admittedly, we would save about £40 million, but that is only 10 per cent of what is now demanded by way of tax relief and of what political parties are haggling over across the floor of this House in terms of trying to con the electorate into giving them support for something which cannot possibly be delivered.  The only way of delivering the taxation proposals in the 1981 manifesto on the Fine Gael side and the Fianna Fáil proposals coming up to the 1982 budget was to indulge in a cut-back on public expenditure or to borrow massively abroad and force the country into a crisis of credit worthiness.  That is the situation.  Even doing all that, there is a current budget deficit of the best part of £900 million.</P>
    <P>We come to a number of areas where reforms can, perhaps, be introduced.  I do not wish to sound negative or in any way destructive of some of the arguments advanced.  I have put forward one definite proposal, namely, that there should be a substantial increase in capital taxation. However, there should be limits, because there are limits to the amount of money which can be collected by this means.  There should be some examination of VAT increases.  These should be titled in favour of those goods which are bought predominantly by higher income groups.  The yield would not be very much but some of the VAT rates should be directed towards goods with a high import content.  There is still scope for re-examination of the categories of goods now included in the different VAT bands, to see if some goods of the luxury or high import content type could be shifted to higher bands.  That could be examined, with some benefit to the <Col N="1214" /> Exchequer, although the benefit would not be massive in terms of yield.  We have already seen a degree of selectivity introduced with regard to video recorders and so on.  The Minister might examine this point.</P>
    <P>Tax relief on non-mortgage interest should be discontinued.  A good deal of the interest relief still goes on items such as cars, which have a high import content. There is no case to be made for subsidising what is, effectively, a negative rate of interest on no specified range of items. On tax relief on mortgage interest for house purchase, I have always held the view that this should be phased out over a period.  Certainly, tax relief on mortgage interest for second-time purchase for people trading up in the market should have been discontinued.</P>
    <P>There are many ways in which reforms could be brought in.  There is no doubt that a number of people who bought houses over the last ten to 20 years, but particularly over the past eight or nine years, would not be caused major hardship by such a change of taxation.  We all know that investment in house property, whether owner-occupied or not, gives a very high rate of tax-free return on the equity investment.  We must bear in mind also that a great deal of new house building, particularly in the Dublin area, in the past decade has consisted of semi-luxury type housing predominantly availing of tax relief.</P>
    <P>An Foras Forbartha surveys have shown that about 80 per cent of all new houses in the greater Dublin area would, broadly speaking, fall into that category of the four- or five-bedroomed detached dwelling.  A taxation system which caters for &ldquo;trading up&rdquo; and absorbing scarce resources of land, skilled labour and finance should not be continued.  These moneys on the tax side should be given to the first-hand buyer, the young people who are screaming to get a decent house and cannot possibly afford it, people who are crucified trying to get £5,000 or £6,000 for a deposit.  They should come first, and we should not give tax relief for mortgages to people who &ldquo;trade up&rdquo; on the market.  Many might not agree with my <Col N="1215" /> view, but I think it is a basic way of changing the whole system.</P>
    <P>Here I come to a major issue, farm taxation.  We should get another £30 million or £40 million per year from the farming community.  No Government, with perhaps the exception of one Minister, Deputy Richie Ryan, was prepared to take on the strength of the farming lobby in relation to income taxation. Many people who live in urban areas and pay PRSI know that there is a substantial block of farmers in rural Ireland who, even in times of relatively low income, can still afford to pay a substantial amount of general income taxation.  I estimate that about £40 million to £50 million a year should come from the farming community into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>State expenditure on agriculture is very high.  In 1980, for example, the State contributed directly about £227 million. Last year State expenditure was £310 million. A great deal of money is transferred both from the National Exchequer and from EEC aid under the common agricultural policy.  The total transfers to Irish agriculture per annum from the Exchequer and EEC aid is now running at a rate of about £600 million a year.  In 1981 it was £623 million.  Very many farmers are on low incomes but I personally hold this view very strongly, I think the political party that makes this a big issue is probably a party which, particularly in urban areas, will get a lot of support.  The Labour Party have always tried to adopt a national view.  We do not purport to represent just wage and salary earners in an urban setting but workers, whether on the farm or off it, in a broad, national way.  It is true that the estimated receipt of income tax in respect of farm profits for 1982 is about £17 million.  That figure has to be contrasted, not in a very accurate way because there are derivatory differences, with the fact that about £1,376 million is collected on PAYE, admittedly from a much larger group of people.  That £17 million should and must be in terms of social equity increased to about £60 million per year.  The Fine Gael Party and our party may not advocate it but somebody must advocate it because <Col N="1216" /> I cannot talk in equity and fairness to wage and salary earners about PRSI or PAYE or about direct and indirect taxation unless I am prepared to say that all sections of the community must contribute. I am adamant on that point.</P>
    <P>Lest the House be under any illusion, I would also point out that there are other areas of development &mdash; for example, net rates payable in respect of holdings of agricultural land.  There has been a massive decline in such rates.  In 1979 it was £36 million; in 1981 it was £31 million; in 1982 it is down to £18.3 million.  There is the old argument that because farmers have to pay rates they should not have to pay income tax.  That does not stand up because successive Governments have virtually abolished payment of tax on farm profits and have also successively reduced rates payable by farmers on their land.  There is an urgent need therefore to change the system.</P>
    <P>I also advocate very strongly that all payments in relation to income taxation should be on a straightforward account system.  Notional elements and all the various devices should be abolished and it should be based on an accounts system as required by law in relation to income tax or corporation profits tax.  I shall not delay the House much further but I would be more specific perhaps about some of the reactions I have to this Finance Bill. I assure the Minister that my reactions are neither designed in terms of ambush in the future or in terms of amendments which would be purely hypocritical.  Any amendments the Labour Party would put down to this Bill will be on the basis that for each amendment demanding relief we shall put down an amendment imposing taxation.  That is a fairly tall order in terms of Finance Bill amendments.  It would be very easy to put down a half dozen amendments to trap the Independents into going into the lobby on a &ldquo;Vote No&rdquo; basis and not have a concomitant basis.  The situation is far too serious for that now in terms of political gain but I submit that in regard to mortgage interest &mdash; this might make the point generally to the Minister &mdash; I believe that where a mortgage is taken out after 6 April 1982 the allowance of interest paid should only <Col N="1217" /> relate to a loan for the purchase of the taxpayer's only or main residence.  The fairness of that is self-evident.</P>
    <P>Again, I think I should advocate that relief should only be allowed at not higher than the 35 per cent rate.  I still hold that view which I held in the last budget.  I would put the ceiling again at £35,000.  Anybody who can afford to pay £70,000 or £80,000 for a house and wants to get tax relief on it can hump off as far as I am concerned.  That is fairly ruthless but I would be tough about it.  If we claim to be interested in social justice there is no justification for mortgage interest relief for second houses or for mortgage interest relief for somebody who wants to buy a holiday home in the west or the south of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the existing system of financing local authorities maintains broad equity between different local authorities.  The higher revenue buoyancy in areas of rapid development helps to finance the higher demand on local authority services in those areas.</P>
      <P>The limitation on rate increases is necessary for two reasons.  First it protects the remaining groups who continue to pay rates &mdash; for example, shopkeepers, occupiers of factory and other commercial premises and so on &mdash; from the danger of excessive rate increases and, secondly, it prevents an open-ended call on the Exchequer for finance.  I am satisfied that the present system strikes a reasonable balance between the desire of local authorities to press ahead with their services on the one hand and, on the other, the need to manage the nation's finances prudently.</P>
      <P>On the wider question of the finances of local authorities, I was concerned when I took office at the extent to which local authority services had been underfinanced. The recent budget provided for additional funds amounting to almost £73 million for local authority services and this will help to offset financial difficulties that might otherwise have arisen in the current year.</P>
      <P>I am at present considering any legislation or other changes which may be appropriate in relation to other aspects of local authority finance.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I do not accept the Deputy's view.  I have eight years' experience of local government activities and if the Deputy wishes me to deal with a particular council, rather than the overall situation, I will do so.  The questions before the House deal with uniform rating and the need for rate limits. I was asked earlier if the rate limit would be scrapped.  I should like to tell Deputy Mitchell that the Minister will review this matter if more funds are necessary.  I said that last week.  The £73 million that is being provided &mdash; it was referred to in the budget speech of the Minister for Finance &mdash; will go a long way towards relieving any pressure that is on local authorities at present.  That is the factual situation as it prevails.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I should like to protest once again at the reaction of the Minister of State to these questions by taking four of them together.  They deal with two separate topics.  At the risk of not being as political as some Members might like to be I should like to concentrate on the points I raised in Question No. 2.  I should like to ask the Minister if he accepts that in counties where the rate in 1977 was low the subsequent increases granted to local authorities have been of less benefit to such areas than they have been to areas that had a relatively high rate in the pound in 1977?  Does the Minister not accept that that is inherently guaranteeing discrimination in the system of local authority financing as exists at present? Does the Minister not accept that throughout the country there is uneven development in terms of the provision of factories, housing schemes and so on, and where there is more development in one area than in another the area with the high rate of development must therefore benefit from increased buoyancy in rates?  For example, is the Minister aware that in North Tipperary County Council buoyancy last year would have amounted to something less than 1 per cent while in <Col N="1224" /> Dublin city it would have amounted to something in excess of 6 per cent?  The system of financing local authorities through the rating system as exists at present is inherently discriminatory and is ensuring that areas that are badly off will get worse.  Will the Minister consider reviewing the system to give some hope to agricultural counties that do not have the benefit of the type of development such as Dublin city or other cities might have?</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> The Deputy covered a number of points in his questions.  In 1977 the rate increase in Tipperary North Riding was 5.3 per cent while in Dublin County Council it was 5.5 per cent.  The Deputy made that comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East)</i>: I will develop that for the Deputy.  The Deputy mentioned rapid development.  It is implied in the questions that areas of rapid development do better under the uniform rate limits because of higher revenue buoyancy but that is not necessarily so.  In areas of rapid development there is also a greater demand for the services provided by local authorities.  For example, new houses have to be serviced with water, sewerage, roads, refuse collection, libraries, parks and so on.  Factories and offices also create demands on services such as pollution control, heavier road usage, parking, traffic problems and so on.  The higher revenue buoyancy in these areas helps to finance the higher demand for services.  Nationally, the average valuation buoyancy is 3 per cent but this varies in individual cases from under 1 per cent to 10 or 11 per cent.  I should like to tell the Deputy that in the last six weeks I have had an opportunity of meeting representatives from many local authorities and I learned that that is the case.  A local authority must be taken with its individual merit.  If the Deputy wishes to deal with Tipperary North Riding I can do so but the question as it is phrased is a general one.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that he has, perhaps mistakenly, misled the House by suggesting that current revenue derived from rates buoyancy is used to pay for capital expenditure such as libraries and roads?  It is not true to say that the Minister was not giving a correct answer to the question posed by Deputy Molony and that the premise upon which the Fianna Fáil abolition of local autonomy in 1977 was based has come home to roost?  I shall give the Minister one specific instance and I should like to know if that instance is typical of most local authorities.  Does he agree that the Minister for the Environment met a deputation from County Leitrim recently who posed a problem in terms of a shortfall of cash for their local authority and that as a consequence additional funds in excess of what the rates would have provided were made available to that local authority?</P>

The Minister has told the House that that money is used for the development of new housing estates, the provision of water and sewerage, all capital works, and roadways, which we all assumed was the responsibility of the developer to provide.  I put it to the Minister that the reality is that a number of counties with lower valuations, very little increase in population and very little development&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The sources are: limitation of statutory demands on local authorities in respect of supplementary welfare allowances, saving to local authorities £2.9 million; reversal of the previous Government's decision on the proceeds of house sales, an extra £7 million for local authorities' <Col N="1228" /> current account; a special allocation of £20 million to Dublin Corporation to supplement their non-capital resources; an extra £15.5 million for local authority housing, including £14 million for Dublin Corporation; an additional £10 million for road improvements; an extra £7.4 million for sanitary services excluding £0.4 million which does not go to local authorities; £2.5 million to enable Dublin Corporation to increase their workforce on the environment improvement scheme from 150 to 500; £1.5 million for revolving fund to enable local authorities to acquire, rehabilitate and sell currently rundown residential properties; £1 million to enable Dublin Corporation to install appropriate facilities in substandard dwellings with bathroom facilities; £200,000 to enable the corporation to purchase Shandon Park for general amenity purposes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that, having reversed the decision made by the Coalition &mdash; the decision being that the local authorities would have to surrender 100 per cent of the revenue they derived from the sale of local authority houses to the Exchequer &mdash; and having allowed the local authorities to retain their 40 per cent, it is now necessary for him to go further and to remove from local authorities the responsibility of raising revenue for the upkeep of courthouses, for health services and for agriculture over which the local <Col N="1229" /> authority have absolutely no control? Thirdly, would he also consider that now is the time for him to increase the subsidy to meet the massive loan charges which local authorities have to pay which in some instances are so high that they will exceed the amount provided for the carrying out of services?</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I do not share those views.  The point about courthouses was raised at a recent deputation and I gave an assurance that that matter would be looked into.  Regarding the other two parts of the question, the Deputy is aware that the Government give maximum consideration to any local authority who get in touch about a problem. In that way the Department of the Environment work on a day-to-day basis. In answer to the question, I am satisfied that the moneys that have been provided in the budget go a long way towards meeting the demands of local authorities, but I make no apology for saying that we find ourselves in difficult times and we must take a pragmatic look at moneys which are available and make the best of resources given to various local authorities. I am in disagreement with persons who hold the view that the present system is inadequate.  In my experience I have found it operating very satisfactorily.</P>

He gave us to believe that the local authorities would be reimbursed by central Government for the losses incurred as a result.  Up to today not one penny has been paid to local authorities in lieu of those moneys which were not paid.

      <P>Arising out of the Minister of State's reply to my first supplementary question about ten minutes ago, I understood him to say that the difference in buoyancy from local authority to local authority varied from under 1 per cent for local authorities in some areas to in excess of 10 per cent in other areas.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that a variation of the order of 1,000 per cent is not discriminatory as between those local authorities?  Secondly, does the Minister of State accept that in some local authority areas, for example, sanitary services such as sewerage disposal schemes or water supply schemes were provided prior to 1977 and as a result those local authorities had a higher rate in the £ than local authorities who carried out such work after 1977 and that within this whole system therefore this discrimination exists?  In view of that, would the Minister of State agree to examine the system of financing new houses, because some local authorities are, without question, being seriously militated against?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> A traffic corps exists within the Garda Sióchána since 1973 with special responsibility for enforcing road traffic law.  I am aware that the Garda play an active role in the promotion of road safety.  To the extent that the Deputy may envisage a civilian type of corps, there is already provision for a traffic warden service.  I would not favour any change in the legal position whereby the powers of traffic wardens are confined to clearcut parking offences.  I share the view which has emerged from previous consideration of this issue that enforcement of general traffic law should be directly linked with general police powers.  I have no proposals therefore to effect a change in the existing enforcement procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the crime rate has increased steadily in the country generally and particularly in urban areas, would it not make sense to empower people other than trained gardaí to deal with traffic offences, to have a traffic corps as they have throughout most of the world?  This would release highly trained gardaí to deal with burglaries and serious crime.  Will not the Minister agree that it makes sense to develop a modern traffic corps to deal with minor parking offences, with speeding and so on?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I can only deal with the Deputy's question in so far as it deals with the setting up of a wholly civilian traffic corps independent of any police force.  Any proposal for a separate police force to specialise in dealing with traffic or for the reorganisation of the existing traffic corps within the Garda Síochána would be a matter for the Minister for Justice himself to assess.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not accept that throughout Europe traffic corps police are trained and identified as such and are able to deal with motorists in a courteous and firm manner?  This is not happening here.  It seems a logical step to take.  The Minister's predecessor in office was to give the matter some consideration but I do not know if he pursued the matter.  In view of the number of serious injuries and deaths that occur on our roads every day, it is imperative that a radical change be made to provide a traffic corps in order to prevent an immense waste of human lives.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment whether, in view of the ease with which cars are being stolen and the number of such thefts, he proposes to make representations to car manufacturers concerning the need for improved locking devices and security or to introduce regulations in regard to standards of design in cars.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> Regulations under the Road Traffic Acts require that vehicles be fitted with door, ignition or immobility locks or devices.

      <Col N="1240" /> Will the Minister try to see if something can be done?  Certain cars can be opened without any trouble, as the Minister is well aware, while other cars present more difficulty.  Why cannot all cars be standardised as far as this matter is concerned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> It would be inappropriate for the Minister to get in touch with car manufacturers and to suggest how they should provide locking devices for their vehicles.  I feel that the message will get home to the manufacturers that they themselves should provide better locking and safety devices for their cars.  If the particular models the Deputy has in mind are being stolen on a regular basis, I think that will become apparent.  It cannot be regarded as good sales technique to sell cars with such inadequate locking and safety devices.</P>

      <P>Why is it that so many cars are easily opened and stolen?  I cannot see anything wrong in the Minister getting in touch with the car manufacturers in regard to this matter.  Is the Minister not aware that it is costing the State millions of pounds and that the police have to spend many hours trying to trace stolen cars.  I cannot understand why the Minister cannot make some suggestions on the matter to the car manufacturers. Perhaps they have a vested interest in having the cars stolen and destroyed.</P>

    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>1.  The figures for each county include expenditure on both rural and urban roads, e.g. the figures for County Cork include expenditure in Cork County Borough and in the Urban Districts of Clonakilty, Cobh, Fermoy, Kinsale, Macroom, Mallow, Midleton, Skibbereen and Youghal, just as the figures for County Dublin include expenditure in Dublin County Borough and Dún Laoghaire Borough and the figures for Tipperary South Riding include expenditure in Clonmel Borough and the Urban Districts of Carrick-on-Suir, Cashel and Tipperary.</P>
    <P>2.  The figures for 1970-1973 inclusive relate to the financial year ended 31 March; the figures for 1974 relate to the 9-month period 1 April 1974-31 December 1974; the figures for 1975-1981 relate to the financial year ended 31 December.</P>
    <P>3.  The figures do not include expenditure on public lighting, traffic control, road safety, loan charges or overhead costs.</P>
    <P>4.  As the figures relate to <i>public</i> roads (roads for which legal responsibility for their maintenance and improvement is vested in road authorities) they do not include expenditure on any works on non-public roads which the road authorities in question may have executed as agent for any public organisation or for any private organisation or individual e.g. any works on non-public roads serving airports, seaports, electricity-generating stations, aviation-control stations, radio-cum-television transmitters, industrial estates, housing estates, mines, bogs, forests, fisheries, farmsteads and places of historic, scenic or recreational attraction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware that Waterford Corporation's block grant for 1982 has remained unchanged at £104,000; if he is further aware that this will lead to a reduction in the number of road workers employed and also in the number of workers who have responsibility for the upkeep of open spaces; if he will increase this block grant to take into account inflation and the expanding needs of the city; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I am aware that the 1982 block grant notified to Waterford Corporation on 25 February 1982 is in the same amount as that for 1981.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of the additional capital made available in the budget I have been enabled to supplement the grants previously allocated to Waterford Corporation for this year by further grants totalling £400,000.  This additional capital is for road improvement works.</P>
      <P>When account is taken of the supplementary grants mentioned, the total amount available to Waterford Corporation this year for road works represents an increase of 84 per cent over the comparable grants for 1981 and an increase of 158 per cent over the grants for 1980. I am satisfied that the corporation is receiving its fair share of the overall funds available to me for road grants in the current year.</P>
      <P>The employment of workmen is a matter for the corporation, which has the responsibility to programme its various operations throughout the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I see that the block <Col N="1257" /> grant remains the same.  Is the Minister aware that because of the decision not to increase that block grant for roads the number of outdoor staff, particularly those employed on roads, is being reduced and there is in effect a certain amount or redundancy attached to the decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. Brady (Dublin South-East) Mr. Brady (Dublin South-East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I hope that will not take place.  We had a deputation which Deputy Collins attended on 4 June and this matter was thoroughly debated.  Unfortunately the block grant will not be changed but I would hope that redundancies will not occur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> It would be a matter for the appropriate licensing authority &mdash; in this case Dublin Corporation &mdash; to consider in the first instance the provision of additional facilities such as a motor tax and driving licence sub-office in Dún Laoghaire, having regard to such issues as the necessary limitation of the range of services which could be provided by a sub-office, the central storage of records in relation to payment of excise duties and changes of ownership, the duplication of supervisory and accounting functions, and so on. There are many related problems involved in the Deputy's suggestion.  I should point out, of course, that under existing statutory provisions, Dún Laoghaire Corporation could not itself be a licensing authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that in the light of the congestion and chaos at the moment in River House where people have to go to fill out a form, particularly with the Bridewell and the Four Courts and the fruit markets nearby, he should favourably consider opening an office in Dún Laoghaire or some other part of south Dublin where people who would normally not <Col N="1258" /> have to go into town could relicence or tax their cars?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I sympathise with the points made by the Deputy and a strong case can be made for his proposal.  There is goodwill between Dublin Corporation and Dún Laoghaire Corporation and I cannot see why a meeting cannot be convened between the two authorities to see what can be done.  I would favour any more simplistic system of issuing such licences. I agree with what the Deputy says.  It is very difficult because of the parking situation. But I would recommend that the Deputy take the matter to Dublin Corporation and Dún Laoghaire Corporation to see if something can be done to alleviate the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the views expressed by Deputy Cosgrave.  Is the Minister aware that this is an old chestnut? It has been going on for quite a number of years and if it were not Deputy Cosgrave's turn to ask the question it would be my turn or Deputy Barry Desmond's turn or Deputy O'Donoghue's turn to ask the question.  This problem has gone on and on without any resolution. There is a need for a separate registration office in Dún Laoghaire.  The difficulties are not insuperable.  It is because of simple bureacratic lethargy that there has been no resolution of the problem.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment whether he will now up-grade the Thurles-Nenagh Road, County Tipperary, to national secondary status in view of (i) the fact that the low <Col N="1261" /> standard of grading of roads into Thurles from Limerick, Nenagh and other areas is seriously militating against development of the town; (ii) the appalling road accident record of the existing road; and (iii) the significance of the road as a link from Cork, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford to Nenagh and locations north of Nenagh such as Galway, Loughrea and Portumna.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> The considerations mentioned in the question have been put to my Department by Tipperary (North Riding) County Council and have been carefully examined.

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have already made a preliminary designation of the Thurles-Nenagh road as the R498 within the proposed regional road system and that, in recognition of the need to improve it, special state grants of £100,000 have been allocated to it, both in 1981 and in the present year.</P>

I am aware that the point was made to his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly.  Prior to that, the request was made two years ago.  Is the Minister aware that 90 road traffic accidents have occurred on that road, not including those which took place in the near vicinity of Thurles and Nenagh towns over the last five years, six of these accidents being fatal?  In view of the very high rate of unemployment in the Thurles area, the fact that this area being located on the edge of the mid-west region, has been left in a very bad position as regards attracting new industry, and in view of the accident rate on the roads, would the Minister review the decision taken?</P>

      <P>Since the company in question went into receivership on 9 March 1982, the IDA and the receiver have made intensive international efforts to secure a takeover of their assets as a going concern. However, no offer for the assets on this basis has been received.  I regret to say that earlier today the receiver, representing the banks and other interested parties, informed the union representatives and shop stewards that the plant <Col N="1263" /> would cease operation on Thursday, 10 June 1982.</P>
      <P>Every effort to secure a takeover of the plant as a going concern has been made. The IDA contacted over 100 companies in the textile sector, 12 of whom, as world leaders in this sector offered the greatest prospect of a take over.  Though most of these 12 companies visited the plant in question and carried out detailed analyses, such a takeover has not emerged.  The IDA are, however, at my request pursuing other approaches, including the possibility of having the plant purchased for the manufacture of products of a kind not previously manufactured at the plant, as well as towels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that this factory commenced production only in the last two years and, therefore, has not had a reasonable opportunity of performing profitably?  Further, as the company commenced trading during a recessionary period, it has had no opportunity of performing profitably.  Taking these factors into consideration and the fact that the IDA grant-aided this company to the extent of £12 million, should the Minister not make money available to keep this factory in operation until its viability has been proved one way or the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy says about the length of time during which the company has been in operation.  In that period, the company incurred losses in the region of £10 million. The Deputy is aware, from the many meetings at which he has been present, of all the discussions into every aspect of this company.  The problem is the fundamental one of viability.  There was a question, even as late as yesterday evening, of a possibility of viability.  I had that question investigated, as I promised the Deputy and those with him at the meeting last night.  The basic problem is that the cost structures were based on a capacity of 85 per cent, but the company has operated at approximately 60 per cent capacity.  The sales prices and cost systems were not adjusted to take <Col N="1264" /> account of the situation.  In other words, the sales taking place were costing a lot of money.  It has also been established by various market researchers into the entire viability of the market, that the kind of product manufactured by this company &mdash; undoubtedly a very high quality product &mdash; had not a sufficient market available to take the sales.  To request money for a company which, as presently constituted, is non-viable and can be clearly shown to be so, is not the proper approach to setting that company on a proper basis.  The decision to discontinue operations has been taken by the receiver who, as the Deputy is well aware, represents the banks and the major shareholders involved.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the State has a moral obligation to the 640 workers directly employed in this operation and possibly to as many others indirectly dependent upon it, one way or the other?  The State was instrumental in promoting this industry through its various agencies and in getting people to take up employment, enter into commitments regarding housing and so forth.  Would the Minister not agree that it would be wrong for the State now to run away from its responsibility and leave those 640 workers and their dependants high and dry?  This is a disaster for Kilkenny.  It is almost equivalent to an earthquake; it is a social earthquake.  The Minister must take immediate steps to protect the employment prospects.  The workers to whom the Minister listened yesterday were very determined to show him and everybody that they could make the firm viable and workable.  Would the Minister not provide the necessary assistance to ensure that the operation is kept going at least for a period of time sufficient to establish beyond doubt, one way or the other, the viability of the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, as the Deputy is well aware from the discussions which we had, I made it abundantly clear from the very first day on which I took over the position of Minister for Industry and Energy &mdash; which incidentally was the <Col N="1265" /> same day on which this company went into receivership &mdash; that every humanly possible effort would be made, because of the newness of the plant, to have it restructured.  I said then that as long as there was any possibility of a company coming forward to run the company on a sustained, viable basis, the Government would not be found lacking in producing assistance for it.  We have spent three months at that.  I have gone over the ground fully and the efforts that have been made.  It is the greatest major international marketing job ever done by the IDA, not only in one but in three continents. I accept that the Government have an obligation in regard to getting employment but it must be sustainable employment. The Deputy and everybody would, I am sure, agree that where the operation is clearly shown to be non-viable &mdash; as I have shown the House that this is &mdash; it would be wrong and leading the workers up the garden path to suggest at this point that it is viable when it is not viable.  I have already said that the cost structures are there based at 85 per cent, producing to 60 per cent, selling at a loss and that situation is no good for the workers or for Kilkenny.  It is only a very short-term policy, throwing good money after bad. I have already indicated that the IDA are now looking for alternative production lines that can be carried on with the towel operation in Kilkenny because it is clearly shown from the marketing situation that for the quantity that would have to be sold and the economy of scale at which it is produced in Kilkenny, the market is not there to receive it.  The Deputy, the House and the workers have my assurance that we shall not waste a minute in pursuing the other possibilities and getting this plant re-opened.  Within its present structure it is clearly non-viable.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any confirmation of the position of the two Irish partners in the Fieldcrest operation or of any further interest shown by either of them?

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The final position of the partners concerned was ascertained this morning following the discussion and the request from the meeting last night.  Their situation remains unchanged; they are not prepared to participate beyond today.  I relayed that to the workers as soon as I got the information.  As regards our approaches to the future of the plant, the IDA are now pursuing other possibilities of trying to bring in larger production lines to produce along with the towelling operation which has clearly been shown to be non-viable in the present situation.  It is a tragedy for the community in Kilkenny, but when the situation is non-viable we must try to achieve a viable situation.  That is precisely what the IDA and the Government will be doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the loss of 650 jobs in Kilkenny is a disaster for the area taking into consideration the fact that a large number of these people left good employment to take on jobs in the Fieldcrest industry and as a result have put themselves in a heavy debt situation with mortgages and other commitments?  In view of the statement that the Minister has repeated consistently in answering questions today, is he aware that the IDA made an investment of £12 million in this industry two years ago?  Is he fully satisfied that the IDA are now satisfied that this factory is not viable? If he is so satisfied does this not put the whole IDA operation into question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the people who took on financial commitments in the area and I suppose it is understandable that when they looked at the promoters of that project they thought they were going into secure employment.  I accept that.  I know from talking to workers during the many meetings we have had their serious financial problems.  I would not say it is a total disaster for the area, but it is a setback. If anybody thinks we will forget about Kilkenny from now on, that is not and has not been the situation and it will not be the situation for the future.  Some <Col N="1267" /> people may say when a factory closes: &ldquo;That is the end of the line&rdquo;.  I may refer to the case of Galway Crystal which closed eight months ago and everybody then thought those skills were being thrown on the dump.  It was not the end of the line and there was an announcement yesterday about a re-opening.  What I do say is that where a project is clearly not viable as in the present case nobody concerned should think of pouring good money after bad.  The IDA are satisfied that we are taking the proper course in the present situation.  Producing this top quality towel it was assumed and expected would make the same impact on the European market as similar brands did make on that market.  That did not occur and losses amounting to up to £10 million in the first couple of years were incurred.  I have given reasons why that has happened.  On that basis everybody must agree that the situation is non-viable.  We are setting out to make it viable and sustainable and to take every step necessary to get a selection of the right products that will make it viable and get the business back on its feet as soon as possible.  That is what the IDA and the Government are committed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>Hearing today that it is quite definite that the factory closes tomorrow, is the Minister aware that he is now leaving 640 people who have been in employment in Fieldcrest out of work to draw social welfare and redundancy money?  Does he agree with what Deputy Crotty said, that only two years ago the IDA backed this venture?  Yet the Minister today says it is not viable now.  Is the Minister satisfied that if the factory closes tomorrow it can be re-opened again?  I saw the same thing happen in Carlow with Erin Foods.  The actual plant was closed and is still lying idle.  I hope that, if the Minister and the Government are not prepared to put in the money to keep this plant going for another three or four months so as at least to give an opportunity for somebody to come in, he is fully aware of the consequences.  I believe that if the Minister allows this factory to close, it will never be opened again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of the Minister allowing the factory to close. The decision has been taken by the receiver representing the main partners, but I point out to the Deputy and the House that the situation he is talking about for the next two months has been going on for three months.  The Deputy is well aware that if there was a possibility of a company coming in to take this enterprise over and make it viable even as late as last night or today or even tomorrow, there would be no question of Government assistance not being forthcoming.</P>
      <P>That situation does not exist that the IDA must look for other companies to bring in other products in an effort to make it viable.  I am also aware of the IDA's investment in the company but I am sure the Deputy and the House are aware that a decision of this magnitude did not rest with the IDA.  It was taken by the Government of the day.  Everybody had full access to the decision-making process at that point.  The facts are there.  We must face them.  We must now go forward and look for a combination of factors to make that operation viable.  It has a first class building, a first class site and a first class workforce.  It is a question of getting the marketing right and the products right to go forward with sustained employment, not have a situation in which everybody knew it would not last and it did not last.  It is a question of the market being right, of the price being right and of our being able to go forward in a situation of sustainable employment and not in a situation in which everybody knows the operation will not last.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister take into consideration the fact that this industry is the first IDA-sponsored industry to be located in Kilkenny and would he have regard also to the fact that there is no doubt in the minds certainly of middle management and of top management, too, in the factory that this operation is viable?  It has been only in operation for two years, in a recessionary period?  It has never had a chance to perform.  I am asking the Minister to intervene to ensure that the factory is not closed on Monday next.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Deputy continues to refer to the viability of this operation.  I have dealt at great length in this House with the question of the viability of this plant.  If there was any question of its being viable, this question would not arise in the House today because the Government will sustain viable employment, especially when that employment is in factories and more particularly an operation of the size we are talking of, but where an operation is shown clearly to be not viable as shown by the records and having regard to the marketing situation, that is a different matter.  The situation in the market place is there to be researched by anybody.  To make an operation of this kind viable it is necessary to introduce a combination of products.  Any company who are geared to an 85 per cent production capacity but who operate on a 60 per cent production capacity, who do not adjust their cost structures and who sell on that basis, and who have lost £10 million in a couple of years are not in a situation that is sustainable.  The operation must be put together on a sustainable basis in the future and that is what the IDA are doing and what I will be doing.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1982: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>

      <Col N="1374" /> Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give the Bill a second reading on the grounds of social justice and economic responsibility, and in particular because&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in departing significantly from the terms of the Budget as outlined in the Financial Statement by the Minister for Finance in March, 1982, it confers concessions solely on the relatively well off, while giving no equivalent concessions to the low-paid as was proposed in the Family Income Supplement provisions of the Budget presented to the House in January, 1982,</P>
    <P>(b)  in granting concessions in regard to PRSI, it does so in such a way as to give maximum benefit to the well-paid, and little or no benefit to the low-paid,</P>
    <P>(c)  it aggravates national economic difficulties by measures, in regard to payments in advance of Value-Added Tax and Corporation Tax, which will cause losses of jobs in many vulnerable businesses, and will worsen the national budgetary situation for 1983 by using up revenue that would otherwise be available in that year, and</P>
    <P>(d)  it does not provide for any long-term reform of the PAYE system as was contained in the proposal for the introduction of a system of tax credits in the January Budget, while it fails to seek other sources of revenue by abandoning any proposals to reduce tax avoidance through discretionary trusts.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy J. Bruton).</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I was referring to the contrast between the January budget and the budget introduced subsequently so far as <Col N="1375" /> the provisions for discretionary trusts are concerned.</P>
      <P>The rate proposed in the January budget was 3 per cent on the establishment of such trusts and a further 1 per cent thereafter.  The purpose of the measure was to stop tax avoidance and I very much regret that the proposal was deleted from the March budget.  As we know, the Revenue Commissioners do not keep any register of discretionary trusts.  There is no register for the purpose of capital taxation since the trusts have not been liable to date to a tax on capital. The only information available to the Revenue Commissioners in regard to these trusts was in respect of the years 1975 to 1977 when the wealth tax was in operation and applied to discretionary trusts. The number of such trusts ranged at that time from 1,615 in 1975 to 1,316 in 1977. Since we are talking of a measure of capital taxation it is of critical importance to examine the amount of money which would have come in and that is merely from what are now estimated to be in the region of 1,500 to 1,600 trusts.  We would have got £4 million in 1982 and £2,500,000 in 1983.  That is on a mere 3 per cent of their establishment and a further 1 per cent thereafter which is about the lowest rate of taxation that one could have brought in.  It was an exceptionally low rate.</P>
      <P>Again, we are back to the question of the contrast in our society whereby while no PAYE worker or other employee has the slightest opportunity of escaping the tax net &mdash; he has a computer number on his income &mdash; yet these trusts have been set up by perhaps the 2,000 wealthiest people in the country.  The trusts have been set up deliberately and the incomes of the people concerned have been paid into the trusts largely for the benefit subsequently of their families.  As such, the trusts are not liable to tax on the capital disposed of in this manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The injustice of this is evident and it is clear from the estimated revenue figure I have given &mdash; £4 million from 2,000 people is a lot of money even at a rate of 3 per cent &mdash; that even they will have been subjected to considerable exemptions <Col N="1376" /> and reliefs in the normal course on a fairly wide scale.  Therefore, the intention to tax only in circumstances where the person is no longer alive and where the beneficiaries would probably be over 25 plus the deliberate deletion in the budget of what we had proposed was a retrograde step.  There is little doubt that a substantial yield could be realised if the levy were imposed across the board and if there were no exceptions.  Equally, I would make the point that perhaps the Minister might consider that the use of limited private companies as trading or investment vehicles results frequently in substantial losses of revenue.  I would ask him to advise the House of the extent to which amending legislation could be introduced which would enable the Revenue Commissioners to treat the private company and the shareholders as one entity, they being subjected to the maximum income tax rate.  There are aspects relating to the taxation of private limited companies which are clearly avoidance measures.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy with the extent of the exemption limits per capital gains in section 32.  I am surprised that the Minister decided to quadruple the £500 exemption limit to £2,000 and for a married couple &mdash; whatever definition one uses for married, presumably an individual and a spouse &mdash; it is also quadrupled to £4,000. There should be some degree of indexation, perhaps from £500 to £750 which would be more than generous in the light of the history of the £500 limit but certainly I could not agree to a £2,000 exemption limit.  The amendment reduced the effect of capital gains receipts for the Exchequer and, as I indicated earlier, these receipts are currently miniscule and hardly worth the while of the staff employed in collecting them.  An enormous amount of work must be done to collect the receipts in terms of appeals, counter appeals, special hearings and so on and it is hardly worth the effort of the Revenue staff to chase a few million pounds.  The rates are very small and we are all aware that the staff involved in collecting the receipts would be better off engaged collecting arrears of VAT or PRSI payments.  Quite an amount of <Col N="1377" /> arrears are outstanding at present.  That does not diminish the argument that we should have an effective capital gains tax system.  The existing staff deserve our sympathy, exercising so much energy to chase so little.  I am unhappy about that section and many other Members should be concerned about the excessive relief given.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider introducing a special land development levy.  Had I the opportunity I would have introduced such a levy. I believe that land that is zoned under the current draft development plans of local authorities should be levied to the tune of £8,000 per acre if rezoned, with or without disposal.  We are all aware that land after it is rezoned may not be transferred for many years afterwards but if we introduced such a levy it would put a curb on some of the outrageous rezoning decisions currently going on, particularly in County Dublin. Those who manage to convince a local authority to rezone land would then have to pay a levy of £8,000 per acre.  We are all aware that where rezoning is agreed a local authority enters a quasi-constitutional obligation in the years ahead to provide the moneys for infrastructural development for such land and that there are mass speculative gains from it.  If a person holds on to the land and sits on it as an asset that person is not liable to capital gains tax.  That person should be caught at the point of zoning.  I should like to tell the House that between 1972 and 1982 about 8,500 acres of land in County Dublin were rezoned.  In the last 18 months about 4,000 acres were rezoned.  For the most part that was agricultural land rezoned for industrial, commercial or residential use.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that local authorities have power to impose a development levy at the point of development.  Where a developer wants to proceed the current development levy is about £4,000.  I would put that levy on at the rezoning stage.  If a person wants to make an application for rezoning either by way of material contravention of a development plan or by way of gaining on rezoning I would slap the levy on.  I would give that <Col N="1378" /> money from the Exchequer to the local authorities to form part of the urgently needed funds for local authorities.  Local authorities are starved of money for road development, sanitary services development and basic infrastructural development. That kind of money could easily accrue to the Exchequer because all that is necessary is for local authorities to be obliged to keep a register of any land where zoning has changed.  That register could be supplied to the Revenue Commissioners who would impose a straightforward £8,000 development levy.</P>
    <P>Section 77 provides for the collection of VAT at the point of importation in respect of imports by registered persons. It is significant that the Minister today told us that the current budget deficit would all be swallowed up by the middle of the year.  That is the most astounding statement I can recall hearing since I became a Member and, perhaps, since the foundation of the State.  I cannot recall a Minister for Finance telling the House that we had budgeted for a current budget deficit of £675 million and all that would be gone by 30 June.  That is a most amazing admission.  It may be that the accelerated payment of VAT will not be collected after all.  One can read many things into this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The second part is illuminating also.  In the course of his speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>Broadly speaking, however, the deficit by end-June should be of the order of 100 per cent of the figure for the year as a whole and this figure should be significantly exceeded by end-September. As I have said, the real impact of extra tax receipts will not be felt until the final quarter of the year particularly because of VAT on imports.  In that quarter revenue should significantly exceed expenditure and thus ensure that the budget targets for the year as a whole are achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does that include the deficit?  In three <Col N="1379" /> weeks' time the whole deficit for the year will be gone.  That is phenomenal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>And, presumably, by the end of the year it is hoped to be back on target.  I have doubts about that.  If one talks to manufacturers and owners of companies one learns how severe their liquidity problems are.  We have spent some time here speaking about Fieldcrest where 650 people may lose their jobs tomorrow morning.  So severe are the liquidity problems with some other companies that we may have a deceleration rather than an acceleration of a month's payment of VAT.  Frankly, I do not see £140 million coming in in the months from September to December next.  The Minister will be doing extraordinarly well to accelerate about £40 million or £50 million.</P>
      <P>The Minister must also accept that Post Office receipts are down.  There has been a decline in such receipts.  That is not surprising when one considers the rates we charge, the second highest in Europe. I doubt if the budget deficit target will be achieved, and the measures proposed are regressive.  If a person wishes to bring in a colour television set or a video machine or millions of pounds worth of cosmetics I have no objection to a levy on that.  It is hard to realise that £52 million is spent on cosmetics annually.  I have no objection if people wish to bring in expensive motor cars and pay full VAT at point of importation, as well as duty, but about half of what the Minister is trying to get is concerned with the raw materials of industry.  About £65 million of the £140 million is directly related to productive raw materials used in many cases for reexport. This is where I am greatly concerned about the impact of the accelerated payment and the payment at point of entry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Finance Bill, the Minister should take his courage in his hands on the famous or notorious section 84 loans of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976. I have outlined a number of ways in which <Col N="1380" /> we can get money here today.  I have said that we need about £100 million of capital tax which we could get with a tough regime.  I am quite convinced that we could get £60 million out of the farming community which is about 10 per cent of the moneys they get from the Exchequer and the EEC.  They get about £300 million a year from the Exchequer and £300 million a year from the CAP.  I am quite convinced that we can bring in another £20 million or £30 million on other aspects of VAT particularly on luxury goods.  If we abolish the section 84 loans, which are a tax evasion and avoidance measure, we could bring in another £20 million.  The discretionary trust side is good for another £6 million or £7 million. Deputies of any of the political parties should not stand up in Dáil Éireann and scream blue murder for tax relief on this, that or the other unless they are prepared to say where the money is coming from on a concomitant basis, otherwise we simply borrow abroad and go on a merry-go-round into financial bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>Section 84 should be examined and perhaps should have one modification. As far as I am aware, a substantial number of private companies in Ireland &mdash; agricultural co-operatives, for example &mdash; avail of that device, to use a polite term.  The facility should apply exclusively &mdash; if at all &mdash; to employment-creating, productive sectors of manufacturing services.  This would dampen down the measure in which the device is used at present.  Preferably the loophole should be abolished altogether.  I am opposed to the commercial banks availing of this device and to the mechanism being used by the commercial banks to confer benefits on particular companies. We should have it amended as quickly as possible, but the IDA may well have reservations about it being amended, all of a sudden, on the grounds that a number of companies have taken up operations here and are already benefiting from it.  If we cannot abolish it now and have the revenue accrue directly to the Exchequer, we should amend it so as to have rigorous control on it.</P>
    <P>Regarding the bank levy and section <Col N="1381" /> 83, this levy is charged on the current deposit accounts of each bank subject to certain adjustments including a £5 million threshold.  The proposed rate of duty in the Finance Bill, 1982, is 0.2 per cent on the first £100 million of taxable resources and 0.35 per cent on the remainder.  In the light of what some of the commercial banks have been doing in recent months, particularly in relation to one major construction firm where they could lose £30 million by virtue of appalling bad management internally, I would be inclined at this stage, despite the fact that it is not the best form of taxation, to sting them for another £20 million.  They deserve it and they deserve that the State should take, for example, not 0.2 per cent of the first £100 million of taxable resources but 1 per cent, and I would make the 0.35 per cent on the remainder 1 per cent also and have it 1 per cent across the board.  That would bring in about £50 million.</P>
    <P>I know that the banks are violently opposed to this method of levy, but to quite an extent in recent years the commercial banks have been loaning money on speculative projects without apparent collateral, apparently on money deposited by Irish citizens in their own banks, and have been losing the money.  If they can afford that kind of mis-investment I am not too sure that I would be unduly worried at this stage if the State were to take another £20 million or £30 million and to say &ldquo;We will look after it far better&rdquo; and in a sense teach some of their investment managers a lesson.  That is fairly sharp and harsh and the levy system is certainly not the best form of taxation. It has disadvantages and opens up an area of considerable uncertainty, but I have felt very strongly about the way in which commercial banks have used scarce national resources for some speculative activities.  I am surprised that the Central Bank have not been more rigorous and forthcoming in their control mechanisms which they are prepared to operate apparently with very considerable rigour when it comes to ordinary overdraft facilities. But major companies can, without a tittle of consent from the Central Bank, obtain moneys of that nature from commercial banks.  In that regard the Minister <Col N="1382" /> should examine the whole structure of the board of the Central Bank.  The commercial directors on the board of the Central Bank should not be nominated by the associated banks but by the Government.  It is a very fundamental and far-reaching change which would be necessary in other legislation into which I do not want to go today because it is slightly outside the ambit of this Bill, but measures of control are necessary.</P>
    <P>These are some of the suggestions I would make.  I welcome the fact that the Minister, in relation to short-term capital gains, has retained the 60 per cent charge for the first 12 months.  Undoubtedly, that is to be welcomed.  It is necessary and effective, and perhaps it is arguable &mdash; indeed, quite arguable in some respects &mdash; that the rate of capital gains in relation to land transactions should be higher.  I would be inclined to suggest that in certain aspects it should be much higher.  For example, take the 50 per cent rate.  An acre of agricultural land in County Dublin at an existing land use value of about £3,500 would have a site value on rezoning of about £35,000.  At the moment that land is subject to a development levy of about £4,000.  If you deduct from £35,000 a levy of £4,000 and £3,500 original site value and put a 50 per cent tax on that, that tax works out at £13,750.  The net gain is still a solid £13,750 per acre to the person directly concerned, assuming that tapering relief and roll-over-relief will not apply.  I do not regard the measures introduced by the Minister as being penal.  The 60 per cent rate is just about right and in some respects I would nearly go to 65 or 70 per cent.</P>
    <P>One of the big problems in relation to taxation is that the whole taxation base is too narrow.  Consideration must be given in the long run to the question of a property tax.  People will say &ldquo;there they go again&rdquo; but we must get away from the system of taxation which is based solely on VAT, income tax and booze.  We must have some form of property tax.  I am not suggesting rates.  A person's private dwelling should be exempted up to a certain limit of value.  Those on low incomes would naturally be exempted. <Col N="1383" /> The value of a person's property should be reflected to a degree in the tax return. In case people would think that I am being unduly extreme in this matter, I would point out that in Canada about 12 or 14 per cent of all State revenue comes on that side and in America about 15 per cent of revenue relates directly to property. If someone owns a property worth £100,000 he might get an exemption up to £40,000 and he would pay some form of tax, say 1 per cent, on the balance.  We have abolished almost every form of taxation except the three I have mentioned and as a result we cannot run the country properly.</P>
    <P>In regard to VAT on luxury goods, there are some other items which might be considered.  Last year we imported about £25 million worth of jewellery, clocks and watches.  I mentioned cosmetics earlier and the estimated revenue this year under that heading is about £60 million, a substantial sum if VAT were to be imposed at a differential rate.  We are wealthy enough to import £3 million worth of fur skin articles and these should be subject to a higher rate of VAT.</P>
    <P>PAYE contributions amount to about 18 per cent of the total wages and salaries of those who pay tax under this system. Only 1.75 per cent of the income of farmers goes in tax.  The self-employed pay about 6.8 per cent.  Corporation taxes as a percentage of non-agricultural profits amount to 12.5 per cent and capital taxation amounts to 1.3 per cent.  In fact, capital taxation as a percentage of total revenue is only 0.5 per cent.  Indirect taxes as a percentage of personal consumer expenditure are very high at 17.6 per cent and VAT as a percentage of personal consumer expenditure is 9.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>We must eliminate the more glaring aspects of poverty.  Many old people live alone in appalling conditions.  Six out of every ten such people do not have not water in their dwellings.  Those of us who grew up accustomed to having this facility may not appreciate this fact.  In 1980 one out of every ten people living alone did not have electricity.  A socially just Finance Bill could eliminate these appalling <Col N="1384" /> anomalies.  Three out of every ten people living alone lack the basic water amenities such as a flush toilet, washhand basin, kitchen sink, bath, shower and hot water.  That is the reality of social segregation in housing policy, yet we give tax relief on mortgages and so on.</P>
    <P>I am quite convinced that there will come a day when we will have a Finance Bill which may prove intensely unpopular but which will be of major benefit to the economic and social advancement of the country.  This can be done without having a balance of payments deficit of £1,300 million or 13 per cent of GNP as we had last year.  We can have a Finance Bill which will not lead to the payment of interest on the national debt, as a percentage of each pound of income tax revenue, of no less than 76 per cent, as was the case in 1981.  Our foreign debt last year was £3,740 million and our domestic debt was £6,560 million.  I am convinced that in 1983, 1984 and 1985 we can introduce Finance Bills that will not result in the current debt service cost of a payment of no less than £1,424 million. It is an appalling figure by any stretch of the imagination.  Equally I am convinced we could have introduced a Finance Bill that would not result in 1982 in the cost of servicing our outstanding external debts, where interest payments alone amount to £479 million and where capital repayments amount to £423 million.  We could do all these things provided we had the political leadership and did not waste our scarce resources that are collected by way of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>In 1981 a total of £72.7 million was spent on drugs and medicine and 95 per cent of those items were imported.  There is an appalling waste of money in this area.  We are spending £300 million per year on unemployment-related expenditure. We are spending £350 million on security: the Border alone will cost us £90 million.  We are spending £850 million on health services, but there is a lot waste and inefficiency in this area.  We are spending £750 million on social welfare. With regard to disability benefits, I must point out that there is a degree of waste in this area.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I say that if we face up in <Col N="1385" /> the lifetime of this Dáil to the major budgetary and financial crises facing us, I am convinced we can put things right. We can build a future for our children and a taxation system of which we can be proud.  We will at least have a worthwhile legacy to leave our children, even though we may have mismanged our business over a long period.</P>

      <P>I thought the Deputy would never wind up his contribution.  I congratulate the Minister for Finance for the decisiveness and the brevity with which he delivered his speech this morning. Since he became Minister for Finance he has dealt with matters clearly, with strength and determination and, unlike his predecessor in office, he has been prepared to show flexibility in his approach.  The previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, and the leader of his party did not show any flexibility whatever when they presented their proposals to the Dáil in January but immediately afterwards they twisted and turned in an effort to retain office.  That seems to have been overlooked by many political commentators, as was pointed out by Deputy O.J. Flanagan quite rightly when the new Dáil resumed. There was a campaign of villification against Fianna Fáil, its Ministers, its leader and Deputies.</P>
      <P>I consider I have been elected on the programme outlined by Fianna Fáil in 1982 and the alternative budget.  The Minister for Finance made the necessary adjustments in the Finance Bill and I agree with what he has done.  The statement he made this morning contains in the medium-term an economic plan which he proposes to introduce shortly and it will contain many earlier suggestions made not only in this House but in the parliamentary party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All over Europe governments are run on the most narrow margins of support. It requires great political skill to maintain <Col N="1386" /> the support of the various groupings within the governments concerned.  This is the situation in Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway and in other European countries.  We have been elected by the people quite recently.  The people have spoken and they expect us to make the system work.  Certainly one individual can be villified more than other people. Newspaper correspondents such as Conor Cruise O'Brien on a weekly basis not only in a national newspaper but also in a British paper have villified Fianna Fáil and its leadership.  It has been a revolting performance.</P>
    <P>At the end of their column other correspondents should state clearly what is their political point of view and let the people judge them on that basis.  At least when Conor Cruise O'Brien writes in newspapers we know he is a former Coalition Minister and we know what his politics were in the past.  We know the conflict of personality between him and the leader of our party, Deputy Haughey. We know Conor Crusie O'Brien blames his political demise on Deputy Haughey, but there are other correspondents who have not done what Conor Cruise O'Brien has done and who are writing these dreadful commentaries on Fianna Fáil and its leadership.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Chair will be taxing it to any great degree. The finances of this country depend on the type of people leading the country. The utilisation of our resources is based on the leadership that we have on the day the Finance Bill is introduced in the House.  It is in that context that I am entitled to speak of the crisis we have now in the media, the total campaign against Fianna Fáil in the media.  We have to make it clear to the people and the media have a responsibility to make it clear to the people what their views are, what their political outlook is.  We have seen an <i>exposé</i> in <i>Magill</i> magazine recently about certain elements working <Col N="1387" /> within the television media here.

      <P>I accept the ruling.  I just wanted to refer to the overall context in which this Finance Bill has been put before the House.  It is fair and reasonable that we should look at the overall contest, at the leadership, at the commentators and the people who are trying to draw attention to so-called divisions within our own party.  They forget Deputy Kelly, who went into exile on the other side to try to wrest the real Fine Gael from Deputy Garret FitzGerald. They forget the divisions within the Labour Party between Deputy Higgins and between Deputy Cluskey and others. They forget these things conveniently, but these are the same political strains evident in any political party.  Yet they choose to concentrate on the personality conflicts within Fianna Fáil almost to the exclusion of what is obviously happening on the other side of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to make a brief perusal of the statement the Minister for Finance made here.  It shows the very deep concern felt by all the people in this House for a fair and more equitable taxation system.  Deputy Barry Desmond was courageous, if that is the word, in that he came out strongly in favour of PRSI and its benefits.  Let me remind the House that the breakdown of payment of PRSI is approximately 50 per cent from the employer, 20 per cent from the employee and 25 per cent from the <Col N="1388" /> Exchequer.  Ultimately all the benefits of PRSI will return to the people who have paid the 25 per cent.  Those benefits will come in the form of pensions, in caring for the old, the disabled, the less well-off in our community, the more deprived in our community.  I admire Deputy Desmond and those politicans who have the guts to stand up and support PRSI in the face of the opposition there is to it at the moment.  It is an unpopular tax, it has some inequities in it and the Minister for Finance has recognised those inequities and has made the necessary adjustments. There is no point in bewailing the necessity to look after the less well-off in our community.  It is absolutely necessary and I do not think anybody would stand up on a political platform and say that the pensioners and the unemployed and all the others should not be given the benefits of what taxation we can raise on their behalf.</P>
      <P>One of the problems, of course, is the enormous rate of evasion, the enormous rate of manipulation of the social welfare system by those quite capable of working, by those collecting social welfare benefits and doing tax free jobs.  Nobody would deny that this is a very serious problem. The people responsible for manipulating the system have not been pursued strongly enough by the Department of Social Welfare, who are far too inclined to say that such an individual is entitled to social welfare benefits without examining the problems or the need of that individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the final analysis what is needed is a breakdown of the unemployment figures. There are a number of categories: the chronically unemployable, who for one reason or another cannot be retrained; the people who are genuinely unable to find work &mdash; the great majority of people out of work want work and it is unfair to categorise those people with the fiddlers &mdash; there is the chronic fiddler, the man who has been able to pull the three-card trick on the Department of Social Welfare, who comes down from working on the roof of the Garda barracks, collects his social welfare benefits and goes back to work on the roof.  We have heard that story before.  Those are <Col N="1389" /> three categories and they should be analysed in that way.  There is perhaps another category that might be considered, the school leavers.  The whole spectrum of the unemployed should be looked at and a proper analysis of their situation should be made.</P>
    <P>There are others, of course, that we hear very little of.  Most of the talk is about those who are abusing the social welfare system, and that is a serious and criminal act.  But we hear very little about those people who make large profits in business.  I do not begrudge them their profits but I do begrudge them their very expensive tax accountants who can advise them on the loopholes.  It is loopholes up there and chiselling and cheating down there.  That is the difficulty.  The tax accountants come in and advise on loopholes and that £.5 million can be made here or there or that tax can be avoided here, that money can be moved from Ireland to the Isle of Man and so on. We hear very little about this.  I would urge the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance to pursue this matter more actively.  Politicians have often been called the second oldest profession in the world.  Like the first, politicians will no doubt continue for a long time.  At least I hope they will; otherwise we will have anarchy.  We must protect our freedom and ensure social justice for all.</P>
    <P>I spoke recently about the situation in which the PAYE worker found himself, with his standard of living rapidly worsening because of increased taxation in almost every area.  Deputy Desmond referred to a number of areas, and I support his approach to some of them, but he overlooked the real issues which require political decisions.  As I said in the budget debate, those political decisions require that we consider further State intervention in areas such as fisheries, which has not made any impact on the economy, the fish processing industry and our marine fleet, which is totally inefficient although we have great wealth in our seas which we do not utilise.  If we invested in these areas we could reduce the tax burden which falls on a very narrow <Col N="1390" /> base, that is, the PAYE worker, farmers, financial institutions and so on. Our mountains could be developed and forests could be created to provide the timber needed for industry.  State help could also be given to the meat and food processing industries.</P>
    <P>Recently I was in a hotel in the midlands and got a beautiful sirloin steak, tinned vegetables and imported potatoes. The midlands is the richest part of Ireland and yet we cannot get fresh Irish vegetables. Why are the farmers not growing vegetables?  Why are the hotels not growing their own vegetables?  Because, in my view, they are dependent on State grants and are not prepared to make any effort to help themselves.  The Government have gone as far as they can in providing aid for farmers who are not getting a good return from their land.  During the last war Eamon de Valera imposed a tax on farmers who did not cultivate their land and produce food.  The Minister might consider imposing such a taxation. I see nothing inequitable about that.  As President Mitterand said recently, we are switching into a wartime economy whether we like it or not and we will be in serious trouble unless we take radical decisions.  We appear to be playing with monopoly money, transferring from one taxation system to another, creating new systems of taxation, but with the same money going round in circles.  We are creating confusion in people's minds.</P>
    <P>In Dublin we have the entire public service system.  There is urgent need for decentralisation.  We should open up areas to ensure that young people coming into the public service are given an opportunity to work closer to their roots and the environment they understand best. That makes good economics and good sense.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond spoke about putting another 10p on beer and 15p on cigarettes which would raise a certain amount of money.  We are spending £2 million a day on drink.  I think much less money would be spent on alcohol if pubs provided food and developed along the same lines as in Britain and in Europe.  If they do not provide such a service, public opinion will insist on it, because it is very essential. <Col N="1391" /> The campaign launched by restaurant owners to be allowed drink licences has a great deal of merit.  It has been proved that a person who has taken too much alcohol and has not eaten enough can cause fatal accidents.</P>
    <P>There is tax evasion everywhere.  Our doctors charge £7 or £8 a visit and if a person pays him ten visits it can cost £70 or £80.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon is a most honourable and decent man and I am sure it would not cross his mind to do what I am talking about but there are many less gentlemanly doctors who would put that £70 cash into their back pockets and would not return it to the taxman.  To overcome this problem might I suggest that on production of a medical receipt these expenses be allowed against income tax?  This would ensure that the PAYE worker could claim his medical expenses against income tax, and the doctor would pay his fair share of income tax.  We have grown men in wigs and gowns who strike fear into the hearts of the people unfortunate enough to have to go to court.  In this day and age these men are charging enormous fees for carrying out public inquiries.  I suggest they take off their wigs and gowns and get down to the work they should be doing, that is administering the law.  We should look at this area too.  Recently we witnessed a foray by the Fine Gael law fraternity who were protecting their own interests when we were discussing the Family Courts Bill.  A fear seemed to exist that these cases would be transferred from an upper to a lower court and made more accessible to the general public. There was impatience that suites had not been provided in which the district judge could consider the relevant family law issues.  We had the amazing scene of three or four Fine Gael lawyers badgering the Minister for Justice, seeking to retain their privileged position.  I was appalled and embarrassed at the situation <Col N="1392" /> and said so to the House.  I hope never again to see a scene of that kind.</P>
      <P>I could talk on for a considerable time but wish to be a little more relevant to the Finance Bill.  It strikes me that the political correspondents of this House should look&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Chair has been tolerant about references to wigs and gowns, even though they do not relate to the Finance Bill.  However, I would ask the Deputy not to return to the subject of political correspondents, because that is irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I made representations, on foot of the budget, to the Minister for Finance and am glad that many of those representations have been included in the adjustments made in the Finance Bill.  In my constituency, a great number of people are provided with a company car and the Minister has made a welcome adjustment in the use of a company car.  These are mostly young people, managers who work long hours in industry with no overtime pay and no other privileges or perks, the allowances for entertainment and so on having been eliminated.  It is legitimate that a company car, used mostly in the interest of the company, should not be taxed at the rate originally suggested.  I am not altogether satisfied with the modifications made for the future benefit of an employee for private use of the company car, but the Minister has gone a long way and, when the moment arrives, he will make the necessary adjustments.</P>
      <P>The Minister states:</P>
      <P>In the case of bona fide car pooling arrangements, there will be no charge to tax in respect of any incidental private use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a welcome arrangement and allows for a great deal of flexibility.  The proposal to grant income tax relief to elderly persons in respect of private tenancies, which is contained in section 5, is also welcome.  The Minister indicates that the relief will commence from 1983 to 1984 and be based on the rents paid in <Col N="1393" /> 1982.  The maximum amount on which relief will be granted is £500 in the case of a single or widowed person and £1,000 in respect of married couples jointly assessed.  Perhaps the Minister, in the next budget, would consider increasing that amount.  Realistically, it is not all that it should be and I hope for a great improvement here.</P>
    <P>Other speakers wish to speak about the budget in general so I shall conclude by saying as I said earlier, that I have no argument with the expenditure being made for Dublin city, some of which is contained in the Minister's statement today.  Deputy Gregory was right in seeking and getting what he sought from the State and the State are entitled to a capital city which befits the name capital. Deputies Gregory and Haughey reached an amicable and excellent agreement and I hope that nobody in this House will jeopardise that agreement, in the present or any future Government.  The inner city has for so long been neglected and any money spent on it is well spent.  Even the former Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, felt there was a great deal of merit in this expenditure but could not quite comprehend how the man in the street would relate to Deputy Gregory when Deputy FitzGerald made it clear before the general election that he could not accept these proposals.</P>
    <P>The merits of the Fine Gael Party have not been properly analysed on the basis of Deputy Kelly, the leader in exile, waiting to wrest back the party from those who have stolen the heart of Fine Gael, the old conservative christian democrats, to bring it back to reality, to the extreme right where it belongs and has always belonged, whose heart is contained in Deputy Kelly, Deputy O'Donnell, former Deputy Mark Clinton and others.  If the media examine the reality of what is happening in the various political parties, they will realise that every statement made by Deputy Kelly is in almost direct contradiction of what his leader has said in the past and is saying at present.</P>
    <P>In the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn went around with the Fine Gael label on one lapel and the Labour label on the <Col N="1394" /> other &mdash; a true Coalition Member.  Why not?  He got in on Deputy FitzGerald's surplus votes and transfers.  We see the honourable chairman of the Labour Party, whom I greatly admire and respect, Deputy Higgins, trying to wrest the soul of the Labour Party from the right wing to the moral standing which it had, or should always have had in the past, from the &ldquo;mercs&rdquo; and &ldquo;perks&rdquo; brigade, to those concerned with the real issues, with social justice and not just with office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond referred to bank profits.  I wish to refer briefly to bank interest rates.  Our industry is being crippled. Money is not available to the industrialist and to the young person who wants to start up in industry.  The Government have taken steps to get loans from foreign banks at reduced rates of interest, 10 per cent in Germany, and 11 per cent or whatever the prevailing rate may be in continental countries.  But this is quite inadequate for young people who want to start up factories or new ventures.  The banks are now charging 21, 22, 23 per cent and in some cases 28 per cent.  Capital as a commodity is not available to them and this will have to be dealt with resolutely by the political parties.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his brevity. Perhaps I have been a little less brief. I wish him success and offer him every support in bringing about a resolution of the problems in our economy.  I have every confidence in him and in the Fianna Fáil Government and in the people of Ireland to provide for the future.  We have the natural resources, the ability and a highly-trained workforce.  All we lack is capital and this House is entitled to intervene in the areas I have already mentioned &mdash; agriculture, forestry, fisheries, tourism and all the others &mdash; to ensure that the national wealth is made available to all the people.  Our people have the capacity and the willingness.  All they want is to be told the truth and given direction and, like de Valera, the leadership will bring us through these difficult times to better days ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of the concern <Col N="1395" /> of Deputy Andrews for the well-being of the Fine Gael Party, I can assure him that we know where we came from, where we are and where we are going and he need have no worries about us.  Despite his remarks about political commentators he shows no mean skill himself in that particular area and if he ever leaves this House, which I trust will be a long way off, I am sure he will find ready employment among the ranks of the scribes he so readily castigates.</P>
      <P>In my consideration of this Finance Bill I was reminded of a man named Andre Queille who was Prime Minister in the French Third Republic.  By the standards of his time he was a very successful Prime Minister in that he was very good at getting power and holding on to it.  His basic political philosophy was that statemanship consisted in the art of postponing problems until they were no longer relevant or until he was out of office and somebody else had to clear up the mess. It was a combination of people like Andre Queille and their arguments that led to the collapse of the Third Republic with the resulting failure of the people to believe that the Republic and its institutions were worth fighting for.  That particular period of French history was characterised by self-seeking politicians, by its domination by sectional groups and their inability to see beyond the next parliamentary vote and most of all, by the complete absence of the will to take any long-term political decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at this Finance Bill and looking possibly at those events which were sandwiched between the publication of the Bill and the budget one can only say that the spirit and the morals and the practices of the French Third Republic have come back to haunt our political system.  The budget of last March was in some respects a phony budget.  It bore little relation to either economic reality or basic accounting.  It certainly fell far short of Fianna Fáil's election target but it did include commitments of a highly sectional nature entered into in this pursuit for power.  I am surprised that Deputy Andrews could take such pride in the way in which the Gregory deal was <Col N="1396" /> arrived at, a deal which by-passed the Cabinet and this House.  It was a private deal entered into between two private individuals which nevertheless committed the State to enormous sums of money.  I am surprised that he as a parliamentarian should take so much pride in that deal.  I do not say that anybody here does not want to see Dublin restored to some form of greatness or that we do not all take pride in our capital city, but I am astonished that a Member of Parliament who believes in the supremacy of Parliament could in any way take pride in that deal.</P>
    <P>The budget of last March, whether on purpose or not and in part perhaps to assuage the feelings of the Workers' Party, was calculated to weaken the business community and damage the creation of new jobs especially through the bringing forward of payment of corporation tax and VAT payments from industry by £176 million&mdash;and of this at a time when cash flow problems were never greater and the margin of profits never so tight. Typically, that particular ploy was in the interests of short-term expediency.  In an artificial way it would alter the budget deficit at the end of this year, although in fact not addressing itself to the underlying problems and in turn storing up problems for next year.  There was at least in that budget an indication that the Government were in some way facing up to some aspects of reality.  It was not doing this willingly or convincingly but at least it was recognising the inevitable.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that by the end of the election campaign in February the people had begun to recognise the sucicidal policies of excessive foreign borrowing the proliferation of non-productive State spending.  The people were ready to make sacrifices especially if these sacrifices were imposed in a fair and equitable way.  People were ready for leadership, ready to follow where a lead was given courageously in a direct and straight way.</P>
    <P>This change in public mood was due to the Coalition Government's courageous facing up to facts and having the courage to follow on from their recognition of the facts and to take hard decisions, but by <Col N="1397" /> the end of the election that was irrelevant. It may have been galling for us politically to find that our sacrifices and ultimately our loss of power had prepared the people for the imposition of further sacrifices in the interest of healthy finances and of future progress.</P>
    <P>Politically we had paid the sacrifice but nationally we had made it easier for Fianna Fáil to act decisively and for that as Irish people and as politicians we can only be pleased.  Sadly and tragically the political leadership was not forthcoming. Instead we had the most shameless abdication of responsibility in our history.  As soon as the interest groups began to howl, and howl as they probably always will, the Government began to capitulate on a wide variety of areas so that what we have got is the cynical negation of leadership and further loss of political self respect.</P>
    <P>The result of this attitude can be found in a number of places.  It can be found, for example, in the concession that gives an additional £312 to each PRSI contributor in the private sector and which will cost an extra £45 million this year.  The granting of that concession may well have merits but the way in which the decision was taken and the timing of it smacks of expedient ad hocery.  More important, there is no indication anywhere in this Bill as to where, how and from whom this extra money is to be raised if the Government at the same time expect to maintain their stated budget deficit.  That behaviour is not good enough for a sovereign Government with a tradition, at least until recently, of fiscal probity.  I am surprised that more voices have not been raised from the opposite benches at this behaviour.  In the past few days we have had the beginning of the expression of concern on this question but it is surprising that more voices have not been raised in the same vein.  The Government must come clean on this.  If the targeted budget deficit is, in the words of Watergate, inoperative the Government must face up to this or else we are faced with extra taxation or with a supplementary budget.  The public have a right to know what the situation is.</P>
    <P>At this stage I do not intend to detail <Col N="1398" /> the promises made in Dublin West, running as they did into millions of pounds but without provision for anyone of them being more in this Bill.  I do not know whether these promises will be kept but again and not for party political reasons but for reasons of national self respect and of the proper and prudent care of our finances, we must be told whether these promises are to be kept and, if so, how much they will cost and how the necessary money is to be raised.  These were commitments that were solemnly entered into but there is no provision for them in the Bill.  Are they inoperative? Again, we have the simple question of Parliament and of the public having a right to know.</P>
    <P>But the question of whether these promises are to be kept is part of a much bigger problem.  I refer to the tragedy of the deliberate and cynical dissipation of the new mood of civic responsibility, the new willingness to endure sacrifices in the national interest which existed at all levels and in all parts of the country at the end of the February election.  That election was one of the great educational experiences of the last decade because in that election the people were given an insight into the State's finances.  Hard choices were put before the people and by and large they responded.</P>
    <P>At that time we experienced a mood of a kind that I do not remember having experienced before, though there may have been such a mood in the twenties or the thirties when people had far lower expectations of the role of the State and perhaps a far higher level of commitment to making the State and its institutions work.  That mood was not easily created but when the people realised that the Government were serious and were prepared to take hard decisions spread evenly across the entire population, the people responded with generosity and with willingness.  In the eight short weeks after the election and with the beginning of the deals entered into privately committing millions of pounds for certain projects, that mood has been destroyed shamelessly in the interest of short-term political survival.  A great deal is necessary if we are to win back the confidence <Col N="1399" /> of the people and to bring about that frame of mind again.</P>
    <P>The people must be prepared to trust politicians again but to bring about this situation they must see politicians acting in the interest of the people.  A great deal would be needed in order to win back that trust and confidence.  Indeed, it may not be possible to do so without the purging effect of a general election to clear the air.  Anybody who has tramped around West Dublin day after day, who has been through three or four elections in the last ten or 12 months will not want an election soon.  He will want to put an election off for a year or two years.  Even those of us who consider that there is a need for an election may echo St. Augustine who prayed, &ldquo;Dear Lord make me pure but not yet&rdquo;.  I think Members on all sides share that sense of weariness, that sense of shame at going back to face the people once again.  Nevertheless, if we do not have an election soon, though I believe we will have one, we may find ourselves in the grip of national paralysis, leaderless, buffeted in this direction and that, postponing problems and all the time creating those conditions in which the extremism of the right or the extremism of the left will flourish.</P>
    <P>We should not fool ourselves into thinking that there are not in our society elements, perhaps on the ground, perhaps some recently surfaced, whose interest is in some form of long-term revolution and who will thrive on the condition of leadership, on general disruption, on the lack of credibility in politicians and on the general disaffection of people from the body politic.  This is the problem which faces all of us as politicians who are committed to the supremacy of Parliament.  It is a problem which if not recognised now may well put in jeopardy the whole future of this House and of Irish democracy.  Tragically the position we face now is so unnecessary. The wounds that are now so evident so far as the present administration are concerned are self-inflicted and this has been done for no real purpose.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to some specific aspects of the Bill.  There is nothing in <Col N="1400" /> the Bill to indicate that the Government will meet the projected budget deficit of £679 million for 1982.  The Minister argued that perhaps because of the budget being delayed the revenue for the first part of the year is down but that we could expect, with the bringing forward of other revenues, to reach the targeted deficit by the end of the year.  There is very little that I find convincing in that argument.  Already for the first three months of the year the deficit is £395 million or 58 per cent of the projected total for the year.  Even if we allow for the fact that the first three months of the year are the most difficult, and taking into account all the allowances, all the factors and all the excuses put forward by the Minister this morning, it looks once again as if we are facing a £1 billion deficit by the end of the year and that is exactly the same figure as that faced by the incoming Coalition this time last year and which was only averted by the drastic surgery of the July budget.  This time we are told there will be no supplementary budget but if we take into account the £45 million for PRSI and the consequences of the Gregory deal, we can see that we are heading towards this totally unacceptable deficit of close on £1 billion. That figure was unacceptable last year.  It was one that every party committed themselves to reducing, but now, once again, we find ourselves facing the consequences for our entire financial, economic and political system which can be little short of catastrophic.  There is nothing in the Bill or in the Minister's speech to indicate that he is in any way concerned about this, or that he believes that he is in any way off course.  The Minister is living in a world of unreality if he believes that by the end of the year we will have reached our targeted deficit without taking drastic and painful steps. There is no indication that he is prepared to do so.</P>
    <P>The bringing forward of VAT and tax payments is a once-off action which will create cash flow problems at this most precarious of times.  I do not like using terms such as &ldquo;cash flow&rdquo; but this will mean that firms will not have the money, that they will go broke.  People will be <Col N="1401" /> thrown out of jobs and the businesses once regarded as secure will find themselves facing insurmountable problems. As the Chair is aware the problem which has closed down that most promising of industries in Kilkenny is just one of the many problems which will face other businesses and which will be exacerbated by this VAT imposition.  It is largely a cosmetic exercise designed to make the books look better at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>As Deputies Bruton and Desmond stated earlier, the budget fails to face up to the question of short-term welfare benefit, and that is to be regretted.  There is something wrong with a society in which people can earn more by being absent from work or, on purpose, working short-time than a person can earn working full-time.  There is something wrong with the present situation which can so easily be fiddled and results in so many anomalies.  The situation is a source of anger, resentment and scandal.  It saps the morale of those who work hard, those who pay under the PAYE system and pay their PRSI on the nail but yet find that their take-home pay is less, substantially less in many cases, than that of a neighbour who for one reason or another has manipulated and worked the system and finds himself on PRSI but as an active participant in the black economy. Obviously, there must be protection for those who lose their jobs.  The principle of PRSI is a good one.  It is one where politicians have had the courage to say that this type of social insurance is worth defending.  It has got out of control, is seen as another form of taxation and the abuses are so widespread as to be visible, especially to those who are in the workforce. There must be proper protection and a proper system.  We are all aware from work in our constituencies that the present system is riddled with abuses and creates bitterness, suspicion and resentment between different categories of workers.  It induces an anti-work ethos in the community and breeds cynicism.  It produces all the hallmarks of a servile state.</P>
    <P>No one would say that the taxing of short-term benefits was the answer to this problem but at least it recognised that the <Col N="1402" /> problem exists.  It recognised that this is a deep-seated social and economic malaise in our society and it signified, on the part of the last Government, a willingness to face up to the problem even if that meant short-term political unpopularity. The mood having been created there, the willingness has been dissipated in the weeks since the election.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the capital gains tax concession in the Bill.  According to a Government statement the effect of this concession which raises the exemption threshold to £4,000 per year will favour the small investor.  Surely the fact is that an individual stock market investor who realises a gain over and above indexation relief of £4,000 per year &mdash; that is what is involved &mdash; could hardly be regarded as a small investor.  Supposing a capital gain of £4,000 represents a 5 per cent real return, then the associated investment is of the order of £80,000. Any person who can afford that type of investment annually can hardly be called a small investor but that is the person now favoured in this Bill.  However, the genuine small investor, the person who typically saves through an institution by participating in a unit trust or taking out various forms of life insurance is excluded from this form of relief.  In other words, there is a discrimination between the person who invests individually through a stockbroker, a person who is pretty well off, and the person who pools his money with others in a unit trust.  In the latter course the person who pools his money with others in a unit trust or invests in an insurance company would be liable for the full 60 per cent short-term tax rate with no exemption thresholds.</P>
    <P>Life assurance investment is also hit by the 1 per cent levy on premium income. In effect, the Bill does not contain any joy for the small saver whose chagrin must be greatly increased by the fact that now the fat-cat investor is so much better off as a result of very skilful and effective lobbying after the budget.</P>
    <P>At a time when our heavy reliance on foreign borrowing is adding to our balance of payments problems we should try to encourage savings, especially the committed type of savings from the small <Col N="1403" /> investors, the type of savings which flow into institutions, instead of making concessions which will largely help speculators and personal borrowers.  The Minister should have another look at this question which is causing great concern among small investors.</P>
    <P>I should like to return to a point raised by Deputy Desmond.  I find myself in substantial agreement with him on this matter although I hope to use somewhat more moderate language than he used.  I am referring to the wisdom of restoring relief on personal loan interest.  That is a regressive measure and will add to the high interest rates problem.  The benefits from this will accrue only to those with sufficiently high incomes to qualify for term loans and the collateral to cover them.  Borrowers on a higher marginal tax rate will gain most.  This concession does not do anything to discourage the practice of trading-up the housing market which artificially inflates the price of the lower houses.  Those who continually buy more expensive houses and borrow in the process are creating problems and, artificially, are raising the price which the first-time house-buyer, the buyer of a modern house, must face.  That concession will create an additional demand for credit.  It will push up the already high interest rates and exacerbate the difficulties faced by industry and mortgage holders in trying to meet their borrowing commitments. The Minister should have another look at this.  I believe the change was made in response to another powerful lobby.  Those with the less powerful voice may be the ones who will suffer.</P>
    <P>I should like to return to the overall financial and political philosophy which underlines the budget and is incorporated in the Bill before us.  It is a philosophy which is part of this Bill and which has underlain most of the actions of this Government from 1977, but especially after 1980.  The psychology, tone and style of this new philosophy were set in the manifesto of 1977 and have been all-pervasive ever since then.  It is a simple philosophy: buy power by raising expectations and pay for it by borrowing. Something will turn up, and if it does not <Col N="1404" /> we will pretend that things are different. We can say, like Alice in Wonderland, that things are what we say they are.  It is a terrible, frightening philosophy based on the assumption that the people are eternally gullible and eternally willing to be bought.  It is causing concern right across this House and to the decent, ordinary members of political parties right through every part of this country.</P>
    <P>It is right and natural that it should cause such concern because that philosophy is alien to the history and principles of the three major parties in this House.  For me, as for most Members here, to take one's seat in this historic Chamber is a proud and unforgettable action.  When I sit here on the backbenches &mdash; there is plenty of time for sitting on the backbenches &mdash; I often think of the great men who stood here and spoke, argued and debated over the years, the men and women who fought and legislated for the betterment of our people.  As I close my eyes, as one does occasionally during speeches here, I think of how they might have been in the early days, young, ambitious, impatient, excited by the prospect of freedom.  I can almost see them now, W. T. Cosgrave, Kevin O'Higgins, Paddy McGilligan, Paddy Hogan.  Later in the thirties one can see the ghosts of Eamon de Valera, Seán Lemass, James Ryan and Seán McEntee, the last fortunately not a ghost but still with us.  One can see them arguing and fighting.  One can look at the Labour benches and see there the almost forgotten but noble figure of Thomas Johnson.</P>
    <P>When I think of these people and their contributions I wonder how they would have reacted to the philosophy which I have just outlined.  Can you imagine Deputy W. T. Cosgrave or Deputy Eamon de Valera giving in to any sectional demand, not to mention every sectional demand?  Can you imagine them running away from commitments solemnly entered into in a budget voted by this House?  Can you imagine them a few weeks later with the stroke of a pen changing that budget?  Can you imagine them plunging the country into foreign debt in the interests of short-term survival? <Col N="1405" /> I could go on, but we know exactly how Deputy W. T. Cosgrave, Deputy Seán Lemass or Deputy Eamon de Valera would have reacted.  Whatever their differences, these men were leaders. They told the people the truth about the economy, the balance of payments, and most of all, something we have forgotten today, the responsibilities of an independent State.  These men never heard of PR or &ldquo;strokes&rdquo; and if they had they would have despised them and those who governed by means of &ldquo;strokes&rdquo; or PR.</P>
    <P>This country is crying out for a return to these values and standards, for politicians who will face up to the problems and tell the people the truth.  The people in harder times never let Deputy W. T. Cosgrave down.  They never let Deputy Éamon de Valera down, nor would the people today let down a leader who is prepared to lead, to tell the truth and to face up to hard realities.  However, if we are to get that leadership, the philosophy which underlines this Finance Bill and the actions of the Government over the past number of years must be eradicated immediately and completely from our national life.  It is sad that this present Government show no sign or indication that that is about to happen.  There is no will to see that that is done and that we return to these old standards.  That is why this Bill must be rejected and we must have an election, however painful and uncomfortable, to clear the air and return to the old standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very unusual year in so far as we have had a second budget presented a few months after the first.  The present Government had to come in here a fortnight after the Dáil resumed following the election and present their budget.  It is extraordinary that some speakers on the other side of the House are so critical of that budget, seeing that most of it was what they themselves had planned for the three, four or five months necessary to plan such a budget.  The Minister here today when introducing the Finance Bill said that it would reduce our borrowing needs and improve employment.  It is essential that we work towards that.  We are living in <Col N="1406" /> difficult times and nobody denies that.  In 1981 the economic growth in the OECD countries dropped to one-third of what it was in 1979 and world trade in the same year fell to one-seventh of what it was in 1979.  Unemployment is rising not alone in our country but throughout western Europe.  It is expected that 11 million people will be unemployed in western Europe by the end of this year in the EEC countries, some of which have not experienced any unemployment since the last world war.</P>
      <P>This morning the Minister spoke about borrowing.  It is interesting to listen to speakers on the other side of the House. Listening to them, one would feel that borrowing for current deficits commenced with Fianna Fáil.  That is not so. In 1973 the Coalition Government had two choices when the price of oil escalated rapidly.  They could either pay their way and reduce the standard of living somewhat, or they could borrow.  They decided at the time that they should borrow. With hindsight one would have to question whether this was a good idea, but the borrowing started then and, as the Minister pointed out, we must cut down on the level of that borrowing and that is what he proposes to do both through the budget and the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Borrowing for capital purposes is a different matter, as long as the money is being borrowed for a worthwhile project. Our infrastructure is grossly underdeveloped. To take a few examples, all our national primary roads lead either to or from Dublin and a great need exists for some major roads going east-west across the country.  I suggest to the Minister, who is a Sligo man, that a very worthy project would be a major road from Sligo to Dundalk and on to Greenore Port. This would open up all that underdeveloped area from Donegal across the north-west through Cavan, Monaghan and Sligo, for industry and tourism and it would facilitate the people who live in that area.  More important is the problem of the amount of traffic in and out of Dublin, particularly the heavy traffic going through the port of Dublin.  If Carlingford Lough were developed the EEC might look at it in the context of cross-Border <Col N="1407" /> projects, and if the port of Greenore were developed &mdash; it has a low-water depth of 40 feet &mdash; it would take much of the heavy traffic which is causing many of the major problems in the city of Dublin at present.</P>
    <P>There is provision this year of £230 million for telecommunications services. This is a welcome development because there has been criticism of this service in the past.  People should not be critical of borrowing money for this purpose.  The Minister for the Environment has provided a welcome addition to funds to increase the output of local authority housing.  There is provision in the Finance Bill for tax relief on money spent on the preservation of buildings of architectural or other value.</P>
    <P>There is much concern about the whole question of taxation and the Commission on Taxation will publish their first report in the near future.  Many people believe we have reached a stage where we cannot accept any more taxation and that there must be a fairer and more equitable means of raising revenue.  The Minister pointed out this morning that the amount of tax we pay is in keeping with other European countries, but I hope that the report of the commission will lead to a more simplified tax code.</P>
    <P>The tax relief of £312 has been mentioned by several speakers, as has the whole question of PRSI.  Deputy Manning said that the Minister did not state how he would finance this allowance of £312.  The Minister said this morning that the PRSI tax concession of £312 would reduce tax revenue by £45 million this year.  He went on to state:</P>
    <P>I have said previously that this has to be made good.  A major review of Departmental expenditures has recently been completed and the results of this review are now being evaluated in my Department.  It is hoped that this will provide substantial savings but, if there is still a shortfall on the £45 million, then I will consider taxation options.</P>
    <P>It could not be more clear that the Minister intends to stick to his original target and to reduce our level of borrowing.</P>

      <Col N="1408" /> The level of PRSI contributions was raised by 2.75 per cent, of which 1 per cent is for the Youth Employment Agency.  Nobody can deny that this is a very worthy cause.  The remainder goes to the social insurance fund and it is important to recognise that this fund exists for the benefit of employees who contribute to it.  From this fund contributory pensions, disability benefit, invalidity benefit and unemployment benefit are paid.  The amount raised through PRSI is supplemented by over £200 million from the Exchequer.  The benefits are there for those who pay into the fund.</P>
    <P>The budget provided a welcome increase of 25 per cent for those in receipt of long-term benefits.  It is important that we look after those who are dependent on social welfare and those who are less privileged.  It is not always appreciated that many of the benefits available here are better than those in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.  It was often said in the past that we were far behind Northern Ireland in regard to social welfare and that this made it unattractive for people there to join us.  Disability benefit here amounts to IR£31.65 while in Northern Ireland it is £22.50.  Even allowing 20 per cent for the change from sterling, we would still be far ahead.  Children's allowances in Northern Ireland are £5.25 whereas here the amount is IR£11.25 per month for the first child and IR£17.50 for the second and subsequent children.  These are some examples of how a person is better off on this side of the Border than on the other side.  A married man with three children in receipt of disability benefit here receives IR£84.46 whereas in Northern Ireland he would receive £54.55.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manning was disappointed that, unlike the Coalition budget, there was no proposal to tax short-term social welfare benefits.  The social welfare system needs to be examined but it would be very difficult administratively to tax short-term benefits and it would add tremendously to the work of the Revenue Commissioners.  It is debatable whether such a measure could be implemented. Certainly something must be done about the number of people receiving unemployment <Col N="1409" /> payments.  There should be a proper assessment and perhaps officials from the Department of Social Welfare and Manpower could carry out a pilot project in a specific area and interview all those who are receiving unemployment payments.  Many people through no fault of their own are forced to live on unemployment assistance.  Those who are elderly might not now be fit for work. Such people might more appropriately be catered for by a medical certificate than by signing on every week for unemployment assistance.  We must find out the number of people who are genuinely available for work because it is only by having this information that we will be able to create the jobs that are so necessary.</P>
    <P>In the area of social welfare services the question of the means test must be considered.  None of us is over-enthusiastic about the concept of a means test because it is looking into the private affairs of an individual.</P>

      <P>The means test is important in the general context of eligibility for all services.  It is important that we have a means test at the moment but an officer from one Department should have responsibility for the matter. At the moment a number of people investigate means.  Officers from the Department of Social Welfare, community welfare officers from the Department of Health and officers from the Department of Education all carry out investigations in respect of the means of applicants.  It is my view that in respect of the entire range of services available there should be only one means test and that survey should be carried out by one Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest challenge facing the Government is the creation of employment. <Col N="1410" /> Today the leaving certificate and intermediate certificate examinations started for almost 100,000 young people. It is a great challenge to the Government to ensure that jobs are created for those leaving school this year and also for young people who have already left school but have not yet got employment. Chapter VIII of the Finance Bill has a provision in respect of deduction in computing trading income.  It is stated that an amount of £10 per week will be allowed for each employee from 1 July 1982 to the end of June 1983.  This provision is welcomed.</P>
    <P>There are benefits for agriculture in the Finance Bill and there are tax credits for banks who are aiding farmers in severe financial difficulties.  This provision is to be welcomed.  Farmers have had difficult times in the past few years and any support for them is worthwhile.  The price increases negotiated by the Minister for Agriculture are to be welcomed.  They were a great achievement having regard to the circumstances, particularly the opposition from our neighbour across the water.  An increase of 11 per cent was a considerable achievement this year.</P>
    <P>In further negotiations in Brussels, I ask the Minister for Agriculture to try to have the entire country put in the category of severely handicapped areas.  I ask him in particular to give special consideration to the 12 western counties where farmers work under an extra hardship.  I believe an application is being processed at the moment in respect of the more severely handicapped areas and I ask the Minister to ensure that the entire country is included in this category.</P>
    <P>Section 85 of the Finance Bill deals with the removal of stamp duty on gifts of land and this is most welcome.  Of particular interest in my constituency is the reduction in VAT on furniture from 25 per cent to 18 per cent.  We have a considerable furniture industry, including a number of small family-owned industries with an employment figure of 800 persons and the reduction in VAT was much appreciated.  Concern has been expressed about VAT on imports at source but I appreciate there will be one advantage in that it will remove the <Col N="1411" /> advantage imports have over domestic products.  I ask the Minister to monitor how VAT on imports at source is working and if is creating unnecessary hardship for native industry I ask him to ensure that something is done to rectify the position.  This Government decided quite rightly not to impose VAT on shoes or clothing and this was welcomed.  It was estimated that if VAT were imposed on shoes there would be a loss of 11,000 jobs in the shoe industry.</P>
    <P>Section 70 of the Finance Bill gives effect to orders made in the budget in relation to increased duty.  Much concern has been expressed to public representatives at the escalation in the number of exemptions granted during the years. Some 20 years ago there were 2,000 applications in one year but three years ago that number was as high as 44,000 applications.  The Government will have to keep this in mind because it is causing concern in relation to work.  If there are over 40,000 licences in a year and if there are a large number of late exemptions in a year, we will have people staying out until the early hours of the morning drinking and this will obviously have an undesirable effect on their capacity for work the next day.</P>
    <P>The area along both sides of the Border has suffered from Partition.  The town of Clones, for example, has the Six Counties on three sides of it and all but one of the roads are blocked and cannot be used. This has left the town without its natural hinterland.  It is very important that new ways of developing this area should be found.  The EEC funds have helped in many ways with various schemes, through the cross-Border tourist orientated projects scheme, which is worth £16 million to both sides of the Border, through some cross-border drainage schemes and through the western package. I would ask the Minister to ensure that this support from the EEC will continue for these very worthy projects and that more such projects will be introduced.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would be very critical of the Coalition Government preaching doom and gloom both during their term <Col N="1412" /> of office and since they left office.  What we need more than anything at this time is confidence in our ability to solve our own temporary difficulties.  Deputy Manning said that those who went before us in this House were great men and I endorse those sentiments.  More than anything else they instilled confidence in the people to get on with the job in much more difficult times.  We have a lot going for us.  We have a well-educated, articulate youth.  Fifty per cent of them are under 30 years of age.  We owe it to them to do our part in Dáil Éireann.  The people must forget their own sectional interests.  We must all work together in the Dáil and outside it to create the sort of country that we would all desire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with some attention to the Minister introducing this debate.  What the Minister said in the House was a condensed version of the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.  I had hoped that the Minister would have given us a little more of the thinking behind the measures that are being taken and indeed some of the thinking behind the measures that are not being taken at the moment, which seem to be almost as important in their own way as the measures that are being proposed, and that he would have tried to show us how the Government believe the measures in this Bill conform to any plan which the Government might have for dealing with the problems which beset us at the moment and which we on this side of the House are not the only ones to articulate. We may in fact have articulated them in more detail than the present Government but the Government appear from time to time to recognise and to want to do something about them.  But we got no indication of what the strategy is.  We got no indication of how the measures proposed in this Bill are designed to meet those problems.  We have had no indication of what difference the measures proposed in this Bill would actually make to the economic situation of the country, to the employment situation or indeed to any of the other problems that would be raised by Deputies on all sides of this House during this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" /> The Minister said that he would refer briefly to the budgetary and taxation strategy which is being followed by the Government.  He went on then immediately to say that he did not intend to give a comprehensive account and that this would be contained in the medium-term economic plan which is now being prepared. I am pleased to know that the Government are continuing with the preparation of a medium-term economic plan.  This is something which we had set in motion and which we obviously need to guide our overall economic strategy for a few years ahead.  But in addition to that we need a much more urgent and fairly coherent short-term economic strategy in order to deal immediately with the major problems we face. There is not much point in having a medium-term economic plan that will on certain assumptions allow us to make progress in three or four years' time if in the meantime we have allowed the economy and the public finances to get into a state in which repair is no longer possible and in which the only remedies could be the kind of draconian remedies which everyone in this House would want to avoid as far as possible.  But to do that we need to have a fairly clear view of what the short-term strategy is.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed, although I cannot say I am very surprised, that we did not get any of that from the Minister this morning.  He did not give any brief account that I could see of budgetary or taxation strategy.  He did not even attempt to set out any element of strategy other than to refer again to one or two of the points which he set out as objectives in introducing the budget on 25 March. I am bound to say that even those bits of the budget speech that we might loosely describe as constituting strategy have on the whole been dropped from this Bill. They have been jettisoned in the period since 25 March as the Government gave in to one pressure after another, took the soft line, took the easy line of deciding to spend a few million more here, a few tens of millions more there, because to do anything else would require an unpopular decision or would simply require a decision which would have to be clearly <Col N="1414" /> motivated and clearly set in the context of an overall, even short-term, strategy for dealing with our problems.</P>
    <P>That has not been happening and we see the results of it and the gaps that are in this Bill compared with what was set out in the budget speech on 25 March.  I recall very clearly that the Minister set out in that budget speech a number of overall objectives for his budgetary policy, including a number of financial targets, and I also recall very clearly hearing the Minister say on that occasion that the budget allocations and the Estimates, taken all together, represented for this year the sum total of what would be spent by the Government on the various current and capital services concerned.  He appeared to make it very clear that neither he nor the Government as a whole would accept any outstripping of those limits during the course of the year. Whether those limits were realistic is beside the point for the moment, but it is very clear that we could not even take those words at their face value.  On every occasion when a problem arose, where there was a major protest or where the effects of decisions looked as if they might be unpalatable to one group or another the answer was not to re-look at the pattern of spending, not to have a further examination of the balance between different areas of spending.  No, the answer was simply to say they would find another £45 million, £3 million or whatever the figure involved, that they would solve the problem that way.</P>
    <P>The result of this is set out in the Minister's speech this morning so clearly that anyone with half an eye will see what he is driving at.  He spoke about a major review of departmental expenditure.  I am not sure what the result of this review will be but he spoke of it in the context of the need to find £45 million to pay for one, and only one, of the cave-ins which happened since this Government took office.  When discussing the departmental review he said it was hoped it would provide substantial savings but if there was still a shortfall on the £45 million then he would consider taxation options. In that statement he has at one stroke <Col N="1415" /> destroyed the credibility, if there was much there in the beginning, of what he said on 25 March when he tried to make us believe that the targets set out in the budget would have to be adhered to.  It is clear now that he has not got a great deal of hope that any review of departmental expenditure will provide the leeway he needs to deal with one, and I repeat only one, of the measures that have been taken since the budget was introduced.</P>
    <P>If he does not make this £45 million out of this review, he says he will consider taxation options.  This is not the first time we have asked what were these options. That question was asked on a number of occasions over a few weeks and so far we have not had any answers.  I should have thought &mdash; and I am not alone in this because the general body of opinion on this side of the House and a substantial body of opinion on the other side agree with me &mdash; that if taxation options were being considered it should be fairly clear on 9 June, almost half-way through the year, that we would have seen some reflection of them in the Finance Bill, that we would have seen some effort to define how we were to meet the targets set out in the budget, we should have seen some indication of the kind of action the Government propose to make to meet their targets.  We would have expected to see some indication of what the Government are planning to do.  But we do not see anything of the kind.  We see some elements being dropped from the Finance Bill compared with what were set out in the budget.  When will we see these taxation options?  It is blindingly clear to anyone who examines the situation and looks at what has been happening to public expenditure and revenue even since the budget was brought in that we are not going to be able to meet the targets set out.</P>
    <P>The question of when we will see these taxation options and the kind of options they are is very pertinent not only for the Members of this House but for every taxpayer.  It will be even more pertinent for the people who are the most easily <Col N="1416" /> taxed and we all know who they are &mdash; the people who pay PAYE and excise duties on the old reliables.  They are the most rapidly changeable forms of taxation we have.  If we are going to see taxation options, the question of when we are going to see them will be very important.  If we were to see them today in this Finance Bill there would be some chance that if they were new taxation options they would be able to have effect over the second half of the year, but if we do not see them now but must wait until the autumn their nature will change very substantially and very perceptibly for the people who will be called upon to provide the extra revenue for the State. At that stage we will be running out of time for collecting new taxes and the longer such taxation options are delayed the heavier they must inevitably be if they are to produce a given amount of revenue to get the Government out of the hole they are rapidly digging for themselves because of their lack of policies which has been so apparent since they came into office.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the budget targets.  From reading his speech I believe what he was doing was preparing us for the revelation which, in my view, is inevitable, at some stage fairly soon and certainly before the end of the year, that the budget targets are unattainable given present Government policies.  There was a lengthy passage about this with a number of ingenious arguments.  He said:</P>
    <P>...the quarterly figures this year do not give an accurate reflection of the trend in the current deficit.  The pattern of the deficit this year is unusual in that the budget was delayed and interest payments were higher than normal in the first quarter, while a significant proportion of the additional revenue raised in the budget will not accrue until the final quarter.</P>
    <P>We all know that.  It is a reflection which is relevant not only to the revenue activities we already know about and which are contained in this Bill but it is relevant to other revenue-raising activities which the Minister seems to be half promising us whenever the Government get around <Col N="1417" /> to screwing up their courage and showing us they meant what they said on 25 March.  We have here a couple of sentences which deal with the evolution of the deficit over the period.  The Minister said that by the end of June the deficit should be of the order of 100 per cent of the figure for a year as a whole and that this figure should be significantly exceeded by end September.  He went on to say that revenue in the last quarter would greatly exceed expenditure and we would then make sure that budget targets for the year as a whole would be achieved.</P>
    <P>In some situations, some kind of expectation might be possible, but it is my contention that starting off with a budget on 25 March, the targets of which are not on even in terms of the budget's own strategy, we cannot possibly expect, at the end of the year, that this evolution of which the Minister spoke this morning will pull the fat from the fire and leave us with any hope of achieving the budget deficit set out on 25 March.  That budget deficit was not attainable on 25 March and is not attainable now on 9 June.  It is doubly unattainable because of what has been going on ever since 25 March.  Since then we have had a whole series of new ways of spending more money, without producing any new taxation options, as the Minister called them, or actually collecting any money to cover the additions to the deficit resulting from that series of payments.</P>
    <P>A large proportion of Members of this House will not believe that at the end of the year we will have the budget deficit set out by the Tánaiste in his initial figures. Many other Members and I, as we go about our business in our constituencies, hear many people talking about budget deficits.  Most of the time what they are really saying is &ldquo;For goodness sake, stop going on about budget deficits. We do not know what those words mean and could not care less when you get down to talking about the politics of it. Tell us what you are doing for the country.&rdquo; When you talk about a budget deficit of the Minister's figure of £685 million, if I am not mistaken, you are talking <Col N="1418" /> about a situation in which the Government are spending almost £200 more per head of the population on the various services provided than they are taking in in revenue.  Without going into a deeper analysis and breaking down these figures as between different uses and different ways of financing, it simply means that the Government who are spending all this money on behalf of our population are creating a situation in which a family of four are being caused, in a real way, to have a deficit of almost £800 a year &mdash; something which they would not dream of doing if left with a choice.  If they did, they would have some reasonable plan for paying off such a debt and for ensuring that they would get something worthwhile out of it and would have planned repayments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not for a moment suggest that the Chair does.  I have been concerned to establish the point that the taxation proposals, in the form in which they are before us, are not such as to allow the Government to reach the target set as one of the objectives of the taxation measures themselves.</P>
      <P>During the course of his statement this morning, the Minister said that we must have a much more exhaustive analysis of proposals for capital investment.  It was curious that there was no reference in his statement to the famous investment programme of happy memory.  It is referred to now and again, but was not referred to this morning.  Does this mean that the Government now take the view that this investment programme to finance which the taxation levels of which we speak are necessary was an ill-judged, badly conceived programme, or perhaps one whose balance is now regretted by the Government because it is not producing the return which should be obtained for State funds invested in a number of activities? It is, above all, not producing the return which we should get in terms of employment opportunities for those now unfortunate enough to be on the dole. There does not seem to be any evidence from this Government's previous period in office, and even less from its present period in office, of any real commitment to a close examination of investment plans.  This was the case in the recent past, as evidenced by the Knock airport affair, where it was made very clear that quite a number of Members and outsiders could have proposed a number of more fruitful ways of spending money in the West of Ireland, and a number of other ways of spending State funds in the western counties which would have been of much more immediate benefit to those counties and their people.  They might have made a far bigger contribution to employment and wealth generation in that part of the country than the project now before us is ever likely to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the overall <Col N="1420" /> level of taxation, saying that it was difficult to compare levels of taxation as between one country and another.  He said:</P>
    <P>The general indications are that our overall tax revenue is set at a reasonable level.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to parse in detail a statement like that.  It may not have been written to be parsed in great detail.  However, I assume that the Minister there meant that, in relative terms, the total burden of taxation on the individual in this country is comparable, in terms of the proportion of his income taken, with that in other European countries.  From the few brief inquiries which I have been able to make in the meantime, that appears to be the case.  That is probably what the Tánaiste was referring to.  I make the point, made also by the Minister, that it is difficult to compare tax burdens as between one country and another.  We are probably comparing a relative tax burden in this country, as he was doing this morning, with the tax burden in other European countries where, in fact, real income levels are higher than they are here, where there is a wider tax base than we have here.  I think the Minister mentioned this morning that our tax base is rather narrow &mdash; thanks largely to a number of decisions taken by his own Government during their previous term of office.  We are comparing that with a similar level of tax burdens in other countries which have a far lower rate of inflation than we have.  All these seem to be relevant factors if we are talking about the burden of taxation and what it does to the individual's disposable income, to his real income and what he can do with the money he actually gets in his pay-packet or cheque.  I think we have come pretty near saturation point in taxation. The Minister seemed in one way to share this view although he put it in a very conditional sense.  He went on to say: &ldquo;More fundamentally, however, there is now a wide imbalance between the levels of expenditure and revenue.  Either expenditure is too high or taxation is too low&rdquo;.  I do not think anybody would pretend today that taxation is too low; we must then conclude that expenditure is <Col N="1421" /> too high.  The Minister himself said: &ldquo;If the overall level of taxation in the broadest sense has virtually reached its maximum potential,&rdquo;&mdash; which I consider it practically has &mdash;&ldquo;then the only conclusion is that the level of Government expenditure is too high and must be reduced and policies must be directed to this end.  There is no other option&rdquo;. Those were the Minister's words here this morning.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that he disputes the notion that public expenditure is out of control.  It seems to me that if we have got to the point where the Minister concludes that we have probably reached an excessive level of taxation and that there is no option but to reduce public expenditure then public expenditure cannot be regarded as being firmly under the Government's control.  The antics we have seen since last March indicate to me that there is very little commitment to control in the kind of policies the Government have been following.</P>
    <P>The terms in which the Minister spoke of his major reviews of departmental expenditure do not give rise in my mind to any real expectation that firm action will be taken to deal with this problem or that there is any firm commitment to examining in any fundamental way where we can begin to look for solutions to our problems.  I find it slightly hopeful that the Minister has at least recognised the existence of this problem in what he said today.  Over the weekend I had occasion to reflect on the relationship between the levels of taxation we have here and the levels of public expenditure that go with them, and on some of the destinations of public expenditure, and I ask the Government and the Minister to have the courage to look again and in some depth at the implication of what the Minister said today.  If he really means what he says, that we now have no option but to look into the overall level of public expenditure, then the sooner we start doing that the better.  Are there services that the State today provide for individuals which might perhaps be more effectively provided by the individuals themselves? Are there services the State provides which could more effectively be <Col N="1422" /> provided by some other agency, by private business, by co-operative ventures, by community services set up and run by the community?</P>
    <P>We should look at these questions because unless we do we shall have no leeway for looking in any real sense with any prospect of success for any rationalisation of the tax burden under which we all suffer today, a burden which has now got to the point &mdash; I think there is general recognition of this &mdash; where our taxation system has become a disincentive to work and in some cases the combination of our taxation and social welfare systems has become an even greater disincentive to work and where in my view we are almost literally taxing people out of jobs.  If the Minister really meant what he said I ask the Government to go more deeply into those questions because unless we do we shall not get out of the problem which the Minister almost defined this morning; it is a pity he did not go all the way and set out the problem in its true colours so that we could set about dealing with it.</P>
    <P>As regards specific measures in the Bill I would first refer to sections 13 to 16 where we have a number of amendments concerning taxation of farm profits, a good old traditional bureaucratic phrase. The word &ldquo;profit&rdquo; is not one you often hear used in rural Ireland these days.  I commend the Government on deciding to retain the measures in relation to the provision for two instalments for the payment of farmers' income tax, the provision in relation to stock relief and the provision regarding rates which we had already provided for in our budget proposals of 2 January.  I am glad those measures have survived in what the Government have put forward and I hope that that view of farm incomes is one that will continue to be reflected in the approach to income taxation as long as we have the very serious income problem that now persists in agriculture.</P>
    <P>I refer also to section 17 and the resource tax.  In fact what is contained in this section is a provision that a resource tax will be refunded.  The resource tax system has already been abolished.  Both the abolition of resource tax and the refunding of amounts already paid were <Col N="1423" /> measures we had provided for in our January budget and I am glad these measures are retained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides for bringing forward the date of payment of corporation profits tax.  This measure together with the provision for the imposition of VAT at the point of entry of goods into the country constitutes and will impose a very serious burden on manufacturing industry of all kinds.  It creates a new burden for every industry that in the course of its production uses imported products.  It is a very serious step and the combination of that and the earlier date of payment for corporation profits tax will create very serious liquidity problems for a number of firms.</P>
    <P>I should like to read a statement made by the present Minister for Education on 16 February last.  He said that in their recent statement the Director General of the CII asked for clarification of Fianna Fáil proposals to raise VAT on imports where applicable at the point of entry as they would relate to manufacturing industry.  He went on to say that the main purpose of these proposals is to tighten up on importers who evade this tax and to reduce discrimination against home-produced goods thus helping our balance of payments.  He said it was not intended that the proposal should harm the export sector in any way and that it was envisaged that Irish firms importing materials for further processing and re-export would be able to avail of a procedure similar to the inward processing concession. He said it was the intention also to introduce a scheme which would provide working capital to industry at the lower interest rates which at present apply to capital investment.</P>
    <P>The Minister concluded by saying that the overall objective of the Fianna Fáil proposal would be to reduce rather than increase the cost of financing the working capital needs of industry.</P>
    <P>How did that turn out in practice?  The result was very different as many Members of this House can illustrate by way of reference to the situation of a number of firms, some of whom are importing goods to be used in the manufacturing of <Col N="1424" /> products for re-export and some of whom are importing goods to be used in manufacturing products for the home market. The problem remains the same but if anything there is a more flagrant imposition on firms who import goods to be used in the manufacturing of products that are to be re-exported.  There is one firm who have made representations to me and to the Minister and who reckon that on foot of the VAT changes alone, their borrowing requirements to finance the earlier payment on VAT will be increased this year by at least £300,000 and possibly by up to £500,000.  That means that in order to pay their tax bills as a result of this proposal in the Finance Bill, that firm will have to find that sort of money and will have to carry the cost of providing it without getting any return for it.  This is a cost that will have to be incurred without any contribution being made towards maintaining employment in the firm, let alone increasing employment. I have written to the Minister for Finance in regard to this firm but so far he has not replied.  The firm import most of their raw material from abroad and they export 80 per cent of their products.  Having discussed the matter with people in that firm, who in turn have discussed it with the Revenue Commissioners, it appears that it is not possible for them to find a way of using the inward-processing arrangement that the Minister for Education referred to on 16 February.  Even if the firm were to try to equip themselves so as to be able to take advantage of those arrangements they would have to incur extra capital costs.  I do not see the logic in our present situation, with unemployment continuing to rise, of putting firms into the position of having to borrow extra money in order to meet their tax bills and in which, if they were to try to avoid the worst effects of what the Government are proposing, they would have to involve themselves in further capital investment just to equip themselves to use what appears to be the only way for a firm re-exporting a large proportion of their imported products.  I do not see any logic in that sort of situation and neither do the firm in question see any logic in it.  There may be many <Col N="1425" /> workers in this firm who will be made redundant at some stage during this year because of the company not being able to meet this extra financial cost while maintaining their present level of operation. The Minister for Social Welfare will not see the logic of the situation when he finds so many more people seeking social welfare benefits as a result of being thrown out of work because of this proposal and it may be that many people will lose their jobs because of what is being proposed.</P>
    <P>To introduce such a measure at a time of such serious difficulty constitutes either total irresponsibility on the part of the Government or total desperation on their part to the extent that they are unable to make any of the other choices that they should make about the use of public funds while they must inevitably find increasing funds to finance the sort of situations that this kind of proposal may result in.</P>
    <P>As I said here on other occasions, the budget of March 25, apart from anything that has happened since in the way of extra concessions that may now have to be covered by taxation options as was indicated by the Minister this morning, raised £56 million more in indirect taxation than will be raised by all of our proposals up to 27 January.  This is being done in a way which in one respect at least will be downright inimical to employment and which cannot but have the effect of creating even greater difficulty for the maintenance of existing jobs.</P>
    <P>Section 28 gives effect to the tax provisions involved in the special rescue package for farmers which the Government have implemented since 1 April and which I negotiated with the Associated Banks and the ACC during our period in office.  It is stated that this section makes provision for the taxation arrangements that are required in relation to banks <i>vis-á-vis</i> that scheme but while the Bill may contain that provision I doubt very much whether any adequate provision is made to ensure that the scheme will have the effect it was intended to have.  Specifically we had set aside in our budget proposals a sum of £4 million to cover the <Col N="1426" /> direct cash cost of operating that scheme this year.</P>
    <P>The Government's provision for the scheme is £1,500,000.  That is not designed to cover the cost of the tax concession to the banks.  Perhaps I should use the word &ldquo;arrangement&rdquo; because it is an arrangement, a means of channelling a reduction in interest rates to the farmers concerned.  It is abundantly clear that the figure being set aside will not be sufficient to finance that scheme this year. On a number of occasions during the budget debate as well as in other places I have asked the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance how they justify the reduction in the provision for financing that scheme.  Neither of them has given any answer on that point.  Neither of them has said anything about any other provision being made to ensure that the scheme can operate.  No one has said why that reduction of £2½ million was made or how it is proposed to ensure that the scheme will operate this year on that reduced provision.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government find out later in the year in this case, as in many other areas, that the provision they made for the scheme in the budget is totally inadequate and will give the lie to what the Minister for Finance said on 29 March about sticking to the targets he set out.  I hope the Minister will give an answer to that and tell the House how he thinks he will get away with financing that scheme with £1½ million.  I challenge the Minister to say, if that £1½ million is inadequate, as I know it to be, how he will make sufficient provision to cover the scheme. There are enough problems in the operation of that scheme and enough difficulties in trying to ensure that assistance goes to the people for whom the benefit of the scheme was intended without creating extra difficulties by not granting sufficient finance for the scheme.  The Minister, when Opposition spokesman on Agriculture, was in a great hurry to make sure that the scheme got off the ground.  I told him then that it was my intention to ensure that we did not rush into a scheme that was badly thought out and that we would make sure we got it <Col N="1427" /> right.  We did get it right and it is generally recognised that the scheme will meet the objectives we set out.  However, it will not be helped by a scandalous under-provision of funds.</P>
    <P>Section 37 provides for the exemption of capital gains on the sale of some small sites.  That provision was included in our proposals in January.  Our intention was to ensure that the new provisions on capital gains tax did not constitute a burden on the many farmers who unfortunately find themselves in the position of having only one answer to the financial difficulties they face&mdash;to sell, if they can, one or two sites on their land for the building of houses.  It is deplorable that they should find themselves in that position but since they are, our view was that they should not be taxed on any gain they would be fortunate to make out of the sale of sites. I am glad that provision has been carried into the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal a little more in depth with the specific provision in regard to this in the Bill.  The figure of £15,000 should be examined in the light of average site values throughout the country and in regard to the size of the financial problem being encountered by many farmers.  I am sure many Members are aware that it is possible to find small farmers with debts amounting to £50,000 or £60,000, not to mention the type of debts to be found on medium and large farms.  I should like to see that figure looked at in the light of considerations such as the average value of sites for building and the gravity of the income problems being encountered by farmers.</P>
    <P>Section 75 provides for an increase in the flat rate reimbursement of VAT to farmers from 1.5 per cent to 1.8 per cent. That is designed to ensure that compensation is made to farmers for the increase in value-added tax on those farm inputs now subject to VAT.  It is the proper way to go about this because value-added tax was not designed to fall on production.  It is one which falls in the end on consumption, as we all know very dearly to our cost.  This is another measure that was taken from our proposals of 27 January but the figure should be kept under <Col N="1428" /> review.  Since the introduction of VAT there have been arguments from time to time that the level of the refund was not adequate to cover the amount of VAT being borne on farm income.  It is essential that the figure be kept under review so as to ensure that the overall reimbursement of VAT into the farming sector keeps pace with the total amount of VAT going out.  This is important in regard to farmers who are not registered for VAT.</P>
    <P>Section 85 is another provision that is carried over from our proposals of January.  It exempts the transfer of land to young farmers from stamp duty for a two-year period, a measure which is generally appreciated by all sides.  It was designed to encourage the earlier transfer of land to younger farmers and people who have a greater and more direct interest in getting maximum production from the farm.  I am not saying that the person from whom the land is being transferred was not interested in good farming but many of them have reached the stage where they deserve a rest after a lifetime of work in agriculture.  The measure is designed to make land more mobile.  We made the proposal to exempt such transfer from stamp duty for two years to see the effect a defined opening in the tax system would have on stimulating the mobility of land.  I have great hopes that the measure will effect a new surge of mobility of land during that period.  If it does we will have achieved something worthwhile in modernising the structure of our agriculture and in ensuring that we have a greater degree of utilisation of capacity in regard to our agricultural resouces.</P>
    <P>I note the that Bill maintains our proposal to increase the relief for agricultural property for the purpose of calculation of capital acquisitions tax to £200,000 or half of the market value of the property, whichever is the lesser.  The measure was designed to respond to the kind of difficulties that exist in the farming sector and to the need to ensure that the capital we have tied up in agriculture is used to the best advantage.  It was also designed to ensure that the maximum proportion of available capital in agriculture was <Col N="1429" /> ploughed back into development and the expansion of production.</P>
    <P>Compared with the budget of 25 March a number of points have been omitted from this Bill and the Minister glossed over this matter this morning.  He galloped fairly quickly through it and he ventured only the remark that the cost of the omissions would not amount to more than £2.5 million.  I am rather sceptical about this.  He did not go into any great detail or identify the makeup of this £2.5 million.  Even if he had done so and we could take that figure at its face value, I would go along with Deputy Bruton who said that to look at the effect of it this year is not going anything like far enough.  What will be the effect of it next year or the year after that?  That is a question which we could well ask about the whole body and shape of this Finance Bill.  What will be the effect in 1983 even if we were to make a completely unwarranted assumption that we will arrive at the targets which the Minister set out in his budget proposals?  Even if we were to reach at the end of the year the targets which the Minister set out in his budget proposals &mdash; which I do not believe is possible &mdash; what situation would we find facing us at the beginning of next year with the effects of the budget proposals of 25 March and the series of cave-ins we have had since then, with the effects of this Finance Bill and particularly with the pernicious effects that the early payments of corporation profits tax and the imposition of VAT at point of entry will have on employment?</P>
    <P>Let the House mark my words: they will have an effect on employment right across the board, not just in the firms immediately involved but in all the other firms involved with those front-line firms, if I may so call them.  It will be passed on in their costs.  It will be passed on in the cost of what whose firms sell to other people, to farmers, to other businesses and to consumers.  What situation will face us in 1983?  When we find &mdash; as we will and I take no pleasure in it &mdash; that the financial targets set out are not reached we will face a very difficult situation at the beginning of 1983 when we come to draw up the 1983 budget.  We <Col N="1430" /> will find that difficult situation whether or not the Minister gets around to some of these famous taxation options that he is talking about to cover the £45 million he mentions, which is only a small part of the extra problem that has been created over the last couple of months.</P>
    <P>Very difficult choices will have to be made and we will face them under a Government who have shown again since 25 March as they showed during 1980 and in the first half of 1981 that their principal first reaction to any problem is to run away from it as fast as ever they can. They may be able to identify the trouble as was done at the beginning of 1980 and as the Minister nearly managed to do this morning but, having identified it, they run away from it.  It is very critical that we do not run away from those problems now.  Unemployment is still rising, our agricultural industry is suffering from three years of decline in income, and great pressure is on every single industry, on manufacturing industry whether it is selling on the home market or particularly if exporting.</P>
    <P>We face the problem that the Minister himself hit at glancingly during the course of his speech.  The burden of taxation is making it extremely difficult to employ people in any sector.  I am not talking about just the situation of the employer running a small busines and employing ten or 15 people.  I am talking about larger firms, about agriculture, agri-business and service industries.  What is to be our response to that?  Our response for the sake of our productive sectors right across the board should be to look again very carefully at how the Government are spending taxpayers' money.  It must not be to say every time a problem comes up that we will spend another £45 million but to say, if we need to spend another £45 million to solve that problem, that there must be something else which has a lower priority, and we should look at that and re-balance our public spending.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that a great many people all around this country would take the same view and if they believed that the object of Government policy was to find fair and more efficient ways of spending taxpayers' money they would have some <Col N="1431" /> assurance that the sacrifices that they make in handing over taxation from their pay packets, in the price of their petrol and in the price of the goods they buy, was to some avail and that reasonable use was being made of that taxation they they were obliged to hand up.  If we do not get to that point we will have increasing discontent, increasing unreadiness to shoulder the burden and increasing resistance to taking the kind of measures that we need to take if we are to do what Governments should do for the people of any country, and that is to direct their affairs wisely and fairly in a way that will command the respect if not always the agreement of the people who pay the piper at the end of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this Finance Bill indicates clearly our Government's determination and will to achieve a proper balance between reduced borowing needs and improvement in employment.  The commitment by our Government to achieve a fairer system of taxation should meet with approval by all, not only in this House but in every household in this country. The setting up of the Commission on Taxation, which is representative of the many different interests within our community, is a major step forward and we all look forward to the first report of that commission which I understand will be published very shortly.</P>
      <P>This Bill contains many new and interesting features.  In particular I would like to refer to a few very welcome features in relation to progress in the fields of health, the environment and agriculture. I will begin in this, my first contribution in this House, by complimenting the Minister on his increased allocation, which will come as a direct result of the adoption of this Finance Bill, towards the many areas and departments which are greatly in need of being salvaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer in particular to the area of health.  As a member of a health board I am fully aware of the capital input from Government in the field of health and I am conscious of the problems of health boards in budgeting for capital <Col N="1432" /> spending and community care.  I am also aware of the difficulties that arise towards the end of the year, and sometimes only halfway through the year, when health boards find that there is a shortfall and they are faced with major decisions.  They usually find that the only area they can trim is community care.  Schemes which suffer most are those for home helps, transport for the needy, the old, the sick and the under-privileged.  People living in remote areas find that services are suddenly halted.  These are the people who cannot speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>This problem became very acute following the cuts announced last year by the Coalition Government.  We were told that these cuts were in the interests of the economy but we must be very careful in our deliberations of this Bill not to take any steps or advocate any measures to deprive people of essential facilities.  The cuts last year in capitation grants from £8 to £1.80 had a disastrous effect.  These cuts resulted in hospitals such as Saint Mary's in Mullingar and the Sacred Heart Home in Ballinderry refusing to take patients from our area, leaving no outlets for patients who wanted to move to convalescent homes.  The hospital in Navan is overflowing and the admissions waiting list is growing every day.</P>
    <P>Our geriatric hospital services are in a worse situation because cuts made in last year's budget would not allow the employment of more staff to look after patients.  Forty women patients are awaiting admission to St. Joseph's Hospital in Trim.  We provided a 20-bed ward some 12 months ago but owing to the embargo on staff recruitment imposed by the Coalition Government we were not allowed to employ the staff to run the ward.  The beds are empty while people in north Meath cannot gain admission to St. Joseph's.  I urge the Minister to do something about this matter as quickly as possible.  He should lift this embargo and provide the service which is so badly needed.</P>
    <P>The Government must adopt a new approach to the provision of facilities for the old and needy by building more welfare homes in isolated areas such as north Meath.  Geriatric patients may be given <Col N="1433" /> great care and attention but when they have to move away from their own areas they suffer very much from loneliness.  I urge the Government and the Minister for Health to examine the matter of community care and to involve local communities as much as possible in the care of the aged by providing welfare homes in isolated areas.  Such homes are not as costly to run as hospitals because fewer drugs are used and fewer nursing staff are required.  I urge the Minister to remove this embargo and to staff our hospitals fully, with special emphasis on St. Joseph's Hospital in Trim.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for Finance for the injection of £900,000 to our board to salvage the community care service.  It provided much needed capital for this most important service.</P>
    <P>The capital cash injection into the environmental section is to be lauded. This will provide badly needed capital for industry and will provide much needed employment.  The spin-off industries such as furniture and bedding which are experiencing great difficulties will get a boost. In the opinion of many people this country has done quite well regarding the provision of housing in the past 20 years but much remains to be done.  I should like to thank the Minister for the Environment for allocating to our county council last week an additional £400,000. This will provide an extra 100 houses in County Meath, bringing the total number to over 200 for this year.  The reintroduction of the provision regarding income tax relief on mortgages, the £1,000 grant for a new house and the help proposed for single people are worthwhile.  It will end discrimination against single people and thanks are due to the Minister.  Many single people had suffered because of the decision of the previous Government and the measure proposed by this Government will be most welcome.</P>
    <P>Much needs to be done with regard to our road network and the provision of an extra capital allocation is most welcome. This is a Government of the plain people of Ireland.  While we have undertaken to provide better communications throughout the country in the matter of highways, we must not neglect the county roads and <Col N="1434" /> lanes.  I appeal to the Minister to provide money to preserve rural Ireland.  We must widen country lanes and tar county roads and make them usable for the people in the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>I live in an area close to County Cavan which is regarded as under-developed but I can assure Members that parts of Cavan are much more developed than many northern and western parts of County Meath.  I ask the Government to make further approaches to our partners in the EEC to declare such areas as under-developed. In that way we could get the benefit of money from the Social Fund that is being poured into the west and the north west.  The land is not much better and in some cases it is not as good as land in our neighbouring counties even though our grants are 20 per cent lower.  This tends to have a detrimental effect on people who have worked hard to develop our county.</P>
    <P>There are many small industries in my area and I welcome the approach of the Government in giving further incentives to such industries.  They have been one of the most efficient and trouble-free sectors in the community and are very suitable for rural areas.  There are many towns, villages and even parishes which have small industries employing from 10 to 30 people.  They help considerably to preserve the rural community and they deserve our support and encouragement.</P>
    <P>We have major problems with regard to water and sewerage facilities.  I come from a county known as the rich county of Ireland.  Yet, when I discuss with my friends here the progress made in the west, north west and in the south with regard to the provision of group water schemes I find that we have been left far behind in County Meath.  While I must stress that we have one of the best county councils in the country, we must ask ourselves what is wrong.  The truth is that to provide group schemes it is necessary to have proper regional water schemes and we are lacking this in County Meath.</P>
    <P>In my own area there is a water scheme which caters for Oldcastle which must be 60 years old.  In the town of Kells we are taking water from the river Blackwater which is prone to pollution and there are <Col N="1435" /> doubts about the amount of lead in the area.  For years a scheme has been in the course of preparation for Kells and Oldcastle and that scheme is now with the Department and has been for some time. I would ask the Minister for the Environment to sanction that scheme as quickly as possible and let the water flow in north Meath and give the people an opportunity to provide group water schemes across that area.  In the town of Kells which is only a few miles away from me probably one of the most scandalous developments that was ever allowed to take place in any county was the granting of permission by a Minister for Local Government over the heads of Meath County Council to build a large estate, which has left us with a problem that we may not solve in our time; there are no worthwhile sewerage facilities to take the effluent from this estate.  I would ask the Government to implement the Kells sewerage scheme as quickly as possible.  It is necessary that the east Meath water scheme be provided as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I have dwelt on a few areas perhaps at a distance from the Finance Bill that is in front of us but I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will forgive me for taking the opportunity when I was on my feet for the first time here to highlight some of the problems that face the people in the areas I represent.  People are looking forward to the adoption of this Finance Bill so that Fianna Fáil, under our leader Deputy Charles Haughey, will undertake the works that I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>There are many challenges for the Government.  I particularly welcome the injection of finance that will be used in the fight against crime.  This fight must not alone continue but escalate.  I congratulate the Minister for Justice on the stand he has taken and I wish him well. I hope he weeds out the drug pushers and the racketeers.  The people welcome the initiative that is being taken.  But we as a Government should call on the good people of Ireland to support the Garda in their efforts to stamp out crime and racketeering.  It is great to see the gardaí on the beat in such numbers as one walks <Col N="1436" /> through the city of Dublin and other towns.</P>
    <P>There are other challenges facing our people which are too numerous to mention. But let me mention one before returning to the Finance Bill.  We must not let our people be overpowered by outside influences.  I know we must advance and develop.  But we must retain our national culture and ideas.  I compare our country today with what it was when I was a child, when we had a happy family home, very little money in our pockets, plenty of hard work, not too many of the niceties of life.  Yet we had a happiness then that is not so evident today.  In our homes we see canned entertainment, the depiction of violence, murder and drugs. The spillover of what we are seeing in our own homes is evidenced on the streets of Ireland today.  I would urge the Minister involved to replace a lot of these programmes with good national programmes, more Irish dancing and Irish music.  We should promote our culture. It is a national disgrace that over a number of years hotels across this country have been provided with Bord Fáilte assistance and grants and do little if anything to promote Irish dancing and Irish culture.  I would like to take this opportunity to voice disgust that that is allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>I heartily welcome the 5 per cent increase in long-term social welfare benefits in addition to all the little things that mean so much to people, for example, the television licence, free travel, free fuel, all introduced by Fianna Fáil and all going to people who, in many cases, had no opportunity to ask for them.</P>
    <P>There is a boost to young farmers. Stamp duty on gifts of land to young trained farmers is being removed for a two-year period and to avail of this concession which will apply from the date of enactment of the Finance Bill a farmer must be under 35 years of age when the deed of transfer is executed and be in possession of an appropriate training qualification.  It is hoped that this concession will go some way towards ensuring that land will pass more quickly into the hands of those who are best equipped to work it with maximum efficiency.  This is <Col N="1437" /> a good thing because for too many years land was not being utilised, cultivated or stocked properly.  The day has gone when the calf born the same day as the younger son was still on the farm when the son made his confirmation.</P>
    <P>We have entered a new era in farm development.  Everybody knows farmers have gone through a lean time and any help we can give them is worthwhile.  I was delighted when the Minister first announced that VAT would be imposed on imports at point of entry and I have not changed my mind since.  I realise we do not produce all the raw materials we need, but we should ask ourselves if the food we eat and the other commodities we buy are made in Ireland.  There are firms who import raw materials to produce foods here which they re-export, and I am sure the Minister will look at this section and give help where it is needed.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and wish him well.  I know he will deliver the goods.</P>

      <P>The Chair congratulates the Deputy on his maiden speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I endorse your compliments to Deputy Lynch on his maiden speech?  His politics were admirably sound, but I am not so sure about his economics.  I agree with the thrust of his social views but on specifics we might disagree as to the amount of Irish dancing that should be shown on television or in our hotels.  He made an eloquent case for the difficulties his constituents are experiencing in many facets of their lives and sought the Minister's help, and the help of the Government, to alleviate those difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy Lynch and most people on that side of the House avoid doing is giving consideration to why these difficulties are with us and to such a degree. Many of our present difficulties have not arisen by accident but are the unfortunate result of deliberate Government policy, commencing with that first great package of promises and strokes which is now being so roundly condemned by people <Col N="1438" /> who were in Government and were actively involved in delivering that package&mdash;the 1977 manifesto.  It set the country's economy on a course of derailment and was prevented from an actual crash in July last year by a harsh but unavoidable and absolutely necessary supplementary budget.</P>
    <P>If that budget had not been introduced the economic consequences for this country towards the end of that year do not bear thinking about.  Devaluation would have been unavoidable and that, in turn, would have brought with it, not immediately but inevitably and quickly, immense problems of unemployment and economic stagnation.  If those corrective measures had not been taken last July and these horrific economic consequences were allowed to happen&mdash;and they were inevitable&mdash;they would have had severely dangerous social repercussions in the sense that there would have been very nearly a collapse of certain services to which the country has become accustomed and which it needs in order to function efficiently as a modern democratic economy.  These services would have ground to a halt.  It is unthinkable that something like that would have happened but there would not have been enough money in the kitty in the last quarter of last year to pay the Garda and the Army.  That is the type of serious problem that confronted the Government when the supplementary budget was introduced last year.  Things had deteriorated to that appalling extent that we were going to have on our doorstep that kind of ludicrous scenario we read about in emerging badly managed Third World countries.</P>
    <P>That position was avoided because corrective measures were taken.  They involved fairly harsh doses of taxation but there was a general acceptance of the need for them.  To obtain that acceptance and the willingness of the public to accept those harsh measures, it was necessary to spell out why they had come about and what the consequences would have been. Having regard to the diet of promises and strokes, the avoidance of facing up to reality, the brushing aside of problems that had marked the conduct of public <Col N="1439" /> affairs not just for months but for years before that, there was a remarkable maturity and willingness on the part of the people to accept the need for this sudden change and the harshness of those measures.</P>
    <P>Every responsible economic commentator recognised that things were at a serious pass, that urgent remedies were needed and agreed that for those remedies to be effective there had to be a drastic change in national thinking. There had to be new attitudes towards Government spending, finances and expectations generally.  These new attitudes could be procured only by the unvarnished telling of the harsh truth.  If that was gloom and doom, it had to be spelt out.  Avoiding the harshness of reality will not make the problems go away. For too long part of our approach in Government has been to hope problems will go away if we refuse to mention them, or recognise their existence.</P>
    <P>The supplementary budget of last year was necessarily only an interim measure. The corrective measures which it introduced should have been continued in this year's budget.  In the proposed budget of 26 January that policy of correction was being continued in the way necessary. Unfortunately, that budget failed and a further budget was introduced on 25 March which made significant changes in the tone of the earlier proposals &mdash;changes which had the objective of masking the hard realities facing our economy and, once again, giving the impression that things were not as bad as the gloom and doom merchants had been preaching, that there was room for a few more promises.  That was the tone of the second budget.  It took over and continued many of the features of the budget which fell.  Indeed, Deputy Lynch has paid tribute to some of those features.</P>
    <P>The Minister this morning did not give a comprehensive economic statement. which is understandable.  He did, however, say that the Government's principal concern was to achieve a proper balance between reducing our borrowing needs and improving employment.  In that <Col N="1440" /> statement he concurs with the views of the Central Bank as contained in their annual report published last month.  The Central Bank set out the primary and immediate objectives of present economic policy to be to correct the imbalance in public sector finances and to see a rapid re-orientation of public capital expenditure towards the most productive purposes possible and, allied with that, to improve the competitiveness of Irish industry and services.  There is agreement between the Minister and the economists in the Central Bank as to what the objectives should be.  This budget is the instrument whereby we go towards meeting those objectives.  The general tone brought by the budget to our financial regime enables us to judge how serious the Government are about attaining those objectives.</P>
    <P>First of all, let us consider the objective of bringing our public sector finances into balance.  The Minister states that at the end of March the deficit was 58 per cent of the projection for the year as a whole, which was in line with expectations, that by the end of June the deficit would be of the order of 100 per cent of the figure as a whole and that this figure should be significantly exceeded by the end of September. The Minister, however, is optimistic. He reckons that this year, because of the late budget and the new taxation proposed on imports, there should be a flush of money particularly in the last quarter of the year, which will rectify the position and that we will end up on target as defined in the budget.  I must question yet more of the vague projections, these nice optimistic hopes of the future which have categorised so much of the Fianna Fáil approach to public finance over the last few years, all the time looking for some vague expectation, with a conman's optimism that something will turn up to avoid the evil day.</P>
    <P>The Minister is laying great store, particularly, on the income which the new VAT on imports will produce.  There must be a number of question-marks as to whether or not his optimism is justified, firstly as to whether the level of imports will continue at the same rate and in the same volume.  This is a two-way <Col N="1441" /> weapon.  If they do, our balance of payments problem will not significantly improve, unless of course our exports perform better.  On the other hand, if they do not come in, then the VAT returns will not be made.  I think imports will be depressed, mainly because of a tendency on the part of importing firms to minimise orders to the greatest degree possible so as to lessen this new burden of value-added tax which they will have to pay at point of import.</P>
    <P>We are told that there is a considerable liquidity crisis in Irish business.  If one believes what one hears while going about the country, that is so.  Every person in business is finding it difficult to collect the money owed to him or her, which must inevitably lead to a cash shortage, a liquidity crisis.  Firms in that position will keep as low as possible the demands on their cash resources.  Their cash flow will be down and, if they see this huge, new and unexpected liability for VAT at point of import, they will try to minimise that liability to the greatest degree possible, particularly when they know that they must either pay for it out of scarce cash flow, or else borrow at more than 20 per cent the cash needed to fund these imports.  Obviously, there will be great pressures on importers to keep their volume of imports as low as possible. This, in turn, will dampen the buoyancy in the expected revenue from this new source.  If that happens&mdash;and I think having regard to what I said it is a reasonable scenario and something likely to happen&mdash;the Minister's optimism that there will be a flush of money in the last quarter-year from this new tax will be shown to have been misplaced and a serious error of judgment will be made in so far as the balance that we want to move towards as between income and expenditure will get even farther away, with all the adverse economic and political consequences that must bring.</P>
    <P>The other difficulty facing the Minister, and which leads me to be sceptical about whether he and his party and Government have learned anything from the economic situation in past months, is the way in which he proposes to deal with the £45 million cost of the changes in the <Col N="1442" /> PRSI which he introduced earlier in the year.  That concession will cost £45 million and the Minister says this has to be made good and he hints that it may be got as a result of a major review of departmental expenditure which has been recently completed and the results of which are being evaluated in his Department. I do not know if the review involves having a look at the services provided for in this year's Estimates, services that the country needs in order to continue functioning, or whether it is an examination of the operation of Government Departments with a view to effecting economies in the normal meaning of that word so far as our personal budgets are concerned. The Minister is a bit short on information there.  If it is his hope to effect economies in operation so as to save £45 million I genuinely wish him every success, because there is room for more economical operation of the public service in a myriad of small ways.</P>
    <P>For example, I asked a series of questions of every Government Department on what was the cost of photocopying in each Department, and the aggregate of all the answers comes to almost £1 million. That was my experience and it is a small thing but it is indicative of what could be done.  In my experience if one asked for a copy one never got one, but two or three.  In what other areas of operation in the public service is there room for simple small savings in the way the system operates?  It may seem nit-picking to take something apparently as trivial as photocopying, but when the cost is £1 million and the Minister is trying to save £45 million and is looking in a difficult area, he must look at everything.  If there are other ways for economising &mdash;and there may well be&mdash;I would guess that it would be some time before they could be implemented and result in an appreciable financial gain to the Exchequer. The Minister might get some gain this year but it will still leave him a long way short of £45 million.  On the other hand if he is looking at departmental expenditure in the sense of looking at the provision for the services being provided by various Departments I would regard that with some foreboding.  I can assure <Col N="1443" /> the Minister&mdash;and he must know&mdash;that the Estimates were examined in the greatest detail with a view to cutting down the Government's liability as much as possible.  This was a long and tedious process undertaken by the previous Government and the final Estimates were, we felt, the very minimum that had to be provided without on one hand causing disemployment or on the other curtailing or ending services the country needs to continue functioning efficiently.</P>
    <P>There is a limit to what one can cut off Government spending on State services, because if that limit is reached there can be serious unemployment.  One could argue that some unemployment resulting from non-essential services might have to be tolerated in the name of efficiency, but that is taking up a very arguable stance.  If one in cutting Estimates goes beyond the limit unemployment can result, and also if one goes beyond that limit services which are essential or which are perceived by the public to be essential may have to be curtailed to an unacceptable extent.  I am very sceptical about the Minister being able to get any part of this £45 million from cutting back on the Estimates for services.</P>
    <P>He says that if there is still a shortfall on the £45 million he will consider taxation options.  The Minister knows as well as I do that without any shadow of doubt there will be a serious shortfall in his efforts to try to obtain the £45 million.  If he sticks to his opinion as in his speech he will have to consider taxation options, but if he runs true to the form of his party he will avoid the harsh taxation option and we will find the deficit expanded and borrowing increased.</P>
    <P>The Minister in order to assume a veneer of financial responsibility says that if there is still a shortfall he will consider taxation options.  If the Minister were serious about implementing taxation to meet the shortfall this is the Bill in which he should do it.  I do not think he is serious.  I think it will be the old Fianna Fáil game of avoiding the hard option, of taking the easy way out, letting the deficit expand and borrowing an extra few million pounds.  If I were a betting man I <Col N="1444" /> would have a fairly substantial bet that that is what will happen, because the Minister's shortfall problems do not end with the £45 million here.  Apart from the fact that his whole deficit looks like going completely out of kilter for the reasons I indicated earlier he is also faced, as he says himself, with £2.5 million this year to meet the changes which he is making for the benefit of some taxpayers in the announcements he made in March when he introduced his budget.  For that he will have to find £2,500,000 but he has not indicated where that will come from.  The old magic reliable of revenue buoyancy is already accounted for in the budget figures.  It will be very interesting to see if that buoyancy is achieved.  In any case, the Minister cannot look to that source either for this amount or for the £45 million in respect of PRSI.  But, of course, there is one further figure which the Minister must try to find also arising out of his budget and which we thought might have been provided for in the Finance Bill, that is, something to take account of the concessions made to the building societies in terms of tax foregone to enable them to maintain their interest levels.  I do not know how much that amount is but perhaps the Minister will let us have the information when he is replying.  I have a vague recollection that it is in the region of £8 million to £10 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not even go so far in regard to that amount as to say that he will consider taxation.  He does not even attempt to spoof us when including that in his targets of saving on capital or Government expenditure.  I am very suspicious that the Finance Bill for this year is something of a con job.  It is not implementing the budget as it was introduced to us and it makes no provision for the changes that have occurred in the meantime.</P>
    <P>I am apprehensive about the eventual outturn in the nation's finances at the end of this year.  The first reason for this apprehension is that the deficit will be fully realised while the year is only half through.  The Minister's optimism for a flush of money in the last quarter of the year is misconceived and erroneous.  It is <Col N="1445" /> a careless and invalid assumption, one that cannot be substantrated on any argument. To attempt to rely on it in a budget speech is very near fraudulence.  It is reckless and would stand up to the terms of the criminal law definition of fraud.  However, this would be entirely in keeping with the budgetary approach of the party opposite as exemplified in the budget they produced in 1981.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has been giving most speakers a mild reminder that the Finance Bill is somewhat different from the budget speech and has been encouraging them to stay with the question of taxation rather than to be returning to the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but I am making the point that the Finance Bill does not implement this year's budget.  It does not provide for the taxation to meet what was provided for in this year's budget.  I am making the point also that in regard to the Minister's speech introducing this Finance Bill his expectations, his prognostications and his assumptions bear no relationship to reality.  There is precedent for this and, as I have said, that precedent was in last year's financial mismanagement.  That, too, is the point I am making in relation to this year's Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The other area concerns the need for prudent investment of capital expenditure towards the most productive purposes possible.  That is what the Central Bank say and the Minister says it also in his speech.  I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Borrowing for capital purposes must be viewed in a different light.  I am not advocating unrestricted borrowing for capital development as this would be entirely wrong.  We must be selective but we must at the same time be prepared to borrow at a substantial level for sound investment projects which will strengthen our economy and provide a worthwhile return in due course. I want to emphasise the need for greater selectivity.  There is a growing concern that much of our capital investment in the past has failed to <Col N="1446" /> produce an adequate return and we must be more cautious in future about the uses to which this borrowing is put. In short, there will have to be much more exhaustive analysis of proposals for capital investment.</P>
    <P>These are impeccable sentiments, sentiments of financial rectitude that must command universal approval.  We must totally agree that scarce and dear capital must be invested in such a way as to get the maximum return for it.  But one can only be puzzled at this stage of this nation's development as to why it is necessary to re-assert in such strong terms what is in effect an economic truism. Nevertheless, it is re-asserted here and not for the first time has it appeared in Government speeches, in White Papers, Green Papers and other discussion documents.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister meant it or was it just a trite economic truism put into his speech.  I have grave doubts that the Minister meant what he said and the reason for these doubts is that I do not believe any Minister could make such a statement in such unequivocal terms and remain a member of a Government who are prepared to continue with the development of Knock Airport &mdash; the Connaught Regional Airport.  I invite the House to consider the acronym for the Connaught Regional Airport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment. It is sad that I must avail of this opportunity to deal with the closure of Fieldcrest Limited of Kilkenny which, as announced today, will take place on <Col N="1447" /> Monday next.  That will be a sad day for Kilkenny and the country.  The announcement by the receiver today that it was the intention to close this factory on Monday marks the worst disaster to hit Kilkenny since the famine, In fact, the closure is a greater disaster for Kilkenny than the closure of Ferenka was for Limerick.  When the factory closes on Monday the dreams of 650 employees will be shattered.  Only two years ago many of those people left secure employment in foreign countries to return to Kilkenny.  Others left other parts of Ireland and put their faith in Fieldcrest. They put their trust in that concern by taking out mortgages to purchase new houses in the city, replacement loans and by moving their children to new schools. Now they have been pushed aside and dumped on the unemployment scrap-heap. They are not entitled to any redundancy payments and realising that the number of unemployed in Kilkenny has more than doubled in the last two years, the prospect of alternative employment for those people is grim, bordering on hopeless.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister in the course of his reply to the debate to give an explanation of the IDA involvement in Fieldcrest.  Two years ago the company commenced trading having received £12 million from the IDA and now the IDA state it is not a viable industry.  It has been stated by the IDA, the Minister, Fieldcrest staff and management that the company was not managed and that sales promotion was a disaster.  The sales office was located in London and reported to America trying to sell Kilkenny towels. Why was this situation allowed to develop and continue?  I should like to know why Fieldcrest (America) were given a 51 per cent stake in the company for £2 million against an investment of £12 million by the IDA.  Why was Irish taxpayers' money used in this fashion? The Minister should institute an inquiry into IDA development and investment in the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At many meetings held in recent months I stated that the company had not received an opportunity to prove itself. <Col N="1448" /> There is a highly skilled staff available and they can guarantee efficient production. The product is of the highest quality and the world is its oyster with regard to sales.  The Minister should give the company the opportunity the people of Kilkenny wish it to be given.  The Minister should step in and take over the commitment to the banks so that the company can remain in production.  That would justify the confidence placed in it by the IDA two years ago.  I do not know what has changed in two years and taxpayers are entitled to be told why £12 million was invested in the company during a recession.  Nothing has changed since. The country is still in recession.  There is an obligation on the Minister to carry out an inquiry as to why the investment has been wasted.  The Minister should give an explanation why taxpayers' money was spent in this fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment because I am not satisfied that the Government have done everything possible to save these jobs.  I am not satisfied that the Government have investigated all aspects of the matter.  The decision to close the factory is wrong and will cause severe hardship.  Earlier today the Minister told the House that already he had managed to delay the closure for three months.  During that time the plant was examined by prospective buyers and it was only last week that it became clear that there was only a remote chance of such industrialists taking over the plant. If the Government lived in the hope up to last week that they would succeed in attracting a foreign interest to the factory it is an indication of the scant consideration the matter was given by them.  The Government should play their part in regard to the factory and fulfil some of their obligations to the workers who have invested heavily in moving to the area. Many of them moved their families from foreign countries and remote areas of Ireland to join the staff.  We may hear a lot about what this firm or that bank put into this industry but the fact is that 640 people invested their future in the plant. They made heavy commitments by way <Col N="1449" /> of housing and so on to take up jobs there.  It is the human factor in this debacle that I am concerned about.  It amounts to a human or social earthquake in the Kilkenny region and neighbouring counties of Carlow, Tipperary and Laois.</P>
      <P>Why should the most innocent party in this whole affair, the workers who invested most, bear a greater loss than any other investor in the plant?  The views of the workers have not been taken into consideration.  We must remember that the plant attracted the most experienced and efficient workers in the textile field. Most of those are still in that plant and they feel that their suggestions as to how the present difficulty can be overcome have not been listened to.  In fact, only yesterday the representatives of each of the sections of the workforce came to meet the Minister and put their views to him.  Up to about a week ago we were all led to believe that there was a good prospect that some outside buyer would take over this mill.  The Government and all the other parties should then have entered into very serious discussions with the people who run the mill and have run it from the word go and who know better than anyone else the problems and the solutions to them.  We are asking the Government to help out in order to keep the mill going and to give that most important group, the workers concerned, the opportunity to prove themselves.  We have had many similar examples in this country.  One is the Tuam sugar factory which the all-party Oireachtas committee said was not viable.  The Minister of the day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a point in conclusion.  What is wrong with Kilkenny?  We saw one example in Tuam, which the all-party committee here said was not viable.  The sugar company themselves said it was not viable, yet the Government, rightly so, for social reasons decided to keep Tuam going.  We are asking the Minister for the same <Col N="1450" /> reason to keep Kilkenny going and give it a chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Crotty and Deputy Pattison for allowing my colleagues and me to contribute to this debate which concerns us all as Deputies from Carlow and Kilkenny.  This is the most serious catastrophe that has befallen Kilkenny city and county and the area generally that we can recall, as Deputy Pattison said, since the famine.  The people that it affects most are the workforce and it is worth remembering that the average age of that workforce is 24 years.  It is worth remembering too that a great many of them left secure jobs in England and elsewhere to come home to Kilkenny and, in the belief of security in their own city, they invested heavily in housing, schools and other things.  Now the world they had envisioned has ceased to exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What can one say of the judgment of the authority who told us two short years ago that this was the most modern factory in Ireland?  The buliding itself and the machines in that building appeared to the untutored eye to be the last word in modernity. They were the last word in heavy expenditure too on the part of the IDA acting on behalf of the Irish taxpayer, the person who contributed the money. Messrs.  Carroll contributed also, as did the Bank of Ireland.  What has happened in the meantime is that now we hear the story that this factory is obsolete.  Was it wrong in the beginning or has it become wrong since then?  There may be an answer but whatever the answer is, the people working there have lost out because their investments in the future have gone.  The Government have a very serious obligation to the workforce in Fieldcrest Kilkenny which cannot be shirked.  The Government were ready to meet similar obligations sometimes with unorthodox methods, in other areas where there were closures.  If ever there was a case for unorthodoxy in a rescue this is the time for it and I hope that such will be attempted by the Government.  I could recite a number of cases where special measures were taken to rescue workers who were affected by closures, <Col N="1451" /> but I do not wish to recite them.  We cannot contemplate the sudden discharge of all these people in a city the size of Kilkenny which has a population of approximately 15,000, a goodly proportion of whom would certainly become disemployed.  The secondary employment which comes to the town from other areas has gone, too.  I appeal to the Government to get their priorities right, to remember what is important and what will wait.  Earlier, before the debate changed, there was reference to another project which could well wait a while. This one cannot wait.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my voice to what has been said by my colleagues in the House because I bear with them concern for the workers who have worked in this mill in Kilkenny.  Over the years I have had the highest regard for the IDA, but it is now time for the Minister to take a look at this sudden change.</P>
      <P>Who was wrong at the time this mill was started in Kilkenny?  Why have things changed so drastically in the short time of a year and a half or two years since it was officially opened?  With all the efforts that have been made and the people who have shown interest in coming to look at that plant, now we are told that it will close next Monday at the cost of something like 630 jobs in the area not alone of Kilkenny but also of Carlow and the adjoining counties.</P>
      <P>In the limited time I have I make this last-minute appeal to the Minister to bring pressure on the Government to ensure that this plant is kept in operation in order that futher efforts may be made to get somebody to rescue the jobs for these workers in the plant, to keep the plant going so that at least it can be sold as a going concern, and to safeguard the livelihood of these people and their families.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a member of <Col N="1452" /> Kilkenny County Council in 1977 when the application was made by Fieldcrest to start the building of a new plant at Kilkenny.  At that time it gave new hope to the people of Kilkenny and many people moved back into the area because they were influenced and encouraged by the fact that the major partner in the company, that is Fieldcrest America, were experts in the towelling world.  They were joined by the cream of Irish industry and Irish business, namely, the Bank of Ireland and Carrolls Limited whose reputation is among the best in this country. The IDA were prepared to put forward grants of £12 million.  People moved in from various parts of the country.  They left secure employment and came to Kilkenny in the hope that their future would be secure.  They purchased new houses, taking out mortgages, and they felt that certain of their future.</P>
      <P>However, we are now told suddenly that the Fieldcrest factory is no longer viable and that we must lose 650 jobs.  I do not doubt for a moment the Minister's sincerity in saying that the present setup is not viable, but, as Deputy Crotty has said, this factory has been operating in a time of depression, it has never had a proper chance and it was in the first instance expected to lose money for a number of years, I think until 1983. Reports have been made on the future of the plant which said that the plant was viable.  I fail to understand now why this factory is allowed to close down.</P>
      <P>I make a last appeal to the Minister that he recommend to the Government than an emergency plan be put into operation whereby the Government would take the place of the banks to ensure that the plant is kept in operation at least long enough to ensure that a suitable partner is found who will come into that firm to ensure the future of the 650 people involved and of Kilkenny city and county as a whole.  It is not alone 650 people but also the trade of Kilkenny city and the spin-off industries which are dependent upon Fieldcrest in Kilkenny. I hope the Minister will put forward some form of emergency plan to ensure that Fieldcrest can be kept in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said today at Question Time.  I very much regret today's announcement by the receiver that the Fieldcrest plant is to cease production.  I regret it because of the human problems that are created for the workers, and in that regard I share fully the concern expressed by the Deputies who have spoken.  I also regret it because of the setback it represents to the community in Kilkenny and to all who worked hard at local level in the local authorities and elsewhere to create the right environment in which it was hoped that Fieldcrest would have thrived.  I regret it too because of the setback it represents to our industrial development and to what we had hoped would be a successful partnership between an outside company and two of our major enterprises, Carroll Industries and the Bank of Ireland.</P>
      <P>In my reply today to the Private Notice Question by Deputy Crotty and the subsequent supplementary questions, I made it clear that despite intensive efforts by the IDA it has not been possible in the three months since the receiver was appointed &mdash; incidentally, the same day on which I took office &mdash; to find a buyer for the assets on a going-concern basis. More than 100 companies were contacted by the IDA, including 12 who had the marketing expertise which is so essential to the success of this venture.  Representatives of many of these companies visited the Kilkenny factory but they all concluded that there is not a market for the quantity of goods being produced in Kilkenny.  The essence of viability in any industry is to produce a product with the right quality for the market and at the right price.  These are the elements which are basic to viability but they are the elements which are totally missing in this operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Intensive efforts were made by the IDA at international level to save this plant.  We fully realise the tragedy involved in the loss of these jobs but I do not accept that it is a total failure.  It is a setback.  It is not reasonable to suggest that we should put people to work on a product which is being sold at a substantial loss.  Losses to September 1981 <Col N="1454" /> amounted to £10 million and have now reached £14 million.  That is the size of the problem.  The capacity of the plant was geared to 85 per cent and it was producing 60 per cent of top quality products.  There was never any question about the production capability of the plant or the workforce.  The market could not take the product and nobody was prepared to pay the price for it.  That is the essential problem of this plant.  This project was put together by Fieldcrest, who had a very well-known name in the US, in partnership with Carroll Industries and the Bank of Ireland.  Many people were attracted to set up home in the Kilkenny area and undertake financial obligations when they gained employment in this plant.</P>
    <P>I have asked the IDA to consider introducing new product ranges to supplement the towel operation and make the plant viable.  It is unreal to suggest that we should pay people to work at producing a product which is not marketable.  The plant is very fine but we must secure sustainable employment there.</P>
    <P>Everybody had hoped that this partnership would be successful but the necessary market penetration was not realised on the scale needed to sell the vast quantity of goods produced at Kilkenny.  This is the fundamental problem and we must now look for a different proposition.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to give the background to the setting up of this industry. On 22 July 1975 the proposal was approved by the then Government and on 30 January 1976 a revised grant package was approved.  In the spring of 1976 there was continuing uncertainty that the project would go ahead but on 30 April 1976 Fieldcrest advised the Minister and the IDA that they intended to go ahead. On 16 August 1976 Fieldcrest reported that the project was likely to be postponed indefinitely but in that month they sought a joint venture partner.  A partnership with Carroll Industries and the Bank of Ireland was put together early in 1977 and the revised grant package was approved by the Government on 24 May 1977.</P>
    <P>The projected market penetration was <Col N="1455" /> not achieved.  To what degree this can be attributed to the recession is an open question.  I share the concern of Deputies but they are asking the Government to enter the field of international marketing in order to sell a high-quality product. That is not realistic.  It is not physically possible for a Government to become involved in selling towel products in a concentrated European market.</P>
    <P>The realistic approach is to look at the project as it is and to try to attract people who will enlarge the product line and establish sustainable employment.  This is precisely what the IDA are doing.  I am fully aware of the problems and solutions must be found but the Government should not be asked to do what companies who are very experienced in the marketing field cannot do.  We must find sustainable employment in the area and I regard this development as no more than a setback.</P>
    <P>Reservations have been expressed about the research carried out when the project was proposed.  All the information was placed before the Government on the dates I have indicated and they <Col N="1456" /> made their decisions.  There is always a risk in business and this venture did not succeed.  We must come to terms with this failure and replace it with an industry which will provide sustainable employment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of members of all ranks of the Garda Síochána assigned to stations in Cork city in each of the years 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1982 was as follows: 31 December 1979, 466; 31 December 1980, <Col N="1272" /> 484; 31 December 1981, 499; 30 April 1982, 498.</P>
    <P>The precise arrangements made for the allocation of manpower between foot patrols and other duties in any particular area are matters for the Garda officers concerned.  The number of gardaí on foot patrol in Cork city varies considerably from time to time and depends on factors such as available resources, local circumstances, other demands for Garda services and the time of day or night.</P>

The Garda authorities have informed me that the present opening hours of the station have been so fixed as to enable the station party to carry out the maximum amount of out-door police duties while maintaining an adequate office service.  They consider that an extension of the opening hours would not be feasible at present having regard to the current strength of the station party but the matter will be kept under review according as the additional manpower at present in training becomes available for assignment.</P>
      <P>Foot and mobile patrols are performed in the Shandon area by members of the station party at Shandon up to 11 p.m. each night.  When the local station is closed, the area is covered by foot and mobile patrols performed by members operating from other Cork city stations which are open on a 24-hour basis.</P>

    <P>The figures for interest payments outside the State include payments to non-resident holders of Government gilt-edged stock.  The 1982 estimate for these payments is based on the level of debt at 31 March 1982.</P>
    <P>The figures for capital repayments do not include small savings and very short-term liabilities such as Exchequer Bills which are being constantly rolled over.  The estimate for capital repayments in 1982 is based on debt outstanding at 31 March 1982.</P>
    <P>The national debt figure for end-March 1982 is an estimate.  It is not possible to provide a national debt figure for end 1982 because of differences between nominal and cash values of Government stocks, because the make up of Government borrowing as between domestic and foreign currencies is only decided from time to time during the course of the year and because of fluctuations in exchange rates.</P>

      <P>Unestablished civil servants are insured for the full range of benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, including occupational injuries benefits. Established civil servants are insured for a much more restricted range of benefits including reduced occupational injuries benefits.</P>
      <P>On the specific question of retirement due to illness or injury, the general position in regard to civil servants is as follows.</P>
      <P>An established civil servant who retires on grounds of ill-health after at least five years pensionable service qualifies under the civil service Superannuation Code for a lump sum based on actual service to which is added a period of notional service, usually of six 2/3 years.  Pension is calculated on the basis of 1/80th of pensionable salary per year of service, including notional service, subject to a maximum of one-half of salary.  The lump sum is calculated on the basis of 3/80ths of pensionable salary for each year of service, including notional service, subject to a maximum of one-and-a-half times salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> An unestablished civil servant who retires on grounds of ill-health qualifies for similar terms except that pension is reduced to take account of any social welfare benefit or pension payable to him.</P>
    <P>If the officer's retirement is due to an injury incurred in the actual discharge of his duties, and the injury is specifically attributable to the nature of the duties, ill-health pension can be enhanced, depending on the degree of disability suffered up to a maximum of 5/6ths of salary, inclusive of the annuity value of the lump sum and, in certain exceptional cases, a lump sum of up to £20,000 or, if greater, 3½ times salary, is payable.</P>

      <P>With a few exceptions, which apply in strictly limited cases, persons engaged in the carriage of road freight for reward are required to hold road freight certificates under the European Communities (Merchandise Road Transport) Regulations, 1977 and 1981, which give effect to EEC Council directive No. 74/561 on admission to the occupation of road haulage operator.  Interested persons in the first instance need to be holders of or entitled to certificates of competence in the haulage business before applying for road freight certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case mentioned by the Deputy the person concerned was stated to be presenting himself for an examination conducted by the Chartered Institute of Transport, success in which would entitle him to a certificate of competence.  Pending the result of that examination, which is expected early in July, I am unable to consider an application for a road freight certificate.  Unfortunately there is no provision <Col N="1298" /> in the Community Instrument and Implementing Regulations for grant to the person concerned of a provisional road freight certificate nor, according to the information available to me, for his securing a certificate of competence other than by examination test.  The only possibility under the regulations for meeting the competence requirement is on the basis of the person concerned employing someone satisfying the competence and other relevant requirements of the regulations, to continuously and effectively manage his road transport business.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of disability benefit since September 1981.  Payment issues to him at regular weekly intervals and he is required to submit medical certificates only once a month.  He was admitted to hospital on 9 March 1982 but, as the Department were not aware of this, benefit cheques continued to issue to his home address for the period to 17 April 1982.  On 20 April 1982, following his discharge from hospital, he reported that he had not received all his benefit payments which had issued to him in March and April.  A list of the cheques which issued was sent to him and when he indicated the cheques which he had not <Col N="1326" /> received and signed the standard form of indemnity replacement cheques were issued to him.</P>
      <P>There was no intention at any time to be discourteous to the claimant.  He was not kept waiting in the Public Office, Oisin House, for any period longer than was necessary for the completion of the inquiry.  It was necessary to obtain details of the cheques which he did not receive while he was in hospital before replacement action could be taken.  The replacement cheques were issued promptly on the receipt of this information.  If he had notified my Department of the position prior to his admittance to hospital the necessary steps would have been taken to ensure that all payments would be directed to him at the hospital.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been claiming disability benefit continuously since 2 January 1981.  He was paid up to 31 August 1981, after which date payment was disallowed following examination by a medical referee of my Department who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He was again examined on 19 February 1982 and was also considered capable of work.  He appealed against the decision and a further medical referee's opinion was obtained.  On this occasion the medical referee considered him to be incapable of work and the claim was allowed from 19 February 1982. Arrears of disability benefit due from 19 February 1982, less supplementary welfare allowance advanced, were issued on 10 May 1982.  Further weekly payments are continuing on receipt of medical certificates at monthly intervals.</P>

In the event of illness, however, and in the absence of insurable employment in this country since his return the UK authorities are the responsible authority and application for payment of sickness benefit should be directed to the Department of Health and Social Security, Overseas Branch, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. However, if he obtains insurable employment in this country and subsequently becomes ill or unemployed my Department would then be empowered to utilise his UK contribution record for the purpose of dealing with his claims.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was visited by an Officer of my Department on 3 June 1982 who advised him about his eligibility for certain services of my Department. He subsequently lodged a claim for unemployment assistance on 3 June 1982 at his local Employment Exchange.

At that stage he had been in receipt of disability benefit for 52 weeks and it was necessary to review his claim to decide if he was entitled to further payment. His claim from 9 February 1982 was governed by the 1980-81 contribution year and as he had less than the required <Col N="1333" /> minimum of 26 contributions, paid or credited, in that year he was not entitled to further payment.

      <P>The regulations regarding entitlement to invalidity pension provide that, apart from satisfying the contribution conditions, the claimant must be permanently incapable of work.  A person is regarded as permanently incapable of work if he has been certified as incapable for a continuous period of 12 months and is likely to remain so incapacitated for at least a further year.  The person concerned has been incapable of work only since 15 February 1982.  He is not, therefore, regarded as permanently incapable of work at present and he is not qualified for transfer to invalidity pension.  However, if he continues to be incapable of work until 15 February 1983, his entitlement to invalidity pension will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>Following inquiries by an inspector of my Department it has been ascertained that the claimant was in fact employed during the 1980-81 contribution year but that her employers had failed to pay the contributions due.  Special credits have, however, been awarded which have the effect of qualifying her for benefit. Accordingly a cheque for the amount of disability benefit due from 19 January 1982, fourth day of incapacity, to 4 June 1982, was issued on 8 June.  When details of her earnings in 1980-81, the relevant tax year, are available pay-related benefit, if due, will be paid.</P>

Payment was discontinued after that date as she had not made reasonable efforts to obtain maintenance from her husband, who now resides and works in Cork city.  In addition, she had declined to disclose information regarding her means.  Deserted wife's allowance is a means-tested payment and in order to establish if a woman is qualified to receive the allowance it is necessary to <Col N="1354" /> have full details of her income from all sources.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 27 February 1982 but was not entitled to payment at that time as, according to the records of my Department, he had not the required minimum of 26 contribution weeks of insurable employment since his entry into insurance.  Following inquiries, it was established that he had additional contributions which had the effect of qualifying him for payment.  A cheque in payment of all disability benefit and pay-related benefit due to 12 April 1982, after which date he resumed work, was issued to him on 4 June 1982.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for unemployment assistance in December 1981.  Following the necessary inquiries by the social welfare officer, the applicant's means were assessed at £28.85 per week, derived from self-employment. Payment in this case was inadvertently delayed due to the papers being mislaid in the post.  However, all arrears due were paid on 15 April, 1982, and the applicant is currently in receipt of £29.10 per week.  This is the rate appropriate from 31 March, 1982 to a married man with two childern, residing in a rural area with means of £28.85 per week.  The applicant has appealed against the assessment of his means, and his entitlement to unemployment assistance will be <Col N="1355" /> reviewed in the light of the decision of the appeals officer.</P>

      <P>NET received a total of £6 <Col N="1360" /> million in repayable advances from the Exchequer in the early sixties for the construction of the fertiliser plant at Arklow. Under the Nitrigín Éireann Teoranta Act, 1970, £3.5 million of these advances was converted into share capital. The remaining £2.5 million is repayable (with interest) to the Exchequer by NET over a 25-year period, which commenced on 1 January 1971: the total principal repaid to the Exchequer at 31 March 1982 was £1,796,000.  At 31 March 1982 NET's total medium- and short-term borrowings amounted to approximately £177 million.  The bulk of these borrowings is from the commercial banking institutions.</P>
      <P>The issued share capital of NET at 31 March 1982 is £77.5 million.  Apart from a qualifying share held by each of the directors, all of the share capital in NET is held by the Minister for Finance.  In 1980, NET applied for £90 million in additional State equity in order to restore its capital base.  In May 1981 the Minister for Finance took up additional shares amounting to £50 million in NET.  The balance of the company's application for additional share capital remains outstanding.</P>

      <P>The Government are concerned about the financial position of NET and in particular the very high level of the company's losses in recent years. <Col N="1361" /> However the financial performance of the company is improving.  Under a new chairman and a new managing director, NET are tackling their major problems and further progress is essential if the company are to have any prospect of viability in the future.  NET have already withdrawn from a number of unprofitable activities, organisation structures and manning levels are being reviewed, consultants have been brought in to advise on various aspects of the company's operations and the technical performance of the plants has been dramatically improved.</P>
      <P>Following the provision of additional equity of £50 million to NET in May 1981 and partly on foot of recommendations contained in the report on NET by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on State-Sponsored bodies, the Government decided to establish an inter departmental committee to consider options for the future of the company.  The committee will be reporting to me soon and the Government will then consider what policy should be adopted towards NET in the future.</P>

      <P>The delay in payment of this grant was due to the apparent absence of a notification of completion of the works and a claim for payment.

Payment will accordingly be made if and when an inspection confirms that the works were satisfactorily completed on or before 30 June 1981.  The inspection will be carried out shortly.</P>

      <P>I understand from Dublin Corporation that the six houses in question are Nos. 21-26, inclusive, Orchard Lawns, Ballyfermot, which were built by the Ballyfermot Housing Co-operative Limited.  The residents of the houses paid amounts ranging from £7,215 to £7,733 to the co-operative in respect of the purchase of the houses from the co-operative.  These houses are built on land owned by the corporation and the site fines amount to £1,300 per house.  The corporation have not received payment of site fines in respect of these houses and accordingly they cannot transfer title to the occupiers involved.  Payment of the site fines to the corporation is a matter for settlement between the occupants of the houses, the co-operative and the corporation.</P>
      <P>I have no power to authorise the corporation to dispose of the sites in a manner other than that provided for under the Housing Regulations, 1980.  On payment of the site fines, the corporation will make arrangements for payment of the approved SDA loans to the house-holders concerned.</P>

      <P>This scheme was constructed as a private water scheme without State aid.  Following its completion the group made application for State grants.  The scheme was investigated by the Department's engineer but the source is considered to be inadequate to serve the houses involved.  I understand however that a scheme known as the Dunmanway Road group water supply scheme is being organised in the area and it is hoped that the members of the Derrygrea scheme will be able to secure a satisfactory water supply by linking with this group.  In that event I would sympathetically consider the possibility of allocating group water scheme grants in respect of the houses at Derrygrea.</P>

In such cases the regulations require the person to furnish a medical certificate indicating that he/she is no longer fit for work.  The matter is then referred to the chief medical officer and the Department of the Public Service with whom the ultimate decision to sanction the retirement on ill health grounds rests.  Subject to the approval of that Department being forthcoming, pension and gratuity entitlements are calculated and paid without delay.</P>
      <P>The case referred to by the Deputy is currently with the Department of the Public Service and their decision in the matter is awaited.</P>
