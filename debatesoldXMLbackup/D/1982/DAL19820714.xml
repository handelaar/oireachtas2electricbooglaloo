      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 4, 15, 5, 16 and 17 (resumed).  There will be no Private Members' Business today but business will be interrupted at 7 p.m. to complete the Second and remaining Stages of the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Bill, 1982, and by agreement the Supplementary Estimate being introduced this morning will be disposed of before item No. 15 is taken.</P>

      <P>You disallowed a question of mine on the Adjournment yesterday.  I understand the reasons were that the implications of the question I suggested for the Adjournment were too great for a half hour discussion and you suggested, through your office, that I place a substantive motion before the House dealing with the subject of Deputy Mitchell's interference with the Garda.</P>

Consequent on this, very substantial increases will occur in the rents of many tenants. Section 23 of that Bill makes provision for the preparation of regulations by the Minister for Social Welfare to grant allowances to tenants who suffer hardship as a result of the coming into operation of the Bill in question.  I would like to know whether the Minister for Social Welfare has prepared these regulations and whether it would be necessary to bring them before the House or what the position is in regard to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is concerned with allowing the committee on commercial State enterprises to investigate the activities of Údarás na Gaeltachta, which is not a commercial State body.  It is a body which administers grants on behalf of the State and does not purport to make a profit.  I have been seeking at every available opportunity, both in Opposition and in Government, so far without success, to have a committee on non-commercial State bodies established.  There are approximately 60 such bodies spending between them between £800 million and £1,000 million. <Col N="2311" /> Údarás na Gaeltachta is only one of these bodies and it is only because certain allegations have been made that some of that money, a relatively small amount of the total spent by non-commercial State bodies, has been mis-spent that it is now being decided that the remit of the committee on commercial State bodies should be somewhat artificially extended to encompass Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>When dealing with a motion to establish the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored bodies, I raised the need to establish another committee to deal with the activities of the non-commercial State bodies who cannot be questioned by way of parliamentary question about the money they are spending because the Minister claims he has no direct responsibility. If such a committee were in existence it would be a much more appropriate vehicle to investigate Údarás na Gaeltachta than a committee concerned with commercial State bodies.</P>
      <P>It might be said that the problems, if problems they are, in relation to Údarás na Gaeltachta would not have arisen in the first place if there had been a committee supervising them during the past five or six years.  Many problems have arisen in the non-commercial State bodies because of lack of proper supervision by the Oireachtas.  Many complaints are made about civil service interference but if such interference and political direction from this House saves State funds from being misappropriated, it is eminently justifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A committee should be established to investigate in an on-going way the non-commercial State bodies.  I pressed the Taoiseach hard on this issue when the other committee was being established and he indicated that he was favourably disposed to this suggestion but did not give any specific commitment.  This is the first and very apt opportunity of raising the matter again.  I hoped that either the Minister for the Gaeltacht or the Minister for Finance, who is more <i>au fait</i> with the general supervision of State spending, would indicate whether and when a committee on non-commercial semi-State bodies would be established.  If such a <Col N="2312" /> supervisory mechanism existed some of the problems which may exist in regard to Údarás na Gaeltachta may not have arisen or some of the allegations made about Údarás na Gaeltachta may not have been made because there would have been a mechanism to have the problems investigated.  I hope that the Ministers will be able to indicate some further progression in the Government's consideration of this matter and that they will confirm that such a joint committee will be established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Baineann an tairiscint seo le comhchoiste a bhunú chun scrúdú a dhéanamh ar Údáras na Gaeltachta, ach mar fhreagra ar an iar-Aire caithfidh mé tagairt a dhéanamh don díospóireacht ar an 30 Meitheamh nuair a cuireadh an cheist chéanna ar an Taoiseach. D'fhreagair sé ar an ócáid sin go raibh sé ar intinn aige an comhchoiste seo a bhunú agus go mbeadh sé lán sásta go mbeadh agallamh idir na hAoirí i leith na dtuairimí atá noctaithe ag an Teachta agus a nochtaíodh ar an ócáid sin.

      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said but there is a case for proceeding a little further.  This motion proves the case for the establishment of the type of committee I have in mind.  I had hoped that either the Minister for the Gaeltacht or the Minister for Finance would have been able to go a little further, in the light of the experience of which this motion is evidence, than the Taoiseach went on a previous occasion.</P>

The Government have had notice since the last occasion and I would have expected the Minister to go a little further and not simply to quote the Taoiseach.  I again appeal to the Minister for Finance, who is probably quite interested in this matter, to indicate if such a committee will be established.</P>

We are spending a substantial sum of money here in the administration of our own affairs, yet we are carrying out those in accordance with procedures which we inherited from the Houses of Commons and of Lords at Westminister in the early twenties. Indeed, both of those institutions have reformed themselves in the meantime, but we are still, broadly speaking, following procedures inherited from them, unreformed, in the early twenties.</P>
      <P>Clearly, expenditure of additional sums of money to enable Deputies to do their work more effectively &mdash; with which this Supplementary Estimate is concerned &mdash; is justifiable but only really justifiable if that is accompanied by an increased constructive output from the Members of this House.  Unfortunately the procedures of this House render such an output very difficult.  We need to have established here substantially more committees to investigate not just legislation but also the administration of public funds.  I raised an example a few moments ago in the Minister's presence in regard to a committee on non-commercial semi-State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also need committees in regard to legislation which would enable outside bodies, many of whom write long and detailed letters to each of us as Members of the House, to present that evidence orally in regard to individual pieces of legislation before a select committee of the House.  We need to show the public at large that they can have an input into the doings of this House.  Unfortunately, there are insufficient mechanisms for taking evidence from outside bodies.  I would hope, in respect of all major legislation, that a committee could be established <Col N="2315" /> with a very limited period of operation, perhaps three weeks, whose responsibility it would be to take evidence from outside members of the public on a particular item of legislation coming before the House, so that those who have something to say about legislation are not forced into simply writing cyclostyle letters to all 160 Members &mdash; some of whom reply, some of whom do not, but most of whom do not read the representations received for understandable reasons, because they have a large number of other things to read.  If a select committee could be established to receive these representations orally and cross-question the people on the case they are making, the legislative process would be much more relevant to the nation as a whole. Unless we succeed in doing that, people will question, in increasing numbers, the relevance of this House to the government of the country.  They will see that, in fact, many of the decisions are taken outside the country, or are certainly taken outside this House by the Government who come in, under normal circumstances, and present their wishes to the House and have them passed without a change of a line or a comma, simply by exercise of the Whip.  That process certainly has a debilitating influence on our democracy and forces the Opposition &mdash; whichever opposition it happens to be &mdash; into a purely negative oppositional role because it has no constructive opportunity to contribute, apart from the limited opportunity afforded by Committee Stage debate on Bills, to the better government of the country.</P>
    <P>If we want our economic problems to be solved they must be solved ultimately with a broad measure of agreement (a) about the facts of the problems on both sides of the House and (b) by a measure of agreement between most or all of the parties on the measures to be taken to solve them.  We must recognise that the problems facing us at the moment are so deep and severe that the measures to be taken to solve them will put our democracy to the test.  We must reform this House to enable those decisions to be taken in an open fashion, whereby <Col N="2316" /> people will see why they are necessary and they will not be seen just as the evil machinations of the Government of the day &mdash; whoever they happen to be &mdash; acting irrationally to damage people's living standards, as seems to be the way in which issues are presented to the public, not because governments are a necessary evil, but because of the unreformed character of this House which does not afford an opportunity for issues wherein possible areas of agreement could be reached to be teased out in a rational fashion between all the Members of the House.</P>
    <P>I must congratulate the Minister on having reacted positively to the proposals made by the previous Government in regard to the financial business transactions of this House, but would hope that he would also take an interest, as he is now moving this motion, in the issue of Oireachtas reform to reform the entire way in which this House does its business.</P>
    <P>We must also reflect on the fact that speeches here &mdash; and perhaps my own is an example in this instance &mdash; can be too long.  This is so because there is not an opportunity in this case for a to and fro discussion.  If a Member speaks once, he or she cannot speak again on far too many items of business.  The assumption is that by allowing people to speak only once this will shorten the debate.  In fact, the opposite is the case.  If people are told they can speak once for an hour, they make absolutely sure to speak for an hour, the debate will take far longer and be far less constructive.</P>
    <P>We should try to do our business by the system which applies in New Zealand where people are allowed to speak a number of times but at no time for more than about five minutes on a particular item of business.  This allows for a type of Committee Stage discussion, with people speaking on a point, getting an answer on that point, moving later to another point and so on.  They have what is a normal dialogue situation in regard to the different issues.  Our present system sends everyone to sleep and everyone out of the Chamber, because there is no chance of another Member getting in on the debate.  I speak for an hour and there is a Member over there waiting to <Col N="2317" /> speak for an hour and another, in his turn, waiting to speak for an hour.  That takes up three hours, so the remainder of the 160 Members can go to their rooms because they know they will not have an opportunity to speak for those three hours.  It is no wonder that people in the public gallery are disillusioned when they see that the House is almost empty.  Much tighter restriction on the limit of speeches, but the capacity of speaking more frequently on particular items, would lead to a much more natural and normal debate in the House, which would be to the advantage of the Government as well as to the Opposition, would not slow up business but would make the House more relevant.</P>
    <P>We must also look hard at our system of voting.  Every time we vote we waste 20 minutes ringing bells and going through the lobbies.  I know that the Committee on Procedures and Privileges is anxious to do this &mdash; we should seek a way of voting, possibly electronic, but obviously tamper-proof, because one could not have a system with which one could be enabled to vote in another person's name or steal other Members' keys and so forth.  This would not consume such vast quantities of valuable and expensive parliamentary time.  I hope that will be given some priority.</P>
    <P>I should like to see at the earliest possible opportunity radio and television broadcasting of all the proceedings of the House.  Up to now I was hesitant to favour this because I was anxious that we should start by broadcasting committees. Committees get insufficient press publicity, and one way of rectifying this would be to bring radio and television into committees first so that they would get an enhanced profile.  However, the danger of the House becoming irrelevant to the nation has become so acute that we will have to go the whole way if we are to restore public confidence in and understanding of what we are doing.  Experiments in Britain show that the public perception of the value of the House of Commons has been enhanced by the fact that the House is broadcast.  We should learn from that experience.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2318" /> In regard to committees, I should like to see hearings by committees held outside of Dublin.  We need to bring the Legislature to the people.  One way would be to have committees hold hearings on subjects which are relevant to particular areas in those areas.  If, for example, we had an agricultural committee there is no reason why it should not hold hearings in the West when dealing with problems which relate to the West. If, for example, it was dealing with industries in Cork there is no reason why a committee sitting should not be held in Cork.  That would get away from the them and us situation which people have who live outside the capital.  They feel the capital expresses an undue influence.  If we brought the Oireachtas into the country we would do a lot to bridge that gap and it would help Members to do their work more effectively.  It would stop us from seeing problems solely through the eyes of our own constituencies.  One opportunity we have to visit other constituencies in a serious way is during by-elections. Although this is a valuable way of finding out about problems in other areas it should not be the only one.  The other way is by going to dances late at night where, as we all know, we learn very little and sometimes we can even make mistakes, as has happened in the recent past. I do not believe that the House when in plenary session should move, but if committees moved to other parts of the country it would be invaluable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party agree to this Estimate.  I should like to make a few brief comments about the operation of the House.  I say this with no disrespect to my colleagues, but since we came back on 9 March there has been a sharp dimunition in the general operations of the House.  For some reason or other, perhaps because of the post-election situation, there has been a great deal of unproductive cross comment on a wide variety of issues virtually every morning we meet, right through Question Time and through a great deal of the ordinary political debate of the House, so much so that if one goes through the debates one can mark off whole pages which can be <Col N="2319" /> classified as an absolute total waste of time on the part of the assembled Deputies.</P>
      <P>If additional facilities are to be provided in the House it behoves the political parties and the Independent Deputies &mdash; although I no way regard them as political offenders &mdash; to internally set our houses in order during the summer recess.  Respect for the Chair, the extent to which the rulings of the Chair are given any regard, has sharply diminished in the House for a variety of reasons.  If we are to conduct our affairs and if the nation is to vote moneys for us there is need to discharge our legislative, debating, voting obligations with efficiency, the maximum of normal human courtesy between ourselves, and the least possible amount of general bickering.</P>
      <P>This is the last opportunity I will have to comment on this matter before the recess.  There is urgent need for all parties to examine the internal disciplines of their Members about the way in which they participate in the House.  The structures of the House, as Deputy Bruton said, are archaic, outdated, and wholly inefficient.  We now have a situation where Deputies are returned to the Dáil not on the basis of their contributions here but rather on the extent to which they look after the day-to-day ordinary needs of their constituents.  One's return is more likely to be derived from the extent to which one completes correspondence rather than to the extent to which one contributes to the debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system whereby the contribution of Deputies, particularly in Opposition, is confined to intermittent Estimate debates, to contentious Private Members' Motions, largely designed to see if the Government can be trapped in a particular way, and to Dáil Questions which, for the most part, cost about £90 to £100 each to reply to in terms of taxpayers' money, should be examined.  The vast majority of questions can be readily answered from Departmental sources without any need to exercise one's parliamentary rights.  Special Notice Questions are frequently matters more akin to publicity than to the issues of the day.  The <Col N="2320" /> parties should get together during the recess.  We should not confine committees of the Dáil to the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, which has not met for 18 months.  It is a tragedy and travesty that it has not been meeting. Apart from that committee, the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities and the Committee on Public Accounts which has not met at all &mdash; we should meet during the recess to discuss urgently a wide range of matters &mdash; Members of the House have no opportunity to contribute.  There is a more questionable aspect: many Members do not seem to be preoccupied about contributing because they regard the question of constituency work as taking precedence.  We should have a public expenditure committee which should meet on a very regular basis.  We should have a budgetary or finance committee which should meet regularly.  We should have an agricultural committee.  There is absolute need for this.  We should have committees relating to international affairs, EEC affairs and education.  The parties should nominate their members to these committees.  If members do not participate that should be widely publicised by the media, and if they do not discharge their obligations in relations to the Estimates of the House then the electorate should judge, particularly at election time.  The results of that election should be the criterion of how those who sit in this House perform their duties rather than the criterion of how many thousands of letters and circulars a Member issues on matter which should really be resolved at local level rather than by parliamentarians at national level.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Bruton's view about broadcasting the proceedings.  When I raised this originally I did not get the agreement of the Fine Gael Party on it. Indeed, I was literally beaten about the head for suggesting it.  The Fianna Fáil Party agreed to broadcasting when they were in Opposition but, on resuming office, they promptly disagreed.  The parties must come to agreement on this. There has been a deterioration in the conduct of debates, and if Members had the opportunity of seeing themselves on <Col N="2321" /> television or hearing themselves broadcast &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

With modern technology there is no reason why the Dáil and Seanad should not avail of this facility.  In present circumstances one is interviewed in a garret upstairs where one is almost asphixiated because it is so small and so utterly inadequate.  It is quite impossible to do a satisfactory interview.</P>
      <P>I support what Deputy Bruton said. There is urgent need for the Leaders of the parties and the Whips to get together with the Ceann Comhairle during the recess in order to take a sharp hard look at the way Members discharge their obligations and the way in which Parliament functions.  The divergences between parties must be sorted out.  It is time parties made up their minds on the fundamental issues in regard to both the national parliament and the European Assembly.  We should know exactly where we stand in these areas.  The quicker this is achieved at both national and European level the quicker will the operations of the Houses of the Oireachtas and of the Assembly be enhanced and we shall see the elimination of the cynicism which has developed particularly over the last six months.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> Deputy Desmond, Deputy Bruton and I had a discussion about this yesterday.  During the summer months we should review the activities of the Dáil.  Basically the problem seems to arise on the Order of Business. There is a feeling of frustration because Deputies cannot come in here and raise matters of national importance without going through a long rigmarole about procedure and everything else. Deputies try to avail of an opportunity to air a matter to which time should be accorded for a proper debate.  At the moment time is taken up on argument, time which should really be used for proper debating purposes.  Restructuring is very urgent and very necessary, <Col N="2322" /> because frustration inhibits people from doing their job properly.  As Deputy Desmond said, there is now competition as to who sends out the most circulars.  The result is Parliament is falling into disrepute. People are actually getting circulars about dogs crossing streets whereas, in actual fact, we should be doing the job we were elected to do.  I welcome the proposal put forward that we should look at the structure of the Dáil.  I would be delighted to discuss this in detail between now and the time the House re-assembles in the autumn.</P>

      <P>I would like briefly to endorse what has been said.  The matter should be discussed in a non-partisan spirit.  There is bound to be a certain degree of uncertainty over the next few years and it is important that the Opposition should know how the Government propose to approach the matter.  We should look rationally now at the whole system, which should be made to operate better.  Quite radical reforms are necessary, reforms designed to speed up the work of the House and make it more effective.  We should engender confidence in our structures.  Some of the present weaknesses in the system derive from our failure to tackle fundamental problems. In the past there has been a tendency to adopt positions governed by where Deputies sat, whether in Government or in Opposition.  We should get away from that approach and adopt a more mature attitude with a view to achieving the best result possible.  I believe we can do that.  A great deal can be done during the recess, and we can come back in the autumn and consider the recommendations that emerge from any discussions that take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Whips have been discussing this issue, as Deputy Desmond said.  Problems have arisen possibly because of the closeness of the voting position.  The Order of Business has deteriorated, through nobody's fault probably but simply because there is no other way of raising issues.  Some system should be devised to enable back-benchers <Col N="2323" /> to raise matters on a certain day every week, thereby giving them an opportunity of airing their views instead of Deputies always finding themselves being disorderly when they want to discuss some matter of importance.  Every day we have at least 15 questions sought to be raised on the Adjournment and it is most unlikely any of them will be called.  Even if a question is called, because of the present unsatisfactory situation the protagonists are not likely to be ready to proceed.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Desmond's point about committees that Members have to be whipped in, I have spent time on a number of committees and it seems to me there is a sort of feeling that only a certain type of Deputy should serve on committees and, if one does not happen to be that particular type, then one does not serve.  Again, there is no compulsion to attend and one finds unfortunate officials running around trying to form a quorum.  More committees would not be a solution unless the parties whip the Members into attendance.  It is a fact, and everybody here realises it, that the way to stay in office is to do constituency work.  I agree this has gone to ridiculous lengths.  Everybody wants to do constituency work and nobody wants to do parliamentary work.</P>
      <P>We discussed the Finance Bill here for six weeks and we had tremendous performances from Deputy Desmond, Deputy Bruton and the Minister for Finance.  The rest of the Members were merrily doing constituency work when they should have been in room 114 dealing with the sections.  The sections which were not agreed should have been debated in a full House.  The public must be very disillusioned at our performance. I am prepared to spend part of the summer working with the Whips to try to bring in rules which will get us away from the present archaic laws.  Everyone is concerned with divisions and how long they can speak and, in the interests of the House, the Government should participate fully in trying to reform these laws before we return in the autumn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>As a relatively new Deputy, I support the move and the leadership given by the spokespersons of the various parties and the Whips towards reforming the operation of the Dáil.  I enthusiastically support the development of a committee system.  I feel that whipping people into a committee structure must mean you are up against a basic problem from the beginning.  We operate a committee system on councils and local authorities and there is no need to force people to do that because the work they are doing on those committees is directly related to the administration of services, systems and of legislation perhaps that is being decided at one level.  It is important that Dáil Éireann should have a relationship, not only with the Legislature but with the administration.  One of the keys to making committees relevant and interesting for Deputies, so that they would get involved and as a result be much more informed should they move from Opposition to Government, or <i>vice versa,</i> is to have a connection with the administration of various Departments.  Deputies should not be detached from Departments who administer the law.  Senior civil servants should meet individual Deputies who serve on committees.  At present the only people who ever meet the civil servants who administer the laws which are brought in are Members of the Government and, of that party, only the Ministers meet them.  There is tremendous frustration for back bench Deputies who are removed from any real say.  If senior civil servants were present at any future devolved committee stage, this would bring a much closer relationship and give greater involvement to Deputies. The average Deputy has no connection with the various Departments who administer the law and there is a natural gap which leads to frustration in Opposition and unnecessary lack of experience and continuity when a new Government is formed and links have to be established from scratch.  There is no need for that, it is inefficient and wasteful and is not practised in other European countries where there is a developed committee system.</P>

      <P>I am glad the House has agreed to the Supplementary Estimate.  I am also glad it has taken this opportunity to discuss what are very important matters in relation to procedure in the House.</P>
      <P>In recent months, it will be accepted and agreed by all sides of the House, through the Whips and the Party leaders, that the facilities for Deputies and staff have been improved enormously.  I am glad to see that development, and we must carry it forward on the basis of the various suggestions made by a number of Deputies in relation to procedures of the House.  I was interested to hear that we consistently talked about this House.  We must take procedures in the other House into account in relation to any discussion we have in relation to changing procedures. We talk about transferring business from here to committees.  Yesterday at Question Time when questions were being directed to the Minister for Finance he was criticised and abused for not being here.  At that time he was speaking in the Seanad &mdash;&mdash;</P>

If a Minister is involved in public business in the Seanad, committees or otherwise, the understanding and co-operation of other <Col N="2326" /> Members should be given to him because of his unavoidable absence.</P>
      <P>After spending over 13 years here I have worked on almost all committees and participated to the best of my ability in debates in the House, both in Government and in Opposition.  We all accept that there is enormous room for improvement in the procedures of the House.  I do not think the last four months have done the House any good.  It is important that everybody, between now and October, reflect on why that was the case and whoever is to blame should contribute to easing the situation towards reform of procedures that will restore full dignity to the operations of this House.  Having sat here for some weeks with Deputy Bruton, Deputy B. Desmond, Deputy De Rossa and others, debating the Finance Bill, some days for 10 hours, it struck me many times that much of that work could have been carried out in committee rooms.  A few years ago, when I was Minister of State, I remember being associated with the harmonisation of VAT levels and that was done very successfully in committees.</P>

      <P>I happened to be the Minister of State who did it on behalf of the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley.  Being responsible for the operation of the committee was a great help to me as Minister of State at the time but it also was of tremendous advantage to all of the members because not only had we the rapport between ourselves but we had the opportunity of involving the experts in discussion in relation to the very complex matter of VAT on both the national and international scene.  Therefore, a lot can be said for certain items of Government and Dáil business being transferred to committee work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, one must look at the totality of the operation, taking into account all of the operations of this House, the other committees of this House and the other House to see if anything can be done &mdash; I am sure much can be done &mdash; to improve the procedures and also the facilities of all those who have to operate within <Col N="2327" /> those procedures.  I am glad to hear the Fine Gael and Labour Whips are accepting all suggestions that have been made by our Whip, Deputy Ahern, in relation to discussions that can and should take place during the summer recess regarding this matter.  I hope that we can have, and I am sure we will, through the Whips and eventually through the Committee on Procedures and Privileges, the leaders of the parties in the kind of discussions we have had here this morning with the kind of consensus we seem to have arising on this subject, and that we can come to some suitable arrangement.</P>
    <P>Other points were raised by Deputy Bruton which may be considered as part of the procedures of the House, although I do not think that they are.  One is whether we should have radio or television in the House.  Let us get the procedures right by agreement first and then ask the question of whether it be broadcast live on radio or TV.  The proceedings of the House have been fairly widely covered by the various representatives of the press here, but one of the areas that has probably led to difficulties in the maintenance of the rules of order of the House has been that at certain times there are very good opportunities for getting publicity.  If the Order of Business was between 7.30 and 8.30, or as in the old times when we sat until 10.30, between 9.30 and 10.30 &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; at night &mdash; not too many people would be there and there would not be too much publicity about it.  We must be realistic about these things.  If we had the Order of Business in the morning and matters arising from it at 9.30 at night it would be a different story on both sides from Members in Government and Opposition.  We can talk about procedures and so on but we are all to blame whether we like it or not, on all sides of the House at all times, in my 13 years' experience here.  If we want seriously to review procedures we must adapt ourselves, especially in relation to the activities of this House, into the role <Col N="2328" /> of legislators and out of the role of politicians. While there has been certain criticism of the role of Deputies and the amount of literature and the quantity of representations they have to make, that is a very necessary part of democracy which I as a Deputy will protect as long as I am here.  While this House may not be able to relate to the people, the representatives of this House have, generally speaking, down the years related very much to their constituents.  That is a very necessary part of democracy which I would not like to see interfered with in any way, and I know that it is not the intention of anyone who has spoken here this morning to interfere with it.  However, you cannot marry the two and look for procedures and facilities that would take care of both.  They might be the same but they are in a way two separate and distinct areas.  Unfortunately, we are inclined to bring the political, representative, emotive type of thing forward into the legislative arena.</P>
      <P>I will not delay the House.  I am sorry for having gone on so long, but it is an important subject.  As it was raised I wish the best to our Whips and the other Whips and I am sure they will take into account the views of the small parties and Independents in relation to any suggestions they may have regarding reform of procedures in the House, and that some arrangement can be made whereby these discussions will lead to concrete proposals being put forward to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which I hope will be agreed.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1982. - National Community Development Agency Bill, 1982: Committee and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The first query I would like to raise in relation to this Bill is regarding the title.  The National Community Development Agency Bill has been discussed three times already in this session of the Dáil, the first time arising from a motion in the name of Deputy Desmond about the establishment of the poverty agency which had been the intention of the previous Government.  At that time we were assured that an agency would be established to continue that work in the general direction that we had in mind.  The National Poverty Agency was the title being considered for the Bill then.  I can see the value of the present title, the National Community Development Agency Bill, in that it is a positive developmental title, but it is causing a great deal of difficulty because it is not clear as to whether it is a community development agency or is directly related to the main aim of the agency that the previous Government had in mind, which was to tackle areas of poverty and deprivation and to look at the problem in a <Col N="2330" /> wide way.  I would like the Minister to clarify this point.  There is a great deal of confusion which is continued throughout the Bill in the terms of reference, and it is not clear exactly what the purpose of this Bill is.  Is it open to any community? Are we talking, as was intended, particularly about deprived communities?  I would like that clarified initially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. E. Desmond Mrs. E. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. E. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended to refer to this aspect of the Bill under section 3, but I presume it is appropriate that I talk about it now.  The title of the Bill presents some difficulty for us in this party.  We have a fundamental difference on this issue.  Our rationale is that a Bill ought to have been set up for the express purpose of combating poverty as a follow-on to the four years of work of the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty.  That is not to say that there is not also a need for the concept of a community development Bill with all the aids that are required by communities in the course of their social development. It is a very good thing, but it is quite different from what we believe is a priority, a Bill to grapple with poverty, which is a blot on this society.</P>
      <P>This presents a difficulty for us because the terms of reference under section 4 apply more precisely to a Bill that would be entitled, say, the establishment of an agency to combat poverty.  We have a major amendment in respect of the terms of reference.  Our thinking is precise and our priorities are clear in regard to this legislation.  We appreciate that at a time when resources are scarce we must be careful about how we spend the money we have but our priority must be to aim at the elimination of poverty.  I am making the point at this stage rather than when the Title is being put because it is a point that is fundamental to the whole Bill.</P>

      <P>This is a comprehensive Bill.  The Title is very appropriate and I am confident that the Bill will give the agency all the powers they will need for the future of their interpretation of areas and groups of social deprivation and poverty and in the <Col N="2331" /> positive and constructive development of communities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flaherty raised the question of the purpose of the agency and asked if they will relate to any community.  The answer to that is spelled out fairly clearly in the functions and in an amendment which I have made for the purpose of specifying clearly that the priority of the agency will be with areas, groups and communities of high social deprivation and poverty.  That is one of the amendments that I propose to highlight during the course of the Bill.  The Deputy can be assured that the agency will use the information that is available as a result of the pilot schemes on poverty generally and also the information that is available as a result of the operation of the National Social Services Board.</P>
      <P>The former Government had in mind a poverty agency with a somewhat more limited function.  That, too, will be brought out in the course of the debate on the sections as a result of some of the amendments that are proposed by the Opposition.  It is important to bear in mind that the stage that had been reached by the former Government was that of the preparation of a draft Bill, of the heads of a Bill, essentially.  However, in terms of parliamentary drafting some of the phraseology used in that draft Bill was not considered appropriate to the final Bill.  Again, this is something that will be manifested in the different amendments that are proposed.  It is important to recognise that at that stage there was a draft proposal which, if the former Government had been in a position to go ahead with it, would have been developed further.  The Bill has been through all these processes, and I can assure the Deputy that it will meet all the objectives the former Government had.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. E. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to repeat the points I have made but I would merely emphasise that there is a fundamental difference here.  Our priority is the combating of poverty.  In his Second Reading speech the Minister said that the agency would have wide ranging powers to promote and support community <Col N="2332" /> development and self help and in addition, as indicated by the Taoiseach in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 23 March, the agency, by way of an additional aim, would carry out the work that was to have been performed by the agency to combat poverty as proposed by the previous administration.  This is our problem here.  This is an additional aim. In talking about communities, the Minister in that same speech instanced a number of communities, including youth groups, social clubs, sports groups, Muintir na Tíre, the ICA and so on.  These are all very worthy groups, groups who I am sure do a lot of good and charitable work, but that is not what this Bill should be about.  There ought to be a Bill to help these organisations, but the proposals in this regard should not come within the ambit of a Bill to tackle the fundamental problem of poverty.  Therefore, our aim is additional and as such the Bill is not satisfactory to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, there are certain attractions in the Title.  It is positive and if the terms of reference of the agency were adequate and were treating as primary the aims we had for it originally, our party would be happy with the Bill but, as Deputy Desmond has indicated, the problem is that there is a new function.  This new function seems to be primary, but if the Minister can assure us now that he will be sympathetic to the amendments we have tabled, which are to ensure that the primary aim of the agency is spelled out clearly as being the tackling of the basic problem of poverty, we would be happy with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister also to clarify for us whether the position of these voluntary organisations will be changed in terms of their current and traditional sources of funding as a result of the establishment of this agency.  Will the appearance of this agency mean, for instance, that the traditional relationship between Muintir na Tíre and the health boards or between Muintir na Tíre and the local authorities and other such voluntary agencies will be changed?  Will there be an interference there?  The Minister has not clarified that to any extent.  The basic <Col N="2333" /> aim as envisaged in the origins of this legislation would be lost if the funds of this agency were to be used simply as a support for voluntary organisations and in a way that was not specified to any extent.  This would mean that not only would we not be tackling the fundamental problems but by these kinds of superficial arrangements for further grant aiding we would be opening the door once again to the articulate and well-organised middle-class communities to take the lion's share.  Again, in the arrangements in respect of one level of the agency's activities, that is, grant aiding various organisations, it would be open to the better-organised communities to exploit the situation.  If we wished to support further these other agencies we could do so simply by increasing their funding from the traditional sources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a point which is strictly in respect of definitions. I would draw the Minister's attention to the definition of &ldquo;statutory body&rdquo; in section 1.  It is: (i)  a health board established under the Health Act, 1970; (ii)  a local authority for the purposes of the Local Government Act, 1941; (iii)  a board or other body established by or under statute.</P>
      <P>For the life of me I cannot see why a statutory body should be defined simply as a body established under statute.  Why is it necessary to specify a health board and a local authority in between, seeing that it is said in subsection (iii)  anyway that a statutory body is any body established under statute, and clearly both the health boards and local authorities are established under statute?  It seems to me that the Minister, who was making much about the drafting of this Bill and criticising its heads, as prepared by the previous Government, has made a bit of an ass of himself about this definition where he has inserted (i), (ii) and (iii) whereas (iii) includes (i) and (ii).</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">

      <P>I could not stress strongly enough the importance that the Labour Party &mdash; as our spokesman on Health and Social Welfare, Deputy E. Desmond has said &mdash; attaches to the word &ldquo;poverty&rdquo;<Col N="2334" /> itself.  I do not want to be repetitious but I do want to say this, that everybody who has worked and written about the poor and poverty in Ireland has stressed the phenomenon of the discovery of the poor, the forgetting of the poor and the rediscovery of the poor.  Let us be clear about the title to this Bill.  It is breaking the continuity of the work done under the pilot schemes.  It is breaking the continuity of emphasis that all professional workers attach to poverty work.  Also it is exceptional in relation to comparable legislation in other countries.  It was not accidental that the United States Legislature found it necessary to specifically use the phrases &ldquo;war on poverty&rdquo;, &ldquo;combat poor&rdquo; in the drafting of their legislation. I find the term &ldquo;community development&rdquo; so bland as to be meaningless. It will transpire later, when we come to examine the alternatives at our disposal by way of terms of reference, that the choice in this Bill is as to whether one accepts existing structures; for example, whether one puts sports clubs, recreational groups and residents' associations in the same basket as people who are struggling to articulate their needs for the first time; whether you do that, as does this Bill, or whether you honestly acknowledge that the poor have come on to the stage and the work that people have done amongst the poor deserves to be represented in the title of a Bill.  It is not a case of some semantic or fashionable interest on the part of the Labour Party.  It has been a consistent usage in legislation dealing with the poor in other countries.  I contend that the removal from the title of the Bill and its definitions of any reference to poverty or the poor is a regression of a very serious kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussion of the title is becoming virtually a Second Stage debate again.  I would point out to Deputies, especially Deputy Flaherty, that at the end of the Second State debate I explained at considerable length that the principal objective of the Bill was to eliminate poverty and inequality.  Therefore Deputy Flaherty need have no concern about that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Bill itself, if one <Col N="2335" /> examines its objectives in section 4 one finds that (b) says:</P>
    <P>to promote and co-ordinate programmes in relation to self-help, poverty and social deprivation, with the object of achieving more effective action by statutory bodies and voluntary agencies;</P>
    <P>If we look at my amendment No. 9 one will find that, following our discussion on Second Stage, I undertook to insert a particular clause which would highlight the priority it was required to give to poverty and social deprivation by including the phrase &ldquo;particularly in communities in which there is a high degree of poverty and social deprivation&rdquo;&mdash; lest there be any misunderstanding about our intentions there.</P>
    <P>I might point out to Deputy Higgins that my amendment No. 10 was drafted also following our Second Stage discussion to meet the points raised by Deputies and proposes the addition of the words &ldquo;and with the approval of the Minister, to engage in. &rdquo; .  One of the other amendments specifies the pilot schemes and studies to make it quite clear that the body can undertake these tasks, take these kinds of actions, and that there will be no ambiguity about them.  These matters will arise under the specific sections.</P>
    <P>As far as the Title is concerned, before we went out of office on 1 July, 1981 I had been engaged in the process of upgrading and strengthening of the National Social Services Council.  That process improved the council by giving it board status, giving it a greater developmental role, which was my objective at that time.  But, to go any further, I had to introduce some Bill or measure which would give that body wider powers.  We then went out of office.  I did not criticise the heads of the Bill as prepared by the former Government.  I said the stage at which the former Government had arrived was the preparation of the heads of the Bill and, consequently, it had not gone through the drafting stage.  That was a point I made by way of clarification of some of the terms that will arise subsequently when we discuss specific sections <Col N="2336" /> of the Bill.  The former Government then set about the establishment of this poverty agency.  In this Bill we are combining both of these in one organisation which will have, as its priority, the tackling of poverty and social deprivation but which will not be constructed in that way.  I might point out to Deputies that I have some of the poorest people in the country in my constituency.  The way in which they are solving their problem is through community development, except that the input time to get that under way in their areas and the support they need is far greater than that required in areas such as those Deputy Flaherty mentioned. Therefore, our goal is to ensure that the resources are available to the people who are doing that kind of work, to initiate and stimulate that type of work in their areas.  This is one of the lessons learned from the pilot schemes on combatting poverty.  The purpose of this Bill will be to provide the resources.  I might point out also that the scale of resources being provided by the former Government was £250,000 in this year and that there are £2 million being provided under this Bill to support this agency this year.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Higgins who raised the question of sports clubs, social clubs and so on.  Without going into the merits or demerits of specific ones, the Bill specifies very clearly the kinds of bodies which should be supported in the first instance, the objectives they should have and the way in which the money should be utilised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty raised the question of the changed relationship that might arise with health boards and other funding bodies.  I should like to make it quite clear that this agency will be operating separately, will endeavour to co-ordinate efforts, but the funds it might provide would be additional to those which would be available under the normal health boards, and I might say that the health boards do undertake a considerable amount of this type of work.  Indeed certain powers are embodied in the Bill to ensure that such co-ordination can be achieved and that the resources of the various bodies can be brought to bear on <Col N="2337" /> problems considered to be within the objectives of this agency.</P>

      <P>I must say, having sifted through this Bill, that it is one of the most sloppily drafted Bills I have ever seen. That is obvious also from the objectives. I do not know whether the parliamentary draftsman was involved or not but this is the first example, the first page of sloppy drafting.  There is other sloppy drafting later in the Bill where self-help is referred to as an independent objective.  If a man <Col N="2338" /> is trying to make a million bucks he presumably could get help from this on the grounds that it is self-help.  I know that is not what the Minister has intended but that is what he has down in the Bill in black and white, just as he has made an ass of himself in regard to the definition of statutory bodies.  This is just typical of the messy way this legislation has been drafted.  I believe the Minister has not done his job or, if he has, then those who have been serving him have not.</P>

      <P>For the purpose of this Bill the Minister concerned is the Minister for Health.  That had not been our thinking, but I have no objection to the agency being dealt with by the Department of Health.  However, I should like to ask the Minister what arrangements he has made to expand the section in the Department which will have to deal with the increased volume of work in relation to this matter.  As the Minister is aware, the welfare section in his Department is already hard-pressed and coping with a major new piece of legislation.  I should like to ask the Minister to explain to the House the plans he has to expand that section.  It was our intention &mdash; a Government decision had been taken in regard to this &mdash; to set up a special unit in the Department with responsibility for coordinating with other Departments and developing the work of the agency.  What arrangements has the Minister made to <Col N="2339" /> ensure that the Department will be able to undertake the extra volume of work involved and support, backup and extend the work of the agency?</P>

It is probably the greatest section with development potential in the health services at present &mdash; I am referring to the welfare and general community section &mdash; but to take on an extra task such as this without the corresponding expansion of support staff is expecting a very hard-pressed section to do a lot.  I should like a little more than a general avoidance of the issue such as the Minister has given us.  I should like a clearer commitment that this work will be done properly and that the other important work, including the preparation of a children's Bill which the section is already engaged in, is dealt with adequately.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Deputy's emphasis on the need for staff in this area and I can assure her that the requirements will be reviewed as the work develops. The Deputy mentioned the preparation of a children's Bill, and I should like to inform her that a problem arose in regard to the preparation of that because some other measures, such as the Bill before the House, were so protracted here.  Those concerned with this Bill are also concerned with the preparation of the children's Bill and they had to attend here on many occasions but the Bill was not debated.  Consequently, that frustrated their activities in regard to the preparation of the children's Bill.  When <Col N="2340" /> this Bill is passed by the House the staff will have more time to deal with the Bill in relation to children, which we hope to have ready for the autumn session.</P>

      <P>In page 4, before section 4, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4. &mdash; (1) The functions of the Agency shall be &mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to examine the extent and sources of inequality in all its forms in Irish society on an on-going basis;</P>
      <P>(b)  to undertake, in consultation with the Minister, action aimed at combating poverty and to evaluate such action;</P>
      <P>(c)  to appraise critically existing policies and programmes in so far as they affect poverty and to recommend any necessary modifications;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2341" /> (d)  to establish and maintain contact with and between Government Departments and bodies having responsibilities relating to poverty;</P>
    <P>(e)  to suggest effective new policies and programmes against poverty and, in consultation with the Minister, to test out new programmes on an experimental basis;</P>
    <P>(f)  to make recommendations to the Minister, either on its own initiative or at the request of the Minister;</P>
    <P>(g)  to advise on the implementation of the recommendations of the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty;</P>
    <P>(h)  to publish as soon as may be after the commencement of each year a report on its activities in the preceding year including a report on the progress being made to combat poverty in Ireland, with a view to promoting public understanding of the problem and its extent; and</P>
    <P>(i)  to perform such specific tasks and submit such reports and information as the Minister may from time to time direct.</P>
    <P>(2)  In the performance of its functions the Agency shall comply with directions given to it from time to time by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(3)  In this section &lsquo;poverty&rsquo; means poverty in the State.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I understand that the acceptance of this involves the deletion of the original section 4 and it would result in the substitution of new terms of reference, This is the section on which most of our time will be spent.  We are constrained in the sense that the Bill proposes to do something additional to combat poverty and that we must pass all Stages before 1.30 p.m. today.  We must keep our remarks as brief as possible, but this is the section on which we will be making our stand.  If the Bill is to do what we undertook to do in Government, to combat poverty and aim at eliminating it, the terms of reference we are suggesting in our amendment must be substituted for those suggested by the Minister.  I should <Col N="2342" /> like to quote the first of the Minister's terms of reference:</P>
    <P>(a)  to advise the Minister and make recommendations to him regarding community development policies and community development programmes, in relation to self-help, poverty and social services;</P>
    <P>That is a very fudgey statement.  It is very broad, and vague.  What we propose is more appropriate.  We indicate what we want, to indicate the extent and sources of inequality in all its form in Irish society on an on-going basis.  If anything has emerged clearly from the four years during which the pilot programme was in operation it is that poverty has its basis in inequality.  We talk about giving a greater share to deprived people in the matter of opportunity, power over their lives, ordinary human rights, but it has also emerged that the rest of society has shown great resistance.</P>
    <P>If we are to come to grips with poverty and if we are to alleviate it, not to eradicate it, we must recognise that poverty is based on inequality and we in our amendment ask that the agency shall examine the extent and the sources of inequality in all its forms in Irish society. In the section the Minister provides that the agency must have the prior approval of the Minister.  It is a completely different matter from what we seek in our amendment.  In the section the Minister has not given any specific task to the agency: he merely speaks of the promotion of greater awareness, the collection and dissemination of information on community development, self-help and so on.</P>
    <P>So there is a basic difference.  In paragraph (d)  of our amendment we ask that the agency will establish and maintain contact with and between Government Departments and bodies having responsibilities in relation to poverty.  We realise that there are policies of the Government and the Departments which far from setting out to alleviate poverty are in themselves regressive.  Much public money is being spent on State aids and grants and subsidies which are available to people less deprived than those we are talking <Col N="2343" /> about today.  The people we are trying to help, trying to reach, are about 25 per cent to 30 per cent of those who are deprived in our society and who by their nature, perhaps by accident of birth, are least able to avail of the social services that are available, who are powerless to avail of them.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to give the agency powers to engage in programmes and in research, with the approval of the Minister. This differs greatly from what we propose.  We speak about consultation, not approval, because we believe it is necessary that the agency would have freedom.  Of course we agree they should consult with the Minister, but it is necessary for the agency to have maximum freedom to embark on schemes and programmes without being forced to go to the Minister for approval on all occasions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken of easing the lot of the poor.  I have no doubt the agency will do that and that they will give special consideration to deprived areas, but I am afraid that the Bill will not give them power to alleviate poverty.  The Bill will simply make poverty easier on the minds of the better off without intruding on them too much.  The lot of the privileged is not being intruded on too much by the terms of reference of the agency, but if we are talking seriously about poverty and about giving all sections of the community equal rights and equal powers we must do something to ensure that so many in our society will not have more than adequate for their needs while others have not enough to subsist on, when children are going hungry to school, when there is overcrowding in accommodation. What we are asking is that such overcrowded and hungry people will be given the chance to compete equally in a capitalist society.</P>
    <P>The Minister's terms of reference for the agency do not include any reference to the work of the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty. The Minister may say that the agency will have reference to the report of that body, of the review group, but the agency should be specifically charged to implement <Col N="2344" /> those reports.  There may have been some criticism of some of the work of the pilot schemes but I have no doubt tremendous work was done there.  The body established beyond doubt that poverty has its base in inequality, and I suggest the agency should be charged with the task of going on from where that work left off.</P>
    <P>The Minister's terms of reference, for these reasons, are unacceptable to us. The terms of reference are too vague and too narrow.  For instance, we have paragraphs (f) and (h):</P>
    <P>(f)  to advise the Minister on the development of community-based services, including in particular improved training and the supply of community development staff;</P>
    <P>(h)  to promote greater awareness, accessibility and co-ordination of social services;</P>
    <P>They are appropriate to a national social services board which should be fostered to do such work with maximum efficiency, but we are not talking about social services but of the inequality that creates poverty, and the Bill will not alleviate poverty through these fake terms of reference. No doubt the Bill will do something: no doubt it will ease the feelings of many privileged people.  But it will not make any structural changes because it will not be altering the hierarchy or opening any new doors.  We will alleviate but not eradicate poverty because the Bill does not make any effort to intrude on the privileged position of the better off in society.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that when referring to our first proposed term of reference the Minister will say it was not included in the draft Bill before the Government when we left office.  It was not, but the Minister had second thoughts about his own measure.  He has introduced amendments here today.  I also had second thoughts about that and advice about that, and having considered that advice I was very quick to accept that if we are to accept that poverty has its basis in inequality we must go straight for it, call that our first term of reference and start <Col N="2345" /> from there.  It is advisable that we make this our first term of reference.  At this stage I do not intend to speak any further. I will come in and out as appropriate on Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 4 put down by me is seeking to replace paragraph (a) of amendment No. 4 to make it more broad in the sense that it makes it necessary that recommendations be made in relation to education, training, housing and community facilities and the jobs necessary to foster development of local communities and alleviate poverty. Like most Deputies in this House, in approaching this Bill we are anxious that the poor in our community are helped so far as society as it is ordered at present can help the poor.  I have no illusions whatsoever that society as it is structured at present will ever eliminate or eradicate poverty, because the society we have is a capitalist society and capitalism is based purely and simply on the exploitation of those who produce wealth, the workers of the society.  Capitalism exploits the surplus wealth created by the workers. The fact that capitalism allows for social welfare payments and sets up various agencies to assist those who hit hard times is simply a recognition by those who control wealth that it is necessary to have some sort of reasonably happy workforce in order to continue with their exploitation. The fact that most social welfare benefits are in fact paid for by the workers themselves while they are working through PRSI payments or taxes, is another matter.  I have no doubt whatsoever that this Bill will not restructure society and will not eliminate poverty. But that does not preclude us from trying to ensure that this Bill will alleviate the worst excesses of the system we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fairly well understood that poverty is not simply a question of not having <Col N="2346" /> enough money.  I have come across cases where households in fairly well-off areas with reasonably high incomes could be classed as poor because of the way their resources have been misused or abused by one or other of the spouses in the family through drinking or gambling problems.  So poverty of itself is not confined to specific communities; it is not that there are pockets of poverty here and there.  There are areas which might be classed as middle class where there is a reasonable degree of comfort with individual families who are quite poor either because the money is misused or because the people in that household, for one reason or another, are not capable of managing their own lives.  So it is necessary to broaden paragraph (a) of amendment No. 4 to ensure that all aspects of poverty will be taken into account.  Education and training are key elements in trying to tackle the question of social deprivation.  Housing is obviously one. Most Deputies, certainly in the Dublin area, will have experience of very bad cases of poverty, again not arising from the fact that the people do not have a reasonable income but simply because they do not have a sufficiently high income to be able to purchase a house.</P>
    <P>This brings us into a whole other area of why housing is allowed to be exploited in the way it is by those who have the money to do so by raising the price of land.  In fact at present the building societies are looking for additional interest rates, which is going to cause untold hardship to people who, in the normal course of events, would be quite well off.  So I would not like us to run away with the idea that poverty is something which exists in certain deprived pockets of our community; it spreads right across into all areas.</P>
    <P>Community facilities is another question. This is where certain areas are worst hit by the lack of community facilities.  In areas that are reasonably well off the people can move out and find the facilities they want and can afford to pay for them.  But in poorer sections of our community where there are no adequate facilities all kinds of problems develop because the young people in the area <Col N="2347" /> have absolutely nothing to do and end up breaking into shops or whatever because of it.  That is not to say that in these areas a lot of effort is not being put in by a small number of people in developing sports facilities.  This is why I would quibble with some of the remarks made by the spokespersons for Labour and Fine Gael.  It is important that this agency should have something to do with community facilities that are already in existence such as sporting groups and so on. There is a need to ensure that these develop.  Again, I would agree that it is necessary that the agency confine its work, initially at any rate, to areas which are worse off, because obviously facilities would be least well developed in those areas.</P>
    <P>Jobs and housing are the key to a lot of the worst forms of poverty that we have in our society.  There again the lack of jobs for young people and the increasing loss of jobs in areas which are not particularly poverty-stricken are causing problems.  There is a loss of jobs in areas right across the board and people are being literally destroyed by being unable to pay their mortgages because they have lost their jobs.  The building societies appear to have a free hand in raising interest rates as they choose.  These areas need to be dealt with by the agency and recommendations made to the Government as to how the problems can be overcome.  I stress that while I hope the agency will succeed and will do much work towards alleviating poverty, I have no illusions that they will succeed in eradicating poverty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to stick strictly within the spirit and letter of what is appropriate on a Committee Stage debate.  The Labour Party are anxious that this Bill be passed by 1.30 p.m. and we have indicated our co-operation in this regard.  I have noticed at times an attitude that we are not being helpful by raising points which we consider fundamental, but it is appropriate when discussing the functions of the agency to raise such points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party amendment concerning <Col N="2348" /> the functions of the agency is action-oriented, as is clearly revealed by the language used.  Under the proposed new section 4 (1) (a) the word &ldquo;inequality&rdquo; is used, as is the phrase &ldquo;on an on-going basis&rdquo;, indicating that an agency of this kind should be free to address not only inherited inequality and existing inequalities but new inequalities that can be created by Acts of the Legislature in relation to taxation and developments of different kinds.  There is reference to action aimed at combating poverty and modifications in existing policies.  Subsection (1) (d) refers to establishing contact between different Government Departments and improving co-operation between them.  Subsection (1) (e) refers to the testing out of new programmes. Where is that reflected in the existing terms of reference of the agency?  Sub-section (1) (f) refers to the agency on its own initiative making recommendations to the Minister.  What is the purpose of having a statutory agency unless it is free to act autonomously?  The agency must have the right to initiate measures and establish experimental programmes and report, regardless of whether this creates discomfiture for the Minister and the Government of the day.  This autonomy is crucial if the agency is to be independent.</P>
    <P>There are two notions running through the terms of reference in the Bill, both of which notions I reject.  The first is that poverty is an aspect of the person, that it is a matter of the poor being assisted to drag themselves to the standard of the existing community.  The second notion is that the poor can be assisted by the existing structures of society if services can be stretched out to embrace them.  I reject that notion absolutely.</P>
    <P>The work of the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty showed that when the gaze of the poor was put on the State what they wanted was not compassion but justice and the right to participate.  This means building into an agency like this the ability to expose the existing structure of the State. The terms of reference included in the Bill will not achieve this.  There is no reference to the continuity of the work of <Col N="2349" /> the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty or to inequality in its inherited, existing or future forms.  There is no reference to autonomous action, and most of the functions are concerned with making recommendations, giving advice and drawing on and evaluating researches.  The agency are to promote greater accessibility and awareness and co-ordination.  We are long past descriptive work in relation to the poor.  We have been doing it for 11 years and we do not need much more description.  We need action, and it is most important that this agency should have teeth and the right to examine critically the existing structures of society. This is the whole spirit of our amendment, and it is fundamental.  We are asking the House to choose between a kind of well intentioned compassion and the beginning of work to reveal inequality and deprivation.</P>
    <P>There is no point in saying &ldquo;We are going to spend this much and you only spent that much.&rdquo;  as if the argument were about quantities.  Even the language used is offensive to people who study the poor and poverty.  It is the State which spends the money and it is the taxpayers who generate the revenue which the State conveys.  It is the use of possessive pronouns which has eaten into the hearts of the poor, where politicians have gone running after the sums the State has spent on services.</P>
    <P>If one accepts the Government's terms of reference one accepts the existing structures and words like &ldquo;community development&rdquo; and &ldquo;self-help,&rdquo; as well as words such as &ldquo;fostering&rdquo; and &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; and &ldquo;advice&rdquo; and &ldquo;awareness&rdquo; and phrases such as &ldquo;the promotion of greater understanding&rdquo;.  The Labour Party amendment would ensure continuity of the work of the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty, a commitment to examining inequality, specific action, and the establishment of co-operation between different Government Departments.  There would also be autonomy for the agency, if necessary, to embarrass any Minister or Government or society about the extent of inequality. It is a choice between action-oriented <Col N="2350" /> terms of reference which would establish continuity and would be welcomed by the professional workers in the field and would give the poor a voice and, on the other hand, a bland set of terms of reference which will not embarrass anybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of our Party on this Bill is in some respects similar to that of the previous speaker, but it has its own individualities.  We are very concerned at the blandness of the terms of reference of the agency &mdash; and feel that they should be amended to ensure that the primary function is poverty-related.  We would not go as far as the Labour Party in that we accept some of the terms in relation to community development, voluntary agencies and the relationship with other Departments and statutory bodies because we feel that unification and co-ordination is to be welcomed in any attack on this problem.</P>
      <P>The primary function of the agency must be to examine the cause and extent of poverty, as stated in our amendment No. 3.  This would cover the amendment of the Labour Party and also Deputy De Rossa's amendment.  It is the widest amendment which allows the maximum examination of all possible causes and the commitment to undertake action aimed at combating poverty and evaluating that action.  These amendments would give the agency or any other agency established by a future Government the power to examine the problem of poverty in the most fundamental way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That power is lacking in the Minister's terms of reference.  The Minister's own amendment went some way towards meeting these criticisms, which we also raised on Committee Stage, but not far enough.  Would the Minister consider accepting these as additional to the primary functions of the agency?  If he is sincere in what he said earlier on what is intended to be the primary function, he will have no difficulty in accepting these amendments.  In the Bill before us section 4 (1) (d) involves the power to foster and assist, including by financial and material aid, projects of community involvement <Col N="2351" /> and activities.  That has the woolliness referred to here on a number of occasions. There is a great danger that unless this section is made more specific any group &mdash; whether in need or otherwise &mdash; can draw funds from the agency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred earlier to the millionaire who is engaged in a self-help project for himself.  That is not likely to happen in this area, but very likely to happen when political pressure comes on, unless the terms of reference are tightened.  This will become a handy avenue from which, come election or any other time, the boys can tap a source of extra funding and do themselves good in a local area without regard to the basic fundamentals.  We have waited long for this agency, and to establish it in such a way that potential abuse is built into it should not be tolerated.  While the Minister has gone some way towards specifying in his amendment the particular community and groups amongst whom there is a high degree of poverty and deprivation, we are not happy with that. The Bill must specify exclusively areas of deprivation.  The amendments should include not only inner city communities. As other speakers have indicated, poverty is not confined to geographical or area groupings.  It occurs through the various classes in our society.  The old are often subject to poverty, even though they may have a middle class or wealthy background, for many reasons.  The first terms of reference must be as wide as possible to cover all these possible complexities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins indicated that all poverty is related to inequality, but there are examples of poverty which occurred even where great opportunity has been available to certain groups, but through illness, accidents or experiences, people slip into a poverty state.  Without trying to alleviate the basic injustices and inequalities which exist in our society, dealing with poverty will involve a commitment and understanding of its complexity and an agency properly committed to it. The Minister should amend the functions of the agency to ensure this, by accepting the amendment put forward here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. E. Desmond Mrs. E. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. E. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I make one brief point?  Why does the Minister consider it necessary to introduce sub-section 4 (2) which says that the Minister may, by regulations, amend the functions of the agency with the consent of the Minister for Finance?  We placed no such power in the hands of the Minister.  This is an unsatisfactory inclusion.  It may give the Minister power to improve the regulations, but may render them even more bland than they are.  It is not necessary that the Minister in this Bill have so much power by way of regulation.  These terms of reference are fundamental to the whole purpose of the Bill &mdash; to establish the agency, under whatever title it is given.  Would the Minister comment on why he saw fit to make this inclusion in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>My party are also concerned at the power given to the Minister in relation to this agency.  All its functions are subject to the approval of the Minister. Despite the fact that we are spending a number of hours and have already debated what is intended for this agency. the Minister is taking extensive powers unto himself.  We are particularly concerned about the necessity for section 4 (2).  When the Minister has the right of sacking, as we have seen in respect to another agency, and that extra strength in many of the other sections, we will be questioning the extent of these powers given to him.  It is important that this agency be allowed to be independant, to comment independently on the changes needed in our society to bring about objectives (1) and (2) which we would like to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take section 4 (2) first, since this has been raised by Deputies Desmond and Flaherty.  The section states that the Minister may, by regulation, amend the functions of the agency with the consent of the Minister of Finance.  This is in accordance with, and governed by, section 19, whereby regulations made under this subsection must be laid before the Oireachtas.  This is to ensure that the Legislature are given the <Col N="2353" /> opportunity to comment on any changes in the functions of the agency.</P>
      <P>The Deputies need have no fear of a ministerial takeover, or of any sinister intervention by the Minister here.  In fact, if he did not make such a provision, the organisation would be totally straitjacketed. The agency may come forward with proposals as they see necessary and we do not envisage all the activities in which they could be engaged.  When proposing these terms of reference and their functions, we cannot cover all that is necessary. The vast majority of the work done, certainly through the Minister for Health, is by consultation, co-operation and the supporting of one another.  There is so much work to be done that one needs more staff and more resources most of the time.  Many involved in agencies say that had they been given the resources and the staff in the first instance, they might have been able to solve a lot of the subsequent problems. If it is discovered that there is a need to make an amendment and to expand the functions in one way or another, particularly as we would be thinking of here, one must have an enabling clause which enables these regulations to be made. They are then laid before the House, so that the Oireachtas would be fully conversant with what is done and can decide to vote against them, if necessary.</P>
      <P>The Deputies should not be concerned about these powers.  Talking about the general functions of the Minister, even amendments put forward in the names of Deputies Desmond and Higgins, section 4 (2) &mdash; In the performance of its functions the Agency shall comply with directions given to it from time to time by the Minister &mdash; despite the wonderful freedom which Deputy Higgins so eloquently described, in his own amendment he talks about a certain degree of ministerial control, and rightly so.  That is all that is involved in terms of ministerial control in the Bill as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In looking at this, as at other sections, I have taken into consideration the amendments put down by the Deputies and the points made by them.  Consequently, I have made a number of amendments <Col N="2354" /> to the Bill.  The points raised are more than adequately covered in the Bill, as I propose to amend it here today. Where it is not the case that the Deputies' proposals are adequately covered in the Bill, I have tabled some amendments which go a considerable way towards meeting their suggestions.  The overall effect of this amendment would be to limit the agency's work in relation to poverty.  Both Deputies Higgins and Desmond made this point at the outset on the title of the Bill.  They are more interested in limiting the Bill specifically to what we believe is a narrow concept of poverty.  Deputy De Rossa brought out clearly the kinds of poverty which can arise as a result of alcoholism, which may be in particular groups and must be identified by the agency.  We do not want to restrict the agency in that kind of activity. Their amendment would seek to delete all references to community development and to self-help.  This would not be wise nor would it be the correct way to proceed. I spent some years working and tackling poverty through community development.  My experience there indicated &mdash; this has been corroborated by the studies done on the pilot schemes to combat poverty &mdash; that there must be an agency which can encourage, foster and set up groups which will get the kind of community and group action necessary to tackle the various kinds of poverty in our society.  That is what this Bill will do.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to words such as &ldquo;fostering&rdquo; and &ldquo;assisting&rdquo;.  The fostering is to set them up, get them underway and provide them with resources to stimulate activity.  I accept that this activity will from time to time be such as to upset the <i>status quo</i> and establishment.  There are overlays of establishments and interwoven establishments throughout society. Of course, one can achieve one's objective without necessarily punching the other fellow on the nose.  In many cases it can be done by the kind of pressure created by groups to get change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What would the Minister do with a resident association which opposed itinerant settlements?.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2355" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a complex area.  I am familiar with the situation where a residents association accepted a group of 40 itinerants.  A council then came along and said they were to have 20 more. Naturally the residents association said no.  They said they had 40 already and were integrating them, their children, visitors and people coming and going.  It was found that nobody wanted to establish a group in the next area.  I have direct experience of this and it is a delicate and difficult situation.  In conjunction with the Minister for the Environment I set up a review group on the travelling people which will report in the next six weeks or so.  We hope to get a national policy.</P>
      <P>Such groups will highlight the realities of the situation from the point of view of the travelling people.  Some people are well represented and have good pressure groups.  Consequently, they manage to get a good share of the cake.  I do not blame them for doing that.  It is due to good organisation on their part.  What is often wrong at the social service end and poverty end is that the groups are not organised or supported and consequently are not able to express themselves.  Very often the key problem is that groups cannot express themselves in a way in which people can clearly understand.</P>
      <P>One of the fundamental objectives of the Bill is to stimulate support and assist community development and voluntary activity.  It is essential that the agency does not operate in a vacuum but rather works with, through and for communities to help them to meet their differing needs and develop their services and activities. There may be areas where they cannot work through a community and may have to work on an outside project.  That is covered in various parts of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated when introducing the Bill, it is intended that the bulk of the funds at the disposal of the agency will be channelled into local projects and activities.  I hope Deputies do not wish to withdraw this source of support from local voluntary groups which may be engaged in activities which come within the functions of this agency.  There is no point in pointing to all kinds of voluntary groups.  They are all governed by the <Col N="2356" /> functions of the agency.  Deputy De Rossa made a point about the function which sports groups can have, particularly in areas of considerable poverty. This has been overlooked over the years. This can do a great deal to combat poverty in such areas.  We should not be too specific.  As Deputy De Rossa said, perhaps alcoholism and sporting activities are areas which the board might want to cater for.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the bulk of the resources will go to local groups and areas rather than building a mammoth bureaucracy and superstructure within the agency itself.  A further result of the amendment which is proposed would be the deletion of social services from the agency's remit.  This would have the effect of preventing the agency from continuing and expanding the vital work of the National Social Services Board. These are points the Labour Party made separately.  They want to restrict it to poverty and leave the social services board separate.  I do not think the amendment will be welcomed by the board.  The board will have an important function in being subsumed into the new agency.  It will have resources and be able to develop its work along the lines which it had hoped.</P>
    <P>To deal with the specific proposals made by Deputies, paragraph (a) refers to any inequality in all its forms.  This is too ambiguous to be enshrined in the legislation.  I wonder if Deputies intended that the agency should deal with sexual inequality and racial inequality and all forms of prejudice and discrimination which exist.</P>

      <P>It would be a question of the agency deciding where the priorities are.  If they happen to come within areas of sexual inequalities the agency can deal with them under its functions as they exist.  The word &ldquo;inequality&rdquo; in that context is taken as being too broad and ambiguous to include in the legislation. In any event the substance of this paragraph is adequately covered in the present <Col N="2357" /> provisions.  If the agency is to fulfil its statutory obligations, it will have to examine all aspects of social deprivation including the nature, causes and effects of social inequality.</P>

    <P>That is all-embracing.  That ties in with later sections which give the agency authority to have research done or to <Col N="2358" /> engage in research itself.  That is very comprehensive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>We are back again to the general terms of reference.  In order to promote public understanding the agency would have to study and examine the situation, but that is not written in as a primary imperative.  It is, perhaps, indirectly understood.  In my opinion it should be written in, and I cannot understand why the Minister will not accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>All sections are complementary and it is quite clear to me that one of the functions will be to promote greater public understanding of the problem and its extent.  Obviously that connotes ministerial and governmental understanding of the nature, causes and extent of the poverty and social deprivation and the measures required to alleviate them.  That brings me to the point Deputy Higgins made that it should have the power to state publicly what measures are required and why they are required to do the research necessary and then separately obviously to discover this information.  All that is covered in the Bill.  The agency will have to examine all aspects of poverty and social deprivation, including the nature, causes and extent of poverty and social deprivation and the measures required to alleviate them.  In addition, I have tabled amendment No. 10 which is designed to empower the agency to engage directly in research. Here it is obvious the relationship between poverty, social deprivation and inequality will come up for consideration. I have accepted the essence of paragraphs (b) and (e) in my amendments.  This will empower the agency to undertake programmes on an experimental basis.  The agency will also be required to evaluate such actions.  It is not my intention, however, that the agency should become involved in operational programmes on a long-term continuous basis, not normally at any event, because the objective is to find out what the reasons are and deal with them either through the medium of the structures set up by the agency or by the Government or other <Col N="2359" /> bodies directly concerned.  Once the agency identify a need arrangements will be made to have the problem tackled by the appropriate statutory bodies.  It is important to recognise here that one of the powers we are giving in this Bill is designed to enable any Minister to direct a body under his or her supervision to co-operate with the agency.  This is a very strong power.  It represents a new approach and one which will be very valuable. It may in certain circumstances be very necessary.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 10 says &ldquo;and with the approval of the Minister&rdquo;. Why does the Minister find it necessary to put a condition precedent on research? He has been generous in responding to our suggestion but why put in this proviso? It reduces the independence of the body doing research.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the areas in which the body would become involved directly.  It was our intention originally that the agency would farm out the research.  That is what the poverty group did.  The intention here is that before indulging in research the agency would be required to obtain the approval of the Minister.  The purpose is to ensure there is no unnecessary duplication as between the agency and other research bodies. The idea is to stimulate other relevant bodies to take an interest in this area.  For instance, the Medical and Social Research Board would have an interest. We do not want the agency to become over-research orientated.  I spent a good while in research, and the tendency is to become too involved.  If, however, there were not suitable existing arrangements then the agency could itself become involved.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated <Col N="2360" /> on amendment No. 5 that he would allow programmes on an experimental basis. Where does he see the National Social Services Board which is at present engaged in an on-going social function in this?  Subsuming the board means taking over staff, responsibilities and so on.  The programme of the board is an on-going one.  Is it not contrary to principle for the agency to subsume an on-going service? Would the Minister clarify the contradiction in this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is that the work of the board will be ongoing.  I see no reason why it should not be.  It would be a matter for the board ultimately to decide what the priorities are.  The functions which the board has at the moment are being subsumed.  They can be continued within the new agency and obviously there will have to be consideration to find what the priorities are.  It is our intention that the functions will be ongoing and I see no reason why the agency would not be continuing them in any event.  Obviously, in the future, the emphasis on their work will be discussed with the new agency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will realise that I am providing the money for engaging in research which she was anxious to have.</P>
      <P>I accept paragraph (c) in essence but I am satisfied it is adequately covered in the existing Bill and in the amendments I have proposed.  As regards co-operation with the statutory bodies, my proposals are much stronger and more specific than those proposed by Deputies in paragraph (d).  My proposals require the agency to promote and co-ordinate the work of statutory bodies and voluntary agencies which are not specifically mentioned in the Deputy's amendment so as to achieve more effective action in relation to self-help, poverty and social deprivation.  I also wish to point out that the Deputy's amendment would involve the deletion of subsection (4) which empowers any Minister to direct anybody under his aegis to co-operate with the agency.  This is a measure which is particularly important in the objectives which we all have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (f) is already covered in my proposals.  The agency may make recommendations to the Minister on its own initiative in relation to the social aspects of national, social and economic planning. Paragraph (e) of my proposals covers that.  This would enable the agency to advise on the whole range of Government social policy, including, for example, policy on housing, income maintenance, health and social welfare, education and personal social services. This brings in the point raised by Deputy De Rossa in his amendment and I want to assure him that that is adequately covered in the Bill as it stands and he need have no fear in that respect.  In addition, my proposals require the agency to submit such reports as the Minister may require from time to time.  Paragraph (g) is not necessary.  The agency will be free to draw on any source of <Col N="2362" /> experience or research in formulating its recommendations.  This may include any of the reports of the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to combat poverty or of similar programmes abroad.  There is no need, therefore, to specify the National Committee in the legislation.  Paragraph (h) of the Deputy's proposals deals with the making of an annual report.  The Bill includes a full section &mdash; section 9 &mdash; on the annual report and related matters, so this paragraph is not necessary.  Similarly, paragraph (i) is already contained in the Bill.  Subsection (2) of the amendment is also covered in the Bill and I am advised that subsection (3) is not necessary.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the essence of amendment 1(a) is already covered in the Bill and will be further strengthened if my amendment No. 10, relating to research, is accepted.  The power to examine the causes and extent of poverty and social deprivation is implicit in paragraphs (a), (c), (e), (f), (g), (i) and (j) of subsection (1).  In addition, my amendment will give the agency specific authority to engage in research relating to poverty. I see no need for this amendment and, therefore, I do not propose to accept it.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 1(b), I agree that the agency should be empowered to undertake experimental programmes in relation to community development, self-help, poverty and social services.  Amendment No. 5, which I moved, seeks to extend this power to the agency.  However, I am not in favour of the agency becoming involved in providing services or undertaking action on a long term, continuous basis as seems to be implied in amendment No. 1 (b). Where an experimental programme has revealed an unmet need, responsibility for dealing with the situation on a long-term basis would be assigned to the most appropriate Government Department or statutory body.  Otherwise the agency would quickly become bogged down in the detailed administration of services which would render it unable to take the broader view of the social policy and social planning with which it is charged. For this reason I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister of State's reply, surely he does not expect us to believe that the only sum not provided for in the budget is one of £2 million?  Surely he is aware that there was a promise given at the Dublin West by-election to spend £45 million?  That was the reason I put down that question. If there have been no savings to date and if we have had Supplementary Estimates last year of £599 million, the previous year to the tune of £477 million and the preceding year to the tune of £360 million odd, where does the Minister expect to find this £45 million?

        <i>(Clare):</i> (a) Maintenance and improvement works are programmed for Leinster House every year and are usually carried out during the Dáil recess, particularly the summer recess.  Because of the impending visits of foreign dignitaries to the House some of the improvement works, including the provision of carpets, were brought forward and carried out towards the end of May at the request of the Leinster House authorities.  (b) Overtime was worked in laying the carpets.  It is customary to lay carpets in Leinster House outside normal sitting times to minimise the inconvenience to Oireachtas Members and Staff.

Could I ask the Minister of State this: if these carpets are normally laid in vacation, where is the necessity for overtime when, during vacation, there is an almost total absence of Deputies and Senators from the House and, when they are there, they can well be asked to step over a roll of carpet or to go by a slightly circuitous route of a couple of feet when walking along a corridor, as everybody in this Chamber frequently has been doing anyway?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that that esplanade, the necessity for which was hotly contended when it was first laid down, is growing moss and, for all I know, rare Alpine growths, in the interstices left behind by the decayed mortar which is now disappearing from it, and that it needs repointing?  Will the Minister agree that it would be more seemly to attend to what we have here, and in this House, than to pretend to what we have not?  It would be far more seemly if the Grand Duke and Duchess of Luxembourg were asked to walk in over a granite esplanade which was not growing weeds as this one either is or shortly will be, and never mind the blue carpets.</P>

It would be more seemly for people in a State such as ours to look after what they have in a proper manner.</P>

      <P>I could not know that; but, if what is needed is to illuminate the premises so that there can be no nocturnal intrusions into Deputies' cars or other establishments on the Lawn, might it not have been done more cheaply than by the cabling that has been provided?  The reason I put the question down was because I saw this work going on for weeks, the devoted laying of cable, the digging of trenches, the laying of setts over the cables and, finally, the erection of some of the ugliest iron standards I have ever seen in my life.  Could it not have been done more cheaply by putting up &mdash; it may not have been very pretty &mdash; on the walls of the Natural History Museum and the National Gallery a couple of relatively unobtrusive floodlights which could have been switched on at times of special danger?</P>

I should like to draw the Minister's attention to something and invite his agreement with a proposition that Leinster Lawn generally is overfurnished, cluttered and ruined.  It should be a lawn and I should like to know if the Minister will accept that it contains &mdash; I made a rough count passing in and out &mdash; an assortment of the following objects: an obelisk, statues, stone benches on which no one ever sits, asphalt paths on which no one ever strolls, bollards, lamps, floodlights, crush barriers, miscellaneous shrubs, a security ramp, a gate office, two fountains from which no water ever emerges, a pond, &ldquo;no parking&rdquo; signs, a hydrant milestone, a metereological office beehive, some science fiction periscopes and a sinister overgrown moat in which no good thing could ever grow.</P>

Where we have a team of people working and a fitter retires that retirement could result in the team being immobilised if a replacement is not appointed.

        <i>(Clare):</i> The position is that the survey has been completed.  The scheme is now at the design stage and approximately 70 per cent of the design work has been completed.  Most of this work, as the Deputy will be aware, is done on drawing boards in the office with an occasional visit to the catchment area. There have not been any people paid to do that work.  Three studies now come on stream.  One is a preliminary study in regard to ground water.  Another is with regard to the oyster beds and the third is in relation to the Turlough area.  If it becomes necessary to augment the number of engineers involved in the design, they will be employed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> The pattern of progress in regard to arterial drainage is first of all a survey, secondly a design and thirdly a cost/benefit analysis.  Then the scheme goes on display.  In this case the survey has been completed and the <Col N="2387" /> design has been approximately 70 per cent completed.  We are now engaged in three specific surveys.  One is on the ground water situation, a survey which is necessary because of the possibility of being able to drain mini-schemes along that river catchment.  This had come to light because of a preliminary study. There is danger of ground water along the catchment area if the scheme has not been designed properly.</P>
      <P>Second, we have the oyster beds which have to have the right mixture of fresh water and saline water.  That is essential. If there is too much fresh water all the oysters would be lost.  This is going on under another professor supervised by him.  Third, there is the Turlough area which raises species of birds and the forestry and wildlife section are doing a study on that.  When we have these three specific studies at hand we will be able to complete the design of the scheme and ensure that we protect these areas and causes no damage to them if at all possible. But we must have the studies before we can complete the design.  After that we can go on to the cost-benefit.</P>

      <P>Progress under the brucellosis eradication scheme has been such that there appears to be a real prospect that the disease may be eradicated in about five years.  The bovine TB is less satisfactory but animal incidence has been reduced from 17 per cent in the mid-fifties to .2 per cent.  Admittedly the incidence has risen somewhat over the past year or so but some fluctuation is inevitable and appropriate steps are being taken to deal with this situation.

Negotiations with the Department of Health are in progress to empower the National Drugs Advisory Board to undertake this work.  Discussions with the Department of Health, the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism and veterinary representative bodies are going on with a view to introducing stricter control on antibiotics and other substances used in livestock production.

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the finance made available to his Department to grant aid agriculture in 1980 and 1981; the cost of administering these schemes; and the finance received by the applicants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The moneys made available to my Department from the EEC and the national Exchequer to provide direct grant aids to farmers amounted to approximately £105 million in 1980 and £126 million in 1981.  All of this money went to the farmers and the apportioned administrative costs for servicing these grant-aided schemes are estimated at £6 million in 1980 and £9 million in 1981. Only schemes which involved grant payments from my Department direct to farmers are covered by the foregoing figures and payments to exporters and processors which support farmers' prices are not included.</P>

The administrative cost for servicing grant-aided schemes on a proportionate basis worked out at £9.4 million in 1981 and £5.88 million in 1980.  The increase may be due to the large number of additional schemes dealt with by the Department.</P>

Out of 78,000 building construction workers only 28,000 are included in the scheme for pension and so on.

There is an agreement registered <Col N="2402" /> with the Labour Court under which facilities are available to both sides to make complaints to the Labour Court which can be investigated.

      <P>As recently as yesterday afternoon, I had meetings with representatives of the Irish Building Societies Association, and of the Norwich Irish and Irish Life Building Societies to discuss <Col N="2403" /> the question of their investment and mortgage rates and other aspects of their finances.  I was informed of developments since the meetings held in March-April last on these general issues.

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to remind the Deputy that when the threat of an increase arose in March last, I initiated discussions with the societies and succeeded in reaching agreement with them. It was well publicised that there would be no increase until August for new mortgages and 1 September for existing mortgages. The Deputy's concern would be more credible if he had not been a member of a party supporting the Government when between July and October last year they withdrew the subsidy and allowed building society mortgage rates to increase from 13.15 per cent to 16.25 per cent, a rise of 3.1 per cent.  I share the Deputy's concern about further increases and, as I said, I will be reporting to the Government and having a further meeting with the building societies on Thursday of next week.</P>

      <P>We are not talking about an increase to 16.25 per cent, we are talking about a threat by the building societies to increase it to 17.95 per cent. Does the Minister not agree that that <Col N="2404" /> would be untenable, particularly in the context of falling interest rates at present, and will he assure the House that he will take all necessary steps, by legislation if necessary, to ensure that there is no increase beyond the figure of 16.25 per cent so that people's homes can be protected?</P>

There is no statutory control over interest rates structures of the building societies, just as there is not statutory control over the interest rates structures of the associated banks.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Was the Minister's attention drawn to the statement of the chairman of Allied Irish Banks recently to the effect that interest rates will rise and continue to rise because of Government over-borrowing and general mismanagement of the economy?  In view of that, is it a fact that the building societies have given notice to the Minister <Col N="2405" /> that they propose to increase interest rates by 1.7 per cent and that that will reach an all-time high and will also affect employment in the building industry? Having regard to the fact that unemployment has now reached 150,000, an all-time record, have the Government any plans to deal with interest rates and with unemployment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill 1982 is limited in scope and is designed, in the main, to deal with matters in relation to which urgent action is needed.  The provisions of the Bill can be grouped under five main headings, as follows: (1) duration of planning permissions, (2) validity of certain permissions, (3) general policy directives, (4) penalties for planning offences, and (5) fees for applications and appeals.  The Explanatory Memorandum which has already been circulated with the Bill deals in some detail with the individuals sections.  I propose, therefore, at this stage to order my remarks on the basis of the general headings I have just mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 2, 3, 4, 11 and 14 of the Bill are concerned with the duration of permissions and are designed to replace section 29 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976. <Col N="2464" /> Under that section all permissions granted before 1 November 1976 ceased to have effect on 31 October 1981 unless they were extended by the planning authority and all other permissions similarly cease to have effect five years after the date of the granting of the permission unless so extended.  In the latter half of 1981 numerous representations were made to the then Minister for the Environment from individuals and from legal and professional interests regarding the effect of section 29 and the difficulties which were being experienced in its operation.  In addition, certain defects in the section came to light and it was considered desirable that these should be put right.  In these circumstances, the previous Minister announced on 16 December 1981 that he intended to introduce legislation at an early date to repeal and replace section 29.  His proposal was that permissions which expired under existing law on 31 October 1981 would be extended for a period of one year from that date and that all other permissions would have a life of six years.  The statement indicated that the changes proposed were considered to be justified because of the lack of awareness on the part of many people of the limit on the life of their permissions and because the five year period allowed under existing law was too short in the case of some major developments.  The development of legislation to implement the proposals announced in December 1981 had not been completed when the Coalition Government left office in March 1982.</P>
    <P>Having reviewed the position in some detail, this Government decided to implement the undertaking in regard to the extension of existing permission and, in addition, to introduce a new procedure to eliminate difficulties caused for both developers and planning authorities in dealing with applications under section 29 for the extension of permissions.  It would obviously be of little benefit to many people to provide at this stage for an additional year's life for permission which expired last October.  Accordingly, to allow for the lapse of time since the previous Minister's announcement in December 1981, section 2 of the Bill provides <Col N="2465" /> that permissions granted before 1 November 1976 will expire on 31 October 1983.  On the other hand, the Government are satisfied that the life of permissions granted in the future should not, in general, exceed five years and section 2 of the Bill provides accordingly.  The previous Government had intended to extend the life of all future permissions to six years but I do not consider it to be necessary or desirable to provide for a general relaxation of this kind.  On the contrary, I believe that a five-year duration for future permissions, coupled with the new provisions of sections 3 and 4, which I shall explain later, is a better solution.  It will encourage speedier development and will be less conducive to delayed commencements and to undesirable consequences as regards dereliction and urban blight.</P>
    <P>It is however necessary to make some form of tapering arrangement in respect of permissions granted between November 1976 and November 1982.  Section 2 provides for this.  Permissions granted during that period will last until 31 October 1987 or seven years after the granting of the permission, whichever is the shorter period.</P>
    <P>I consider that the new provisions of section 2 will achieve a reasonable balance between the objective of encouraging early development and redevelopment and the practical problems encountered by developers of all kinds in commencing and completing their developments.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, mention that where, under section 29 (9) of the 1976 Act a planning authority have already extended the duration of a planning permission by a period which is longer than that which is being provided for by section 2 of the Bill, that extension will continue to have effect.  There is little option on this point: if such extensions were to be invalidated now serious hardship and adverse financial consequences could ensure for persons who entered contracts and made commitments in good faith on the basis of the law as it stood at the time.  On the other hand, the fact that an extension has been refused under existing law will not limit in any way the <Col N="2466" /> application to a particular permission of the extended periods of duration provided for in the section.</P>
    <P>Section 2 contains provisions which are necessarily complex about the scope and effect of the new provision regarding the duration of permissions.  Detailed discussion of these will be more appropriate on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for a degree of flexibility in regard to the duration of permissions which is lacking in the existing section.  It will allow planning authorities, as part of a grant of permission, to specify a period of duration longer than five years in cases where they consider that the nature and extent of the development or any other material consideration would warrant this.  I envisage that this provision could be used in the case of continuing developments, such as quarries or in relation to large, complex developments which could take a long time to get under way.  Refusal by a planning authority to exercise their power under section 3, or a decision by a planning authority to specify a particular period, may be appealed to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties created by section 29 of the 1976 Act was that it did not specify any procedure in relation to extension applications and, indeed, did not even require a formal application to be made, Moreover, no time limit was specified for dealing with applications and no criteria for deciding applications were laid down.  Section 4, and the regulations to be made under section 11, should eliminate these difficulties.</P>
    <P>Under section 4, criteria are set out for the granting of extensions and the section is drafted so as to require planning authorities to grant an appropriate extension where an application complying with these requirements is made.  The requirements are&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  that a proper application is made in accordance with the regulations;</P>
    <P>(ii)  that any other requirements of the regulations are complied with &mdash; for example that any necessary supporting documents or information is submitted &mdash; and;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2467" /> (iii)  that the planning authority are satisfied that the development has commenced, that substantial works have been carried out and that the development will be completed within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;substantial works&rdquo; is not defined, leaving it to be given an ordinary commonsense meaning in the particular circumstances of each case.  Having regard to the wide range of developments for which permission can be granted, any attempt to define &ldquo;substantial works&rdquo; could lead to serious difficulties and it seems best, therefore, not to attempt such a definition.</P>
    <P>Under section 4, one extension only can be granted by a planning authority except where the relevant development has not been completed due to circumstances beyond the control of the person carrying out the development.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned already, section 11 will enable regulations to be made regulating procedure in relation to applications for extensions.  It will also permit regulations to be made to deal with any consequential or other matter necessary to give full effect to sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill.  The section is based generally on section 25 of the 1963 Act under which the regulations dealing with planning applications are made.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for savers which are necessary as a result of the replacement of section 29 of the 1976 Act.  These can best be dealt with on Committee Stage, as can the repeals of certain subsections of section 29 which are included in section 15.</P>
    <P>I turn now to section 6 of the Bill, the purpose of which is to remove doubts about the validity of certain permissions and approvals granted on appeal before 15 March 1977 when An Bord Pleanála took over appeals functions.  The need to do this arises from the decision of the Supreme Court in <i>The State (Pine Valley Developments Ltd.) v. Dublin County Council</i> (judgments delivered 5 February 1982).  In that case, the court held that the Minister for Local Government had <Col N="2468" /> no power, in determining a planning appeal, to grant permission for a development which contravened materially the relevant development plan.  I should emphasise that the Minister was not a party to the case and had no notice that the important point of law involved was to be raised or decided in the Supreme Court in the case.</P>
    <P>The Pine Valley decision has to be seen against the background that, in determining planning appeals, successive Ministers for Local Government had always been advised that they had power to grant a permission even in material contravention of a development plan.  A significant number of such decisions were made between 1964 and 1977, when the function of determining appeals passed to An Bord Pleanála, but it would not be possible to attempt to identify all of the cases which might conceivably be involved. However, cases are known, the facts of which appear to be similar on this issue to those of the Pine Valley case; these include cases involving very substantial housing and industrial developments.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court decision has given rise to unease and uncertainty in the construction industry, among the financial institutions and in the legal profession.  It is particularly undesirable that purchases of land, dwellings and other buildings have been made, and that contracts and commitments have been entered into, in good faith, on foot of permissions which are now open to challenge in the courts. Serious problems are arising not only for builders who have developments in progress but also for owners of completed buildings.  Problems are also arising in closing sales of new houses and other property.  The Incorporated Law Society have been in touch with me to express their concern about the effect of the Pine Valley decision.  The society feel that many innocent parties would be involved in considerable hardship unless the situation is latered.  As the society see it, this hardship would affect people changing house or buying a new house, who could be on bridging finance and unable to complete a mortgage or sale because of the doubt now cast on the planning permission for the property.  For this reason, the <Col N="2469" /> society have urged the introduction of legislation to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>Before deciding to introduce legislation to deal with the matter, an effort was made to have the relevant point of law reviewed in the course of another case which is before the Supreme Court, but that case will not now be taken until the term commencing in October 1982 and I cannot, of course, be certain as to the outcome of the case even then.  In these circumstances, and having regard to the disruption and hardship which have arisen, the only sensible course at this stage is to enact a provision which will put the matter beyond doubt.  Section 6, accordingly, makes it clear that a permission or approval granted on appeal prior to 15 March 1977 (when An Bord Pleanála took over appeals functions) shall not be invalid by reason only of the fact that the development concerned would materially contravene the development plan.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that the Minister shall, from time to time, issue such general directives as to policy in relation to planning and development as he considers necessary.  Subsection (3) makes it clear that the power conferred by the section may not be used in relation to particular cases.  Essentially, section 7 is a re-enactment of section 6 of the 1976 Act extended to apply to planning authorities as well as to An Bord Pleanála.  The terms of section 6 are otherwise unchanged.  In 1981, planning authorities received approximately 54,200 planning applications while An Bord Pleanála received over 4,500 planning appeals.  It is anomalous in these circumstances that planning authorities are not required to have regard to ministerial policy directives as to planning and development which apply to the board.  Clearly, the same criteria should be applied at local level and at appeals level, and the new section will enable this to be achieved.  Section 6 of the 1976 Act will be repealed by section 15 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Only one directive has been issued under section 6 of the 1976 Act.  This directive was given by me to An Bord Pleanála in May 1981, and related to policy on large retail establishments. When the Bill is enacted, I intend that <Col N="2470" /> the May 1981 Directive will be re-issued to planning authorities and to the board. This will be consistent with the Government's commitment to the continuance of a policy of freedom of choice for consumers as between large-scale and independently owned retail outlets.</P>
    <P>Sections 8, 9 and 13 of the Bill are concerned with the level of penalties for offences under the Planning Acts.  The wider question of enforcement will be considered as part of the general review of planning law which I am carrying out at present, but the present Bill is being used to provide, as an interim measure, for higher penalties as a deterrent to those who contravene the requirements of the Acts.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 8 is to increase the monetary penalties for all offences under the 1963 and 1976 Acts to take account of the fall in money values.  For the less serious summary offences, a maximum penalty of £100 is provided for in place of the fines of £20, £10 and £5 which now apply.  The more serious offences which now attract fines of £250 on summary conviction will carry a maximum fine of £800.  The legal advice available is that this is the maximum penalty which can be prescribed at present while retaining the offences within the category of minor offences which can be dealt with in the District Court.  The offences which will attract the new maximum fine of £800 include failure to comply with the conditions of permissions in regard, for example, to housing estates and other development.  The penalties for further or continuing offences related to the basic offences are being increased pro-rata (that is from £2, £5 or £10 a day to £25 a day in the case of lesser offences and from £50 to £150 in the case of the more serious offences).</P>
    <P>Section 8 (3) makes provision, for the first time, for indictable offences in the case of two basic offences under the Planning Acts.  These are the offences under section 24 (3) of the 1963 Act of carrying out development, in respect of which permission is required, save under and in accordance with a permission, and the offence under section 26 (4) of the 1976 Act of failing to comply with a warning <Col N="2471" /> notice, or knowingly assisting or permitting development in contravention of a notice, or damaging or removing a tree to which such a notice relates.  On conviction on indictment of either of these offences, a person will be liable to a fine of up to £10,000, or up to two years' imprisonment, or both.  These penalties are intended to be a real deterrent in the case of flagrant breaches of the Planning Acts and are an indication of the seriousness with which the Government view such breaches.  Clearly, however, every contravention of the relevant sections will not warrant such large penalties or, indeed, being dealt with as an indictable offence.  It will be a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide when to press for a trial on indictment and when to consent to a summary trial in the District Court.  Section 9, accordingly, permits a justice of the District Court to try summarily an indictable offence where the Justice is of opinion that the facts constitute a minor offence, the Director of Public Prosecutions consents, and the defendant does not object to a summary trial instead of a trial by jury.</P>
    <P>Where an indictable offence is tried summarily under section 9, the section provides for maximum penalties of £800, or six months' imprisonment, or both, plus further fines and/or imprisonment for continuing offences.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is consequential on the provision in section 8 for indictable offences. As it stands, section 80 of the 1963 Act provides that any planning offence may be prosecuted by the relevant planning authority.  Since the Director of Public Prosecutions is responsible for the prosecution of indictable offences, it is necessary to confine the planning authority's power under section 80 (1) to summary offences, and section 13 provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Finally, I come to the provisions of the Bill in relation to fees for planning applications and appeals.  The main provision is section 10 but sections 5 and 12 are related.  Under section 10, the Minister for the Environment will have power to make regulations, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, providing for the <Col N="2472" /> payment of fees to planning authorities and to An Bord Pleanála in relation to the various categories of planning applications, appeals, and so on.  Where fees are prescribed in relation to a planning application, the two-month period during which the planning authority must determine the application will not begin to run until the fee has been received by the planning authority.  Similarly, where fees are prescribed in relation to appeals, provision is made under which the appeal will not be valid unless the fee is received by the board within the period specified for the making of the appeal.  In addition to enabling fees to be prescribed for payment by the main parties to applications and appeals, the section makes provision for the payment of fees by other persons who wish to make submissions or observations either to the planning authority or to the board as regards an application, appeal and so on.  Provision is also made under which an additional fee could be prescribed in respect of requests for oral hearings of appeals or references to the board.</P>
    <P>The power to make regulations under section 10 is deliberately framed in a flexible manner.  In particular, it is made clear that the regulations may provide for the payment of different fees in relation to cases of different classes or descriptions. This power could be used to require relatively small fees to be paid for single house applications or for other minor developments as compared, for example, with the fees for major commercial developments.  The power to allow for complete exemption from the payment of fees in circumstances specified in the regulations, or for the waiver, remission or refund, in whole or in part, of fees in specified circumstances could be used to make special provision in relation to certain categories of applications at local level or to make special provision in relation to appeals by prescribed categories of persons or bodies.</P>
    <P>The question of charging fees in relation to the processing of planning applications and appeals has been raised at intervals in the past 10 years and has been considered in detail in more recent years in the context of other changes in the <Col N="2473" /> system of local finance.  In May 1980, for example, a paper on local government finance prepared by the County and City Managers' Association recommended that local authorities should be empowered to charge for the &ldquo;investigation and determination of planning applications&rdquo;. Following consideration of proposals submitted by the former Minister for the Environment, the Coalition Government decided in December 1981 that legislation should be prepared to enable planning fees to be introduced.  This intention was confirmed at the time of the January 1982 budget.  The legislation now before the House is the same as that decided on by the former Government, and I trust that this will be borne in mind in the debate.</P>
    <P>I might mention that the cost of planning control at local level in 1981 is estimated at £6.86 million.  The total number of planning applications in that year was 54,200.  The average cost of dealing with applications was about £280 in County Dublin and the four county boroughs, and £85 in the other counties.  In areas outside of Dublin and other major growth areas, a high proportion of total applications relate to housing &mdash; either extensions of existing houses or proposals to erect new single houses or small groups of houses.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Bill will enable the existing requirement as regards appeal deposits to be repealed when fees regulations are made.  The deposit of £10 is no real deterrent to frivolous or vexatious appeals.  In the past number of years, only a very small number of appeals have been declared by the board to be vexatious &mdash; 14 in 1979 and 13 in 1980.  This does not mean that a much higher proportion of appeals may not have been without substance but is a consequence of the legal interpretation of &ldquo;vexatious&rdquo; as used in the 1976 Act.  It appears that &ldquo;vexatious&rdquo; in that sense is held not to include, for example, causing unnecessary delay and is not synonymous with being frivolous or without foundation. The fact that only a small number of appeals is formally declared to be vexatious cannot be taken as an indication that all others are reasonable.  In practice, <Col N="2474" /> the true nature of an appeal which is vexatious, or frivolous, or without merit, may not emerge until processing of the case is well advanced or almost completed. Each appeal is, of course, dealt with on its merits, and experience has shown that few can formally be declared to be vexatious, given the legal interpretation of that word.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the fact that the £10 deposit system does nothing, in present day circumstances, to deter vexatious or frivolous appeals, there is also the consideration that the deposit system creates unnecessary administrative cost for the board.  The receipt of deposits, the preparation and issue of receipts, the maintenance of deposit ledgers, the refund of deposits and so on, all give rise to an expenditure of staff time which is entirely disproportionate to any benefits a deposit system may bring.</P>
    <P>One illustration of the ineffectiveness of the deposit system is that there are now more than 1,000 appeals which have been effectively abandoned by those who lodged them, notwithstanding that £10 deposits have been paid in respect of the appeals.  The appellants in these cases have only to notify the board of the withdrawal of their appeal or application to secure the refund of the £10 but they do not take the trouble to do so.  The deposits in these cases have to continue to be held in suspense and accounted for yearly in the books and records of the board.  It is this which provides the immediate need for section 5 of the Bill which will establish a mechanism to enable An Bord Pleanála to deal with these cases as part of a general power to dispose of cases which the board are of opinion have been abandoned.</P>
    <P>References and appeals are regularly made to the board and not proceeded with.  In some cases, there may be a request to hold an appeal in abeyance.  If such requests are reasonable, they will be acceded to by the board.  Section 5 is not designed to interfere with that system. However, where an appellant simply does not co-operate in processing the case, or, in effect, abandons it, the board have no way of dealing with that situation, except to determine the original <Col N="2475" /> application, involving a commitment of time and effort which should go to more pressing cases.  What section 5 proposes is, in effect, to confer a power on the board to enable them to clear from their books cases where the appellant has clearly lost interest in pursuing his appeal.  Before exercising their powers under section 5, the board will be required to serve appropriate notice on the parties and to invite submissions in relation to the matter.  Any such submissions will have to be considered by the board before an appeal is formally declared to be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Bill will allow the fee for a copy of an entry in the planning register to be increased by regulations. The fee fixed by section 8 of the 1963 Act is 10 shillings which, under the Decimal Currency Act, 1969, must now be construed as 50 pence.  In fixing the new fee account will be taken of the fall in the value of money.  The planning authority register is used for the purpose of recording all entries required under the Planning Acts in relation to all land within the area of a planning authority.  Copies of entries are required mainly for conveyancing or other legal purposes and are sought primarily by solicitors, auctioneers, architects and estate agents.  It is reasonable to increase the fee having regard to rising production costs.</P>
    <P>I undertook in the House, on 6 July, to report in the course of this debate on the administration of the draft building regulations.  Deputy Quinn raised the matter then.  With the permission of the Chair, I shall endeavour to give the House as full a statement as is possible on the subject.  I propose to go into some detail on the history of the matter, not to justify the length of time which the process has taken, but as a necessary background to an understanding of the present position and the complexity and importance of the subject.</P>
    <P>The power to make building regulations, and I stress that it is a power and not a duty, was given in sections 86 to 88 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  The intention was that these national building regulations <Col N="2476" /> would apply uniformly throughout the State and would replace local building by-laws which a small number of local authorities operate by virtue of powers under the Public Health Acts.</P>
    <P>These by-laws are over and above the provisions of the Planning Acts and require, as a general rule, that a person proposing to erect or alter a building should not merely get planning permission where required but also get approval under the by-laws.  There is no appeal against refusal of approval.  The by-laws contain many useful provisions, but it is inevitable that with developments in building technology they would become out-of-date.  A uniform approach throughout the country was desirable. The basis of administration of the by-laws, involving as it did waiting for approval with no right of appeal, could lead to delays and frustration.</P>
    <P>Following the coming into operation of the 1963 Act, An Foras Forbartha were asked to prepare recommendations for the technical content of the proposed regulations.  This they did with the help of a committee and sub-committees on which a wide range of specialists sat, including representatives of the professions. The committee reported in 1969. Consultation with the building industry ensued and resulted in technical changes.</P>
    <P>It was then necessary to put the document into legal form to ensure that the requirements would be enforceable in law.  This was an extremely complex task. Eventually the draft regulations issued in 1976 to the building industry and the professions with a request for any comments they had.  In the meantime, I should say that it had become clear that certain amendments of the relevant provisions of the 1963 Act were desirable and these had been effected in the 1976 Act.</P>
    <P>More than 500 different comments were received on the 1976 draft and these were considered and where appropriate accepted.  However, a more fundamental issue had been raised by the building industry.  They were concerned that the proposed method of implementation and control, involving the submission of plans and other documents for approval to the <Col N="2477" /> local authority, would create inhibitory and costly delays in getting construction projects under way and seriously affect efficiency and employment in the industry. It was also clear that the system proposed would involve the recruitment and training of a substantial number of staff in each local authority area, particularly those without by-law controls, and this would impose a substantial financial burden on local authorities at a time when, in common with other elements of the public service, they were having to face unavoidable limits on resources.  And it would take a substantial amount of time to train and recruit the numbers involved. Alternative solutions had to be considered, and so emerged the idea of a certification system of control.  Under it a designer would certify that the lodged plans for a building complied with the regulations and on completion the builder would similarly certify the building. The local authority would act as registrar for the certificates and oversee the system in their area, making spot-checks to ensure that certification was not being abused.  In turn the Minister would receive reports from local authorities and oversee the system nationally.  There would be close co-operation between the building control and the fire staffs of the local authority.</P>
    <P>That was more or less the position as I remember it on taking up office late in 1980.  The amendment of the draft regulations was being finalised, and a certification system of control was being drafted in consultation with the industry. Naturally, following the Stardust tragedy, everything was done to speed up this process.  The draft regulations, with a list of approved amendments, were issued to local authorities with a request that they take them into account in dealing with planning applications, and likewise to the building industry and the professions. Shortly afterwards a comprehensive revised document issued.  About the same time a document setting out a full control system based on certification issued to the building trade and the professions for comment, and work was completed on the preparation of heads of legislation which were then circulated to <Col N="2478" /> the many Departments concerned.  The legislation is necessary because of the need to cover such items as energy conservation in the regulations, to provide for EEC requirements and to cover the certification system.  Consultation with Departments has been completed, but we shall of course have to consider the Tribunal's recommendations before deciding on the terms of legislation.</P>
    <P>Consultation with the industry and the professions has been ongoing.  While this related chiefly to the control system, the professions raised some aspects of the regulations, as drafted, particularly those dealing with fire, and they have been specially considered in my Department. I shortly expect a considered report from the professions on the latest draft of the regulations and the proposed control system. Again the Tribunal's recommendations will have to be considered.  To speed up that consideration, I have arranged for the immediate examination by a special group in my Department of the Tribunal's recommendations on the draft regulations.</P>
    <P>We are also considering as a matter of urgency the Tribunal's recommendation that the fire aspects of the draft regulations should be taken separately and quickly brought into force.  I may say that we had already considered this, but it appeared that the provisions of the draft regulations regarding structural matters are inextricably related to those regarding fire, since a building must be designed as a whole.  However, we shall look at this again.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, we are looking at the Tribunal's recommendation that a by-law approval type system should be used for fire aspects even if a certification system is used for others.  Such a concept would certainly require careful examination and consultation with the industry and professions and the local authorities. It may come to a clear choice between certification on the one hand, or by-law type approval on the other, for all aspects, with all that that entails.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should make the point that building regulations are exclusively concerned with new building work or with changes in the use of a building.  Other <Col N="2479" /> features of the Tribunal's recommendations, for example, those related to management regulations, seem to relate to fire legislation and do not come within the scope of building regulations, and I do not propose to deal with them here. They can be discussed in the debate on the Tribunal's report promised for the next session.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should make it clear that the Bill now before the House is regarded by me as a short-term measure only and that I see a need for further legislation to bring about the improvements required in our planning system. A general review of that system is being carried out so as to enable us to decide what changes are necessary to improve the performance of the system and to speed up the decision-making process at local and at appeals level.  Clearly, it will take some time to complete this exercise and to introduce and enact whatever legislative proposals may be decided upon. In the meantime I will be asking planning authorities to review their own approach to planning control so as to ensure that the system will not have the effect of causing delays in the commencement of worthwhile development and in the creation of jobs.  Work on the preparation of a substantial memorandum containing advice and guidelines to assist planning authorities in reviewing their procedures is well advanced in my Department.</P>
    <P>The present Bill, although it is an interim one, provides for some necessary and desirable modifications of existing law.  In addition, some of its provisions are urgently required for reasons I have explained earlier.  In these circumstances, I trust that the House will co-operate with me in giving the Bill a speedy passage through all Stages.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The idea of physical planning was first introduced in this country in the thirties, and, I think, modified in the early forties. The enactments which dealt with that attempt to regulate planning and development were the Town and Regional Planning Acts.  I say &ldquo;attempt&rdquo; because <Col N="2480" /> I think the intervention of the Second World War and other complications meant that that attempt never got off the ground.  At that time each local authority were obliged to prepare a draft town plan within a certain period.  I think power was given to extend the time within which those draft plans were to have been prepared, but the whole thing ground to a halt and did not materialise.  However, the idea was there and the necessity for planning was recognised at that time.</P>
      <P>The basic legislation dealing with planning and development is the Planning and Development Act of 1963, quite a large Bill which was enacted by the Oireachtas after much consideration. The wisdom of controlling planning and development cannot be questioned.  The necessity for it is obvious.  Indeed it would be frightening to try to visualise this country now, even were there no planning laws, if planning were allowed to go ahead higgledy piggledy without let or hindrance.  In the interests of our environment and of preserving our heritage for future generations there is an obvious need for controlling planning.  However, it must be recognised also that there should be a balanced approach to planning. We must recognise that if, on the one hand, we had very strict planning and environmental control, we could have the purest environment one could imagine but we would have no industrial progress, no economic growth and we would have a small population.  On the other hand, we could visualise allowing development, planning, building, the change of use of land all to go ahead without control when, for a short time, we might have quite an affluent country but one in which nobody would want to live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1963 Act did not make any provision for putting a limit on the duration of planning permissions.  Once they were given they lasted without limit.  That was an undesirable state of affairs because people, having obtained planning permissions, could delay building on the land until the ground for which permission was given became more valuable.  The 1976 Act amended that by putting a limit of five years on planning permissions. <Col N="2481" /> One would have thought that the holders of planning permissions granted under the 1976 Act would have borne in mind that such permissions would run out within a certain time and that they would have made a greater effort to build on the land.  I do not know whether they thought they would automatically get new permissions or that the permissions granted would be extended but many of the permissions granted were not availed of.</P>
    <P>Deputy Peter Barry when he was Minister for the Environment received representations in regard to many planning permissions that were out of date. He gave an undertaking that he would revive them, extending them for a specific period, one year.  The Bill before the House proposes to extend permissions that have run out of date and were granted before 1976 by two years.  It is our view that an extension of one year is sufficient and, consequently, I have tabled an amendment to that effect. Deputy Barry also indicated that in future planning permissions would last for six years but the Bill before the House proposes that they should be valid only for five years.  I have no fixed views about that but I will avail of the opportunity on Committee Stage of discussing this matter with the Minister.</P>
    <P>Planning permissions are very important to all builders, large, moderate and small.  In fact, they are of greater value to the small or moderate builder than to the wealthy one because they give such people an opportunity to arrange finance.  The granting of a planning permission alone will not build houses and builders must arrange for finance.  The fact that permission is valid for a reasonable time enables people to arrange their finance.  The fact that a builder has planning permission in respect of a property other than that on which he is building is accepted as security in the bank for advances.  It is because of that that such permissions are important.  Some of these are what I call conditional permissions and are subject to the performance of a condition precedent which is usually the provision of services or things of that nature.  Very frequently a builder, or a <Col N="2482" /> person holding a planning permission, does not have control over this condition. The planning permission does not become operable until the condition has been fulfilled although a builder may not have control over that.  It is only reasonable, therefore, that time should not run against the holder of a planning permission until the condition has been fulfilled. Very frequently this must be done by the local authority.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment I have tabled in regard to this because it represents a reasonable attitude on a matter that is of great importance to the building industry. It may take a number of years to provide the services with the result that a builder will only have a limited period in which to erect a building and that is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for an extension of two years in the case of old planning permissions and provides that in future they will last for five years.  I suggest that the extension to two years should be reduced to one year.  Section 3 enables a planning authority to grant permission for a period longer than three years if there is a reason for doing so.  That could be the extent of the development or some other peculiar circumstances.  That is a reasonable section.  It introduces some flexibility into the planning laws and I am in favour of it.  Section 4 provides that a planning authority shall have power to extend existing planning permissions where the work had started and a substantial amount of the work has been done and where it is likely that the job will be finished.  The Minister has said that only one extension may be given unless such work is held up due to circumstances beyond the control of the holder of the planning permission such as a strike or something like that.  I see one flaw in that, in that there does not appear to be any right of appeal to the applicant or to an objector.  There should be a right of appeal to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>Section 5 gives power to declare references, appeals and applications withdrawn and I regard that as no more than a tidying up exercise.  Section 6 deals with the Pine Valley case and appeals heard before 1977.  People acted in good faith <Col N="2483" /> and spent a lot of money on building based on permissions given by various Ministers before that year, and it is only right that they should be validated.  I am not sure about the position, whether it has been remedied or do we have to await the Supreme Court decision in another case which the Minister has brought?  The present Minister was not a party to those proceedings; he did not have an opportunity to argue the case, but he might be able to tell us whether the board have a right to contravene planned programmes. I imagine that was made right by the 1966 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 7 could be controversial.  It gives the Minister power to issue directives to planning authorities and to the board.  It could be argued that this provides the Minister with a way back into planning procedures.  Without introducing politics, it was right and proper that planning decisions should be taken out of the pressure of politics and the pressures which politicians are subjected to.  The Minister should tell us a lot more about his ideas in this section which enables him to give directives.  I admit there is also provision for publishing such directives in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and for giving notice, but at the same time I hope the Minister will be able to tell us the sort of directives he has in mind, because if he has in mind anything which could influence or limit categories of planning matters I will object to it.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is the penalty clause.  The penalties in the old Acts which we are amending were trivial and it is reasonable to increase them, but I think we are taking a chance when we increase from £250 to £800 the penalty on summary conviction. The Supreme Court held that a penalty of £500 was consistent with trivial offences, the type which the Constitution states may be tried in a court of summary jurisdiction, the District Court.  It is now proposed to increase such penalties to £800, and because the Supreme Court, I feel sure, recognises inflation, I think these penalties will stand up.</P>
    <P>Section 10 enables the Minister to introduce regulations to provide for the payment of fees.  In this respect the Minister <Col N="2484" /> went on the defensive immediately and said it is not very far removed from what the Coalition Government had in mind.  Before he became Minister, Deputy Burke in 1981 went to Kilkenny and made a long speech to a meeting of county managers.  Deputy Kelly gets copies of all those speeches.  This one spelled out in no uncertain terms how the managers and councils could find a substitute for rates.  He told them they could get £1 million out of planning applications.  We are not going back to 1981, but a bit further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): It is the job of a Government to introduce proposals, to introduce legislation, and it is the business of the Opposition to listen to representations to them and to bring them to the House.  I submit there is danger in making these regulations now and the Minister would want to be careful not to go overboard when he has in mind ways and means to find money to replace rates.  Without doubt, local authorities are starved of money.  We could talk about that for longer than the time available to us this evening, but in a situation like this I think the Minister for Finance might advise the Minister now in the House to be realistic when he draws up these regulations.</P>
      <P>Like the prevention of pollution, orderly planning and development are necessary in the national interest, in the interests of the entire community, and I would argue, as I have done for many years, that this should be the primary responsibility and the burden of the entire population who benefit from it.  It is hard to argue against that reasonable approach.  For instance, when we enforce anti-pollution laws we do it for the benefit of the entire country.  When people are asked to restrict their planning and development activities in Mayo or Kerry very often they do it for the benefit of others, such as those living in Dublin suburbs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure every Deputy has got many <Col N="2485" /> representations in regard to the proposed fee whose size does not appear in the Bill.  I have got dozens of representations, and to ask people to pay £30 for planning appeals &mdash; they are doing it in the national interest and in the interest of their respective areas &mdash; is going a bit far. The Minister has told us there have been few vexatious appeals.  He went on to say that the term, &ldquo;vexatious&rdquo; needed definition. But I am sure that if there were unreasonable appeals we would have been told about it too and he would have told us.  Therefore, I would be in favour of urging the Minister, if he has this figure of £30 in mind, to cut it down.  There are a number of amendments standing in the name of Deputy De Rossa and I will have something to say when we reach those.  It is a great pity that we have such a limited time for this Bill.  I know we have agreed to it but it is another indication of the absurd way we are forced to do our business. We certainly cannot do justice to these Bills and it has been proved on numerous occasions that hasty legislation is bad legislation.</P>
    <P>Delays are very frustrating and we very often have delays with the planning authorities.  But at least there is some curb on the planning authorities in that they must deal with a planning application within two months.  But we know that they find ways around that by asking for further information and the thing drags on and on for a long time.  But an appeal to An Bord Pleanála can take much more than a year.  That is quite unreasonable.  It is an obstruction of people who want to get on with their business.  I keep repeating that Departments of State, semi-State bodies and corporations of one sort or another seem to put the life of a man at about 500 years. They certainly think that a period of five years in a man's lifetime is nothing, but it is quite a sizeable bite and to hold up these planning matters from the time when the application first goes in for maybe three years is quite unreasonable. I have put down an amendment here to make it obligatory on An Bord Pleanála to hear, determine and give a decision on the appeal within six months from the date on which the appeal has been <Col N="2486" /> lodged.  It was suggested to me that I should have put in three months instead of six months.  Perhaps I should, but certainly there should be an obligation on An Bord Pleanála to deal with the matter finally within six months and if they have not enough staff or advisors or inspectors they should get them.</P>
    <P>By and large An Bord Pleanála discharge their duty in a satisfactory manner and by and large their decisions are accepted.  Therefore, when one comes across a decision that it seems nearly impossible to understand it sticks out like a sore thumb.  I came across one of these decisions given by 12 or 18 months ago and I find it very difficult to understand the decision.  There was an appeal from a local authority granting permission.  The board allowed the appeal subject to a condition which meant agreement between the applicant and the local authority.  The local authority refused to agree to the condition because they said that was the whole point in the objection; that was why they would not entertain it. Again, the appeal goes back to An Bord Pleanála and they grant the appeal again.</P>
    <P>A short time after that there was another application made for a similar type of development but much less extensive within a very short distance, a matter of a couple of hundred yards of the previous one, and it was rejected again by the local authority in pursuance of their policy for this area.  It goes back on appeal and it is turned down and it was a very strenuous job to get an oral hearing. But certain things happened and an oral hearing was eventually given.  The general opinion is that the reason for refusing the first application was much stronger than that for refusing the second. I do not want to go into details but great care needs to be taken even at the highest level in An Bord Pleanála to see that things like that do not slip through. I must say that I would need a lot of convincing that this one did not slip through because it is something that sticks out like a sore thumb.  I do not want to identify places or people but An Bord Pleanála must maintain the high reputation and the high standard for integrity that it has.</P>
    <P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether that is an invitation to be sharp or brief but presumably it is a combination of both. In this instance I propose to be exceptionally brief.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party gave a clear undertaking to representatives of the building industry and to the Government that we would co-operate in getting this legislation passed during this session in a constructive manner because of the context in which the request was made and because of the climate in the building industry which is something just short of disastrous.  In so doing we are not waiving our democratic rights to have enabling legislation brought through this House under proper scrutiny.  Nor are we waiving the rights to improve the existing legislation.  I take it from what the Minister said in his speech that he will be bringing in legislation to cover regulations arising out of the administration of the national building regulations scheme &mdash; presumably it will be another Local Government Planning Bill &mdash; and that will give us an opportunity to amend those sections of the existing body of legislation that we see fit to amend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context I propose to confine my remarks as sharply and as distinctly as I can to what I consider to be the three main issues contained in this legislation. The first is that we should recognise that it is simply enabling legislation and contains little or nothing of policy <i>per se.</i> Within that context the first item that it proposes to deal with administratively is <Col N="2488" /> the withering clause, as it is referred to, in the building industry generally.  The point should be made that if it had not been for the collective incompetence of all of us this amendment would not be necessary.  I would put the blame on the Department who were not prepared to move two or three years ago and face the inevitable reality of 31 October 1981.  We should not waste time on this aspect but we should recognise why we have to deal with this problem and draw some lessons from it for the future.</P>
    <P>The Bill also addresses itself to the rectification of the Pine Valley decision. I accept totally the argument put forward by the Minister in relation to the judgment of the Supreme Court.  I have been critical at other times of decisions made by the Supreme Court but I will be more orderly on this occasion and make no comment, except to say that I support the judgment of the Department and the Minister.  We support the section unreservedly. I always understood that the Minister of the day had the power materially to contravene the development plan of an authority and the 1976 Act specifically conferred that power on the board.  I failed to understand the decision in relation to Pine Valley but it is essential to tidy up this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 10 empowers the Minister by regulation to fix charges and fees in relation to applications for planning permission. This is potentially the most contentious of the components of this Bill because we are being asked to give the Minister the power to make regulations which will not have to be laid before the House before becoming law.  These regulations simply require the consent of the Minister for Finance.  I am somewhat wary of giving an open cheque to a Minister for the Environment who may be hard pressed for cash at local authority level.</P>
    <P>There are many amendments which could be made to the body of planning and development legislation but at the request of the building industry, which is now experiencing a major economic crisis, we have agreed in principle to let this legislation go through and to make our points during this debate.  When legislation <Col N="2489" /> is introduced before Christmas to administer national building regulations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The Deputy is optimistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had this trait for a long time, particularly in relation to time-tables.  I do not presume to abandon my optimism but I want other people to hurry up.</P>
      <P>The life of a planning permission is critical from a point of view of operatives working on a building site, people working in the architect's office or the solicitor's office or people serving AnCO apprenticeships.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate whether section 3 will enable a local authority to extend or to determine the life expectancy of a planning permission beyond five years, having regard to any conditions that the local authority may set in that planning permission. The Minister will be familiar with the very fair argument that planning permissions should come into effect only when the operable conditions attached to the permission are capable of being implemented.  Frequently members of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael make outrageous rezoning proposals in County Dublin and elsewhere so that planning permission must be granted, although in reality it cannot be implemented because of the lack of services.  Planning permissions are sometimes obtained from a local authority which are not capable of being implemented because some of the conditions which must be complied with are totally outside the control of the recipient of the permission and totally within the control of the local authority.  It seems contradictory to grant a planning permission with a legal life span of five years when one of the conditions of the permission is outside the control of the recipient and vested exclusively in the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have come across a kind of fifth column rearguard action by officials in local authorities rejecting, rightly or wrongly, the section 4 mandate imposed on them by local councillors and effectively undermining the decision to grant permission <Col N="2490" /> by imposing constraints and conditions by way of sewerage and water supplies which effectively negative the planning permission.  It is my contention that the amendments proposed by Deputy Fitzpatrick can be more effectively embodied in the interpretation of section 3.  I do not like the idea of issuing directives to local authorities or of reducing in any way the powers of local authorities.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that point on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Pine Valley decision poses no problem for us and it is correct that this legal doubt should be cleared up.  It has undermined the sale of a number of sites and has brought about the collapse in the building industry of a number of jobs, to the detriment of the entire industry.  It is no coincidence that we were talking at the end of Question Time about industrial relations in the building industry because it is now in major crisis.  Fortunately it is beginning to dawn on many people in the building industry that a Fianna Fáil Government are not synonymous with good times.  The cyclical nature of our market economy is taking a savage toll on the building industry.  It is essential to get some kind of rational planned input of capital to even out the troughs and booms which have affected the industry for so long.  Lawyers and lending institutions have gone through planning permission with a fine tooth comb with the purpose of minimising the risk to their shareholders or clients.  I am glad that this legislation removes some legal doubts.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for taking up my suggestion of 6 July by referring to the Stardust Tribunal.  It is the most concise and up-to-date report the House has had on what is happening in regard to the national building regulations.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party support in principle the idea of self-certification.  There has been considerable consultation on this. The industry needs to have this matter clarified.  It is not unreasonable or unoptimistic to aim towards having the legislation debated in the House before Christmas.  If the House wants co-operation from the Labour Party in relation to this and the question of fire safety, <Col N="2491" /> it will have it.  I support the view that the fire regulations should not be made separate from the national building regulations. They are an integral part of the building design process and could not be separated in any system of administration.</P>
    <P>The Fire Services Act, 1981, is the correct one to utilise for the management of premises, particularly in places of public resort after they are completed in terms of construction and design, to ensure ongoing safety and standards. However, that is appropriate for another day.  I acknowledge the fact that the Minister has taken up the invitation put by me on 6 July and has given a clear, concise and up to date statement about what has been happening in relation to the national building regulations.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other Members who wish to speak.  We have from now until 7 o'clock to try to do as good a job as possible on Committee Stage and tease out some of the ambiguities which are still in various sections.  In the interests of co-operation I conclude my remarks.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to be pithy but sharp in relation to my views. I relate them to section 7 of the Bill, which concerns the Minister's entitlement to make the requisite social policy. It is on that section I intend hanging my remarks.  My purpose in intervening is to expose an ongoing scandal in the constituency which I have the honour and privilege to represent over the last number of years, that is, Dun Laoghaire.  I refer to the Foxrock Park area on one hand and Cabinteely Avenue and Longmeadow area on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill states that the purpose of the section is to enable the Minister to issue general policy directives on planning and development to planning authorities as well as to An Bord Pleanála.  Section 6 of the 1976 Act, under which such directives may be issued to the board, is being repealed by section 15 of the Bill.  Under subsection (1) the Minister issues a general directive and a planning authority and the board must have regard to this in performing <Col N="2492" /> their functions.  Subsection (3) makes it clear that the Minister may not by virtue of the section exercise any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or the board is or may be concerned.  Subsection (4) deals with the publication of the directive. Like Deputy Fitzpatrick, spokesman for Fine Gael, I assume they will be published in <i>Iris Oifigiuil</i> or some such publication which will be available generally.</P>
    <P>The scandal which has been ongoing for five months in the Foxrock Park area is one which should have been remedied almost as soon as it happened. Foxrock Park was invaded by traders of one description or another in February of this year.  The matter is of deep concern to me as a Deputy in that it appears to the people I represent in that area that the political system is immobilised. Deputies can do nothing about the situation. The central authority seems to be powerless.  The local authority's role in the whole matter is open to question and query.  The problem relates to a piece of ground in the ownership of a developer. The developer could come in and remove those traders overnight.  It is his property and it appears to me that he has plans for that ground.  Until such time as that individual receives the type of planning permission he requires he will allow these individuals to remain on that patch of ground to the hardship of residents who have been living in the area for a number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That appears to be the situation.  It is not good enough.  The people living in Foxrock Park and members of the Longmeadow Residents' Association paid good money for their houses. As citizens of the nation living in County Dublin they are entitled to the peace and quiet they assumed they would be getting when they bought their residences.  Now their health is threatened by the continuing presence of these individuals.  There is lack of toilet facilities, lack of water, young foals are born on the property and faeces are not removed.  That is the kind <Col N="2493" /> of health hazard which not only the residents have to suffer but also the individuals on the site.  A number of the traders are itinerants.  There are some legitimate itinerants among them who are being rehoused slowly by the local authority. In the meantime the problem is ongoing.</P>
      <P>It is a serious problem and I ask the Minister to deal with it in his reply and outline what power he on the one hand, and, on the other, the local authorities, have to abate this particular nuisance. I received a letter from the chairman of the Foxrock Park Residents' Association arising out of a number of meetings Deputies representing the constituency had with him.  With the permission of the Chair I shall quote the letter briefly.  It states:</P>
      <P>I am taking this opportunity to formalise the Actions to be taken following the two meetings held at Setanta House on 30th June, 1982 and 6th July, 1982 between Members of our Association and TD's from all parties representing our constituency.</P>
      <P>You have agreed to exert your utmost influence in conjunction with the other TD's on an all party basis to have an amendment made to the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill 1982.</P>
      <P>The next sentence is, I believe, the most important sentence in this letter.</P>
      <P>This is to ensure that landlords will be obliged by Law to prevent their land being used in any way which needlessly causes hardships for local residents.</P>
      <P>In the particular circumstances of our Estate, such an amendment would allow both the Local Authority and Central Government to force the Landlord to evict the itinerants whose presence has caused such unwarranted physical dangers, risks to health and loss of property values to the residents.</P>
      <P>Your help was also sought in relation to bringing pressure to bear on the various Public Bodies which appear to have remained inactive, instead of taking the direct action which they are empowered to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That reference underlines the first observation <Col N="2494" /> I made about the apparent immobility of the political system.  I am part of the democratic process.  In this instance it does not seem to be working and I feel somewhat embarrassed on that account. I want to see democracy work.  I want to see residents get their just entitlements in the enjoyment of their homes and lands, together with the right to come and go unopposed to their properties.  I want to see legitimate itinerants properly housed and properly relocated.  I want to make it very clear that in this instance these traders are conducting an ongoing business in the middle of a housing estate. The penultimate paragraph of the letter reads:</P>
    <P>Examples of these are the Dublin Medical Officer of Health and the Departments of Environment and Justice. Although each of these was asked for help, they either have done nothing beyond acknowledging our letters or have evaded the issue.  Copies of letters to and from these Bodies are enclosed.</P>
    <P>Your assistance is appreciated and I look forward to your success in resolving our problem and in showing yourself to be a political representative worthy of our support.</P>
    <P>In their letter to the Minister for Justice they outline eight or nine particular problems.</P>
    <P>(1)  The 50 persons referred to use the lands and boundaries of neighbouring houses as toilets and it not unusual to see half-naked children urinate in public alongside the public roadway.</P>
    <P>(2)  Bonfires are lighted around 11 p.m. &mdash; and adults gather around and swill cider.  Invariably fights break out, shouting and screaming follow, and the residents are unable to get to sleep.</P>
    <P>(3)  Animals foul up the public roadway and broken prams, old tyres, old clothes, etc. are abandoned on the path and roadway.</P>
    <P>(4)  Animals are tied to pegs on the &ldquo;long acre&rdquo; and constitute a danger to passing traffic.</P>
    <P>(5)  Our children are jeered at, and <Col N="2495" /> harassed as they pass along the roadway and adults are told to &ldquo;open your purse&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(6)  Residents who protest personally to these people are abused in the most foul language and sometimes threatened.</P>
    <P>(7)  The public water supply has been tapped to provide services for the trespassers.</P>
    <P>They do not seem to be trespassing as far as certain people are concerned.</P>
    <P>(8)  Groups of men parade their horses and visiting itinerants make bids to purchase.  The persons referred to gained access to the area by breaking down fences with a truck late in the evening of the 16th March, 1982</P>
    <P>The date is 16 March, not 16 February. I want to see this situation in the constituency, particularly in the Foxrock area, remedied immediately and I would very much appreciate it if the Minister could specifically deal with this <i>cri de coeur</i> on behalf of the residents of Foxrock Park and others who live in these areas and have been subjected to this type of treatment, treatment which should not be allowed to continue.  It appears to be a situation where the local authority on the one hand and central government on the other are inert.  What happens as a result of that inertia is that politicians and central democracy are brought into disrepute. I do not want to see that happen and I will do all I can to ensure it does not happen.  The associations have made representations to every party, to the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Donoghue, to Deputy Barry Desmond and to Deputy Liam Cosgrave, which agree I hope, with the purport of my remarks.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by referring briefly to a letter from the Longmeadow Residents' Association.  Here again you have a situation in which decent people in the heart of suburbia are trying to live in peace and harmony under very difficult conditions. They are subjected to traders actually trading at the entrance to their estate.  No man or woman dare make any observation <Col N="2496" /> to these hard men as to why they should or should not sell their wares at the entrance to their estate.  To do so would result in their going in fear of life and limb.  I received this letter from the Longmeadow Residents' Association.  It is dated 9 July 1982:</P>
    <P>It is with heavy heart and a deep sense of frustration that I write to you as our Representative to seek your help in finding a satisfactory solution to the problems facing this Association.</P>
    <P>The development of the Longmeadow Estate was commenced by Messrs. Wates &amp; Company in 1969 and to date approximately 220 houses have been completed out of an envisaged 250.  In 1977, Wates &amp; Co. sold out the remaining portion of the development to Cormeen Construction Limited.  Since 1977 Cormeen Construction Ltd. have built a number of houses and actually sold some of the remaining sites to various builders.  Cormeen Construction Ltd. however remain the developers with overall responsibility for the completion of the estate at the Johnstown Road end, prior to same being taken in charge by the Local Authority.</P>
    <P>This section comprises the major open spaces for the estate and involves the culverting of a stream and general landscaping of an area of approximately 5 acres.  Despite meetings, letters, chance meetings with public representatives and eventually a High Court Action against the developer Cormeen Construction Ltd. to date, i.e. thirteen years after the commencement of the development the open spaces have not been completed and roads footpaths and services have not been taken in charge by the Local Authority.  In fact two months ago the developer applied to Dublin County Council for Planning Permission for the erection of 15 houses on the area referred to in the initial Planning Permission which was granted by Ministerial Order in 1973 as being open space. This application was turned down by <Col N="2497" /> Dublin County Council as Planning Authority for the area.</P>
    <P>At present the &ldquo;open space&rdquo; is used as an unauthorised camp site by traders. It is in a deplorable condition. Toilet facilities needless to say are non-existent.  I am sure I need not spell out the problems that this leads to.</P>
    <P>Thirteen years is a long time to wait for an open space to be completed.  We feel it is totally unreasonable bearing in mind that the open space forms part of linear parkway stretching from Deansgrange in the north to Wyatville, Ballybrack in the south, which is already practically completed.</P>
    <P>As stated above your comments and help in reaching a satisfactory solution to our problem would indeed at this stage be gratefully appreciated.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  I may have been unduly prolix but this is a matter of fundamental importance. This is an ongoing tragedy as well as a scandal.  I think I have illustrated the problems confronting these associations. Associated with these problems is the continuing lack of the taking in charge of housing estates in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire.  Here I refer specifically to the development at Newtownpark Avenue.  I want now to ask the Minister to give the House some assurance that these situations will not be allowed to occur in the future and I would ask him specifically to abate with what existing legislation there is the particular problems experienced by these residents' associations and move this unwilling developer who appears to be engaged in environmental blackmail.  These are matters of fundamental importance and, while they relate specifically to the constituency I represent, I have no doubt they apply thoughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the planning board which consists of members of the highest integrity.  I welcome the Bill <Col N="2498" /> and the very helpful explanatory memorandum which is attached to it.  I would like to make one appeal&mdash;to use a pun&mdash;to the planning board to speed up their planning decisions.  It is right and proper that there is a planning board in existence which has taken the unjustified stigma of wrongdoing off successive Ministers for the Environment and, before that, Ministers for Local Government, in relation to planning appeals.  In doing that the board have been good for democracy. I do not think there has ever been a case, as suggested, of interference by any Deputy with the planning board and that is how it should be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>While I recognise that the Bill before us is short and is not intended to be a comprehensive amendment to the main existing planning laws, it is necessary that we should include some amendments which we have put down to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned with fees, planning permissions, compensation to those who are refused planning permission and facilities for the access of the disabled and elderly to public buildings.  However, in view of the short time available to us, I do not think any of these amendments will be dealt with very extensively.  For that reason, I will deal briefly with a number of points which we had in mind. As the Minister stated, there is a need for a general review of the planning laws in which there are many anomalies.  It appears, from experiences which I have had, that developers who are ruthless enough can achieve what they set out to do.  I know of one instance where a planning application was granted by default because the local authority failed to respond in the specified time.  The result is that a developer is now building an amusement arcade in a residential area and is breaking all the planning laws in relation to the draft development plan and so on.  This has happened despite the fact that there were numerous court cases in relation to it and that an injunction was served on the developer concerned to stop this work.  The man is blithely carrying on building the arcade and he seems to be able to do as he pleases.  The <Col N="2499" /> question of developers getting planning permission by default should be looked at and, if a local authority fails to respond in the specified period, the application should fail and a re-application should have to be made.</P>
    <P>With regard to the area of compensation, Dublin County Council were complaining yesterday in relation to a park they are trying to develop.  Deputy Gallagher told me about a case in Waterford where the owner of land which was under water sought planning permission to develop it.  Because he was refused permission, he received compensation of £¼ million although 11 of the 15 acres which he sought to develop were under the sea. It is an extraordinary state of affairs that when a local authority refuses planning permission, because it is inappropriate for the area, the taxpayers have to pay compensation to the person who has been refused planning permission.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed by many people with regard to rezoning which has taken place in the Dublin County Council area.  The air needs to be cleared in regard to what is going on in this area.  I am reluctant, as other Deputies are, to restrict in any way the already well restricted powers of county councils and corporations but something needs to be done in relation to rezoning.  It does not seem correct that a local authority should set down a development plan and that county councillors can make a complete hash of it.</P>
    <P>Applications by householders in regard to their sole dwelling should not be subject to a fee.  Commercial applications for the development of large numbers of houses, office blocks, industrial development and so on should be charged the full economic fee.  The cost of the application to the local authority should be charged to those who are attempting to carry out development.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the problems which the disabled and the elderly have in relation to access to public buildings. For that reason, I put down an amendment seeking to have a section of the draft building regulations inserted into the Bill and to ask the Minister to <Col N="2500" /> make it obligatory on those developing buildings open to the public to make them accessible to the disabled.  It is generally accepted that where a building is accessible to the disabled, especially those in wheelchairs, it automatically makes them more accessible to the elderly, to those with young children in prams and to those who are on crutches. When I come in here it often strikes me that it is a pity that we do not have a TD who is in a wheelchair because then we would realise that it would be next to impossible for him or her to gain access to the House.</P>
    <P>I am strongly of the opinion that five years is enough for implementation of a planning permission.  After five years the grounds on which that permission was granted will have changed, the area will have changed, and the various conditions which existed at the time the permission was granted will have changed.  For that reason when a planning permission runs out before any development has started a fresh application should be made in view of new conditions that exist.</P>
    <P>I will not delay the House any further, but in view of the fact that it is unlikely that we will be able to discuss many of the amendments put down, the Minister should consider accepting them or incorporating them in the Bill in some way or at least he should give an assurance that he will consider them seriously in the not too distant future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I welcome the Minister's decision to produce this Bill prior to the summer recess.  It is a most appropriate Bill and is long overdue. Serious anomalies exist in the present planning laws and these anomalies should be deleted now.  As we all know, when planning was introduced here it was new to this country but we were fortunate in that we could learn from the mistakes of other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it has been brought to my notice that elected representatives of public bodies, such as county councillors who are responsible for establishing the planning law within their counties, are debarred from access to the files while an application is being processed.  This is a <Col N="2501" /> shocking state of affairs.  It is an indictment of a public representative who has the backing of the people, who has been elected by them democratically to see after their rights within that council, that he can be told by an employee of that council that he cannot see the file and, therefore, cannot see how that application is being processed.  This is a serious infringement of the rights of a public representative.  I would like the Minister to change that and make it possible for every public representative to have access to the files while the application is being processed.</P>
    <P>It is well known that small building contractors in rural Ireland depend on a flow of permissions to keep their staffs in operation and many of them are depending on the individual planning applications that are being refused by planning authorities throughout Ireland.  I can quote that one-eleventh of the 54,200 applications received in 1981 in the whole country were processed in Cork County Council.  Quite a number of refusals were meted out in that authority when permission should have been given to the people who had applied for it.  It is shocking to think that perhaps a son, daughter, brother or sister who gets a plot of ground from his or her relatives, and perhaps is living in a far distant land, is refused permission on the grounds that no services are available in that area, even though in his application the applicant has proved to the planning authority that there is ample preparation in the area for a septic tank and ample room for a bored well.  Such applications are turned down by councils throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The five-year period which the Minister is now introducing is not sufficient for individual applications such as I have quoted.  Sons and daughters emigrate to England, America, even Australia, where they will be for the next ten years. They have received a plot of ground from their parents and they apply for planning permission and then they find that after five years that planning permission is null and void just because some speculator comes in and buys other sites near their plot, making the permission for that site completely irrelevant.  This should be rectified <Col N="2502" /> by the Minister and I have no doubt that he will take it into consideration.</P>
    <P>It is well known that most refusals in rural Ireland are meted out on the grounds that &ldquo;It could be seen from scenic route No. 51, 72 or 83&rdquo;.  As long as it has a number it does not make any difference, the development will be premature for the area where public services are not provided.  As I have stated septic tanks can prove that wrong.  The word &ldquo;premature&rdquo; should be erased from planning decisions.  There should not be any such thing as &ldquo;premature&rdquo; where planning applications are concerned.  We in rural Ireland cannot live on fresh air and cold water.  I come from a constituency which depends chiefly on its emigrants to come back to build retirement homes and so on and special consideration should be given to those areas.  The attitude is &ldquo;Forget about him, he is gone, he is a bird of passage&rdquo; but much dissension exists in rural Ireland today because of that.  Also the building industry is the only little industry we have left in south-west Cork, which I represent, and objections have been the curse of development in that area.  We would have a refinery in Whiddy Island today were it not for third party objections and that refinery would be capable of meeting the requirements of EEC regulations and would not produce a high level of lead pollution. Another part of my constituency, Court-macsherry, has been completely devoid of industry and the one and only fishery industry mooted for it was turned down because of a third party objection six months ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take all this into consideration.  A number of things must be upgraded in planning in order to ensure that people get justice.  I would like the Minister to delete a clause imposed by planning authorities throughout the country to the effect that the applicant must reside in the house for five years.  I have known building societies to refuse loans to applicants on account of that imposition.  Surely you cannot compel a person to reside for five years in a house if he has to change his job and go elsewhere.  This should be taken into consideration. Also if the person decides to <Col N="2503" /> sell the house for financial reasons he cannot legally do it because this imposition is placed on him.  This is serious and the imposition should be erased from the planning laws.</P>
    <P>There are other things I would like to say, but I will not delay the House much longer.  However, public representatives should be given the opportunity of access to the files while the planning application is in progress.  Give an extra two years. The planning permission in respect of private development should be extended to at least seven years and perhaps to ten years.  It could be left at five years or even shorter in respect of industrial development.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify the position in respect of applications submitted in respect of extensions of planning permission after 31 October 1981. These applications were in respect of approvals that had been granted previously but when the applications for extensions were made they were refused. When the people concerned appealed to An Bord Pleanála they were refused also. Are these applications now null and void or will they stand until 31 October 1983? Having regard to the serious depression in the building trade generally, but particularly in my constituency, I appeal to the Minister to extend the period in respect of these applications to 31 October, 1985, if possible.  The small builder in rural Ireland depends on individual planning permissions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that of necessity the Bill is short and that it deals only with a certain situation but I suggest to the Minister that at the first available opportunity steps be taken to encompass a complete overhaul of the Principal Act of 1963 which shortly will be 20 years in operation and which has shown up a number of defects in that time.  It has undergone only one substantial amendment and that was by way of the 1976 Act, which provided for the setting up of An Bord Pleanála and which contained the withering clause.  I suppose that clause is the <Col N="2505" /> one that is responsible for our being here today discussing this Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 3 which provides power whereby the local planning authority may extend the period for a time longer than five years, I would not be in total agreement with such proposal. I say this because I consider five years to be an adequate period within which most developments should be capable of being accomplished.  Section 4 deals adequately with that situation in that it proposes to grant the power to a planning authority to extend the period provided the application is in order and that substantial works on the project have commenced. It is understandable that there will be delays in any development.</P>
    <P>I support what Deputy Quinn said regarding the meaning given to the words &ldquo;planning authority&rdquo; in the Principal Act. Section 2 (2) of the Principal Act specifies the planning authority to be the elected body in the areas so specified whether that body be a county council or an urban council; but, as Deputy Quinn has pointed out, there has been a fifth-column activity here in relation to the operation of the spirit of the Act by certain officials of the various councils.  I submit that in very many cases the county managers and city managers have hijacked the role of the elected representatives and that the views of elected members are being disregarded constantly by appointed officials in county council and city council establishments.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the monopoly of good sense rests with the professional planners or with the professional people in the relevant planning authorities.  By &ldquo;planning authority&rdquo; I mean the establishment personnel.  There have been some bad decisions in relation to the rezoning of lands but there have been appalling decisions by professional planners in relation to local situations and these decisions have led to a certain amount of antagonism and local agitation. I wish to impress on the Minister the need to strengthen the power of the elected local representatives in this entire sphere and I support totally what Deputy Quinn has had to say in respect of the operation of section 4 of the City and <Col N="2506" /> County Management (Amendment) Act. That section is there to be used democratically by the elected representatives and it contains inbuilt safeguards.  However, I have witnessed instances in which, though the section was invoked to grant planning permissions which did not breach the development plan, the permission was subsequently appealed by an appointed official of a local authority.  It is totally wrong that this should happen. These officials should not be allowed to engage in this type of activity.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress also that it should be brought to the attention of An Bord Pleanála that the majority opinions of elected representatives are valid and should be taken into consideration in adjudicating appeals which come before them.  In many instances these appeals relate to matters already touched on such as the development or lack of development of many of our housing schemes. We are all aware of this whether we represent constituencies in the capital city or any of the provincial centres such as Dundalk, Drogheda, Waterford, Cork or anywhere else.  It is a problem that is endemic throughout the country &mdash; the non-compliance with planning permission &mdash; particularly in relation to a matter raised by Deputy Andrews, that of the completion of open spaces.  I believe that An Bord Pleanála should be directed to take into account discussions and decisions of elected representatives in adjudicating on any of these matters.</P>
    <P>I accept the provisions of section 5 as a tidying up of the situation in relation to appeals.  I accept fully what the Minister has said, that An Bord Pleanála at any one time have on hand a lot of appeals from people who do not intend pursuing them.  Therefore it is only right that some mechanism be devised to have this situation tidied up so that people would know exactly where they stand.  Allied to that is section 10 dealing with planning fees. I may be in the minority here but I feel it only right that there be some charge in relation to planning applications.  Under the existing legislation, which I do not think is amended by this Bill, far too many applications are lodged on a speculative <Col N="2507" /> basis.  There is the attitude prevalent that if we can lodge this application now and get planning permission for this little piece of land, it will be worth a lot more money and therefore will constitute an investment.  I believe that attitude is wrong and that the community at large have no obligation to people who own little portions of land.  If it is the case that they are entitled to seek planning permission, thereby increasing the value of that land, then equally the community at large are justified in seeking a reasonable fee in respect of the work that must be undertaken in the processing of such applications. It must be remembered that in regard to the application process there is the architectural opinion, the engineering opinion, the medical health reports and the ordinary administrative work. Though no fee has been mentioned, probably one of approximately £20 would be acceptable in respect of such applications.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the appeals fee and felt that perhaps it should remain at £10.  In this respect I would not agree in as much as any bona fide appeal will entail the reimbursement of the fee in any event.  Without necessarily winning their appeals, once applicants' arguments are substantially upheld, their fees will be reimbursed.  Therefore I do not believe it constitutes a great imposition. Many of the appeals about which we are speaking are not individual third party appeals but rather those organised by residents' associations and various other groupings, of which, I must say, I approve.  I would uphold their right to appeal but would not support those who contend that they are in any way frustrating the building industry unnecessarily. I believe that individuals' rights must be protected.  Therefore I uphold the right of such organisations to lodge bona fide appeals.  I would not object to the increased fee mentioned in this section.</P>
    <P>Section 7 has been referred to extensively, which is the section in regard to general policy directives.  Volumes have already been spoken about the subject of the rights of itinerants but very little time has been devoted to the rights of other <Col N="2508" /> people involved in this situation.  I want to make it perfectly clear that I support the concept of providing halting sites and fully serviced transitional sites for these unfortunate people.  Having said that, it is only right that local authorities who have expended moneys on the provision of these facilities be granted the necessary protection by the Minister for the remainder of the population.  The constituency I represent, Louth, particularly the town of Dundalk, has since 1968 provided a fully serviced site, with chalets and space for itinerants to carry on their normal occupation, whether it be tinsmith, scrap dealer or whatever.  It was the first such site established in the country and has proved to be very successful. The integration of these people into the settled community has been very successful in that period.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, having taken all of those desirable policy decisions, having implemented various Ministers' recommendations with regard to the travelling people and the recommendations of the Bewley Commission, that area has been afforded no protection whatever from the hoards of traders and transient travelling people who descend on it at different times.  I know it is not a problem peculiar to this locality.  Nonetheless I would ask the Minister to provide some protection where all the other necessary steps have been taken.  I can understand circumstances arising where steps have not been taken and when these people will insist upon remaining in certain locations.  But where such steps have been taken I would ask the Minister, as a matter of policy, to direct that some protection be afforded public property in a lot of these areas. Over the last weekend I witnessed the descent on an open space which had been cultivated with flower beds, seating and various other amenities through public moneys, when that area was mutilated by a hoard of these people who arrived in their BMWs, Volvos and Mercedes to carry on street trading, when absolutely no protection was afforded either to the residents of the locality or to public property which was destroyed.  I regret to say that the Garda ignored the situation completely and under present law the local <Col N="2509" /> authority were powerless to do anything about it.  A tremendous amount of goodwill for the corrective steps which should be taken in these situations is being lost through lack of protection being afforded in areas where what justice demands has been done.  I would direct the Minister's attention, in section 7, to this problem.</P>

      <P>On section 7, dealing with general policy directives, I should draw the Minister's attention to lack of policy in relation to planning permissions granted along our arterial roads.  From one county to another there is to be seen vast confusion and differences of operation. It is undesirable in open country, in areas beyond the speed limit zones, to allow unrestricted building along arterial roads.  A directive to planning authorities would be appropriate in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to section 6, the soul of the Bill.  It seeks to make valid certain appeals which were granted particularly in cases where they infringe development plans.  I should like to draw to the attention of the Minister a requirement in a section of the Principal Act that local authorities should prepare development plans.  However, a practice is now growing in cases where local authorities refuse planning permissions that do not conform with their development plan.  Applicants are now applying to An Bord Pleanála for compensation and their request is being acceded to.  Unless this matter is looked at it will have serious implications for local authority finances. Local authorities, in compliance with the Act, prepare development plans incorporating desirable and valid objectives. <Col N="2510" /> Those objectives are not appealed against within the specified period while the plan has been on display but subsequently applicants are awarded substantial and excessive compensation.  That will prove detrimental to the finances of local authorities ultimately and the Minister should direct his attention to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks will be confined to one or two points although I could speak on the subject of planning generally for some time.  It seems to me that the Bill before us will not make any substantial improvement in the planning problems that are facing us, in particular the planning problems facing the county where the issue of planning is most critical, County Dublin.  The exercise we have seen in County Dublin in recent years involving the rezoning of land by the council is something which goes very close to bringing the entire operations of that council into disrepute.  We have had the spectacle recently of 150 acres of land zoned for high amenity purposes being rezoned by the council for housing in the Dublin hills in the teeth of very reasoned opposition and explanations as to why it should be done by the skilled professional planning staff in the employment of that council.  That is just one example of what has been going on in County Dublin in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall give details of another case which highlights the problem.  A proposal was made to rezone an acreage of agricultural land for housing purposes and that land, as far as the eye could see, was zoned for agricultural purposes north, south, east and west; but for some reason a councillor was motivated to propose that the land should be separated from the vast expanse of surrounding land and rezoned for housing purposes.  There was no drainage on the land or any logically or earthly reason why that land should be <Col N="2511" /> extracted from the large area of agricultural land.  Yet, that was done.  The skilled professional staff of the council advised against it, explaining that there was no drainage or other facilities available to develop it.  Notwithstanding that the council rezoned that land.</P>
    <P>They are problems the Minister should be introducing legislation to deal with. This Bill makes little or no contribution towards them.  Part of the reason for that situation arises because in some local authority areas, Dublin county in particular, the council are no longer capable of acting as a local authority.  The population of the county has expanded to such an extent, and the interests of the north, south and west of the county, each with huge populations, diverge to such an extent that the time has come when the county should be divided into smaller administrative units.  The elected representatives for those areas would more readily represent the views of the people living in those areas.  I have no doubt that those rezoning applications would be contrary in the entire to the wishes of the people living in those areas.  There is an urgent need, for example, that the new town of Tallaght be granted urban status and that it be in control of its own development and that of the land surrounding it.  The town has now upwards of 75,000 people and it should have its own urban council.  We are now faced with the situation where councillors from areas that are very far away, such as Balbriggan in the north, are making planning decisions affecting the western and southern parts of the county.  Understandably, those people have little knowledge of the requirements and needs of that end of the county.</P>
    <P>The whole process of the making of a county development plan and the rezoning situation is in need of an overhaul. The approved local residents' associations and tenants' organisations must be involved in some way in the planning process and the determination of what land within their areas should be utilised for housing, what land should be preserved for amenity purposes and for industrial purposes.  There should be <Col N="2512" /> some arrangement for compulsory consultation with approved local associations operating within the area.  Their views should be sought before decisions are arrived at.</P>
    <P>In the present situation there should be a procedure established under which decisions of the local authorities making county development plans involving the rezoning of land contrary to the views of professional planning staff can be the subject of an appeal.  We do not have an appeals procedure arising from the rezoning of land.  Once the rezoning decision has been made by the council that is the end of the matter.  Clearly, An Bord Pleanála have a function where an individual planning decision is concerned but they do not have any function where rezoning of land takes place under a county development plan.  I urge the Minister to look at this procedure and set up an appeals system so that local associations or individuals who are aggrieved as so many are, particularly in the Tallaght area, at some of the appalling rezoning decisions made can go before an objective and independent authority, possibly An Bord Pleanála or a different forum. The Minister should deal with this with all possible urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire) Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> It is unfortunate that we have so little time to debate an important piece of legislation such as this.  The fact that so many Deputies wish to speak on the Bill highlights the need for a proper review of the Planning Acts.  I hope the Minister in the near future will give us an opportunity to debate the Planning Acts in a constructive, comprehensive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning laws should apply to everybody equally.  Deputy Andrews, my fellow constituency Deputy, went comprehensively through the problems facing Deputies in Dún Laoghaire, particularly the illegal parking by traders on privately owned property.  I do not intend to go into the letters which Deputy Andrews has put on record, but I wish to express support for a number of his points.  When I say that planning laws should apply equally to all I mean that if you are to bring people to court for failing to comply <Col N="2513" /> with planning conditions or for unauthorised developments by people who happen to own those developments or were responsible for bringing them about, the same laws should apply to them as to people who these days are inviting people on to their property, so-called traders and in some cases a number of itinerants, to cause disturbance, annoyance and abuse to residents in built-up areas.  As long as the law permits that kind of thing to continue we will have problems.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention again to two cases referred to by Deputy Andrews.  The first is Foxrock Park.  By coincidence or otherwise, after a planning application had been lodged with Dublin County Council we had an influx of traders to the site.  In another instance, we had a planning application lodged for a shopping centre and there was another influx of traders.  We had difficulties with the developer: we had to bring him to court to develop a piece of land in Cabinteely as an open space because originally it had been the condition of the planning permission.  After 13 years of development on that site we had to bring him to court.  What has happened?  We have an influx of traders and some itinerant families to the site.</P>
    <P>These are not coincidences.  They are allowed to happen because we are not applying the planning laws equally.  I assume the Minister's colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, has spoken to him about this because the Minister for Education attended the same meeting as Deputy Andrews and I, and I suggest that he includes an amendment to this Bill prohibiting any structure of any description on land zoned for residential or other purposes without planning permission. That would eliminate this abuse that is occurring constantly in both Dublin city and county.  It is the only way to deal with this problem.  We must amend the Planning Act so that structures of any description will not be allowed on land without prior planning permission.  It is wrong to expect a developer to comply with planning law, for which we could bring him to the High Court, and at the same time allow people to go into private property <Col N="2514" /> and trade there, and we cannot touch them because there are constitutional and other threats against us so that we cannot deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I recently got in touch with the planning development department and asked them to take action under existing law in regard to land usage, when land is not being used for the purpose for which it is originally zoned.  Today I received a telephone call from a chairman of one of the local residents' associations to tell me he had been in touch with the planning department who had told him that they were deciding not to take action under the planning laws despite a commitment given to me when I was chairman of Dublin County Council that action would be taken.  I got on to the planning authority officials to insist that they carry out the functions they are employed for.  As Deputy Andrews said, this sort of thing more and more is bringing public representatives into disrepute because it is causing doubts in the public mind whether we are doing our job at all.</P>
    <P>This kind of thing should not be allowed to continue.  If the Minister is to use his powers under section 7 he should direct the officials to implement the law as it exists.  I ask the Minister to give me a commitment that he will amend this Bill to make certain that use of any land will not be permitted unless prior planning permission has been granted.  That law should apply to everybody &mdash; to the itinerants, to the traders, to developers and to ordinary private individuals.  It is the law of the land and it should be applied equally to all.</P>
    <P>We must deal with the itinerant problem in a different way.  We must provide sites for them and we must offer them proper housing conditions.  We cannot get away from our responsibilities in that respect.  I admit all that, but the provisions of the Planning Acts should be upheld irrespective of whom they apply to.  That is what I am looking for here today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews very ably dealt with other points in this respect, matters which we discussed with resident association representatives whom we met.  I fully support his contribution because we are at <Col N="2515" /> one about this situation.  As elected representatives we are here to see that the law will be applied equally across the board.  We want to show to the people who elected us that we will carry out our duties without favouring one group more than another.</P>
    <P>In the Foxrock Park problem we had a typical example of abuse of the planning laws.  It is a scandal that such abuse is being allowed.  In Dublin County Council we offered housing accommodation to a number of families on this site.  Anybody who applies to Dublin County Council for rehousing must be offered accommodation in accordance with the priority scheme of the local authority, without discrimination of any kind.  Every applicant entitled to be included in the scheme must be offered accommodation.  We have an obligation under the Housing Act to offer accommodation to those who need housing who are not capable to provide houses themselves.  I want the Minister to give us a commitment that the Bill will be amended so that this type of scandal will be eliminated today, or tomorrow at the latest.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have referred to development plans and I have listened to some of the contributions carefully.  Having been chairman of Dublin County Council in the last 12 months I can say it is utter hell because people cannot make up their minds what the functions of elected representatives should be.  We heard Deputy Taylor regarding some of the actions of local elected representatives.  I disagree with some of the decisions of Dublin County Council in regard to development land but not all of the decisions were wrong.  However, the law obliges elected representatives to draw up a development plan, put it on public display and eventually adopt it.  Therefore, it is a reserved function of elected representatives to carry out the review.  But the criticism levelled at Dublin County Council is that we have ignored the views and the wishes of the officials of Dublin County Council.  I agree with that because on numerous occasions good advice was given and was ignored.</P>
    <P>However, the point I want to make in <Col N="2516" /> the context of the planning laws is whether it is the wish of this House that the reserved functions should be taken away from the local elected representatives. If that is so, so be it; but there is no point in criticising decisions of elected representatives if by law they are obliged to make them.  What is happening in Dublin County Council is that a plan was presented by the officials of the council and the elected members asked for a review.  Every decision taken by the council was contrary to official advice and therefore it was no longer a reserved function of the elected members but an executive function.  If we are talking about planning and planning law we must decide whether we will continue to have this aspect of planning law regarded as a reserve function or an accepted function. That is where all of this problem arises. Having gone through this review I would like to see the whole process of drawing up a development plan being scrapped because one cannot plan with a fear in the background that everything one does is going to raise land prices or cause compensation claims to be lodged against the local authority.</P>
    <P>If we want to plan we should be able to plan and be able to change that plan if we feel it needs to be changed and we should not be obliged by law to carry that plan right through.  In other words, if we rezone an area for housing or industry or any other purpose the local authority should be able to come along in 12 months' time or in two or three years' time and scrap that plan and say &ldquo;we have looked at the progress over the last 12 months and we do not like what is happening so we are going to scrap that plan and start afresh.&rdquo;  But we cannot do that because we are told that if we do that we are going to leave ourselves open to compensation claims.</P>
    <P>That is not planning.  That is planning against the fear of being blackmailed into providing some sort of compensation to the landowner.  We should have a plan, a review that will allow the local authorities to plan for the future with no statutory obligation to provide services or anything else.  We should be able to scrap that plan and not allow monstrosities <Col N="2517" /> to continue simply because we might be obliged by law to pay compensation. Does the Minister mean to tell me that if we decide to develop a new town in a certain way and find that half way through it the place is a total disaster we have to keep going simply because if we do not we are going to be faced with massive compensation claims?  That is not planning for people; that is planning for money, for compensation.  We are talking about Planning Acts.</P>
    <P>I would like to correct one point with regard to the development plan.  Unfortunately, it was referred to by Deputy Quinn.  It has been consistently said that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have rezoned half of County Dublin.  Elected members of Dublin County Council are in there as elected members and I, as chairman, did not vote, but I want to put the record straight on this in this House.  It was not a question of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael making decisions.  There were many occasions when Labour, who now wish to run away from their responsibility, were involved in motions for rezoning of land in County Dublin, and I can quote those cases.  So let us not destroy ourselves by turning this whole issue into party politics.  It is worthwhile mentioning that.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make is in regard to the Casual Trading Act which refers to licences being issued to people who are now touring the county, stopping here, there and everywhere with their chip vans; the latest Chinese takeaways and every other conceivable piece of food that one can think of is now being sold at the side of the road.  I would like to draw the Minister's attention to one thing.  If I want to apply for planning permission to open a shop or a takeaway food shop I have to comply with strict planning controls. I have to lodge my planning application. I have to be inspected, I have to comply with the Health Acts.  Everything has to be looked at.  It now appears that people can stop these vans here, there and everywhere, outside people's homes at 12 o'clock and 12.30 at night causing obnoxious smells to flow through people's bedroom windows, and lo and behold, the following morning the place <Col N="2518" /> is strewn with litter, the person having gone away after selling his goods.</P>
    <P>Where is the Planning Act in that? How can these people be allowed to stop with vans and everything else, sell food at the side of the road and disappear and come back the next night and do the same thing?  They can stop on the side of a public road causing a traffic hazard. They are not obliged under any Planning Act to comply with the conditions of the planning authority and they are trading away merrily and nobody seems to be able to stop them.  This is what Deputy Andrews and myself have been talking about.  The planning law should apply to everybody.  If there is a law for one person the same law should apply to every other person.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to give a commitment to this House that he will stop this sort of abuse that we are having to face day in, day out.  When the problem of Foxrock Park disappears, with the help of God in the near future, Deputy Andrews and my three other colleagues in Dún Laoghaire constituency will be touring off somewhere else to deal with precisely the same thing and when we have dealt with it there we will be back over to some other place to deal with the same thing.  Therefore we must insist that the law be enforced, that the law be strong enough to enable a local authority to move in immediately and stop this, to enable them to move people on immediately, to take action immediately and not have these long drawn out court proceedings taking weeks and months where, if one happens to miss the term in the High Court, one has to wait another couple of months before it is dealt with and people are still abusing the law and nothing is done about it.  There should be strict powers given to the planning authorities to enable them to move in and stop unauthorised developments. That is what I call having proper, strong planning laws for everyone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of fundamental questions arise from this Bill.  Will the Bill improve planning standards?  Will it speed up the development of derelict areas in our cities and towns?  Will it <Col N="2519" /> stimulate the building industry?  It is only by answering these questions that one can judge whether it is a good or bad Bill. The Bill's powers are very much the same as those already held by county councils and corporations.  Nevertheless, a number of points arise on the Bill.  The Minister has made no provision for the inclusion of public representatives on his proposed commission, local councillors in various areas throughout the country who might have the necessary expertise to enable them to contribute to the work of the commission.  There are good points in the Bill as well.  It enables the Minister to invite a body such as Shannon Free Airport Development Company, who have a considerable amount of experience in building factories and other structures, to play a part in the commission. This company could contribute a lot to urban renewal in that part of the country in which it operates.  So perhaps there is something useful to be gained from that experience.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Minister has taken this initiative himself he should be congratulated and applauded because anybody travelling through our cities and towns, particularly tourists and outsiders, gets his impressions from the centre city area and those impressions are often lasting ones.  Any traveller coming to this country and travelling through our cities and towns could not help but be shocked by the ugly ruins and derelict areas which disfigure our cities and towns.  If the Minister could do something about that it would be a step forward.  It is, of course, envisaged that there will be a provision in the Bill to provide finance to help in the development of these derelict areas and for general building development in our country, if there is any money there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all right putting down a provision in a Bill which will enable money to be spent on this necessary work but if the money is not there, there is not much point in doing that.  It is like far away cows having long horns.  We could have the finest Bill in the world before the House but unless we have the will and determination to carry it out and, above all, the money, nothing good can come <Col N="2520" /> from it.  If the money could be found it would be a good development not only for the Bill itself but for the country generally. Above all, the Minister has done very little in the Bill to tackle the problem of the delays in carrying out compulsory purchase orders not only in Dublin but in the main cities and towns throughout the country.  Anybody who has any experience of the long frustrating delays in processing a CPO will know that our system is outdated and outmoded and should be reformed.  But the Minister, unfortunately, has shied away from the problem of tackling the process of CPOs. As far as I am concerned this is one great handicap and frustration in tackling the problem of derelict areas in our cities.  It is a great pity that the Minister has lost this opportunity.  He could have given himself more powers to acquire land and property in the areas I have referred to.</P>
    <P>We could learn much from the manner in which other countries have tackled this problem of derelict areas.  A war was fought some 40 years ago on the mainland of Europe and many cities were devastated. They have all been rebuilt and I marvel at the efficient and direct way in which other people can tackle the problem of urban renewal, while we make such heavy weather of it.  We could learn much about conservation and restoration from the historic cities and towns of Europe.</P>
    <P>The Minister might look to the city of Edinburgh in Scotland which has a very civilised way of encouraging people who own business premises and houses in historic areas by giving them financial assistance to keep their properties in a good state of repair and in attractive condition. We could learn from their example by helping people who own brick and stone buildings in historic areas to enable them to keep the buildings in good repair and in harmony with their surroundings.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also attempt to get a mixed development in city areas, which should encompass not only housing but also cluster industries.  The Shannon Free Airport Development Company have provided small cluster industries and houses in Limerick and other parts of the mid-west.  There is need <Col N="2521" /> for an efficient, intelligent and sensible approach by the Minister but whether he is up to the job I do not know.  We will not know until the Bill has been in operation for some time whether it will improve physical planning.</P>
    <P>There is provision for commissions to over-rule local authorities.  The Bill stipulates that these commissions are not obliged to prepare plans for an area, although they may do so.  That may be a bad thing because it may give undemocratic powers to the commissions.  If there is exclusion of elected representatives from membership of the commissions, this could be undemocratic.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's emphasis on the need for uniform national planning procedures.  This is a good point, especially in relation to the Stardust tragedy from which there are many lessons to be learned.  I hope the Minister will learn them as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister and these commissions cannot ignore local authorities and their experience and expertise.  If there is to be a proper planning system there must be greater co-operation and co-ordination between An Bord Pleanála, the local authorities and the commissions.  It is difficult to understand some of the planning permissions and the criteria on which they were based, as well as some of the appeals allowed by An Bord Pleanála.  I hope the Minister's new awareness of the need for a uniform national approach to planning will find expression in better planning decisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also extend his activities to the school curriculum.  There is a need for better visual appreciation of buildings.  Those who carry out acts of vandalism show little awareness or understanding of the benefit of fine buildings to the community.  If we had not buildings of character in our cities and towns we could almost be living in &ldquo;Concreteville&rdquo; in America or a new town in Britain.  Unless we have buildings which give a city or a town its own identity, there is no point in talking about our heritage.  &ldquo;Heritage&rdquo; is a debased word which has been thrown around rather loosely during the past decade but unless we give positive expression to our interest <Col N="2522" /> in buildings of character which have a meaning for people in local communities, this is just lip-service and hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister has not tackled the problem of compulsory purchase orders in cleaning up derelict areas.  He has lost a great opportunity but I will not entirely damn him, even with faint praise. I applaud the step he has taken and the appreciation he and the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, have shown of the need to tackle the problem of urban renewal. They have not gone any further than showing interest in this matter but I hope they will not abandon this new found interest.  When it comes to the division of the spoils and the making available of money for these projects, I hope they will show the same determination and initiative in getting this money and using it for the purposes of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I concur with Deputy Kemmy regarding the cumbersome procedures adopted by local authorities in acquiring property under the CPO system. We have all experienced this in our local areas and because the procedures are so difficult there are many undeveloped areas which should have been developed long ago at much less cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the case of the individual who makes an application to the planning authority for permission to build his house.  The Explanatory Memorandum states that this Bill is to enable the Minister for the Environment to issue general policy directives to the planning and development authorities as well as to An Bord Pleanála.  Planning assistants <Col N="2523" /> are far too clinical in their appraisal of planning applications.  Engineers will also have an influence on the matter and very often there is not sufficient liaison between planning assistants and engineers. The lack of discussion between them can result in planning permission being refused, although a little flexibility could sort out the matter.  I am talking about the individual who may have a bit of ground on which he wishes to build a home but who is refused permission because of a technicality.</P>
    <P>The question of exemptions from planning was very contentious in my area some time ago.  I refer to farm buildings, some of which are exempt from planning. There should be no such exemption.  The effluent from this type of development is very often far enough way away from a building, but it can be a source of great nuisance to the people residing in that area.  For that reason a very good look should be taken at such developments.</P>

      <P>I do not know how the three Whips are getting on, but I would like to thank all who contributed to the debate.  I share the regret of all concerned that more time is not available for consideration of this important measure.  In view of the time constraints, I will confine my response to the points with most bearing on the question.  I do this against the background of commitments already made to bring forward further planning legislation as soon as the current review of the existing statutory system and its operation has been completed.</P>
      <P>Quite a number of points have been made today which are outside the scope of this Bill, but they will now be given consideration in the course of that wider review.  I assure the House that they will be considered.  In the time available to me I shall try to reply as rapidly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested that a one year extension proposed by Fine Gael should be enough.  If one year is accepted, 31 October 1982 will cause the same problem as 31 October 1981.  For that reason, 31 October 1983 is the suggested <Col N="2524" /> date, which would appear to be reasonable.  By the time this legislation goes through the Seanad it would be the end of July, leaving only three months, which would not be sufficient.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick also referred to permission conditional on various services being provided or on agreement being reached between the local authority and the applicant.  If it were merely a continuation of services, that would be one thing; but other items come into play here such as the question of agreements with regard to charges and so forth.  I would like to clarify for Deputies Quinn and Fitzpatrick that section 3 of the Bill empowers planning authorities to vary the life of planning permission having regard to the nature, extent and relevant development of any other material considerations. The terms of the section will enable a planning authority to take into account factors referred to in determining the duration of a planning permission at application stage.  In addition, section 4 of the Bill provides that the duration of a planning permission shall be extended where a planning authority is satisfied that development has commenced within the appropriate period and that the appropriate extension work has been carried out and the development will be completed within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>As a further contribution towards the removal of difficulties of the type covered by the amendment planning authorities will shortly be advised by me as to the use of conditions of this kind in a memorandum being prepared by my Department for issue as soon as possible.  In these circumstances, and since there can be delays by developers as well as by planning authorities in reaching agreement on matters specified in the conditions, it is neither necessary nor desirable to accept the amendment as put down.  In practice were the amendment adopted, there would be endless debate and argument as to whether particular conditions were covered by it and there could be no certainty as to when a permission commenced to run against the developer.</P>

      <P>Who is to say what the developer has control over and what he has not?  However, I will return to that subject later.  I do not know how the talks upstairs are getting on.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick sought confirmation that An Bord Pleanála can give permission even in cases of material contravention of a development plan.  I confirm that the board have this power.  It is expressly conferred by section 14 (8) of the 1976 Act.  The Pine Valley case does not cast any doubts whatsoever on that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the general directive is concerned, I can assure the Deputy that there is no question of attempting to use this section to bring myself or any future <Col N="2526" /> Ministers back into planning in the way suggested.  Section 7 is only a restatement of a section which already exists since 1977 in relation to the Appeals Board.  It has not been abused there and there is no question of its being abused in this form.</P>
    <P>The maximum penalty of £800 was mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  He feared that it might be unconstitutional but I can assure him that it is not.  Deputy Quinn referred to withering and the Pine Valley case, and also to the charges and fees.  I can confirm for Deputy Quinn that the fees will be settled by regulation and they can by annulled by this House in the normal fashion.  I have already referred to the withering section.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews referred to section 7 which, as I have said already, is a general directive and these directives will be published. Deputies Andrews, Bellew and Barrett referred to the situation with regard to traders and itinerants occupying properties, both private and public, around the country and the nuisance being caused thereby.  It is a major problem in the Dublin area and there are over 400 families involved.  I appeal to the local authority to use the power already available to them.  Deputies Andrew and Barrett asked me to bring in an amendment. I refer Deputy Andrews to the 1963 Act, section 3 (1) (2) and (3), but, in particular, to subsection (2).  This refers to the position where land becomes used for any of the following purposes: the placing or keeping of any vans, tents or any other objects, whether moveable or collapsible, for the purpose of caravanning or camping; for the sale of goods; the storage of caravans; the deposit of bodies or other parts of vehicles; old metal mining or industrial waste; builders' waste; rubble or debris.  All these things need planning permission.  That is the law and I would ask the local authority involved to enforce that law.  Not only have they that law, but they are backed up by further legislation.</P>
    <P>By agreement of the House, I understand that this debate can continue until 7.15 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been trying to cover as many points as I could in the time available, but it is a little easier now.</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputies Andrews, Barrett and Bellew that the powers are there within the Planning Act and should be enforced by the local authorities.  The powers with regard to traders are also there in the Casual Trading Bill.  Deputy Barrett referred to the fact that traders are getting permits to trade in the area. It is up to the local authority to decide on the designation of specific areas for trading. I would ask the local authority involved to designate such areas.  It is a disgrace in our city and country of Dublin and around the country that local authorities have not been using the powers available to them.  Also, the Litter Bill will be coming into force this month, which will give local authorities specific power to remove dumped cars and other refuse from sites and will impose a responsibility on landowners to keep their property in a proper manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity to restate my appeal to Dublin County Council, Dublin City Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  I wrote individually to every member of those three local authorities asking them to use their powers with regard to a settlement policy for the itinerants right around the city and county of Dublin and Dún Laoghaire.  The present situation is a disgrace to the local authorities involved and I am asking them to use their powers.  I am glad to have the opportunity to do that this evening.  They have been sitting on this.  I have written to them and given them commitments regarding finance and so on.  Decisions have not been taken despite that.  I do not like the approach taken by Dublin Corporation who settle their problems about itinerants out in the area of the Dublin County Council.  Every local authority should look after the problem. It should be looked after in small numbers of two and three families per district rather than lumping 20 or 30 families <Col N="2528" /> together in one area continuing on the policy of segregation.  The families should be brought into areas in twos and threes rather in the way proposed by Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;inertia&rdquo; was used and I could not agree with it more.  The main Dublin-Belfast road is a disgrace to Dublin County Council.  It is not just in Foxrock that the council have not acted. They have the powers and the commitment with regard to finance to enable them to act.  The law is there and does not need to be amended.  They should use the law.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa mentioned a general review of the planning legislation.  I agree with him.  As I said when moving the Bill, that is under way at present.  He also mentioned the question of compensation. As soon as this item has been concluded we will move an expediency <Col N="2529" /> motion to set up a joint committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas to deal with the question of land, the supply and cost of building land including land adjacent to urban areas.  The question of compensation is one which is more relevant to that.  The review of the operation of the Local Government Planning and Development Act is more relevant to that than to this Bill.</P>
    <P>As regards the duration of planning permissions we have opted for a five-year period rather than the six-year period suggested.  The only change is an extension until 1983 for permissions which were caught in the net of 31 October last. With the exceptions in the Bill the remainder will be in a five-year period. As far as access by the disabled is concerned, it is covered in amendment No. 7.  The section, as drafted, provides the general power to issue policy directives on matters relating to planning and development by both planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála.  Regarding Deputy De Rossa's amendment, it is more appropriate that all provisions regarding building standards, including those to cater for the special needs of the disabled, should be dealt with in the context of the building regulations.  This is in line with the recommendations of the Stardust Tribunal that matters relating to building structures should not be dealt with in the context of land use planning but should be dealt with separately.  I assure the Deputy he has my full sympathy on this. I have already given this commitment to the handicap association.  It will be brought in in the context of the building regulations in the autumn session.</P>

Deputy Taylor mentioned many items most of which relate to local government reform in the Dublin area.  I refer him to a speech I made in Balbriggan in April last year where I asked that local authorities in the Dublin area together with other interested parties should make suggestions with regard to an overall review of local government operations in the Dublin region.  I would be interested in getting a submission from the Deputy on this and regarding new town status, whether there should be town commissioners, urban status for Tallaght and so on.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also mentioned that there was no appeals procedure for development plans.

I thank him for his kind remarks and will take note of the points raised. Deputy Sherlock mentioned the CPO procedure.  I agree there is considerable room for improvement in speeding up CPO procedures.  It takes far too long for a CPO to be put on land whether it is for roads, housing, or whatever.

    <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 go together. Amendment No. 2 proposes to provide that time shall not run against a developer who holds a planning permission subject to conditions where the conditions are outside the control of the developer.  This <Col N="2532" /> is a reasonable amendment and I would urge the Minister to accept it.  Permission subject to a condition is not available until the condition precedent is fulfilled and the condition I am speaking about is one within the control of the local authority, which is also the planning authority, and I want to provide that time will not run against the developer until the condition has been complied with and the permission becomes available.  I could elaborate on this but it is really self-explanatory. There is so much good sense in it I do not think it requires any argument. I know there are a number of planning permissions which will be valueless unless this amendment is accepted.  I know the Minister sees the force of my argument and I suggest he could bring in an amendment in the Seanad tomorrow and arrangements could be made to complete the Bill there and bring it back here on Friday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak about the Whitegate oil refinery, the effect on fuel prices of the decision to incur future operational losses in the refinery now being taken over and the role of the INPC catering for 35 per cent of oil to the Irish market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume the Minister is familiar with the various consultants' reports in relation to Whitegate.  It has been established beyond all reasonable doubt from these authoritative studies that the working capital requirements of the INPC to finance stocks could be anything from £45 million to £70 million.  There is also clear evidence available to the Government that the refinery is generally regarded as having a maximum life span of five to seven years.  The original figures submitted by the company estimated that operational losses would be not less than £10 million and possibly £20 million per year. It is also evident from studies done that the refinery is technically obsolete, that it uses excess energy in relation to modern refineries and there is a doubt that it <Col N="2538" /> would meet the stringent EEC lead contents standards.  The refinery is equipped for hydro-skimming and, as such, it would be at a substantial diseconomy of anything from £6, £8, or £10 per tonne compared with most of the advanced European refineries.</P>
    <P>These facts were known to the previous Government and they are known to the present Government.  The Minister stated that the net effect of the takeover of the refinery and the mandatory uptake on the part of the Irish companies concerned would mean an increase in the cost per gallon of 1½p to 2p.  I do not believe that.  From the calculations I have done I suggest the lowest increases will be 7p to 8p per gallon and it would not surprise me in the light of INPC operations if it worked out at 16p or 17p for petrol, 10p to 14p for diesel and 7p for heavy fuel.  The net effect of the two Government successive policy decisions will have a very serious impact on the economy, industry, and on unemployment and that is very serious.  We may have a vis-breaker installed in the plant, I do not know if the Government have given formal sanction to go ahead with that.  Presumably it is still desirable but the Minister should state the cost.  As he knows, the cost is anything up to $25 million or $28 million.  How much is it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get on to the stock situation.  The Minister maintained that because we are taking over the refinery, automatically the national stock situation is contained and improved and will be maintained.  At present we <Col N="2539" /> have about 32 to 35 days on average of petrol and 42 days on average of diesel on shore in Ireland.  The EEC requirement is 90 days.  Now the INPC apparently will take on 35 per cent of stock requirements since it is to be presumed they are responsible for 35 per cent of supply of oil on the Irish market.  The net effect of all this is that the INPC take on the major responsibility, the State takes on the major responsibility, and simultaneously we spend £10 million now on the refinery and we have to provide working capital requirements of anything up to £60 million or £70 million a year. Operation losses could be anything from £10 million to £20 million a year.  Does it in any way increase or improve the stock situation?  It does not.  I do not know who devised this crazy strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that the logical way to improve the national security of our country against the effects of a sudden major oil crisis which would affect oil supplies is consciously and deliberately to build up our strategic stocks held in the country of finished products.  We should tighten up the regulations to ensure 90 days stocks in the country.  I do not think that it can be done by taking over an obsolete refinery and having the burden for 35 per cent of the stock maintenance thrown on the back of the State.  The major burden for a 90-day stock level would have to be placed on the oil companies.  The Minister has given some figures here, but at least it is a logical placing of the burden on the oil companies, and if they have to expand their tankage in Whitegate &mdash; which should be expanded &mdash; and if we are to take over the tankage in Whiddy Island &mdash; which we should take over &mdash; then the companies too will have to spend some capital investment, but it will be spent on something which is tangible, which is there and which will not be closed down in five years.  Without question, the reports indicate that Whitegate, if only for safety reasons, would have to be closed down in five years.  I would like to get in to some of the equipment there, open it up and have a look at it.  I do not think that even that was done before final decisions were taken.  Either we do that <Col N="2540" /> or we decide to build a new oil refinery. The workers down there are entitled to know exactly what we intend to do.  We cannot say that we will open up a refinery, keep it going for five or seven years and close it down because it has to close, it is not operable technologically, technically, equipment-wise, it is not just obsolete but incapable of being run unless one puts £40 million or £50 million of new equipment into it or unless one decides to build a new one which would cost anything from £150 million to £200 million, and you will have to start planning now.  Where is that money to come from?  Is it from the tax-payer, the price of diesel, the price of petrol, the price of fuel oil?</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken about the constitutionality of what is going on here and about the extent to which it is in conformity with the Treaty of Rome.  I have genuine doubts about strategy of this nature being constitutional, about the constitutionality of forcing the oil companies to take up products from Whitegate to the extent of 35 per cent of the market.  There is a case to be stated in that regard which I do not want to develop here because I have not the time, but everything in the legislation as now proposed could be challenged successfully in the Court of Justice of the European Communities.  Reliance on Article 36 of the Treaty, is, to say the least, rather flimsy.  I do not believe that the arguments about national security are tenable at this time.</P>
    <P>In short, therefore, the purchase of the oil refinery does not raise the overall level of national oil stocks.  Even if we mothballed it, it would not necessarily reduce the level of national stocks because the tankage is there and presumably will retain finished oil products.  Likewise, a mandatory 35 per cent uptake by the oil companies of INPC-Whitegate Refinery products does not determine our strategic security of supply situation.  It is manifestly evident and must be stressed that even with Whitegate in full production the bulk of our oil requirements are imported in product form.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the INPC will succeed in a more dynamic sufficient <Col N="2541" /> throughput in Whitegate than hitherto. I have been looking at the INPC accounts and annual report.  In their short career they have lost a good deal of money, taxpayers' money, on the purchase of crude oil at alleged favourable prices from Saudi Arabia.  Breaking it down, that allegedly highly efficient refinery is on subsequent sale in the market.  Still it lost £2.2 million, £3.2 million, or is it £4 million?  It would be interesting to know the exact figure.  Are these and future losses to be subsumed into the price of products from Whitegate?</P>
    <P>The Minister has said, and I ask the country to examine his statement here very carefully, that the prices ex Whitegate are to be a recovery of the capital, crude oil acquisition, shipment and storage costs and the operational costs in the refinery.  All that is to be integrated in the ex Whitegate price.  There are some very serious implications in that statement which go away beyond 1p or 2p. They go into double figures.  The price increases consequent on this strategy will be borne by Irish industry, the private and public sector users and the public at large.  The full implications of the decision have not yet dawned on all politicians and the public at large.</P>
    <P>I have two other points.  Why then was the refinery purchased in principle by the previous Government?  I have no doubt that the Minister will answer that question. The only reason the refinery was purchased and a decision of that nature taken, as far as I can perceive &mdash; and perhaps Deputy Kelly can enlighten us further &mdash; was that Fianna Fáil had made a promise in the general election to do it anyway, so the capitalists of the day decided that if it was to happen they might as well try to get some credit for it. If that is the way you run a country, then God help it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This episode clearly underlines the absolute need of Governments to develop some responsible sense of national corporate investment criteria of a political nature, since all the decisions are ultimately political, in the use <Col N="2542" /> of public moneys, in planning long-term State investment and in having the political courage not to be swayed by short-term political expedients.</P>
      <P>I have often been critical of my own leader but on this issue the former Tánaiste, Deputy O'Leary, was courageous. He held the line for quite a long time and I know Deputy Kelly has such strong views on this matter and I think he was correct on this occasion.  On that basis I do not wish to cavil at the efforts of the leader of this party to keep a sense of responsibility on this matter, but I suggest that if anybody refers to yesterday's <i>Financial Times</i> in respect of standard prices, market prices and spot prices and tries to work out what the INPC are to charge the companies concerned and considers what the likely throughput at Whitegate is, he might well conclude that as a result of what is being decided here this evening the price of petrol will increase by at least 10p or perhaps even 16p per gallon while the price of diesel will increase by 7p or 8p per gallon and the price of heavy fuel by from 3p to 5p per gallon.  I am putting down a very big marker in so far as this whole exercise is concerned because, as I said last evening, like NET and Irish Steel we will be haunted in this case, too, in the years ahead.  I can visualise a situation in which somebody somewhere will be talking about another £200 million for another new oil refinery at Whitegate.  Where will we get that sort of money?  What is to happen to this unfortunate country of ours in the context of the management of our economy?  We have a great deal to answer for.  The Minister and I concur in many respects, but I will be interested to hear what he has to say in replying to the debate.  There is no political kudos for any of us in this unfortunate exercise.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Desmond on that part of his speech that I heard.  While it would not have been in order to cheer him, I wanted to do so.  I agree with many of his remarks.  As a Member of the Labour Party, the Deputy deserves credit for having had the courage to express those remarks without any ideological wrapping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2543" /> The Bill is expressed to be an amendment of the 1971 Fuels (Control of Supplies) Act, but, as Deputy Barry said yesterday, when the 1971 Act was introduced as a Bill by Deputy Lenihan, who was then Minister for Transport and Power, it was promoted openly as an emergency measure to take account of future emergencies.  The then Minister said fairly, in those days more than ten years ago, that he sincerely hoped the legislation &ldquo;would go into cold storage&rdquo;. I am referring to column 113 of Volume 252 of the Official Report.  The Minister spoke repeatedly in his opening and closing speeches of an &ldquo;emergency&rdquo;.  Clearly the Act was aimed at dealing with a situation caused by a shortage of fuel.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us is aimed at something quite different.  I will not raise a constitutional alarm about it but it is undesirable that legislation which was intended originally to cover a possible emergency created by a shortage of fuel should be used as a vehicle for something different.  As described by Deputy Desmond, this Bill is no more than a Bill that has resulted from the exigencies not of the common good but of the 1982 general election.  The fear and the emergency that was in people's minds on both sides of this unfortunate house was not that fuel would become scarce, because presumably if there was a shipping shortage, the supplies of crude as well as of refined oil would be affected, but the fear that the voters around the district affected by the Whitegate refinery might turn and rend whatever party could be represented to them by their opponents as having let them down.  I am sorry to say that what Deputy Desmond has said is true.  I am ashamed to have to say that.  It is one of the reasons for my speaking from the third bench and also why I hope that in the years to come forces in this House will reorganise themselves in such a way that such an event will no longer be possible and that no lies will be told to put a face on what is being done now.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it is only fair to say that I recognise that there are some obvious concrete and stateable reasons in favour of having our own oil refinery <Col N="2544" /> though that is a view that I do not share. However, there are some such arguments and there are people who believe sincerely in this concept.  It is a view that is shared obviously by officials in the Department.  Therefore, I must not be thought to be hitting out all around me. But what I very much doubt is whether at a time of financial stringency those arguments should outweigh any other.  In particular, and this is a technical matter, I doubt very much as a lawyer whether it is proper or good practice to use an Act brought into law originally for one purpose as the vehicle for something quite different &mdash;&ldquo;let us have the refinery and let us force the companies who operate to buy the products at whatever prices it may suit us to charge them.  Let us forbid them to do business otherwise.&rdquo;  Regardless of what face the Minister may try to put on it, that is not part of an emergency. There may be people on my side of the House who would have been willing to read the speech that the Minister has read for us on this Bill but this House is not about the business of using one Act as a shell or a vehicle for something quite different.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has made clear, the Bill aims at what the accompanying explanatory memorandum describes as &ldquo;mandatory disposal&rdquo;.  The use of that phrase is simply a pompous way of saying that we will force someone to buy something he does not want, or that we will force him to buy something that he may want, but at a price which he is not willing to pay and which he never would pay on a free open market.</P>
    <P>If I were a visitor from some other part of the English-speaking, common-law world and were shown this Bill and asked what it is all about, and if I were given also a copy of the 1971 Act with which to compare the Bill, I should be quite foxed as to the purpose of the Bill.  I say this because in the business end of the Bill, that is, section 6 which substitutes various provisions for the old section 2 of the 1971 Act, all that is provided is power for the Minister to regulate, not just the &ldquo;supply and distribution&rdquo; of fuel, as was the case in the 1971 Act, but the &ldquo;acquisition, <Col N="2545" /> supply, distribution and marketing&rdquo; of fuel.</P>
    <P>The marketing of cabbages is regulated in the Dublin market.  Undoubtedly the seller must produce, by reason of various by-laws, his produce in a clean and healthy condition.  Likewise in the fish market one would not be found offering for sale fish that was verminous or which was in any other way a hazard to health. On a reasonable construction of the situation it could be said that the authority who are enforcing these by-laws are &ldquo;regulating the acquisition and marketing&rdquo; of the products.  However, a visitor from, say, Australia or New Zealand could well read with the aid of a magnifying glass the Bill before us and not guess that what was in view here was &ldquo;mandatory disposal&rdquo;. There is not a line in this Bill which says that the acquisition and marketing is to be regulated in such a way that the unwilling purchasers, the unwilling people necessarily present in the market, are to be forced to go home with a load, as the case may be, of cabbage or fish or, as in the case of this Bill, a particular kind of fuel; not a word.  I want to warn the Minister &mdash; it is only a technical point &mdash; that he may find that what we are enacting here is no more than a piece of paper with no legal effect.  I object very much to hole-in-corner legislation which, only in its accompanying Explanatory Memorandum, has the guts to say that what we are at here is to force somebody to buy something he does not want at a price he does not want to pay.  But, when we produce the actual Bill, there is not a word in it which makes that intention plain.  I will laugh if the Minister subsequently falls on his nose when the court, the High Court or Supreme Court before which oil companies may challenge this legislation, says this Bill entitles him to &ldquo;regulate&rdquo; the marketing and the acquisition of fuel oil, but does not entitle him to force somebody to buy his oil, or the oil of his semi-State body and nobody else's so far as concerns 35 per cent of their offtake.</P>
    <P>I have a couple of minutes left only and I do not want to cut in on Deputy Lyon's time.  I will make them as quickly as I can.  If this Bill is enacted and is not <Col N="2546" /> thrown out the window for the purely technical drafting reason to which I have adverted, if no other objection were available against it, and it can be used to force companies to take 35 per cent of their supply from Whitegate at a price to be determined by the INPC, what essentially is now happening is that the companies are being, in a kind of way, subject to a breach of their ordinary rights of property.  I want to make it clear &mdash; as I have had to do on frequent occasions here before when dealing with fuel questions &mdash; I am not a shareholder in any oil company, I have not been lobbied by any oil company.  Indeed if I were lobbied by them I would treat them as I treat all lobbies.  I have no interest in oil companies, good bad or indifferent, direct or indirect.  But oil companies, like any other kind of a company or individual, have rights here.  When they find themselves forced to take a particular product at a price they do not want to pay, or a product which they do not want, and if they are not allowed to recoup that price in what they charge to their ultimate consumer, then they are being, in part, expropriated.  If I have not misunderstood the current Supreme Court jurisprudence on this question, they are being unjustly attacked in their property rights.</P>
    <P>It may be that that unjust attack can be mitigated or perhaps rendered entirely harmless by permitting these oil companies to charge the ultimate consumer enough money by way of the ultimate price for the product as to recoup them for the loss which otherwise they would have suffered if forced to take the Minister's oil at the Minister's price.  Therefore, as Deputy Barry Desmond said &mdash; in far less words than I have felt obliged to use &mdash; the suffering Irish industry and the suffering Irish public will be paying the price of this measure.  That may be so.  If that happens, I want to say this &mdash; quite apart from the obvious implications for industry and the ordinary consumer being forced to pay more, implications which will spread throughout the economy in terms of inflation, and the Minister need not deceive himself about that &mdash; we will then be witnessing a detrimental effect of a partial monopoly, <Col N="2547" /> because a monopoly means that you dictate the terms of the market.</P>
    <P>The Minister is proposing now only to dictate 35 per cent of the market, the terms of 35 per cent of oil sales in this country.  But I can see some other Minister oiling into this House and saying: I think the time is ripe and it would be appropriate, all things being considered, to make that 35 per cent 45 per cent or, for all I know, 55 per cent, when we would be creeping up and up towards a situation in which there would be a monopoly or near monopoly.  A monopoly under our law and Constitution &mdash; introduced by the founder of Deputy Reynolds' party, for which all those who came after him are all too willing to take credit, although they do not want to take responsibility for the darker, shadowy sides of the Constitution &mdash; is not defensible. A monopoly is not defensible here unless it operates in the public interest. And who is to say that the public interest is served if we end up with a situation in which the ordinary consumer is paying 10 pence, or whatever, a gallon more for the product merely in order to keep the large political parties' noses clean over a situation which might have developed in the east of County Cork during the 1982 general election?  I do not want to be part of any such decision.  Naturally I cannot escape the collective responsibility which I bore as a Member of the Government which initiated this, and I do not seek to escape it, but I now do not want to bear that responsibility.  I want to warn the Minister opposite, who is now in a situation of sharing collective responsibility for what is happening here this evening, that he is stepping into an embryonic monopoly situation which, if the courts here remain free and independent, and operate as they have been up to now, may leave him defending a situation which is not in the public interest, and defending it with no weapons worth talking about.</P>

      <P>There are just two last <Col N="2548" /> points I wanted to make &mdash; a further objection which is of a constitutional kind is this: suppose the oil companies take the line that if they are forced to take even 35 per cent of oil products at an inflated price &mdash; larger than they would have had to pay abroad &mdash; and that they, therefore, have to raise their market price and that, therefore, their share of the market generally sinks because the extra price induces people to switch to coal, timber or God knows what; suppose, in other words, it damages their business, even if they are allowed to pass on the price to the consumer, how will the Minister reply to that?  What argument will he put up to the High Court in response to that, that he is damaging and injuring their business in order to pursue a political objective?</P>
      <P>Finally, let me say this &mdash; I am very suspicious, and every Member of this House with 60 years' experience behind him ought to be similarly suspicious, of anything which puts a price-fixing power into the hands of a semi-State body.  The INPC's price for the product which the Minister proposes to force companies to take to the extent of 35 per cent of their distribution, will be fixed partly in relation to their cost.  When did a semi-State body ever keep an eye on its costs as jealously as a private company with shareholders has had to do?  When did that happen?  What check will there be on the INPC, which has already lost, I know it is only peanuts, only peanuts of millions of pounds, but some millions of pounds since its establishment only a few years ago?  Who will keep a check on their operating costs, on their efficiency, on their notions of extravagance, on their notions of economy?  Who will prevent those costs, over and above what private enterprise would have developed, being fed into the ultimate cost to the consumer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer first <Col N="2549" /> to the statement of Deputy Barry Desmond in the House last evening when he referred to the white elephants of Cork Harbour.  I deplore that reference being applied to Whitegate and other industries and activities in Cork Harbour.  I was very anxious to hear him, as he promised he would, dissect the white elephant of Whitegate from tusks to tail.  I came in especially to hear that dissection which I did not hear.  Perhaps he had second thoughts about it.  Perhaps my colleague from Cork North-Central or his colleague from Cork South-Central in the Labour Party advised him not to be carrying on with that kind of stuff about Cork Harbour.</P>
      <P>I would ask him: is he now saying that his own leader, the leader of the Labour Party, who was Minister for Energy in the short-lived Coalition Government of 1980 to 1981, was wrong in his decision, collectively taken, to take over the oil refinery, the decision in principle, after many months of questioning by us Deputies from Cork as to what were their intentions?  They kept stalling us telling us about consultants' reports they were waiting for.  However, with the onset of the general election things changed.  It has been stated tonight that the taking over of the oil refinery by the State was a promise made by Fianna Fáil candidates, or aspiring TDs, in the constituencies around Cork Harbour but I wonder if Deputy Kelly is dissociating himself from the statements of his colleague, Deputy Hegarty of the East Cork constituency. Deputy Hegarty indicated to all and sundry in east Cork at the church gates and elsewhere that he would see to it that the oil refinery was kept in operation. I deplore this running away from collective responsibility and commitment by colleagues at party level and the endeavour to shift the responsibility for their decisions in principle to somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the mid-fifties it was realised that there was a need for a refinery and the Government agreed to the refinery commencing operations in 1959.  The Government gave it significant tariff protection to assist its setting up.  I contend that the <Col N="2550" /> decision was the correct one but I deplore the fact that the refinery was deprived of investment for many years.  That should not have been allowed to happen.  While it was happening the shareholders, the international oil companies, were investing elsewhere.  If we looked at the possible alternative to the purchase of the Whitegate refinery by the State we would see that we would be depending for the supply of oil, and its by-products, totally on those same people who did not invest in the refinery.  Whatever about the technical aspects of the Bill outlined by previous speakers &mdash; I am not a lawyer and I am not qualified to go into that matter in detail &mdash; it is my view that it is a necessary consequence of the decision to purchase the refinery.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the 250 jobs &mdash; 150 directly employed and upwards of 100 in ancillary services &mdash; will be saved.  The workforce in that refinery are highly skilled and dedicated.  The refinery was virtually free of industrial unrest through the years.  There has been a commitment by the employees to keep the refinery going and that is to be commended.  What better way to recognise that than for the State to agree to taking it over, as the Government propose.  Money should be invested in it so that it can be upgraded and the running down that was allowed to happen, halted.  This move by the Government will keep a valuable work-force in their jobs.  Important though that is &mdash; it is vitally important that those jobs be maintained &mdash; I contend that the decision to purchase the refinery by the State is of significant importance in the context of national independence.  It is the only refinery we have and it was essential that it be purchased by the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by the speakers last night when they pointed out that we needed additional time to discuss this topic.  I should like to make it clear that I did not bring this Bill in in the last week or two with the intention of forcing it through the House in one hour-and-a-half.  The Bill has been available for three weeks and <Col N="2551" /> was on the Order Paper but was not taken for one reason or another.  It is a debatable topic and there are many sides to the arguments but they must be put in perspective. In the short time available to me I will try to deal with the arguments made last night and tonight.  I accept that oil companies have rights but when we are talking about a commodity such as oil which is the lifeblood of the economy I do not think it is fair to compare it to the selling of a cabbage or sweets.  We are dealing with a more important commodity which must be looked at in the context of the national economy.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask Members opposite to cast their minds back to 1979, and before, when there were queues for petrol and oil.  What would be the cost to the national economy if we were left without oil for a number of days or one week?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies opposite should put their arguments in perspective. I do not deny the legal ability of Deputy Kelly, or his ability to debate the constitutionality of Bills, but, in fairness, he should put all arguments in relation to the matter before the House on the table. It was strange to listen to Deputy Desmond referring to this as a white elephant when he was junior Minister in the last Government who took a decision in principle to buy the refinery.  It was surprising to hear him turning his face away from that decision.  It is strange ideology coming from the Labour Party.  In fact, it is strange ideology coming from the two speakers opposite.  They may have arguments that are worth listening to but they should practice what they preach.  Some weeks ago in the House those Deputies trouped through the division lobbies in favour of nationalising a textile plant and that does not bear any comparison to the decision the House is being asked to take this evening.  Yet, they are prepared to turn their heads away from that.  I say, let the people of the country judge us on our <Col N="2552" /> statements here.  That is what democracy is all about.</P>
      <P>I do not doubt the ability of Deputy Kelly in regard to the legal position.  This was a difficult decision in principle for the last Government and it is equally difficult for the present Government, and to try to equate it simply with election promises is not on.  The Deputy is being simplistic about the facts and I do not want the position to be misinterpreted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell the Deputy when I come to it.  The Deputy is far from reality and I want to put him and Deputy Desmond right about the life span of the refinery.  For a start, the INPC, when they took over the refinery, clearly stated that the Whitegate refinery was one of the best maintained throughout Europe, that its minimum life span would be about ten years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputies over there and over there decide to go on any road, they will follow it to the end.  I will give the facts and let them speak for themselves.  The life span of the refinery would not be seven years but at least ten years with the possibility that it will be 15 years.  I have no doubt that in present circumstances it will last that length of time.  I have told the House what the consultants say about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What did they say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recent advice I have following the opening up of equipment in the start-up maintenance is that a life of at least ten years to 15 years can be safely projected and that this can be considerably extended at modest cost. The decision to amend the 1971 Fuels Act was a deliberate one.  There is a flavour of emergency attaching to the Act, but there was also a deliberate decision at the time not to use the word &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; when the Bill was being <Col N="2553" /> drafted.  I am satisfied after looking at both sides of the argument, that the advantages of using the 1971 Act outweigh other considerations.  I believe this kind of legislation to be in the public interest and the common good, that it is fully justified by Irish law and that it is in compliance with the Treaty of Rome.  I say this on the best advice available to me.  Deputy Kelly is a legal man but anyone who puts up the arguments advanced here by Deputy Kelly is living in a fool's paradise.  I am going on the best advice given to me.  Of course when it comes to international law and Article 36 of the Treaty of Rome, nobody can give an absolute guarantee, but on the best advice available to me the 35 per cent requirement complies with Article 36 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, the major requirement of national security.  If somebody tells me that the purchase of the refinery was not a question of national security I can only refer him to what happened here before.  We have been seeing headlines in the newspapers, articles all over the place, and we have to extract the facts from the morass.  I have put all the facts, given to me by the best advice I have, on the table and let the people's judgment prevail at the end of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been talk about market prices for oil.  I intend to do all in my power to minimise the effect of Whitegate in this area, and a process of consultation about a special price regime for heavy fuel oil is well under way.  A final Ministerial order will not be drafted until a wide process of consultation has been completed.  When the order comes before the House I will be only too glad to give Deputies detailed explanations.  Necessarily, an amelioration for HFO will mean a heavier burden on lighter products.  I have said that the cost of Whitegate would be equal to 1½p per gallon on all products for the entire market but I cannot say now on which products and in what proportions it will be applied.  I have been saying in my statements that we have been told by the INPC what the real cost of this will be.  It is interesting to know that the INPC will be able to refine the crude at Whitegate <Col N="2554" /> at a lower processing cost than they had been getting on quotation from virtually any other refinery in Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  I have been basing my statements on the best possible advice.  In relation to what we should do in regard to investment, Deputy Desmond asked me what the right investment options are. The first one is the vis-breaker which would cost $17 million to $18 million. The second investment option is a coking plant at a cost of between $40 million and $50 million with a pay back period of three years.  Incidentally, the pay back period for the vis-breaker would be two years.  The first option would give better production but the coking plant would give even more.  The installation of a catalytic cracker would give the best refining levels.  The original cost of this would be in the region of $150 million. Of course there are technical problems.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We also know that when Whitegate was established in 1959 there was a premium to be paid, the same as I have to pay a premium on my life or the Deputy pays a premium on his life.  The premium in 1959 was 1d per gallon, and if we want to reflect back on what the price of petrol was at that time it was approximately between 11d and 12d a gallon, so the premium represented approximately 9 per cent or 9½ per cent of the price of a gallon of petrol at that time.  Now I want to relate that to today's terms and bring it right up to date.  If anybody tries to tell me that the price of petrol is going to go up by 9 per cent or 10 per cent per gallon I would say they are absolutely foolish to make that assumption.  The wild exaggerated assumptions made by Deputy Desmond of 20p to 30p a gallon are no more valid than some to the other figures that have been tossed around this House since this Bill came in.  I have not finally decided yet, but if I were to exclude heavy fuel oil and not put any cost on to it, the premium would not be anything like what Deputy Desmond says.  If I were to exclude the light fuel oil and put it all on petrol, it would not even reach the figures that Deputy Desmond talks about.  All the various options are being examined and when I make my final decision I have to strike the right balance between industry and consumers and so on, realising the fundamental principles of keeping our industry competitive and looking after and keeping down ESB prices which effect every consumer and the price of petrol.  I have to make a fair and balanced decision at the end of the day.  That is exactly what it is going to be, and Deputies should not be pulling figures out of the air that bear no relation to the reality. The figures are there and are available to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making my decision here as Minister.  I will be responsible to the public for the decisions and actions I take.  That is the essence of democracy.  If Deputy Kelly wants consultants to run this economy and make up my mind for me, let me tell him that I am not that type of person; I make my own decisions and I will stand over every single one of them and let the public decide at the end of the day whether they want to accept my decisions as being in the best interests of the common good when they were taken and if they had the right balance.  Consultants will sometimes produce the results we want them to produce.  I have long experience of consultants.  I use them to produce facts. But they do not make up my mind for me, and may God forgive me if I ever see the day when I would allow them either to run my business or make my political decisions.</P>

Let me inform Deputy Desmond that if we close the Whitegate oil refinery tomorrow morning and do no refining in it at all then, under the obligations in regard to national storage and in the interests of national security, an additional storage package has to be provided. <Col N="2558" /> I have also gone through the figures in that respect, and the figure that would be required to put the alternative storage there to make up for the oil that would be refined through Whitegate at any point in time far outweighs the cost of putting Whitegate there in the first instance.  The Deputy can do his sums any way he likes but he will get the same answers as me.  But let him not take part of the equation and say that is the answer. He should put all the figures down.</P>

      <P>I know well what the Deputy is trying to misrepresent here.  It is a strange conversion from the ideology that used to be part and parcel of Labour Party policy.  It is a pity that other Members are not here to listen to the Deputy. That is the situation.  The Deputy's argument falls flat on its face when he talks about providing the adequate storage that would be required.  Furthermore, it would take three or four years to get that storage facility put into position and, where goes the national security and the 90 days in the meantime?  That is part of the argument that has been advanced here in relation to it.  I would love to have a much longer time to go into more of the nitty gritty and the fine detail of it.</P>

      <P>But we must remember one thing.  Whitegate oil refinery closed last May.  There was always a premium there, the same premium as existed since Whitegate was put in in 1959.  It was 1d on a gallon of petrol which cost between 11d and 12d at that time.  If all the great men with figures over there put it into today's perspective what figure would they come out with as the equivalent? <Col N="2559" /> This nation paid that premium and was happy to pay it.  There has to be a premium if we are to talk about security in any form, whether it is one's life or anything else.  I never denied that there was a premium.  But I am prepared to say openly and honestly that it will be lessened as much as possible in the areas of this economy and this country where this must be done.  That premium is there. But it was also there when Whitegate closed last summer.  Did anybody see a reduction in the following months?  No, we did not.  It never came through.  So let us be honest about it and say that we have there and we need, for our national security, that element of it.  There is a premium to be paid.  No one denies it.  It has to be lessened to the greatest degree in parts of our economy.  That is a decision that has to be made and that is precisely the road I am travelling along. But when we talk about market prices and the price of crude today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity to highlight injustice in the administration of housing grants.  Many people have been deprived of grants to which they are legitimately entitled.  This situation arose due to the withdrawal of reconstruction grants after a certain date. This brought about a flood of applications which led to grave administrative problems in that section of the Department. People are still awaiting grants to which they are entitled.  They are receiving the reply from the Department that there is no record of their applications, despite the fact that they made legitimate applications and received acknowledgements from the Department.  The Department is in turmoil, and this fact has been brought out at Question Time and during <Col N="2563" /> other debates.  The Minister must accept that a great effort is needed to straighten out the affairs of his Department in relation to the payment of grants and the necessary inspections.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for a grant, work had to be completed by 30 June 1981, but in many cases the work has not yet been inspected and as a result grants have not been paid.  This unsatisfactory position demands drastic action.</P>
      <P>In general these grants were applied for by working-class people with small homes who wished to provide the necessary facilities or carry out improvements such as the replacement of windows, the building of chimneys or the replacement of a roof.  Many people have not an inside toilet and in some rural areas there are houses which have not even an outside toilet or a bathroom.  The grants were also available for the extension of kitchens or the addition of an extra bedroom in the case of large families.  These grants were essential to most people who availed of them.  In some cases people improved their houses by putting in aluminium windows and building sun porches, but generally the grants were sought for improvements which were absolutely necessary and the people who undertook these works could not have done so unless grants were available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tenants of local authority houses had improvements carried out at their own expense with the aid of grants and some, later on, purchased these houses.  Grants were applied for to improve the facilities available.  These were ordinary people seeking to upgrade their living standards &mdash; in most cases these were substandard &mdash; and I was surprised that these grants were withdrawn.  House improvement grants go back to 1919.  It was recognised, even then, that people required help to improve their living standards.  These grants continued interruptedly until withdrawn on 21 January 1980.  This was a bad decision of the Minister's Government and I, certainly, would not be proud if my party in Government had taken that decision.  This withdrawal created the problems experienced by people who have applied for grants ever since.  People <Col N="2564" /> were notified that they had to apply before 21 January 1980 to receive the grant.  Later on, they were notified that if the work was not completed and the Department notified to that effect before 30 June 1981, the grant would not be made available to them.</P>
    <P>The crunch of the matter is that the Department accepted applications from these people in an open-ended situation, with no time limit on completion of the work being involved.  Many of these people had already applied before notification of withdrawal of grants.  They were lulled into a false sense of security that a grant would be available to them when the work was completed.  This is a very important factor.  Applicants were notified through the media of the time limit.  The Minister, when questioned about applicants not being aware of the closing date said that this date was extended twice, the final date being 30 June 1981, that this fact was given considerable publicity in March 1981 and again in June 1981, that large notices were published in all five Sunday newspapers and these facts figured prominently on television and in the news bulletins. Does the Minister consider that adequate notice to people who have applied for grants with no strings attached?  Does he believe that everyone reads the Sunday newspapers or, even if people do read them, that they read the advertisements?</P>
    <P>If a survey were carried out, it would be found that quite a few people do not read Sunday newspapers and never read advertisements in any newspapers.  Many do not listen to news bulletins and follow only sport on television or in the papers. The Department were obliged to inform, by registered post, every applicant who had been accepted that he must notify the Department by 30 June 1981 to qualify for a grant.  The people involved were those in the lower income classes who do not pay too much attention to newspapers. These people could not have afforded, without a grant, to carry out reconstruction.  They have been put in very dire financial straits by having to borrow the shortfall, on which they are <Col N="2565" /> now paying very high interest rates, in addition to the capital.</P>
    <P>If the people deprived of these grants came together and challenged the matter in the courts, I do not believe that any judge would give a decision against them. A large number of people have not received the grants and they should take a test case to the courts and challenge this unjust decision.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter.  A mistaken decision by the Government has caused this situation and the Minister is directly responsible for depriving these unfortunate people of the grants to which they are entitled.  Does the Minister believe that people who are due grants of from £600 to £1,000 would not have applied before 30 June 1981 had they known that it was necessary to do so to receive these grants?  I know many of these in Kilkenny city, without having to go outside it, and of a few cases where the work was inspected by a Government inspector but the grant has not yet been paid.  That type of case can be contested.  The Minister cannot use the fact that he notified these people by newspaper advertisements and television to refuse to pay the grants.  I ask the Minister to give serious thought to this and make these grants available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the old scheme of grants, the Minister for the Environment announced on 21 January 1980 that they were being terminated as and from 1 February 1980. That appeared in an announcement on the press and was also made on radio. Between that date and 1 February over 40,000 applications were received in my Department.  I wish to put it on record that in 1980 and 1981 over 50,000 housing grants of all categories were paid by my Department.  The amounts involved were £27 million and £30 million respectively. This was a major achievement and reflects credit on the staff who looked after this scheme which was on a massive scale.  The money was provided to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We announced on two occasions that the scheme was being terminated.  In March 1981 we announced that the latest <Col N="2566" /> date for applications was March 1981. After a request made by Members at Question Time that I have another look at the position, the date was extended to 30 June 1981.  We then left office and what happened?  The then Minister, Deputy Barry, was asked a Question in December 1981.  In reply to Questions Nos. 333 and 335 on 17 December 1981 he said: &ldquo;Under the housing regulations 1980, as amended ...&rdquo;&mdash; I shall not read the reply as it is well known.  In other words, he was satisfied that the extension of the closing date to 30 June 1981 received adequate publicity in March.  It featured prominently on radio and television news bulletins and notices were published in the Sunday newspapers. On 14 June 1981 large notices were published in all Sunday newspapers. Accordingly I have no proposals to amend the regulations in regard to this matter.</P>

      <P>There was a time limit in respect of the pre-1977 applications. This was enforced by the 1979 Housing Act which was passed by the Oireachtas. In any case where notification of completion was received by 30 June 1981 at least one inspection has been carried out.  If on inspection the work was not completed payment could not be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to answer some of the serious allegations which were made as far as the staff in my Department are concerned. At Question Time Deputy Fitzpatrick said that files were burned and lost in my Department.  He said yesterday evening that people who were entitled to grants were robbed of them.  That was the word that was used.  Deputy Quinn was also here and I asked him if he would give me some of his time.  However, I did not have enough time to go into it in detail. He endorsed my remarks.  This is a serious matter.  Human nature being what it is, no-one is perfect but I am satisfied about one thing: the officials in my Department and in other Departments do their job to the best of their ability. There may be human error.  I am not a <Col N="2567" /> perfectionist but I do the best I can.  I assure the House that I have asked the grants section since I returned to office a few months ago to see what new arrangements can be made to streamline the work of the section.  That is under way at present.  Indexing and so on will be computerised. I have also made other changes which I hope will help us to get information more quickly.</P>
    <P>In regard to grants which, for one reason or another, could not be paid, my officials brought a number of files over here and explained to representatives both here and in the Seanad exactly what the position was and why the grants could not be paid.  I have nothing to hide and I will not hide anything.  When I returned to the Department I took over a Mickey Mouse of a reconstruction scheme.  I altered it to include repairs to the fabric of the house.  I know that Deputy Crotty is a reasonable and honourable man.</P>

      <P>The pupils in the Killinick and contiguous area reside in the Bridgetown catchment area.  Those who are <Col N="2433" /> three miles or more from Bridgetown are eligible for, and can be provided with, free transport to that centre.</P>
      <P>Pupils who are eligible for free transport to Bridgetown may instead qualify for catchment boundary facilities to Wexford centre, i.e. they must make their own way to the catchment boundary for Wexford and board the bus at a point on the Wexford side of the catchment boundary.  Under the terms of the free transport scheme such facilities are provided on condition that there is spare room on the relevant vehicle after pupils attending their appropriate centre have been accommodated and that no extra cost to the State is incurred.</P>
      <P>No guarantee can be given that accommodation for pupils availing of catchment boundary facilities will be available in any particular school year.</P>
      <P>The circular letter issued each summer to the parents of such pupils by the transport liaison officer for Wexford town does not, as the Deputy states, refuse transport to Wexford for the pupils, nor are they allocated spare spaces on a fare-paying basis.  The letter advises parents that there can be no guarantee of places for pupils availing of catchment boundary facilities on services operating from the following September.  If seats are available after provision for eligible pupils is made, free transport will be provided for as many of the catchment boundary pupils as possible.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 10 May to 19 June 1982, after which date he was certified fit to resume work.  He was not qualified for payment as, according to the records of the Department, he had not the required minimum of 26 paid or credited contributions in the contribution year 1980-81 which governed his claim.  On 24 May 1982 he was requested to furnish details of his employment record in 1980-81 which might serve to qualify him for payment.</P>
      <P>Following the receipt of an employer's statement it was established that the claimant had sufficient contributions to qualify him for disability benefit at the appropriate maximum weekly rate from 13 May 1982, fourth day of incapacity.

      <P>The claimant is not qualified for payment of disability benefit as the employment contributions paid in respect of him are not reckonable for disability benefit purposes.

      <P>On 19 April 1982 a notification was received from the South Eastern Health Board stating that the claimant was still incapable of work and was receiving supplementary welfare allowance.  Following inquiries regarding the amount advanced by the health board, payment of disability benefit was resumed from 14 April 1982. As, however, the claimant only submitted his medical certificates at irregular intervals and as he was paid on the basis of the medical evidence received, the cheques were issued at irregular intervals. The claim was recently reviewed and it was decided, in view of the nature and duration of the incapacity, to pay him weekly in advance in future and to require him to submit medical certificates at monthly intervals only.

      <P>The suggestion made by the Deputy will be borne in mind in the context of the review of the free fuel schemes which is at present taking place.  A general extension of this nature would, however, cost about £550,000 for each additional week.  Another approach might, however, be for persons to avail themselves of existing provisions in the scheme of supplementary welfare allowances. These provide for the payment of allowances to persons with exceptional heating needs because of ill-health or infirmity.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of disability benefit since 5 December 1981.  As, according to the records of the Department, he has only 74 contributions in respect of insurable employment to his credit since his entry into insurance in 1976, his entitlement is limited to payment for 52 weeks.  He would require a minimum of 156 such contributions to qualify for invalidity pension.</P>
      <P>An inspector will visit him at an early date with a view to ascertaining whether he had any earlier periods of insurable employment which would serve to qualify him for invalidity pension.  If it transpires that he had sufficient additional employment to bring his total of contributions paid to 156, the earliest date from which he could be paid invalidity pension is 5 December 1982 as the relevant regulations require applicants for such pension to have been incapable of work for at least a year before being transferred to invalidity pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since assuming office I have adopted a number of measures which will improve the financial position in relation to the current expenditure of local authorities.  The statutory demands in respect of supplementary social welfare allowances and the maintenance of drainage schemes were limited to an increase of 18 per cent over 1981; the previous administration's decision not to allow the allocation of 40 per cent of the proceeds from the sales of local authority houses towards their current expenditures was reversed.  The benefit in revenue to Cork County Council of these two measures will, in 1982, amount to an extra £387,000.</P>
      <P>In addition, provision was made in the budget for extra allocations totalling almost £24 million for various local authority services.  Cork County Council will receive an equitable share of these funds including £780,000 extra for roads and £230,000 for environmental works.</P>
      <P>The net effect of the measures which I have taken is that Cork County Council will benefit in 1982 to the extent of almost £1.4 million extra in its finances.</P>

      <P>Overall responsibility for the control of water pollution rests with the Minister for the Environment.  At the same time, under the Fisheries Acts 1959 to 1980 I have responsibility for the conservation of our fish stocks.  I am very concerned about the pollution of our waters and the regional fisheries boards under the aegis of my Department are to the forefront in combating water pollution, including taking legal action against offenders.  The regional fisheries boards keep records of fish kills reported to and investigated by them and are required to furnish monthly returns to my Department. While official records of incidents of water pollution are kept by various bodies concerned I have, however, directed that my Department consult with the Department of the Environment so as to arrange for the keeping of records of fish kills on a centralised national basis. Such records, while important, will not of themselves solve this difficult problem of water pollution.  The full co-operation <Col N="2463" /> of everybody concerned is urgently required.</P>
