      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 6 and 15.  By agreement the three Supplementary Estimates being introduced today will also be disposed of today. While the remaining Estimates and Supplementary Estimates are being disposed of today they will be moved in the order listed on the Order Paper except for the following which will be moved and debated in this order at the end: Votes 35 and 36, Fisheries and Forestry (together); Vote 9, Public Works and Votes 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27, namely, the Justice group (together).</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, will the Taoiseach investigate the leaking of part of the report of the Commission on Taxation in a morning newspaper today?  In view of this report will he arrange for the circulation of the first report to Members of the House or at least place a copy in the Dáil Library today if sufficient copies are not available for circulation?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am increasingly disturbed about the number of these leaks. As the Deputy is aware, the Stardust Tribunal report was also leaked.  In this modern world of ours it seems very difficult to preserve any sort of confidentiality any more.  But I agree that, now <Col N="1870" /> that these reports have emanated about the Income Tax Commission report, it would be desirable to get a report out publicly as quickly as possible.  I will see what can be done about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>The House is being asked to pass in their totality Estimates for all the remaining Departments, being in their original form as presented and in a number of cases involving additional Supplementary Estimates of a considerable nature.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could indicate where the savings of £45 million indicated by the Minister for Finance will be made this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not provided in any of the Estimates today.  The Minister for Finance has already indicated that this and other over-runs will be dealt with by proposals he will bring forward later in the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about an over-run.  The Minister has indicated that a sum of £45 million is to be saved on departmental Estimates so as to fund the tax concession in respect of PRSI contributions. It seems extraordinary that the House is being asked to adopt all the departmental Estimates in their original form, together with a number of Supplementary Estimates, while the Minister for Finance has indicated on several occasions that he intends to effect a saving of £45 million in the course of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that it is being voted does not mean that the money will be spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather a lot to invite the House to adopt all these Estimates while we have already been told of the Government's intention that £45 million of these Votes will not be expended. Surely it shows something less than courtesy to the House to expect us to pass Votes involving hundreds of millions of pounds while the House has been told quite clearly by the Minister for Finance that he intends across a spectrum of Departments to implement spending cuts of £45 million.  Those cuts will not be implemented until August but in terms of annual outlay they represent cuts of £100 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The money may not be expended, even though it is being voted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Since a commitment has already been given by the Minister for Finance that £45 million of these moneys will not be spent, surely it shows less than courtesy not to inform the House of the Departments in which these cuts are to be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  That does not follow.  Despite our best endeavours to provide additional sitting times on Fridays for full discussion of these Estimates, the House has not been able to get through them.  I will not now go into the reasons for that.  We have done our best to provide time for the Opposition <Col N="1874" /> to discuss Estimates more fully this year than any other year.  The Estimates are going through now in the way agreed by the Whips because there is no alternative facing the House.  It is not the Government's fault that they have not been discussed in greater detail, Estimate by Estimate.  We are voting the Estimates as brought forward and the Opposition should not complain if we indicate clearly that we intend to the best of our ability to achieve savings on all these Estimates. We have already indicated on a number of occasions that the savings which will be achieved on expenditures and staffing, et cetera, will be made between now and the end of the year but that does not affect the normal parliamentary process of voting the Estimates through as provided for in the Book of Estimates.  In every year the Government and in particular the Department of Finance are expected to achieve savings on Estimates, even though those Estimates have been voted through the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I might approach the matter from a different direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, my understanding of the procedure this morning is that the Estimates will be brought forward by me or the individual Ministers and that in regard to most of the Estimates the proceedings will be confined to questions.  Subsequently, when the main body of Estimates and Supplementary Estimates has been disposed of, three particular groups will be debated fully.  At this stage the arrangement is that these Estimates will be brought forward by us and agreed by the House, subject only to questions of elucidation or information in regard to any particular Estimate.  I hope that arrangement will be adhered to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> I am very anxious that the agreement should not be broken and I accept what the Taoiseach says.  The Government have played their part in trying to give us time to debate these Estimates.  We were given an assurance that when the Dáil resumes we will have the opportunity of debating <Col N="1875" /> the remaining Estimates.  Deputy Boland's point is quite different and has nothing to do with the agreement.  It is a separate issue.  We accept that we have entered into an agreement that these Estimates should go through &ldquo;on the nod&rdquo; but Deputy Boland's point concerns the projected saving of £45 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Taoiseach's point but I consider my question ought to have been raised, and the Vote for the Taoiseach's Department seemed the most appropriate.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could indicate whether there will be any spending cuts or reductions in the Estimates and Supplementary Estimates in respect of his Department in the remainder of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we expect to achieve savings on staffing in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach could give some indication of the extent of the spending cuts which are to be effected in his Department for the remainder of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The real position is that I cannot give the Deputy the exact information at this stage.  They are not spending cuts, but we are hoping to achieve savings on staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>The House have already been told by the Minister for Finance that the Government have identified £45 million of spending cuts or savings, depending on one's definition of it.  If the Government have identified that, they must have also identified in respect of which Departments they anticipate those savings to be effected in.  In that context, I would have thought that the question was reasonable.  However, the Minister has indicated to the House that the question is impossible to answer.  That represents an answer in itself.</P>

      <P>With respect, so that the record may be accurate, I indicated that the precise question put by Deputy Boland was impossible to answer.  That does not say that it will not be feasible to indicate the nature and the areas in which economies on expenditure may be sought in the course of the year. That will be done and, as has already been indicated, there will be opportunities later in the year for the House to discuss the merits and demerits of these changes.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> It is one thing to agree the Estimates, but the question to which Deputy Boland is trying to get an answer is a simple one relevant to what we are discussing here. The matters are intermingled.  If somebody makes a statement that there is to be a saving of £45 million, where is the money to come from?  Surely someone can stand up and say it will be in this, that or the other Department.  Then the matter could be got out of the way.  If that statement is going to be made, someone must answer for it.  Where is the £45 million, in which Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a little out of order.  However, the position is, quite simply, that the Minister for Finance has indicated from time to time that there is a PRSI adjustment and that there are other overruns on Government Departments. I would make the point here, if I wish to be tendentious, that some of these overruns arise from under-provision in the Estimates prepared by the Government of which Deputy Boland was a member.  However, we are not going to go into that sort of political argument here.</P>

      <P>The position about these matters, overruns of any sort on the Estimates, has been mentioned several times by the Minister for Finance.  It is his intention, by a combination of staff savings and expenditure savings now and at the end of the year to restore these overruns.  That will be done by a combination of these measures.  As we are now only halfway through the year, it is not possible to indicate all the areas where the staff savings will occur.  However, we are endeavouring to achieve staff savings right across the board and we are endeavouring to achieve expenditure savings right across the board.  As I said in relation to my own Department, we are quite reasonably satisfied at this stage that we will have, in the Department of the Taoiseach, staff savings.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has endeavoured to answer the question &mdash; a technical question as he quite correctly identified it to be.  It is a technical question which he answered quite fairly in respect of his own Department.  He has indicated that there he intends to effect staff savings. Apparently, the Minister for Education, in moving his Vote for the Central Statistics Office, finds it impossible to identify whether there will be any savings in that Vote.  That is fair enough.  I am quite happy to move on. However, if we are to be technical, we had better be careful as to our choice of words.  A tax relief of £45 million should not be described as an overrun.</P>

The late Deputy Vivian de Valera came in here and discussed these at length.  He asked numerous questions and objected strenuously.  What Deputy Boland is trying to elucidate he is entitled to receive.  Five or six Supplementary Estimates have been already voted.  Last year we had Supplementary Estimates to the tune of £599 million.  The previous year we had Supplementary Estimates to the tune of £477 million.

We have a charade here week after week with time being wasted and not devoted to the matters set down and agreed for debate.  If the Deputy wishes to debate the Estimate, do so.  If the Deputy wishes to repeat with monotonous <Col N="1882" /> regularity the same questions he will get the same answers.  The answer is that the Government have been examining all the Departments and areas of spending within their control.  They are seeking economies under those headings and are committed to bringing forward a programme of expenditure reductions to achieve at least the £45 million in question.</P>

      <P>Is it anticipated that there will be a saving in respect of this Vote? This is the House of Parliament and not a collection of undergraduates to have some donnish person wave his finger at and give lectures to in outmoded economic theory.  The House is entitled to demand an explanation before it passes sums of £16 million and which in their totality will represent hundreds of millions of pounds.  It will take quite a long time.  We seem to be moving away from the technical nature of the discussion in which the Taoiseach and I were engaged, now that the Minister is being obstructive. The House is asking for a reasonable answer.  We are being asked to pass a vote of £16 million and have been told there is a considerable amount of money to be affected across all the Estimates.  It is reasonable to ask if it is anticipated that there would be savings in respect of this Estimate and, if so, in respect of which subhead and the amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are seeking economies from all Departments and in so far as subheads relate to particular Departments economies are being sought.  There is already sufficient indication of substantial progress in this area but since the totals have not yet been finalised it is not appropriate to indicate prematurely the precise scale of the savings which will be effected under any subhead.  That is not a lecture on economic theory but a statement of common sense and fact.</P>

      <P>The Deputy appears to be under a misunderstanding. <Col N="1883" /> What the House is being asked to do is authorise the maximum amounts of money which each Department may spend.  If Departments succeed in achieving economies within those totals, I would have thought that is desirable and something the Opposition have been asking for in recent months.  I fail to see the underlying rationale for complaining when Departments might actually bring in spending totals for the year which were less than the estimated sums voted.  That is what we are doing.  We are voting Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister for Education was around the political scene at all last year he must have realised that is precisely what the previous Government were trying to do.  It is reasonable that the House should have identified for it the Departments in which these savings are to be effected.  We are being asked to pass the Estimates in respect of all the remaining Departments.  We are told it is anticipated that the totality of the estimates will not be spent before the end of this financial year.  It is reasonable to ask in respect of which specific Department it is anticipated that the Estimates being passed this morning will not be spent in full.  Is it anticipated that the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Finance is one of the Votes in respect of which the Government anticipate there will not be need to expend the full amount authorised?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, staff can be deployed or allocated to various duties in the course of the year.  The fact that staff were initially <Col N="1884" /> recruited for one purpose does not preclude them being gainfully employed on other activities in that Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the rationale of what he is saying is that Departments are being asked to achieve economies but that the reality is they may not achieve any?  The sum of £45 million may not be recouped by way of economies in any Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not an accurate way of putting the matter.  That is why one must be careful about the way one replies to questions.  It is feasible in the course of the year to bring in one set of proposals which will achieve an economy on spending of £45 million or any other sum.  It is equally possible for other events to occur in the course of a year which would add to spending in various Departments, perhaps for matters quite extraneous to those considered to date.  For example, some catastrophe could occur somewhere in the world between now and the end of the year and the Government might be asked to send funds.  Between now and 31 December it is quite feasible that a number of events could occur which would add to or subtract from spending totals.</P>
      <P>The Government have embarked on a programme of action designed to bring forward economy measures which will produce savings of £45 million on the Estimates prepared for the House.  That cannot be a guarantee that the recorded figures on 31 December will show precisely that result because &mdash; other happenings may occur between now and 31 December.  That is a perfectly common-sense, reasonable, factual presentation of the matter.  If I am wrong I would be delighted if someone would point out in what respect it is incorrect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In this respect: the Taoiseach gave the House a categorical assurance on his own Vote that savings of at least £45 million would be effected across all the Estimates.  That was given in the light of his greater knowledge and parliamentary experience, over and above that of the Minister for Education, that catastrophies <Col N="1885" /> could occur in other parts of the world or in a part of the world called Ireland during the course of the remainder of the year which may necessitate additional spending.  In the full knowledge that such events may occur the Taoiseach was quite categorical that all these Estimates would not be spent but would be underspent to the tune of £45 million.  The Minister for Education has put down a small but significant marker. He has explained to the House that in his view it is possible that by the end of this year these Estimates may be overspent because of events yet to arise in the remaining six-and-a-half months of this year.  There is a lot of divergence, perhaps not for the first time, between the view expressed by the Minister and that expressed by the Taoiseach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I take it that when the Minister speaks about a saving of £45 million between now and the end of the year he means an overall saving taking one Department with another.  Am I right in thinking that indications so far suggest that that will be very difficult if not impossible to achieve? For the first six months of the year we appear to have overspent.  We appear to have borrowed as much as we anticipated would be needed in an entire year, but the Government say that due to buoyancy between now and the end of the year they will not alone make their target for the second six months but will retrieve what they have overspent in the first six months.  Furthermore, am I right in thinking that there are several Departments, including that for which I am spokesman, the Department of the Environment, for which substantial Supplementary Estimates have already been introduced to deal with overspending of one sort or another?  The Minister said it was because the Estimates were not large enough.  Be that as it may, the Government adopted those Estimates when they came into power.  They could have altered them but they did not.  They are their Estimates now.  They rejected them in January of this year and in the March budget they adopted them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Department of the Environment <Col N="1886" /> alone there is a very substantial Supplementary Estimate to pay for additional sums given to county councils here and there all over the country and for other things.  Does not all that suggest that the Government are really gambling in a reckless way, hoping that they will back a winner?  They are suggesting that they will have this saving overall when all the indications are there that at the end of the year they will be heavily off target on all sides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not recall the Taoiseach saying at any stage that the overall level of spending for the year would show a saving of £45 million on the Estimates as presented to the House.  I heard him say, and I repeat, that we were engaged on an exercise in Government designed to secure economies of at least £45 million.  The Taoiseach referred to PRSI adjustment and other overruns.  It would be at least £45 million and that certainly is achievable.  But it does not tell us what the final overall total spending for the year will be because, as I have indicated in reply to Deputy Shatter, it is possible for many other events to occur between now and 31 December.  When Deputy Boland asked a somewhat similar question I said that it was impossible to answer because no one can say at this juncture what the spending figure would be by 31 December.  Nobody on either that side or our side could foretell that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this and earlier Votes we have managed to uncork the genie out of the bottle and he has turned out to be a puff of smoke.  The Minister has explained to the House that you have a set of Estimates for the public Departments for the year and you have a Government target for the budget deficit. If after six months your deficit is £17 million or £18 million more than your projected deficit for the total year and if as well as that overspending in six months on your deficit for your 12 months' projection you also have a series of Supplementary Estimates banked up on Estimates not yet passed by the Dáil which must be passed today and presumably in the autumn also, and if in conjunction with that you have £45 million of notional savings of which your Minister for Finance has announced he will give the details in a fortnight, but in respect of which you are asking the Dáil to pass hundreds of millions of pounds today, yet the Minister responsible for moving most of this money is unable to identify a single penny in a single subhead in any Department in respect of which those savings are to be achieved.  The explanation for that is that you take the cork out of the bottle, the genie comes out and in all the smoke you say that nobody could say with any accuracy what the Government's final spending at the end of a 12-month period will be.  When you get to the end of the 12 months, whatever your spending was, you say, &ldquo;Yes, of course we saved £45 million because if it was not for the £45 million we saved it would have been £45 million more&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1889" /> This is a convoluted economic theory which was evolved in 1977 and we are seeing the manifestation of it now in most of the difficulties which this country faces.  It is doing all the sums on one side as to what you want to spend or promise and on the other side you write down all the figures as to what the revenue might be, and then you write in buoyancy, hope and smile, and away you go on a wing and a prayer.  At the end of the year you say that something must have gone wrong, the unions did not co-operate, there were difficulties on the international scene, inflation throughout Europe was higher than anticipated, but despite all these setbacks we will do the same figure for next year because we must keep our resolve.  We must keep our determination and if we can see that theory through there is no doubt but that by 1982-83 we will have abolished unemployment. That was the promise they made in 1978.  Instead of that the theory became abolished in December 1979 and it is now arriving back in a different form.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of what the House votes here and the declaration of the Taoiseach that it was his full belief and expectation that these Estimates would not be expended in full and the expenditure on them would be reduced by £45 million plus the equivalent of the overruns wherever overruns occurred, if you move four seats down to the Minister for Education you are told that nobody can anticipate what the expenditure on these Estimates will be and at the end of the year we will know for the first time.  Bearing that in mind, we will be told at the end of the year that whatever the total expenditure was it should have been £45 million plus the cost of the overruns because a marvellous effort was made by the collective wisdom and endeavour of the Cabinet and they saved that £45 million.  If it had not been for their heroic work, we would have been that much further into the manure business.  That is the extent of the Minister's economic theories in the House this morning.  Can the Minister tell us in respect of the vote of £68 million for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners whether it is anticipated that any of the projected savings will occur in this <Col N="1890" /> Department and, if so, in respect of which and to what extent?</P>

If he wants to have a wide-ranging debate and discussion, some of which would be of an academic nature, some of it of an almost metaphysical nature, and some of it of an accounting nature, I am quite happy, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to come to some agreement with the Whips and reorder the business of the House.  In the meantime, if we want to stick with the business before us and adhere to the times agreed to, I must resist the temptation to follow Deputy Boland in his excursions and flights of fancy.</P>
      <P>When he finally got to a question on the Estimate, he asked was it anticipated that there would be savings on this Vote, to which the answer is yes, we expect this Department to make their contribution to the economy.</P>

I want to remind the House that, in previous years, it was a Fianna Fáil Government who greatly expanded the staff and the investigative activities of the Revenue Commissioners because we very much wanted to achieve the maximum degree of equity in our tax system.  Part of that process is that those who are liable for tax should make their returns and should be seen to make their fair contribution.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I understand the Minister for Education is saying it is hoped to effect savings on staff in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. Does the Minister realise that the Revenue Commissioners appear to be literally years behind with their work, for the simple reason that they are understaffed? From the information given to the House within the past couple of days it appears that millions and millions of pounds worth of income tax and VAT were uncollected in the past 12 months. How does the Minister seriously suggest it will be possible to effect savings there? Does he intend to reduce salaries?  I presume not.</P>

      <P>I am giving the same reply in response to all these questions about exactly where economies are expected to be achieved, because all Departments and sections have been asked to secure economies and to bring forward proposals for that purpose.  If I say some Departments or some sections are not expected to achieve economies, Deputies opposite will want to hone in and say: &ldquo;You have selected Departments A, B and C for cuts and you have not selected Departments D, E and F. Why?  On what basis?  To what extent?&rdquo; At this stage, when no final decision has been taken by the Government as to the precise composition of the economies to be achieved, it is perfectly correct to state the position as it is, which is, that all Departments and sections have seen invited to bring forward proposals for economies.  Many have already come forward. Some have already been discussed. The process is not complete and, therefore, it is right to keep the possibility of savings open under all headings.</P>

Now when we try to do that we are told we are arrogant, that we are being unfair and unreasonable and that we are wasting parliamentary time.  Surely the Minister for Finance can tell the people of Ireland where he will get £45 million to pay for the PRSI reduction.  That is a simple question.  Is it in one Department or another Department?  The Minister cannot come in here and say that when they do their sums at the end of the year they will have another £45 million.

      <P>It is very appropriate that a similar question be asked on this Estimate. Is it anticipated that this Department will be asked to make savings?  The <Col N="1899" /> only Department that has been identified so far is the Department of the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach clearly indicated that he anticipated achieving a saving in his Department by way of staff savings. It is unfortunate that this Minister does not have as much information as the Taoiseach had and is not in a position to say where the savings will be made.  In the case of this Estimate it is particularly appropriate that he indicate if savings will be achieved and, if so, if it will be in the area of staff.</P>

If additional sums are required for particular Departments, those additional sums will be brought forward by way of Supplementary Estimates, as has been done in a number of instances.  That was why I said in reply to earlier inquiries that it was not possible for anyone to say what would be the final amount of spending for the year. I also pointed out that it is possible to come along with specific proposals to achieve economies of £45 million, just as it is possible to come along with proposals for tax changes or any other specific action.

They would be savings on the sums as provided in the Estimates established at the beginning of the year.  As I have already pointed out, that does not mean there will not be other changes either by way of additions to spending or reductions in spending, in the remaining months of the year.

      <P>I admire the tenacity with which the Deputy is pursuing all these lines of inquiry but I can only point out that questions of this nature are in the form of the question, &ldquo;Have you stopped beating your wife&rdquo; because regardless of what answer one gives it conveys the impression of some misdemeanour or misbehaviour by the party in question.  For that reason I do not choose to reply to the question in the form put by the Deputy.  I have indicated that no such decision has been made and that no such discussions have taken place but the Deputy knows well that neither he nor anyone else is in a position to anticipate what anybody might choose to talk about at some future date.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is making a valid point in that a number of people, including myself, have expressed concern to ensure that the right balance is struck in regard to the way in which moneys are allocated to the different levels of education.  Inevitably there will be differences of priority as between people. Some will put more emphasis on one level of education rather than on another.  To refer again to Deputy Boland, I am on record as having said on a number of occasions that perhaps there is a need for greater priority to be given to the primary school level of education.  For that reason I shall not attempt to reply in detail to questions of the kind put by Deputy Boland.  The particular reason why I had to be more careful in replying to Deputy Boland on the question of school transport, is because, as he knows, there were some forms of proposals &mdash; I am not saying these were from either the Minister or the Government &mdash; in the area of school transport.  If I were to say I were not aware of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However, the point is that if a Government are reviewing their spending programmes they must consider various headings of expenditure. If they failed to do so I am sure the Deputies opposite would be the first to accuse us of some form of dereliction of duty.</P>

Apparently as an aside the Minister said in the course of that answer that he is on record as saying that he considered greater attention should be given to primary education than to the other levels. Is it not reasonable to expect that that attitude be reflected in the Estimate whereas what we have is a difference of £50 million in respect of this level of education compared with post-primary education?

Sir, I am making the point that the Minister is misleading the House in so far as he has explained to the House that in his Supplementary Estimate on Vote 29 he is implementing the budgetary provisions of 25 March last and yet, two Votes later, he insists that he was unable to do anything with the Vote because it was prepared in January last.

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if my replies have given the impression of misleading the House.  Let me assure you, Sir, that there is no such intention on my part.  Inevitably when one is replying, as one is attempting to do briefly, apparently one may create that impression. May I suggest to Deputy Boland &mdash; as I imagine he would recognise &mdash; that it is feasible to come along and simply add on a smallish amount of money for once-off type grants and so on, or for grants in aid of the expenses of a number of youth activities, it is feasible to do that. I know, Sir, that it would be feasible to add on some sums of money to spending in various levels of education, I am not disputing that, but what I am suggesting is that if one wanted to achieve any sort of substantial alterations in the pattern of education spending, that is not something which can be done at the drop of a hat or overnight.  Let me point out that we were able to make one change which did affect primary education, namely, the reversal of the school entry age.  We did that because it was administratively feasible to do so and we made provision for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say also that if one were to try <Col N="1912" /> to go further than that it would be appropriate to provide time for consultation with the various interests involved in education, the various teaching bodies, the management groups, parents and so on.  For that reason I certainly did not wish to attempt any instant, overnight changes in the pattern of education spending.  Therefore, I do not feel that my replies were misleading in the context of dealing with what is, after all, supposed to be a discussion on the Estimates for spending for this year and not, Sir, at this stage, I understood, a discussion on the whole, general reform or policy for education.</P>

I want to go on record as protesting against the attitude of members of the Government washing their hands of the present Estimates.  These Estimates are the Estimates of the present Government.  They were adopted by them when they took office and altered where it suited them. The best evidence of that was given by the Minister this morning when he told the House that a figure of £229,000 was a Supplementary Estimate to implement a budget statement made on 25 March. How the Minister can say that these Estimates are not his is beyond me.  The Minister has adopted them and rejected the January budget.  His party introduced their own budget along different lines. The £45 million mentioned so often this morning is an alteration in the Estimate. It is a fact that that was an alteration in an Estimate and money must be found for it.  The Estimates were altered by way of additions and reductions.  I do not want to hear any more about these Estimates not being the Government's.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £90,388,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1982, for grants-in-aid of An tÚdarás um ArdOideachas, certain Higher Education Institutions and Services and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.</P>

      <P>The Minister has accepted that the Government had the capability of changing Estimates wherever they so desired and implementing those changes through their budget on 25 March.  I should like the Minister to indicate to the House whether, in respect of this Vote, he is in a position to answer a question which was put to him by a Member some time ago, asking him if it was his intention to increase higher education grants during this year in line with an undertaking given by his party during the February election campaign.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, that means that there will not be any increase in the grants this year because, as the Minister is aware, what is provided for in this Vote is money for the implementation of the existing higher education grants scheme in the form in which it was introduced last summer which represented, in many cases, an increase of up to two-thirds in the amount of grants being paid to eligible <Col N="1918" /> recipients.  It doubled the income limits in respect of applicants.  The sum provided for in the Vote for this year is to implement that scheme at those levels, £1,000 maximum grant.  If an additional provision is not being made it would appear that there is no intention to increase the grants in line with the commitment given in the election.  If there is an intention to increase the grant it would appear that the Minister is being less than fair to the House in presenting an Estimate which, obviosuly, will not be sufficient and will require adjustment.  Apparently, a further Supplementary Estimate will be necessary later in the year when the £45 million saving is being effected.</P>

      <P>I can see why the Deputy would want to draw attention to the improvements in the higher education grants scheme announced last year.  We know that that was some of the sugar to sweeten the pill of shoving up the school entry age.  However, I should like to point out that a decision has not yet been taken.  It will be taken very soon. If that decision requires additional expenditure it will be brought forward, as the Deputy correctly stated, in the form of a Supplementary Estimate at the appropriate time.  There is no basis for the other remarks which the Deputy made.</P>

      <P>That is wrong.  This is 9 July and it is not possible in the ordinary way for a change to be implemented in the higher education grants scheme in respect of the academic year which commences next October.  The Minister has chosen, as he did some weeks ago when questioned by Deputy De Rossa, not to answer the query honestly.  I will answer that question now.  There is no way at this time of the year, bearing in mind that those seeking higher education places have applied to the Central Applications Office in Galway where they were processed and placed on a computer, that changes can be made in the eligibility requirements for applicants for such grants.  That will entail opening all the grant applications again and having to <Col N="1919" /> re-run the entire computer programme. It was only with extreme difficulty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to continue on those lines.  There is no way a change can be implemented now.  It was only with extreme difficulty, and following protracted discussions, that on 2 July last year I was able to persuade the higher education authority and the CAO office to reopen the computer records and implement the major changes that were made last summer.  We are a week later this year and, to my knowledge, there is no way any major change in the scheme of grants can be introduced in time for the coming academic year.  If it is the intention to make changes the Minister has not made financial provision in the Estimate for them.  Obviously, if changes were proposed, financial provision would have been included in Vote 33, which is a Supplementary Estimate being introduced specifically for higher education and would be the appropriate vehicle whereby the funding of higher education in grant increases ought to be brought about.  I am merely drawing the attention of the House to the fact that this was an undertaking given apparently during the February election.  I think it is reasonable to ask whether the Minister is now accepting that his Government had the capability of altering Estimates to implement some of those undertakings?  It is important to point out that it appears as <Col N="1920" /> if this is not being implemented, particularly important because the question was asked some two months ago and the Minister indicated then that he would be in a position before the summer to say whether or not the grants were being increased.  I suppose the only complaint we could have is that the Minister has a different definition of &ldquo;the summer&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I think the Minister said this was one of the Departments that have been asked to effect savings and that it is hoped that they will be able to save on the original <Col N="1924" /> Estimate.  I put it to the Minister that does not make sense in view of the fact that he has just said there is a Supplementary Estimate for £16 million.  That Supplementary Estimate had to be cleared by the Department of Finance and presumably they were satisfied that there was not enough money available to the Department in the original Estimate to enable it to carry on for the year.  They cleared a £16 million Supplementary Estimate and the Minister tells us that the Department have been asked to find savings on its original Estimate and that he is hopeful they will do so.  In fairness to the Minister he did say earlier that the answer he is giving is a formal one, that it meant nothing, that he was giving it in respect of each Department.  I think he must agree, however, that it is not applicable here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">

      <P>I should point out that in this instance the bulk of the Vote is in effect to meet the cost of the operation of CIE.  That accounts for the lion's share of the original Estimate.  The Supplementary Estimate of £16 million being sought is also related to CIE.  This illustrates the point I was making earlier that other events can occur which give rise to the need for additional expenditure and if this happens it will be put in the form of a Supplementary Estimate and brought before the House as is being done now.  At the same time, it is perfectly valid to ask the Department of Transport to set about achieving economies on its own staffing and other activities which can yield savings as a contribution towards the overall spending cuts required of at least £45 million.  Those are both perfectly valid approaches.  It is perfectly possible to give extra money to CIE and secure economies elsewhere.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Would the Minister agree that if the Department of Transport are to make a real saving they will have to find the £16 million that we are now dealing with for a start plus whatever other amounts they can save, say £500,000.  If the Department save £16½ million in salaries or somewhere else they will have in effect <Col N="1925" /> saved £500,000 on the original Estimate. Is that not what the Minister is saying?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not correct in that kind of statement because in this particular instance the additional provision for CIE was announced in the budget statement on 25 March.  This Supplementary Estimate is giving effect to that announcement.  If the House votes this sum it is adhering to the spending figure put forward in that budget statement so there is not a need to find an economy of £16 million somewhere else in the Department.</P>

      <P>In response to this type of query some weeks ago, the <Col N="1931" /> Minister for Finance indicated that he hoped to have it completed within several weeks.  For various reasons there have been many pressures on the Government including, in the case of the Minister for Finance, the large amount of time necessary for the processing of the Finance Bill.  Therefore, it was not possible for the Government as a whole to allocate as much time as they would have wished to completing the exercise as rapidly as they would have wished.  I can only say it will be completed sooner rather than later.  It will definitely have been done before the resumption of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind that the Government and the public service will be on leave and that it is hoped to make a saving of £45 million, if these economies were to be begun in August there would be a saving of £100 million in a full year. However, if this has not been completed before the end of this month it could not be put into operation earlier than the end of September which would mean only four months, meaning that in a full year the figure would be £135 million.  Is it not therefore important that the process would be finalised before the end of this month?  Anybody speaking realistically would agree that this process should be ready to go into operation by the end of this month.  Can we therefore expect an announcement before the end of July?</P>

      <P>I cannot accept on behalf of my colleague the Deputy's <Col N="1932" /> suggestion that the position in relation to a large number of firms is a reflection on the calibre or performance of the Minister. Many factors could have been responsible for that, and because firms usually get into financial problems over a long period I would have thought that the Minister's predecessor in office would have to share some of Deputy L'Estrange's rebukes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £19,574,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1982, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, including sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose that the traditional practice of discussing the Fisheries and Forestry Estimates simultaneously be followed &mdash; in which case I shall move the Forestry Estimate when the debate concludes.</P>
      <P>These Estimates were of course settled by the previous Government and as a result of their efforts to reduce overall expenditure the Fisheries Estimate shows a decrease of £620,000 as compared with last year's Vote.</P>
      <P>The overrall decrease is due mainly to a reduction of £1,899,990 in An Bord Iascaigh Mhara's capital development grant.  Increases have occurred in the grant for sea fisheries development, inland fisheries development and the grant-in-aid for the Salmon Research Trust of Ireland Incorporated, and the provision for the repayment of advances.</P>
      <P>While, as Minister responsible, I would like to see greater expenditure on our fisheries and particularly on inland fishery development, I must accept that fisheries is receiving a fair share of the available resources.</P>
      <P>The value of domestic landings of sea fish in 1981, excluding salmon landings, amounted to £35.4 million as against £28.9 million in 1980 an increase of 18 per cent.  In addition there were landings into foreign ports valued in excess of £5 million.  The total quantity of fish landed at home ports in 1981 was approximately 177,000 tonnes.  This is a record figure and represents an increase of 42.000 tonnes over the 1980 catch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value of exports of all fish and fishery products has reached the record <Col N="1936" /> figure of £51 million as compared with £41 million in 1980, representing an increase of 24 per cent.  Over 60 firms are involved in fish processing operations employing about 1,700 people.  A total of 27 projects, incorporating either new processing plants or extensions to existing ones were approved for grant purposes in the calendar year 1981 involving a total capital investment of £7.4 million including State investment of £2.86 million.</P>
    <P>The large increase on our catch last year is clear evidence of the capabilities of our fishermen who can now compete on the fishing grounds with their counterparts from other fishing nations. Unfortunately, unit prices did not keep pace with the increase in landings but prices, I am glad to say, are for most varieties showing an upward trend. Mackerel, of course, was the main contributor to the increased catch and our processors, exporters and fishermen deserve congratulations for the fact that virtually all landings of mackerel were disposed of for human consumption.  It is true, of course, that large quantities of mackerel were purchased for freezing aboard eastern European freezer trawlers. There are those who say that this processing should take place ashore in Ireland and that is our ultimate aim. However, pending the full development of our processing facilities the freezer trawlers can provide a useful outlet subject, of course, to proper control and monitoring of their activities.</P>
    <P>As I said in the House during the debate on the Sea Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, what the fishing industry now needs is confidence.  I aim to give it that confidence.  I have already had discussions with the main representative organisations in the industry and it is my intention, following further discussions with those bodies and in consultation with BIM, to produce a new fisheries development programme.  A greater emphasis on refurbishing of the existing fleet, increased productivity and particularly on marketing will form part of such programme.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for 1982 for administration and <Col N="1937" /> current developments amounts to £5,010,000 and the grant-in-aid for capital development amounts to £3,500,000. Additional funds are available by way of repayable advances from the Central Fund, a line of credit from financial institutions and the Board's own resources to meet the demand by fishermen for loans for boats, gear, etc.  In addition to subvention towards the purchase of boats and gear the board's grant-in-aid for capital development also covers the provisions of services to the fishing industry such as ice plants and training facilities and grants for mariculture.  While it appears the grants available will be sufficient to provide grants under the BIM marine credit plan for all suitably qualified applicants making application, there will be a shortfall in repayable advances, something that should have been foreseen by the previous Government when the Estimates were approved.</P>
    <P>Interest in aquaculture in Ireland has grown rapidly in recent years, especially in the area of marine aquaculture, with the emphasis on oyster, mussel and escallop cultivation.  Although marine species such as oysters and mussels have been raised artificially for many years, their culture is a relatively new technology with continuing developments in methods of culture and this experimentation along with cultivation in new untried areas requires a period of testing and evaluation before success can be assured.</P>
    <P>The continuance of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara's mariculture grant scheme geared to the development of fish farming projects again played a significant role in the development of this sector.  Last year, the value of production was £1.8 million, this year it is expected to be well in excess of £2 million.  This is an area where progress is possible and I am examining ways and means of accelerating our mariculture development.  We have many advantages in Ireland in this field but careful planning and research is essential to ensure success.</P>
    <P>A sum of £4.15 million has been included in the Estimate for fishery harbour works.  This provision will be expended mainly on the on-going development schemes at the major fishery harbour <Col N="1938" /> centres at Howth and Killybegs. Work is being or will be undertaken at 12 other locations including Castletownbere. Rossaveal, Schull, Cahirciveen, Portevlin, Kilcummin and Killala.  Now that the development of the five major fishery harbour centres is nearing completion, it will be possible in the future to give more attention to minor harbours and landing places.</P>
    <P>The Central and Regional Fisheries Boards, which were set up in October 1980 continue to work for the better conservation, protection and development of every aspect of our inland fisheries.  The first elections to regional fisheries boards were held in December 1981 and the seats on the central and regional boards are now filled.  The membership of each regional board represents the various fishery interests in the region.</P>
    <P>Under section 32 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, the introduction of a staff scheme for the staff of the central and regional boards is well under way and a draft scheme is with the unions concerned. Also, I am glad to say that a superannuation scheme for the staff of the central and regional boards is at an advanced stage and is at present with the unions.  It is hoped to be able to introduce this scheme shortly, a long overdue scheme which will give continuity of employment and security to staffs of the regional boards.</P>
    <P>The most important aspects of our inland fisheries is our salmon fisheries. Provisional figures for 1981 show that the total weight of the salmon catch by all fishing methods was 655 metric tonnes valued at £2.3 million as compared with 895 metric tonnes in 1980 valued at £3.2 million.  The overall weight of our salmon catch in 1981 showed a fall of almost 27 per cent on the 1980 catch which in turn was 16 per cent below the catch of 1,073 metric tonnes in 1979.  This decline in recent years continues to be a cause for great concern.  For my part I am committed to the full enforcement of the law against illegal salmon fishing and the Department have again arranged for vessels of the Naval Service to patrol our salmon fisheries during the present season in support of the fisheries protection <Col N="1939" /> staff of the regional boards and the Garda.  Unfortunately, a work to rule by the protection staff reduced the protection provided for a period to an unacceptable level but I am pleased to say that the dispute has now been settled.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware the salmon levy has been discontinued from 1 June, 1982.  A total of £280,000 in levy has been collected to date.  While the levy was not acceptable to the industry there is general agreement that those who benefit from the development of our inland fisheries should contribute towards the cost of this development with the State, which is contributing £4.4 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>As the time available to me is limited I will conclude my remarks on fisheries by a brief reference to the discussions on the EEC Common Fisheries Policy. There has been little progress since the matter was discussed in this House recently.  The most recent meeting of the Council of Ministers failed to resolve the outstanding issues.  I made it clear to the Council that the present Commission proposals were completely inadequate as far as Ireland is concerned and as a result of my stand, improved quotas for a number of species have been proposed for Ireland.  Another meeting of the council is due to be held within the next two weeks and I can promise the House that I will continue to work to the limit of my ability to obtain a satisfactory policy for the Irish fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the Forestry Estimate. The nett amount required this year &mdash;£34,787,000, represents an increase of £767,000 &mdash; or only 2 per cent &mdash; as compared with last year.  The increase, which is mainly due to higher salaries and wages, the introduction of grants payable under the western development scheme and the increased cost of services, is partly offset by an increase of £1.65 million in appropriations-in-aid.</P>
    <P>Some of the subheads provide for roughly the same level of activity as last year and do not call for any special comment but if Deputies want detailed information about them I will be happy to provide it in my reply.  I will therefore <Col N="1940" /> concentrate for the most part on the other provisions in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Subhead A.1 &mdash; £9,580,000 provides for the salaries, wages and allowances of the Forest and Wildlife Service administrative and technical personnel.  There is an increase of £59,410 compared with last year.  Increases arising from the current agreement on pay in the public service will be provided for in the global vote for Increases in Remuneration.</P>
    <P>Subhead B.1 &mdash; £2,164,000 provides for travelling and incidental expenses and shows an increase of £619,000 on last year's allocation.  Heavy expenditure on travel &mdash; which is unavoidable, given the dispersed nature of the forests, is essential if field operations, including supervision of a large workforce, are to be efficiently carried out.</P>
    <P>Subhead B.2 &mdash; £659,000 relates to the cost of postal and telecommunication services.  The substantial increase of £422,700 this year, is due to the cost of operating the switchboard service at the Department's new offices in Leeson Lane, increased postal charges, and the provision of new telex services.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.1 &mdash; £3,200,000 is a grant-in-aid for the acquisition of land.  The balance in the acquisition fund at 31 December 1981, viz £653,000, together with £3.2 million now being provided should bring in about 18,000 acres in the current year.  The level of land acquisition in recent years has been quite unsatisfactory &mdash; especially having regard to the existing land reserve situation which, as well as being unevenly distributed, is now at a very low level.  The pattern of funding for the current year's acquisition programme was set by the previous administration and the maximum use is being made of it.  However, since land acquisition is the life-blood of the afforestation programme I am less than happy with the degree of funding for the purpose.  The provision of adequate finance for the acquisition programme in the years immediately ahead is something to which I will be giving serious consideration.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.2: Forest Development and Management &mdash; £24,348,000 &mdash; accounts for the bulk of expenditure in the Forestry Vote.  The major proportion of the <Col N="1941" /> expenditure relates to wages.  The increase, viz. £1,072,300, over the 1981 provision, is accounted for by wage increases, higher cost of machinery and materials, and increased cost of repair and maintenance of the forest machinery fleet.  The national forest estate now embraces 377,000 hectares (930,000 acres) of land, of which 304,000 hectares (751,000 acres) have been planted.  The activities covered by the subhead include the production of nursery stock; the establishment, maintenance and protection of State plantations; the provision of public recreation facilities; the purchase, maintenance and hire of machinery; the construction of forest roads; and the whole field of timber harvesting and conversion.</P>
    <P>The level of activity being provided for is roughly comparable with last year's performance.  I would like, however to make particular comment on some aspects falling under Subhead C.2.  As regards employment, the Forestry workforce now represents about 2,700 men &mdash; usually in areas where alternative employment prospects are poor.</P>
    <P>As regards the planting programme, the overall objective of the State afforestation programme is 10,000 hectares (25,000 acres) per year but it has not been possible to attain this target in recent years &mdash; due largely to difficulties in the land acquisition sector and the unsatisfactory position of the land reserve which I have already mentioned.  As a result, the area planted annually has been of the order of 7,000 hectares (17,500 acres) and it is expected that the current year's planting programme will be at about a similar level.  The Government are currently reviewing the situation in regard to the State planting programme with a view to settling policy for the years immediately ahead.  The stage is now being reached in Irish forestry where past investment is beginning to show a significant return.  With emphasis on timber harvesting now becoming more pronounced, the provision of adequate funds for forest roads and harvesting machinery assumes paramount importance.  It is intended to maintain the construction programme for new roads at last year's <Col N="1942" /> expanded level, and the repair and reconstruction of existing forest roads damaged by heavy extraction vehicles during last winter's bad weather will also be priority items.  While the updating and replacement of some of the fleet used by the Forest and Wildlife Service is an ongoing business, only the most essential of the used machines are being replaced this year but some funds may be allocated for the purchase of additional specialised timber harvesting equipment with a view to fulfilling commitments to the various elements of the timber industry.</P>
    <P>The medium density fibreboard mill at Clonmel which is being built by the Medford Corporation of Oregon, USA, is now well advanced and production is expected to begin by summer 1983.  When at full production this plant will employ 200 workers in the factory and a further 250 in timber harvesting.</P>
    <P>Some funds are also provided for the development of forest parks and the provision of general amenity and recreational facilities in State forests.  The largest element of the expenditure is in respect of labour employed in the maintenance of existing parks and amenities and tends to increase annually in line with labour and other costs.  The &ldquo;Open Forest&rdquo; policy, under which the public are encouraged to use State forests for recreational purposes, is now in operation for over ten years.  During that time eight forest parks have been created and three more are in course of development. In addition, at some 400 forest locations, parking, picnicking, forest walks and other amenity facilities have been provided. The demand for recreational use of forests continues to grow and the number of visitors remains very high but in the current financial situation some slow down in the rate of new developments is inevitable.</P>
    <P>The final part of subhead C.2 relates to timber conversion and includes provision for the employment of harvesting contractors to supplement the Department's direct timber harvesting and harvesting operations by customers who purchase standing timber.  This traditional pattern of contract harvesting provides a worthwhile <Col N="1943" /> service industry for the wood-processing and sawmilling sectors.</P>
    <P>The purpose of subhead C.4 is to provide a measure of grant assistance to Chipboard Products Limited at Scarriff, County Clare.  The House will recall that in 1980 a sum of £400,000 was provided to enable the receiver at Chipboard Limited (in Receivership) to continue operations for a limited period while proposals for restructuring the company were being considered.  This restructuring took place last year when a new company, Chipboard Products Limited, in which the State holds some 64 per cent of the equity, was formed.  In this context details of the agreements entered into with a private consortium were given to the House by one of my predecessors when he introduced the 1981 main and Supplementary Estimates for Forestry on 26 March 1981 and are recorded in the Dáil Report, Vol. 328, Columns 26-264. The new company have been in operation since May 1981 and the grant assistance of £919,000 now proposed is intended partly for capital development purposes and partly to meet the cost of subventing timber harvesting operations in accordance with the terms of the restructuring arrangements.  However, I should say that the company are continuing to feel the effects of severe competition from imported chipboard and the situation generally is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>The provision of grants for private planting in subhead D shows an increase of £375,000 over last year, largely explained by the necessity to provide funds for the forestry element of the EEC western package which came into operation on 15 April, 1981.  This scheme, in which the emphasis is on private forestry, envisages the afforestation in the west of Ireland, over a period of ten years, of 24,000 hectares of land which is marginal for agriculture but suitable for forestry. The total expenditure under the scheme for the ten-year period is £18 million, which is to be shared equally between the EEC (FEOGA) and the Irish Government. Grants are available up to a maximum of approximately £800 per hectare and a free technical advisory service on <Col N="1944" /> all aspects of the forestry operation will be provided by my Department.</P>
    <P>I need hardly stress that the planting of trees is an activity which is very beneficial from the national standpoint.  I would hope that, despite a somewhat slow start, there will be a more enthusiastic response to the western package scheme from owners of suitable land in western areas and that it will, as time passes, lead to a significant increase in the level of private forestry in this country.  The traditional private planting grants scheme will, of course, continue to operate as heretofore in the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>The modest increase in subhead G this year is due entirely to increases in remuneration of wildlife rangers.  Forty-nine rangers are now employed by the Forest and Wildlife Service and, while their duties extend to enforcement of all aspects of the Wildlife Act, their primary preoccupation is with hunting and poaching offences and illegal trade in wildlife species.</P>
    <P>Subhead G also includes provision for grants to regional game councils to assist local schemes of game development and also a small measure of assistance towards the development of game shooting facilities for visiting sportsmen.</P>
    <P>Subhead H provides funds for wildlife conservation.  The programme of work in that field is proceeding reasonably well despite the inevitable effects of present financial constraints on some activities. The two major elements of the 1982 programmes are wildlife research and habitat protection.  A variety of research projects is being carried out.  The results of a recent survey on the peregrine falcon, undertaken with the welcome assistance of the Irish Wildbird Conservancy, should be available later this year.</P>
    <P>I am happy to report a measure of progress in the establishment of statutory nature reserves.  Eight such reserves have already been established and I expect that number to increase to at least a dozen during the current year.  It is particularly pleasing to be able to report the fairly recent completion of the purchase of the largest and key area of Pollardstown Fen in County Kildare.</P>
    <P>I would not like to let this occasion <Col N="1945" /> pass without paying a well deserved tribute to the work of the Wildlife Advisory Council whose critical analysis of, and advice on, a wide variety of wildlife conservation topics is greatly valued by me.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned enforcement of the Wildlife Act, and the role of wildlife rangers.  Over the past five years, upwards of 270 successful prosecutions have been taken under the Act.  However, it is vitally important that the role of the wildlife rangers be complemented and supported by the promotion of public education and knowledge of wildlife matters. The Forest and Wildlife Service already have a wide range of wildlife literature which is distributed free on request and it is hoped to produce some further publications of interest, especially to school children, during the year.</P>
    <P>Participation by the Forest and Wildlife Service in international conservation activities is achieved through active involvement in organisations such as the EEC and the Council of Europe, and, where appropriate, in their work in the sphere of international conventions and regulations relating to the protection of wildlife, especially migratory species.</P>
    <P>Subhead I provides mainly for a number of programmes undertaken for my Department by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  These are concerned with the promotion of the use of home grown timber and the advancement of timber technology research.  The proposed increase in the subhead reflects the fact that only a token sum was provided for this purpose last year.  This gave rise to some criticism and following a review of the situation in the meantime, it was decided to reactivate some of the institute's work of promoting the increased use of native timber, particularly in the construction sector.  The other major element in subhead I is the provision of funds towards the activities of the Wildlife Advisory Council, to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>In subhead J, appropriations in aid, the main element of the forecast of income accruing to the Forest and Wildlife Service during the year relates to timber sales.  The present market situation is such that the immediate opportunities <Col N="1946" /> for increasing revenue from timber sales are limited and subhead J inevitably reflects this temporarily unsatisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>The domestic market for pulpwood is still depressed and some temporary measures, including sale of raw material for export, must still be tolerated in order to generate income, maintain employment and ensure continuity of trained harvesting personnel.  However, maintenance of the existing outlet at the restructured Scarriff mill, assuming its current difficulties are temporary, and the operations of the new fibreboard industry at Clonmel will provide a sound basis in the years ahead for the development of a steady market for smaller produce.</P>
    <P>Sawlog prices are governed by the level of activity in the building industry as well as by competitive imports and have fallen steadily in the last year.  However, in anticipation of an upturn in the market, I hope that projected income will be realised, perhaps through bigger sales volumes, albeit at more moderate prices.</P>
    <P>Looking at the situation in the longer term I believe that current problems in the timber sales sector are temporary.  It is accepted that wood will continue to be a scarce resource, not only in the European Economic Community but worldwide; and I am quite confident that, as the present general recession eases, the policy of maintaining production of such a versatile renewable resource will be fully vindicated.</P>
    <P>I have now dealt with the Estimates for Fisheries and Forestry in some detail and I commend both Estimates to the House for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to comply with the agreement reached between the Whips by restricting my speech to 30 minutes but the time is not sufficient to deal with Estimates of this nature.  At a later date the Minister might give us the opportunity to debate these matters more fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister complained recently about our inexperience in putting down a motion while he was involved in delicate negotiations.  I do not accept that. <Col N="1947" /> Our Government were involved in those negotiations a short time previously and the negotiations were carried out in a good spirit.</P>
    <P>I am dissapointed with the Minister's attitude to the question of fishing limits. This is an important issue and the decision taken will have long-term effects on the fishing industry.  I intend to bring to the Minister's attention the present position in regard to the 12-mile limit.  We made the point quite clearly that the Minister must insist on, and not accept less than a 12-mile limit.  I want to bring to the attention of the House the European Parliament Working Documents for 1980-81.  No doubt the Minister and his officials have these documents before them and they should be gone into.  An important section, No. 7, of that document dealing with the general principles for fishing limits, states:</P>
    <P>(c) outside a three-mile limit all Community fishermen should have the same access to fishing grounds.  For certain particularly dependent areas protective measures may be adopted by the Community for local fishermen. These safeguards may take the form of an extension of the three-mile limit up to a maximum of 12 miles....</P>
    <P>It also mentions certain technical measures such as increased quotas of catches.  From the same section I quote:</P>
    <P>(a) the necessity for a comprehensive system which takes account of social as well as economic factors, and the impact of Community decisions on particular fishing communities, and on jobs directly and indirectly linked to fisheries or aquaculture.</P>
    <P>(b) the need to pay due regard to the dependence of particular regions on fishing and to the contribution which fishing can make to the wellbeing of the poorer and more peripheral regions of the Community as recognised in The Hague Agreement of 1976, together with the losses suffered by Community fishermen in third country waters,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1948" /> These matters were very clearly pointed out during the last debate and brought no reaction from the Minister, which disappointed me very much.  There is no need for me to go through The Hague Agreement again.  Its contents have been spelt out absolutely clearly.  I quote now from the Minister's speech this morning:</P>
    <P>I made it clear to the Council that the present Commission proposals were completely inadequate as far as Ireland is concerned and as a result of my stand improved quotas for a number of species have been proposed for Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is not sufficient.  There is no use telling the fishermen that they will get extra quotas of fish.  The Minister must insist on the 12-mile limit.  It galls me to read the document which is before the Minister at the moment.  The French, in particular, have dominated this debate. They have so much right to our waters at present that they will clean them out and our fishermen have no hope of competing against them.  The Minister must change his stance and insist that these traditional rights agreements be phased out over a fixed period of five to ten years.  These agreements have been built up over a period of years.  The French have spent £290.5 million in modernising their fleet during the last ten years, to build up their case for these traditional rights at the end of 1982.  The Minister must fight their case with every breath in his body.  It is absolutely essential, for the long-term development of our fishing industry that the Minister make the right decision in these negotiations.  This morning he barely mentioned the EEC agreements. He can talk about expanding our fleet and development of one type or another but unless he gets a satisfactory and adequate agreement for our fishermen on these negotiations the long-term effect will be disastrous.  The Minister knows this perfectly well, he comes from a fishing county.</P>
    <P>We cannot allow fishing fleets from France, in particular, Denmark and all the other EEC countries to fish our coastal waters.  The six-mile limit is not acceptable.  If we cannot get the 12-mile <Col N="1949" /> limit we cannot expand our fleet.  The Minister says that we can do so if we get adequate quotas, but he is wrong.  The development of our fishing industry is starting from a very low base.  The other countries have at least a ten year start on us.  As regards the phasing out of the traditional rights, the Minister may wonder why I mention a period of from five to ten years.  I know, having taken part in some of these negotiations, that these people will argue that their fishermen got a living from our waters and that they built up these traditional rights.  That is the weak argument which will be put up. The Minister should be well able to argue, in turn, that they invested heavily in their fishing fleet in order to build up these traditional rights, but that we cannot any longer accept them.</P>
    <P>The Hague Agreement clearly states:</P>
    <P>Dr. Garret FitzGerald, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, won the following four concessions:</P>
    <P>Ireland would be treated as a special case as far as fishing was concerned requiring privileged treatment by comparison with other countries, including Britain.</P>
    <P>We were to be allowed to double our catch between 1976 and 1979&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Minister may make the point which he made the last time that we have done so.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to continue to increase it rapidly thereafter.</P>
    <P>That is important.</P>
    <P>We were given the right to take unilateral conservative measures in the interests of preserving stocks until such time as a Common Fisheries Policy was agreed.</P>
    <P>I bring the Minister's notice to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of July 3 1982, written by Albert Reynolds, which mentioned that 79 per cent of our fish may be given away:</P>
    <P>As the EEC countries come close to an agreement on a Common Fisheries Policy, it is clear that Ireland is <Col N="1950" /> to get less than 4 per cent of the total EEC fish quota &mdash; and worse still, Irish trawlers will be able to take only 21 per cent of the catch in Irish waters.</P>
    <P>That is an important, well-written and researched article which states the unfair terms being negotiated at the moment. We have a good coastline but a poor fishing fleet with certain problems, financial and otherwise, facing them at the moment.  The Minister has a moral obligation to secure for them the 12-mile limit and to ask these other countries to phase out their traditional rights.  In my book, these traditional rights are nonsense.</P>
    <P>During my preparations for this debate, I came across some EEC documents. The EEC Council decision taken on 25 July 1978 authorised Community expenditure for Denmark and Ireland between January 1977 and 31 December 1982 for short and medium term measures connected with introducing sophisticated facilities appropriate to inspection and surveillance of fishing activities.  I was trying to find the results of that decision. There is another document before the EEC at present which states:</P>
    <P>The implementation of the medium term measures in Ireland have been delayed because of the complexity of designing new facilities, which must be particularly sophisticated to ensure total effectiveness in the inspection and surveillance of very large fishing areas.</P>
    <P>Since the programme drawn up by Ireland and approved by the Commission decision of 15 May 1979 cannot be fully implemented by 1 January 1983, the Commission considers that it would be in the Community's interests to extend this date so that the planned work can be completed and Community participation in the expenditure involved can be ensured.</P>
    <P>To facilitate the implementation the Commission feel there should be provision for the Community to make advance payments to Ireland as and when investment is made to fulfil the programme approved by the Commission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1951" /> The Commission, therefore, invites the Council to adopt the attached draft decision amending Council decision 78/640/EEC of 25 July 1978 on financial participation by the Community in inspecting and surveillance operations in the maritime waters of Denmark and Ireland.</P>
    <P>These finances were given to us to carry out certain developments.  The Danes spent the necessary funds but I should like to inquire why we did not utilise them.  According to the submission which is before the EEC at present we have not complied with the draft resolution. Surely any moneys given to us by the EEC should be spent.  The decision was taken as far back as 25 July 1978.  It is now 1982.</P>
    <P>The fishing fleet are experiencing very serious financial difficulties at present. Some measures were taken to assist trawler men with repayments by reducing interest rates and carrying over interest in principal without any increase in interest. I give the Department credit for that. It is more than some of the other financial institutions attached to the State are doing.  It is not sufficient, however.  If we are to extend our fishing fleet and consolidate our position, particularly with these new agreements, we will require a four-year programme.  Interest rates and the high cost of diesel, which is the main source of energy used in the fishing industry, will have to be subsidised.  There should be an interest subsidy of 10 per cent for a minimum of two years to allow fishermen get over the serious financial difficulty in which they find themselves.</P>
    <P>It could be said that this is an extreme action but fishing is one of the growth areas of the economy.  It was necessary to bring in such a scheme in agriculture because interest rates were far too high and so was the inflation rate.  It is essential to have such a scheme.  The Minister should give some consideration to this suggestion.  I have information to the effect that the French have now introduced new subsidies.  They have continually subsidised the fishing fleet.  We have not done so.  Our fishing fleet must compete with the French on the open market. <Col N="1952" /> We have a problem as far as marketing is concerned.  At certain times there is a flood of fish on the market and the price drops.  At other times there is a scarcity and the price rises.  In the plentiful time fish should be put into cold storage.  We should have sufficient cold storage facilities.</P>
    <P>We should have a better distribution of fish and every town should have a proper fish market.  I appeal to the Minister to consider this.  The Minister has consistently brought to our notice the fact that we drew up these Estimates but he should remember that Fianna Fáil introduced another budget in March.  It is up to the Minister to bring in a Supplementary Estimate if he so wishes.  There is nothing to stop him doing so.  These excuses are worn out now.  Fishing should be looked at as a growth area in the economy.</P>
    <P>The 12-mile exclusive limit is so vital to the fishing industry that the Minister and the Government must be prepared to use the maximum muscle in the EEC to ensure that it is obtained.  Ireland has few enough resources and must be permitted and encouraged by the EEC to fully develop them on land and sea.  Our fisheries must be retained for the exclusive use of our industry within a 12-mile limit and any Government which does not protect this vital interest must look upon themselves as being neglectful in that area.  Due to the importance of the 12-mile exclusive limit the Minister must oppose any EEC fishery agreement with third countries until such time as our demands are met.  If he is too weak about this situation I hope the last two debates we had in the House will strengthen his arguing points in the EEC.</P>
    <P>As regards forestry, this is a growth area of the economy also.  It has a limited potential for development.  We have thousands of acres of land which are unsuitable for agricultural purposes but suited for afforestation.  This land must be described as a wasted asset because it is not being planted.  An attempt to use it must be made by the Department.  The Minister has reservations about the amount of money for land purchase.  I accept that, but he will have great difficulty <Col N="1953" /> in securing the type of land the Department were interested in over the years, that is, marginal agricultural land. This land, even in the west, will now be reclaimed and put into agricultural production. The Department will face great difficulty in the years ahead.  Nevertheless, particularly in the west thousands of acres of more or less stony land will be unsuitable for reclamation for agricultural purposes and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry should purchase that land.  From knowledge I have of the area it seems that forestry have only a very small amount of development there. They should turn their attention to that area where they can get suitable land for planting.  They will not get it in Wexford or in most of Munster and Leinster except in the areas of high hills and even there any areas that are suitable for sheep production will be reclaimed for that purpose and not for afforestation.</P>
    <P>The Department have almost a complete monopoly on all raw material as far as timber is concerned.  The manner of manipulating that monopoly is important. We import approximately £45 million worth of timber of different sorts per annum.  This represents a very substantial sum of money, and the objective of the Department should be to supply as much as possible of the type of material that we import.  The sawmill trade claim that they can take up quite an amount of these orders, particularly in the building trade, if they are given the right price by the Department.  I understand that a dispute is in progress at the moment with the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>He is having discussions with them.  I had a phone call from a constituent of mine this morning who is in that business.  He said that the Minister made an offer yesterday.  He did not tell me what the offer was.  I must point out to the Minister that an offer was made by his senior officials to the sawmills which they claimed was completely inadequate. I asked him what the offer was but he did not tell me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has a serious duty to supply as much of this timber as possible to the sawmillers.  Like the fishermen and the farmers, they have started from a very bad base.  They have not the type of investment they are entitled to and they claim to have financial problems and the people in the investing and production lines have financial problems also.  If the Minister can relieve this, even on a temporary basis, I appeal to him to do so.  They claim that he can.  They would not give me any information about what the demands were although I asked them.  They said discussions were going on at the moment and that to tell me would be a breach of confidentiality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the dispute about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked them how long the problem was going on between themselves and the Department and the answer was six or seven months.  I know that the Minister has not been in office for seven months &mdash; he has been there only four months &mdash; but he cannot claim that in the four months he has been there he could not do anything in this regard. <Col N="1955" /> He should make some concessions, even on a temporary basis, to relieve the situation. These people have cash flow problems and he should relieve those problems if he can do so.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister for a direct answer on the following.  The sawmillers claim that he has made special arrangements with a firm known as Medford Limited who it seems have come into the country and erected a factory in Clonmel. For many years the Irish sawmillers have been regular buyers of timber from the State and have asked that the price of timber would relate to market conditions. I know this could be very difficult. This was refused.  But the Medford company, an American company of fibreboard manufacturers, were negotiating for and have established the plant in Clonmel and they were immediately given a deal by the Department, I have been told.  Such a deal has been denied the Irish sawmillers.  If this is not true I ask the Minister to deny it here in this House, because this is the place for him to do so.  I asked what the deal was and my informants said they did not know.  I am asking the Minister to state whether he has done a deal with an American company who are setting up an industry in Clonmel and whether he has given them special conditions that he is not prepared to give to the sawmillers of this nation.  We as a nation are inclined to look at the faraway cows, forgetting that we have good, basic industries in our own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Any such decision, if it has been made, is not in the national interest.  It is not fair to Irish citizens trying to stay in business in difficult times <Col N="1956" /> to deny them what we are willing to give to foreigners.  I challenge the Minister's right to discriminate against the citizens of this country.  If he and his Government, who claim to be concerned with the creation and maintaining of employment in the country, are not prepared to state unequivocally that they will give the Irish sawmillers the same terms as were given to this firm in Clonmel, their commitment to Irish industry is very hollow. My time is very limited and I had intended raising other points.  How many minutes have I left?</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister when planting is taking place to consider the planting of extra ash.  Coming from a hurling county, like the Minister, I feel that the traditional game should not fall short of its material, which is a very lucrative area for the Department.  I understand that the cost of ash at the moment is £200 per ton.  I appeal to the Department to make sure that this is not neglected.</P>
      <P>A couple of weeks ago the supply of poles to the ESB and P and T was discussed in the Dáil.  Why are these poles supplied from foreign markets?  I know that the poles must be of Douglas Fir or larch.  Would spruce be of adequate quality for this very lucrative market?  I understand that some of these poles cost £150 each.  If cash is going out of the country it is essential that the Minister see if we can supply the raw materials ourselves.</P>
      <P>I had intended dealing with some other points and I hope we will have a chance to discuss them in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>It was I who <Col N="1957" /> asked that some kind of arrangement be made so that the three Estimates could be taken and I will be very brief on this Estimate.  I do not totally agree that there should be half an hour for an Estimate, but this one is very important.  An agreement was reached between the Whips for half an hour on this Estimate and 20 minutes each on the rest.</P>
      <P>I am not an expert on fisheries.  I will direct most of my remarks to the Forestry Estimate.  This is the first opportunity I have had to address the Minister in this House since his appointment.  I wish him well and particularly in his negotiations on fisheries in the European Community. He carries a big load.  I am beginning to wonder whether the benefits accruing from being a member of that Community are more than negatived by their impositions in many fields.  It is essential that a large portion of our fisheries should be preserved for our own fishermen.  There is general agreement on that.</P>
      <P>In 1977 the Fianna Fáil Minister went around shouting about a 50-mile limit. That did not do any good.  We should be practical.  Everyone was shouting about 50 miles.  A great deal of harm was done by the hassle between different parties about whether we should have a 12-mile limit or a 50-mile limit.  I wish the Minister well in his negotiations.  I know he will try to get the best deal for our people. It is essential that we should have an exclusive area for our people and that it be as large as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will confine the remainder of my remarks to the Forestry Estimate.  Since the foundation of this State the Irish people have invested millions and millions of pounds in forestry.  Large areas were planted which have since come to maturity.  We owe a debt of gratitude to the people who started this programme in the early days of the State.  To our eternal discredit we did not deal properly with this mature timber and we did not make a success of processing it.  I said that in an Estimates debate when my party shared government between 1973 and 1977.  I said to the then Minister with responsibility for Forestry that we had a duty to become involved in the timber processing industry.  Down through the <Col N="1958" /> years when timber in our forests became mature, by and large it was handed over to private enterprise and they were enabled to reap the benefit of the millions the Irish people had invested in a growth period which was uneconomic.</P>
    <P>With the help of large amounts of grants from the State, private enterprise set themselves up in the processing industry. When the crunch came they got into difficulty for one reason or another, in some cases because of bad management. I am not referring to the State industry because I do not know enough about it to say it was badly managed.  In one timber-orientated industry in Athy, 150 people were employed.  A multinational firm were involved and they sold off the factory to an individual whose management ability was in some doubt.  Over £1 million of our money was invested in that company.  When they were winding up their operations a special estimate was introduced by the former Minister to subsidise that factory and try to keep it going. It is alleged that the managing director went off with most of that money in his pocket.  The Department or the IDA or Fóir Teoranta did not put somebody on the board or take shares or do anything to protect that money.  That must be realised in the Department.</P>
    <P>The 150 people in that factory had built up experience and expertise over 20 or 30 years.  This was not a mushroom growth. The factory was supplied from forests throughout Wicklow and Laois.  The thinings were their raw material.  They were charged a fairly high price for that raw material and, when that factory and others closed down, it was exported for £1 a ton to the eternal disgrace of the Minister's Department.  Having closed two factories, one in my own town, we opened one in Clonmel.  I want to castigate the IDA who own 64 per cent of the shares for placing it in an area where people had no expertise or experience of this industry. A new factory was built in Clonmel, although in my town we had 150 people with years of experience of the timber industry.  That was a disgraceful act whether it was done by the Department or the IDA.  With that expertise, a viable industry could have been rebuilt.  At present <Col N="1959" /> the timber sold in every hardware shop is imported timber.  Yet we are told our industry is not viable.  That is not the case.</P>
    <P>It was wrong to site that factory in Clonmel where there was no forestry experience.  I do not blame the people of Clonmel for getting the factory placed there.  Anybody with any business sense knows that the industry should have been built up where it had operated successfully for over 20 years.  Because of a short period of bad management, coupled with high prices for thinnings, which later the Department exported for £1 a ton, the factory closed down.  The men had the expertise, and the industry and a sawmill were properly administered.  That was not found to be the most suitable place to re-invest.  More could have been offered to the people who were prepared to invest in a limited way.  Surely the major shareholder &mdash; in this case the people &mdash; should have some say in the matter.  The Minister made a very serious mistake here.  People skilled in this industry are now unable to find employment in an area they know something about.</P>
    <P>I believe we have a valuable product in timber and I congratulate various Governments for developing our forests as a tourist and recreational amenity. Our timber can be regarded as a valuable commercial product only if we are prepared to complete the process and sell it to the public thus reducing our imports. If our timber was properly treated, it would be equal to if not better than any imported product.  The Department do not seem to be making any effort in this direction although millions of pounds were invested in this area.  We should be able to compete with imported materials.</P>
    <P>I discussed this matter with a number of foresters and one man told me that public service employees in the processing industry were not prepared to work hard enough.  I do not agree with that.  If it were true it would show that there is a lack of supervisory ability in those employed in the public service.  Our people can work as hard as any other nationality.  There is no body better <Col N="1960" /> equipped to produce the finished article than the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  They have the raw material.  If they throw up their hands and say they cannot compete with other countries, and that it is cheaper to import timber, that is disgraceful.</P>
    <P>Over the years we have invested millions of pounds in our forests and they are now coming to maturity.  We are still taking over land and planting trees every year, but unless we can process that timber properly, and can compete with imported products, that investment will be lost.  Most of the timber we see being used has been imported.  That is another doubtful advantage of being a member of the EEC, but I will not go into that debate now.  Have I run out of time?</P>

I know the Minister cannot correct the terrible mistake that was made when the timber factory was started in an area where there was not a timber tradition, by-passing an area where a mill had operated successfully for 20 years and unsuccessfully for four years under new management.  Then the Department and Fóir Teoranta supplied millions of pounds to keep it going but the situation worsened.</P>

    <P>I am glad to see the State has a 64 per cent interest in the Clonmel business. <Col N="1961" /> This means we will be in control.

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bermingham for shortening his contribution to allow the rest of us speak.  If the fishery and forestry industry is tackled in the correct way it can be used to tackle our unemployment problems.  Unfortunately this country's natural resources have been plundered for years.  Our natural gas at Kinsale belongs to the Rockfeller Marathon Company, our ore from the biggest lead zinc mine in western Europe is being shipped out from Navan as fast as it can be got out of the country, and our oil rights are already handed over to the multinational corporations before even one drop has been brought ashore. Our excellent agricultural land is under-utilised and our food is unprocessed. Clearly there has been a lack of foresight in the development of our natural resources.  I disagree with the Fine Gael Deputy who said we had few resources. In fact, we have vast resources.  The resources of the sea and forestry are renewable and for that reason they deserve special attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment we are facing the possible &mdash; and I emphasise possible &mdash; sell-out of our fishing stocks.  This would be a betrayal because fish are a valuable renewable resource with the potential for a major processing industry.  If the stocks are wiped out they cannot be replaced, as some of the other EEC countries have learned to their cost.  Under the proposed EEC agreement the Government must now allow other states to fish up to six miles of the Irish shoreline.  In effect this would allow fleets that in many cases have fished their own waters empty to come and clear out the Irish stocks.  There <Col N="1962" /> would be little point in asking them to preserve Irish stocks.  It is no use talking to our fishermen about conservation when they see the German, French, Spanish and Dutch trawler owners grabbing all the catches they can, literally while stocks last.  If we are serious about job creation we must shout stop at this point.  We must not allow any further diminution of our fishing limits.</P>
    <P>Fishing is a hard, dirty and dangerous job.  The deckhands who work on Irish trawlers are paid on the share system which means they have no holiday pay, no sick pay, no pensions and no job security. The rule is that if they do not catch fish they do not get wages &mdash; it is as brutal as that.  Every year unfortunately some of them pay with their lives for the risks they take and the lack of proper safety enforcement.</P>
    <P>A major scandal in the fish industry is the difference in price paid to the fishermen and the cost to consumers in the shops.  Quite recently trawlermen were getting £6 per box &mdash; which works out at less than 5p a lb &mdash; while consumers were paying more than £1 per lb for the same fish.  The dumping of good fish back into the sea is the other major outrage of the so-called free market.  There is total chaos in the present system.  Hundreds of tons of fish are dumped every year to keep up the intervention price.  This is a criminal waste of valuable protein in a hungry world, in the interests of short-term private profit.  It does not even make economic sense.  That fish should be processed, not dumped.  A planned and developed processing industry is vital.  Far too much of our national catch is shipped out raw to be processed abroad, creating added value and good jobs which we need badly at home.  The total catch is pitifully small considering the export potential.</P>
    <P>Giant trawlers from Japan and eastern Europe travel thousands of miles for the fish shoals.  We have some of the richest waters in the world around our coastline that are barely tapped by our own fleet. This country must not give away any more of that resource in the present EEC negotiations.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the Howth harbour development work.  It is not surprising <Col N="1963" /> that the cost of the harbour development has overshot its budget.  What is alarming is that the extra funds appear to have been diverted towards the marina and yacht club complex.  This means that the essential services needed to preserve fishermen's jobs in the port have been neglected.  Not alone has essential work on the fishing section of the harbour been postponed, such as the new icing plant, but the representations by fishermen's organisations for more space and improved facilities have been ignored.</P>
    <P>For instance, it is a disgrace that the fishermen's request for a larger auction hall has been rejected by the Office of Public Works in favour of larger carparks for day trippers, especially as there are regular buses and trains available from Dublin for people wishing to visit the harbour.  I hope that in his reply to the debate the Minister will indicate that the views of the local fishermen will receive a proper hearing.  It is also important that he gives an assurance that the necessary funds will be made available to complete the fishing section of the harbour &mdash; even if it means leaving the yacht club stranded for a few months.  After all, men's jobs must surely take precedence over other men's leisure pursuits.</P>
    <P>On the forestry front, I think a word of praise is in order for the excellent work done by the Department in developing our timber reserves.  We still have one of the lowest rates of afforestation in Europe, despite our ideal climate for timber growing, but this is because of the lack of commitment by successive Governments to develop yet another of our most valuable renewable resources.</P>
    <P>I realise that time is tight and I want to allow other speakers to speak.  Many of the points I intended to make have been made already.  I should like to close on this note.  An Estimate was passed this morning allowing for the purchase of the assets of the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  I hope this purchase by the State is an indication that it intends to treat the timber industry and the processing industry as an integrated industry, not simply to have the Clondalkin Paper Mills arrangement as a once-off effort to save jobs in <Col N="1964" /> that area.  I hope it is part of an integrated plan for the development of the timber industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Donegal South-West) Mr. Gallagher (Donegal South-West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> I wish to thank Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Bermingham for cutting short their contributions to allow me a few minutes to speak.  I am very disappointed at the way Deputy D'Arcy acted in this House.  He made all sorts of suggestions. He spoke about The Hague Agreement but considered it in isolation without considering the London Agreement in the early sixties and the Treaty of Accession. The Deputy could have been much more constructive.  He could have stayed here and listened to other Deputies who also have something to contribute to the debate.</P>
      <P>Deputy D'Arcy spoke about marketing. I was surprised to hear him say that the problem could be alleviated if we set up markets in every town and village.  I come from a constituency where the people depend on the fishing industry.  I agree it would be very satisfactory if the Irish people would buy more fish but it would not alleviate the problem.  We have to look abroad for markets.  I ask the Minister to consider going on a promotional trip to help the fishermen and the processors to sell mackerel.  Perhaps he might consider embarking on such a tour, just as the Minister for Industry and Energy and the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism have done.  I think the fishermen and the processors would appreciate such a gesture from the Minister.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on what he has done in the past few weeks.  In his negotiations in Brussels he got an increase from 56,000 tonnes to 80,000 tonnes in regard to mackerel and I was glad to hear him say today that he is going to seek a further increase.  This is the kind of Minister the fishermen want to fight on their behalf.  The Minister has been quite realistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy made all kinds of suggestions including a 12-mile limit and so on.  When their Minister went to Brussels he was prepared to accept a six-mile limit. However, Fine Gael are now trying to <Col N="1965" /> make life more difficult for the Minister and no matter what deal he gets it will not satisfy them.  We saw what they did when they were in Government.</P>
    <P>I took offence when Deputy D'Arcy spoke about the poor fishing fleet.  I hope he was not referring to our fishing fleet. If he was, the fishermen will give him their answer.  We have no poor fishing fleet.  The industry is only in its infancy so that suggestion about our fleet is very disrespectful.</P>
    <P>I have not had the opportunity before to speak here about salmon.  There has been a decrease in this area of fisheries in the past two years, but I am confident that there will be an upturn this year. However, that should not lead us to be complacent but rather to adhere fairly rigidly to conservation measures.  On the question of conservation I should like to pay tribute to the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and to the regional fishery boards for the part they play in this area.  Much credit is due, too, to the angling associations who have contributed to the restocking of our rivers to ensure the sustaining of salmon fishing. These associations go to the expense of buying the ova and putting them into the hatchery so as to ensure a supply of salmon for the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that part of the moneys accruing from the salmon levy should go towards the development of our inland fisheries.  However, now that that levy has been abolished I have no doubt that the fishermen will respond if called on to do so and will contribute towards the development of our inland fisheries, that they will help to buy the ova to be put into the hatcheries or, better still, to be put directly into the rivers where the survival rate is greater than in the hatcheries.  I should like to have the opportunity of speaking for much longer on the question of salmon.  It is a subject on which I have very strong views in terms of what we should do in the future and of the legislation which perhaps should be brought before the House in this regard.  However, I can only express the hope than on another occasion I will have the opportunity of going into this matter in more detail.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1966" /> I should like to refer, too, to the Sea Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1981, and to say how important this legislation has been in ensuring that more moneys were available to BIM to enable them to buy new grant-aided boats.  In this connection, too, I should like to mention especially the smaller fishing boats, those of 30-40 feet on which many people along the western coast depend for a living. Indeed, this fleet is the backbone of the fishing industry in the constituency I represent. Statistics indicate a bright future for the larger boats but not all that many people are employed on those boats.  The people who operate the smaller vessels have to go out at night in hazardous conditions in their efforts to make a living. There is an urgent need for loans and grants in respect of these small half-deckers. It has been a disappointment that in the last number of years the EEC have not paid anything by way of FEOGA grants in respect of these smaller boats but I appeal to the Minister to have this point emphasised at Council of Ministers meetings.</P>
    <P>Regarding the west, I would remind the House that if it were not for the fact that we in that part of the country are so disadvantaged, Ireland as a whole would not be classified a disadvantaged area. The result of this is that the rest of the country &mdash; Dublin, Waterford, Cork and so on &mdash; can reap the benefits that are available because of our plight.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would refer briefly to the factory ships.  I am very pleased that, although we must accept these, we must also forge ahead with greater freezing capacity along our coasts.  We can only hope that in the not too distant future we will have sufficient freezing capacity so that it will not be necessary to have these freezer boats along our coasts.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the decline in the landings of lobster and crayfish and I would ask the Minister to have his Department investigate the reasons for this situation.  If conservation measures in this respect are considered necessary, I am sure that our fishermen will respond to any move in that direction.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary for me to go into the question of the common fisheries policy <Col N="1967" /> since this is ground that has been covered by all those who have spoken. However, we must be realistic and have confidence in our Minister going to Europe and endeavouring to get what is best for us.  It is unfair and pointless for anyone to try to force the Minister to speak of something that is unrealistic. The people who voted with us on the evening of the motion in question obviously have confidence in the Minister also.  We have not given our Minister <i>carte blanche</i> to go to Europe and do what he wishes, which is what happened when the Coalition Minister went out there.</P>

      <P>It would be impossible in the time remaining for me to reply in detail to any of the various important and at times complex issues raised by a number of Deputies.  All I can do is to assure those Deputies who have contributed that when the debate has concluded I will contact them immediately and will endeavour to give them the information they sought.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy De Rossa's query about the development of Howth Harbour, I assure him that the development to which he refers is part of an overall plan for the development of that harbour. When we have concluded this debate I shall let the Deputy have sight of the engineering plans for the project.  We are involved only in the fisheries aspect of it, but I am sure that when he sees the overall plan he will be satisfied that the various interests are being protected adequately.  I have been out there to see for myself what is the position in regard to the various issues involved.  I am available to meet representatives of the fishermen there in relation to the overall development and any reservations they may have about the shaping of proposals. But they would need to look at the overall plan.  I think if the Deputy saw the overall plan he would be quite satisfied that it was one in the interests of all the people of that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is impossible to cover the whole area of fisheries by way of reply to queries raised here.  However, there is one point to which I should like to refer for a moment, that is the issue of the saw millers and the alleged dispute mentioned by Deputy D'Arcy at the beginning of the debate.  I should say there is no dispute <Col N="1969" /> between the saw millers and myself.  I have had a very useful and constructive meeting with them as a result of which we established a meeting with the millers and officials of my Department.  These discussions are continuing.  I do not think Deputy D'Arcy could expect me to take too seriously remarks which some constituent of his made yesterday, a constituent who was not prepared to tell him the exact nature of the alleged dispute or give the Deputy the type of figures which would have enabled him even to make a case.</P>

I shall give an undertaking to any Deputy with a particular interest in this, to the Deputies who spoke here, to meet me immediately after this discussion when I shall let them have the benefit of the full information at my disposal and which may help to alleviate any misapprehensions people might have about some of the activities of my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett, Clare) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett, Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Clare</i>): The net amount originally allocated for the Vote for Public Works and Buildings for 1982, as shown in the Book of Estimates, was £90,291,000.  The Government have since made available additional sums totalling £425,000, made up of £125,000 for archaeological surveys and reports as announced by the Minister for Finance in his budget statement on 25 March last and £300,000 more for arterial drainage construction schemes.  I will be introducing a Supplementary Estimate later in the year to cover these additional allocations as well as the cost of pay increases not <Col N="1971" /> provided for in the original Estimate but for which provision was also made in the budget.</P>
      <P>Apart from the works covered by this Estimate the Office of Public Works are also responsible for carrying out various works programmes for other Departments on a repayment basis, the allocations for which in the current year total £77 million approximately.</P>
      <P>Such extensive programmes of works could not be undertaken without the necessary staff and support facilities.  The cost of these is met from subheads A1 to C of the Vote for which I am seeking a total of £12,018,000.  This represents less than 7 per cent of the estimated gross expenditure outturn for the office which will be in excess of £180 million.  It is a fair indication of the amount of work which my staff gets through in a year, particularly when one considers the long lead-in time and the detailed planning which has to be undertaken before a project commences.</P>
      <P>Subhead D of the Vote, for which I am seeking a sum of £3.6 million, covers the purchase of sites and buildings, a necessary preliminary to the various works programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times, thanks to the help and co-operation of various local authorities and the general public, the Office of Public Works have purchased sites in some of our larger provincial towns and cities with a view to decentralising some Government services.  While it is easy to draw attention to such high-profiled and well-publicised purchases of property, the office are also involved on an ongoing basis in more mundane land purchases such as sites for Garda stations, social welfare offices, customs offices, tax offices and many other Government services which are administered at a local level.  These purchases may be overlooked in the light of the larger schemes but they are highly important to the social and economic fabric of our everyday life. The office are also continuing with the on-going programme for the purchase of new sites and premises in order to replace the many dilapidated and run-down premises which at present house some <Col N="1972" /> Government services and with which, I am sure, my colleagues here and the general public are only too familiar.</P>
    <P>The purchase of land for national park purposes and for the National Monuments and Waterways Services is also met from subhead D. Insofar as new acquisitions for park purposes are concerned, the concentration in recent years has been principally on the development of Connemara National Park and the establishment of the new Burren National Park in County Clare.  The bringing into State care of important monuments and sites of exceptional archaeological interest is part of the programme of protection of our national heritage.  Purchase of sites for the waterways service relate to the provision of improved facilities for people using the Shannon navigation.</P>
    <P>An amount of £29.5 million is required under subhead E for the carrying out of new works, alterations and additions, including furnishing and fitting out of new buildings for Government Departments and other State purposes.  The benefits of such a works programme as this are felt not alone by the public servants who will gain better working conditions but also by members of the public who will have occasion to visit the various buildings and properties concerned.  Expenditure of this amount will also ensure the maintenance of many jobs not alone directly within the construction industry but also in the affiliated and downstream industries throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I have circulated amongst Deputies copies of my office's new works programme which lists the projects covered under this subhead and which gives a good idea of the varied works in hand or proposed.  I will just comment briefly on some of the major items included.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to state that in 1982 we will see the completion of such major projects in Dublin as 14-16 Upper Merrion Street where refurbishment works have been carried out and the building is being occupied by Department of Finance staff; the complex at 93-99 Lower Leeson Street which is now being fitted out for occupation and will be the new headquarters of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry; a new building <Col N="1973" /> for the State Laboratory at Abbotstown, County Dublin; and an office development at Beggar's Bush to house the Geological Survey Office and the Labour Court.  As you are all aware, the National Concert Hall has been completed and has been operating successfully since September last.  Also completed is a large refurbishment project on the North Block of Government Buildings and construction of the second stage of the new Garda Headquarters at the Phoenix Park.</P>
    <P>Work has commenced on the adaptation of premises at 2-3 Kildare Street to provide additional accommodation for the National Library.  Restoration of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, is progressing well and is due for completion in 1983.</P>
    <P>On the provincial side the construction of government offices in Athlone and Waterford is now complete.  An extension has been provided to existing offices in Kilkenny.  Work is proceeding on the erection of Government offices at Cork, Carrick-on-Shannon, Navan, Shannon and Thurles and planning is at an advanced stage for the erection of new Government offices at Kilkenny, Portlaoise and Letterkenny, the extension of the Government offices in Castlebar and temporary Government offices in Wexford. Other developments being planned include Government offices at Arklow, Cavan, Dundalk, Sligo, Tralee, Tullamore and Wexford.</P>
    <P>A total sum of £2,629,000 is required in respect of works which will be undertaken for the Department of Justice, mainly for the Garda.  This includes provision for the erection of new Garda stations and residences, for the improvement of existing Garda accommodation and for other works at the Garda Depot and Templemore Training Centre.  The progress made last year in the replacement of substandard accommodation will be maintained in the current year.  Major works were completed last year at 12 centres, including Boyle, Killaloe, Kanturk and Navan.  In progress are contracts for the erection of new stations and, in many cases, residences, at 16 centres. These centres include Athy, Carrick-on-Shannon, <Col N="1974" /> Tralee and Terenure, Dublin. Planning for buildings at 31 centres, including divisional headquarters at Monaghan and district headquarters at Wicklow, Arklow, Blackrock (Cork), Belmullet, Caherciveen and Westport is at an advanced stage while preliminary planning is in progress in respect of 28 other centres.  Planning for the provision of a Garda officers' training college at Templemore Training Centre is also well advanced.  A computer suite has been completed at the Garda Depot and work is progressing on a second suite.</P>
    <P>Planning is also in progress for new and additional accommodation for court staff in Dublin and for welfare office accommodation in Limerick.  Other Departments for which major building programmes are in hands or planned include the Departments of Agriculture, Posts and Telegraphs and Foreign Affairs. Included in this subhead also is a provision for the decentralisation programme which the Government have decided to reactivate.  Tenders have been invited for the provision and/or financing of five of the more advanced projects namely, Athlone, Ballina, Galway, Killarney and Sligo and the others will follow as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>A total of £776,000 is also included under subhead E for works at our national park and monuments.  Work on a new visitor centre at Glendalough is expected to begin before the end of the year.  This new building will make a significant contribution to the amenities of Glendalough and should be greatly appreciated by the many visitors to the monastic site.</P>
    <P>A provision of £164,000 is being made also under this subhead for yet more investment in the development of the Shannon Navigation.  The Office of Public Works, in co-operation with Bord Fáilte and the local authorities, have played a major role in developing the great potential of the waterway for recreational use.</P>
    <P>In regard to subhead F.1-F.4, not alone do the Office of Public Works construct new buildings but they also have responsibility in the areas of maintenance, furnishing, leasing, heating, lighting, and so <Col N="1975" /> on, of Government offices, Garda stations, post office buildings, employment exchanges, social welfare offices, agricultural institutions, Irish embassies abroad and other State-owned buildings.  The cost of this, with the cost of maintenance of certain State-owned harbours, the River Shannon Navigation and the various national parks is met from subhead F.1, F.2, F.3 and F.4 for which I am seeking a toal amount of £39,457,000.</P>
    <P>While expenditure under the maintenance subhead, F.1, is kept to the minimum consistent with the obligations of the Office of Public Works, false economy must be avoided.  Unless property is properly maintained it becomes dilapidated and the progressive deterioration resulting from neglect can prove very costly to remedy.  Property which is neglected can also be a source of danger to those who occupy and use it and even to passers-by.  The Office of Public Works have an obligation to see that this does not happen with the property under their charge.  Where buildings are rented, commitments under tenancy agreements, which can include financial contributions in the form of service charges towards the cost of maintenance carried out by landlords, must be honoured.</P>
    <P>The cost of furniture and furnishings required in State premises throughout the country and in Irish embassies abroad is met from subhead F.2.  In order to discharge their responsibilities in this regard, the Office of Public Works have a furniture division which operates a large furniture store, a modern furniture production unit and repair and restoration workshops.  This division supplies modern standard office furniture to the various public service offices, post offices, Garda stations and so on, and provides office and domestic furniture to prisons.  It also furnishes prestige buildings such as Leinster House, Aras an Uachtaráin and Dublin Castle, as well as Irish Embassy Chanceries and residences, with an appropriate combination of modern furniture and furnishings and restored or reproduction furniture.</P>
    <P>While I am proud of the skill of its craftsmen and of the very high quality of <Col N="1976" /> the furniture produced both in the modern production unit and in the restoration workshop, I am mindful of the need to support the Irish furniture industry and to develop and improve the range of high quality native products available.  It is settled policy to make the maximum possible input of Irish made furniture, furnishing and fittings into all premises serviced by the furniture division.  I am assured that the display of high quality Irish materials in important buildings here at home and in our embassies abroad in pursuance of this policy has helped to generate business for a number of Irish firms, including significant export orders in a number of cases.  I need hardly add that I am anxious to encourage this very desirable development whenever possible.</P>
    <P>In regard to subhead F.3, until such time as my office is in a position to build all the public service accommodation requirements it will be necessary to lease space from developers to meet these.  The cost of this is met from subhead F.3 for which I am seeking £14 million.  The State, through the Commissioners of Public Works, takes tenancies of much of the privately developed office space in the country and in this way encourages further development which provides useful employment for many people.</P>
    <P>An amount of £6.8 million is required under subhead F.4 to heat and light the accommodation occupied for State purposes. In so far as is possible the Office of Public Works use native fuels for this purpose and every effort is made when planning buildings to ensure the maximum usage of these.  Indeed, I believe approximately 80 per cent of the expenditure is in respect of native fuels such as electricity, turf and so on.</P>
    <P>Under subhead F.5 I am seeking an amount of £590,000 for the reconstruction of Waterford courthouse which it is hoped to complete this year.  The Office of Public Works are undertaking this work on behalf of Waterford Corporation, who are repaying the cost.</P>
    <P>An amount of £300,000 is required under subhead F.6 to cover expenditure on works to the King's Inns, Dublin, which it is hoped to commence this year. <Col N="1977" /> The building is of major architectural importance and is scheduled for preservation under the Dublin City Development Plan.  It is, however, in a poor state of repair and as the Office of Public Works are carrying out major repairs to the Registry of Deeds, which is part of the same structure, it was decided that they should also carry out essential works to the King's Inns building.  The major part of the expenditure will be met from the Funds of Suitors, subject to the necessary legislation being passed by the Oireachtas, and provision for receipt of £300,000 from the fund has been included under subhead K of the Vote &mdash; Appropriations-in-Aid, Item 10.</P>
    <P>In regard to subheads G.1-G.3, in an economy such as ours where agriculture plays such a vital part it is essential that all available land be brought to its full potential.  Hence the importance of the arterial drainage programme of the Commissioners of Public Works may be readily appreciated.  An amount of £13,406,000 is included in the published Estimates for continuance of the comprehensive programme of survey, design and construction works and maintenance being carried out by the commissioners.</P>
    <P>Subhead G.1 provides for the carrying out of hydrometric studies and of comprehensive drainage surveys as a necessary preliminary to the schemes.  Construction works costs are met from subhead G.2.  This year works will continue on the Boyne, the Maigue and the Corrib-Mask-Robe.  As I mentioned earlier, additional money has since been allocated for drainage works and has enabled a start to be made on the Boyle and Bonet schemes this month.</P>
    <P>As well as the primary benefits to agriculture there are many secondary benefits to be derived from arterial drainage, not the least of which is its employment content.  Indeed drainage is labour-intensive; at present almost 1,000 men are employed of the three schemes in progress and at peak the Boyle and Bonet schemes will employ some 300 more.</P>
    <P>The value of arterial drainage is well appreciated and is not lost sight of in the EEC who provides substantial grants annually towards the cost of works.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1978" /> There would not be much sense in completing a drainage scheme if, when completed, the river and its catchment were allowed to revert to their former condition and accordingly the commissioners also maintain completed schemes.  The cost of maintenance is met from subhead G.3 and is recoverable from the county councils concerned.</P>
    <P>With all these works in progress, it is understandable that a large amount of machinery is required.  The cost of purchasing and maintaining this machinery is met from subhead H and the amount sought for this in the current year is £2.756 million.  The Office of Public Works has built up a central engineering workshop whose staff has the expertise to advise on the most suitable type of machinery to purchase and to maintain this equipment and repair it when breakdowns occur.  The variety of machinery and plant used in the different schemes necessitates purchases of a wide range of spare parts, and this is a major feature of the purchasing and material control division of the workshops.  The machinery is used not alone in drainage schemes but also at other works at State harbours, on the Shannon navigation and on coast protection schemes.</P>
    <P>An amount of £134,000 is required under subhead I to cover the cost of outstanding charges in connection with the coast protection scheme at Enniscrone. Included also is an amount to cover maintenance of completed schemes at Rosslare and Youghal, the cost of which is recoverable from the county councils involved.</P>
    <P>Subhead J.I is the subhead under which provision is made for the general conservation and presentation of national monuments in State care, for archaeological excavations and for some expenses of the Archaeological Survey.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to announce that works at the Casino, Marino, are now almost complete and that later this year an announcement will be made as to when this very fine building will be opened to the public.  The Casino had of course nothing to do with gambling or the like. The title is derived from &ldquo;casina&rdquo; which is Italian for &ldquo;little palace&rdquo;, and a little <Col N="1979" /> palace it is indeed.  The building was erected by the first Earl of Charlemont to serve as a sort of summerhouse in the grounds of his out-of-town residence at Marino House, the area now called Marino being at the time in the countryside. It was designed by William Chambers and is regarded as possibly the greatest gem of 18th century architecture in these islands.  When opened to the public, the Casino will be an outstanding addition to the tourist amenities of the city, and I feel sure that it will come to be regarded with pride by the citizens of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Grants for research archaeological excavations are to be made again this year on the recommendation of the Royal Irish Academy.  This will enable the investigation of the major site at Knowth, (County Meath) to continue as well as the investigations at Carrowmore megalithic cemetery, County Sligo.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the Archaeological Survey which is being carried out under the aegis of the Office of Public Works.  The purpose of the survey is to record all the ancient and historic monuments in the country, and its importance cannot be over-emphasised in view of the fact that these are the prime sources of information of past ages for the social historian.  Because of the regrettable ever-increasing rate of destruction of our heritage of monuments and sites, it has been decided to prepare and publish inventories of sites and monuments for each county and to leave aside for the present the more detailed survey and publication of full illustrated texts.  A start has already been made on the inventories for the counties already surveyed, i.e. Louth, Monaghan, Meath, Westmeath, Longford, Cavan and Kildare. These inventories will list the monuments in each county and will be accompanied by distribution maps and should be of value to students, local authorities and institutions of academic study, as well as to the Department of Agriculture including the Land Commission and to the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  It is hoped that the publication of the inventories will increase people's awareness of archaeology and, as more sites are identified, <Col N="1980" /> the destruction of potentially-valuable sites should diminish.  To accelerate the archaeological survey further, the University Colleges of Cork and Galway have been invited to carry out preliminary surveys and publish inventories of monuments in Counties Cork and Galway.</P>
    <P>On a general note, it is very satisfying to observe that, at a time when the tourist industry generally is going through a difficult period, the numbers of visitors to our national monuments continue to increase and that receipts from the sales of admission tickets more than cover the cost of providing a guide-information service at the major national monument sites.</P>
    <P>Earlier in my speech I mentioned that the Office of Public Works also undertake works for various Departments on a repayment basis.  One of the major programmes currently being undertaken under this heading is the provision of the buildings required for the development of the telecommunications service, the cost of which is met from the telephone capital account.  In March 1979 the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs announced an accelerated building programme for the erection of more than 500 new buildings or extensions to existing buildings, the majority of which were to be completed within three years.  The Office of Public Works reached this very difficult target.  At the end of March 1982 more than half the buildings were completed and a further 100 or so were well on the way to completion and will be handed over for use by the end of this year. Planning of most of the remaining projects is at an advanced stage.  Expenditure on this service in the current year by the Office of Public Works will be in the region of £30 million.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works also undertake the primary school building programme for which the Department of Education have allocated £27 million in 1982.  Other building programmes undertaken by the Office of Public Works include those for prisons for the Department of Justice and harbour works for the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1981" /> In the short time that I have had responsibility for the Office of Public Works I have been impressed by the extent and varied nature of the works undertaken by the Office and the expertise which it has developed in many fields through years of experience.</P>
    <P>I am sure that many Deputies will wish to comment on areas of special interest to them under this Estimate which I commend to the House.  I hope that, when replying, I will be able to supply any additional information sought.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much.  First, I should like to pay tribute to the Minister of State and to the officials of the Office of Public Works.  I have always found the Minister of State to be a most courteous person and I must say the same about his officials.  This Estimate is one of the most interesting to come before the House this year.  It covers a vast area in which various schemes operate with very wide ramifications.</P>
      <P>The Public Works Act goes back to 1831, 152 years, and it is still going strong. That Act created a separate Board of Works for Ireland and vested in it duties and responsibilities for the eight existing boards.  Their functions were concerned with the execution and maintenance of public works in Ireland.  The board, constituted under that Act, were charged with the execution of many services. Those duties were later expanded and at times contracted as the vicissitudes of the time and the changing political situation demanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has stated the operations of the Office of Public Works cover practically every Department of State, almost every part of the country and many features of our lives.  The Office of Public Works are the servants of so many Departments that it is hard for them to escape criticism.  When criticism is showered on them it is perhaps the Departments <Col N="1982" /> the Office of Public Works are the agents for who should get the blame.  The blame is usually heaped on the Office of Public Works.  It seemed to be fashionable in the past to decry the Board of Works.  They are often blamed for the sins of others.  As the people responsible for doing the work of other Departments, they are bound to get the criticism.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works, as the Minister said, are the repository of vast knowledge relating to the whole country. They are in a position to give a lead in standards because of their history and traditional skills.  They have a unique opportunity to set proper standards for buildings, design and workmanship and can ensure that the work done by local authorities and the private sector will have a high standard to compare with and evaluate.  Unfortunately, the standard in buildings has fallen and too many are inclined to put up with second best.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works deal with improvements to Government Buildings and to Leinster House.  We have an excellent building here, excellently run, with a courteous and competent staff, but they have a lot to put up with.  Our waiting rooms at the gates are far too small.  One could hardly swing a cat in them.  On budget day and at other times we can see queues of people waiting outside in the rain before they can be interviewed.  I know this has to be done for security reasons but it is a pity that we cannot have better waiting rooms.  The waiting room on the Merrion Street side is much smaller than the one on the Kildare Street side.</P>
    <P>There are many complaints about the heating and the thermostat which governs the heating in Leinster House.  The humidity here for the last week was overpowering. It is impossible to put up with it or for Deputies and officials to do their work properly.  I cannot understand why it cannot be improved.  During winter one can go into one room and the heat is unbearable but when one goes into another room one is frozen.  I wonder if the ushers and the messengers could have lighter uniforms to wear during warm weather.</P>
    <P>We have had an extension added to <Col N="1983" /> Leinster House and the old College of Art was given to us recently.  This extra space was needed and was to improve the accommodation for Deputies, Senators, officials, the press and the general public. All have benefited from the improvements but there are many snags which need to be overcome and more improvements are needed.  Deputies are crowded into small rooms.  There are secretaries working in those rooms as well and it is impossible to work in such conditions. People in industry would not work in the conditions that Deputies and those who serve them work in here at the moment.</P>
    <P>There is not a proper storeroom.  I have been in the place in the basement but it is a dreadful place to work in.  If there was a proper storeroom a year's supply could be purchased.  I am informed that only a few months' supply can be purchased at the moment.  The messengers have to take the stationery and the envelopes on a trolley, push the trolley over our beautiful carpets which we should be trying to protect, into the rain at times, and across to the College of Art.  Something needs to be done immediately in relations to this.  It is hard to believe the conditions which some people in Leinster House have to work in.</P>
    <P>It is only right to pay tribute where it is due but the first major breakthrough came under Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach in 1980.  We are very fond of abusing him at times but I was Chief Whip at that time and there was a major breakthrough. He gave us permission at that time to go ahead with facilities for Deputies and Senators, although they are not enough.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from a letter I got on 8 October 1981, when I was Chief Whip for the Fine Gael Party, regarding the young man doing the printing work at that time.  It stated:</P>
    <P>Accommodation in our new rooms must be found for &mdash;&mdash; and his machines.  For the first three months he was here, he spent all day working in a room where there was hardly enough room for the machines, let alone himself.  The room had neither a <Col N="1984" /> window nor any ventilation as the double doors had to be kept closed because of the noise.  He is now situated on our landing directly outside the women's toilet.  It is very cold and draughty there.  Even during the Summer there was a draught there which would skin a cat and there is no way at all of closing the area off.  It is unreasonable to expect anyone to continue working in such conditions.</P>
    <P>I do not want to give the young man's name.  Unfortunately, he is still working under the same conditions on the landing, because a suitable room cannot be found for him in Leinster House.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton on many occasions has dealt with the improvements we should have in Leinster House.  As Chief Whip on 28 May 1980 I sent to the Taoiseach a long list and I am glad to see, on checking through it yesterday, that we have got almost three-quarters of what we asked for at that time.</P>
    <P>There are many other items we still have to be given.  One is a terminal in the Library for Euronet, a European Computerised information system, a telephone exchange for each party with telephonist for each exchange, a bleeper system for all Deputies with links to the Party Whip's office and the messenger office, a telex terminal with newsagency reports to come into the Library, a new electronic system for divisions to cut out delays in voting, computerisation of Dáil reports for quick retrieval of quotations and newspapers on microfilm as in RTE.</P>
    <P>We are concerned about the programme for school construction to meet the needs of primary education.  Many of our national schools are not up to standard. Some are still without flush toilets and some of the schools are still pre-fabs provided ten to 15 years ago.  It is unreasonable that schoolchildren should have to tolerate conditions that should make politicians blush with shame.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Office of Public Works should strive towards the establishment of further national parks in suitable places throughout the country. Indeed I should like to see one in each county.  More attention should be paid to <Col N="1985" /> such a programme which would keep our young people interested in games and off the streets and away from vandalism and drugs.  The country should be proud of the amenities in the Phoenix Park.  It provides one million Dublin people with facilities during relaxation times.  However, there have been complaints that the Office of Public Works are not maintaining the gaelic, soccer and camogie pitches as they should be.  They contain dips and hollows, and need to be resodded and drained in some cases.  I welcome the steps being taken in regard to arterial drainage but unfortunately nothing has been done in the Shannon Basin.  On 16 May 1972 I had a question down and was told that the work there was awaiting a report of a costs study.  That is more than ten years ago and the people in Longford-Westmeath, mainly small farmers, have their lands flooded for six months every year.  I hope the Minister will see if grants are available from the EEC to get this work done as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I asked a question also in 1972 about whether the Government could provide their own office space instead of relying on rented accommodation.  I was told it was being examined.  I am glad that certain new buildings in Dublin are being opened this year.  In 1962-63 the Government were paying £9,000 a year in rent and this year the figure is £13,645,000. That money could be much better spent. Many of the buildings we are renting have been built by speculators who borrow the money from Irish insurance companies and others.  Why cannot the Board of Works do that?  I could speak for a long time on this Estimate but I agreed to divide the half hour with Deputy Bermingham.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>If I tried to say what I have to say in a quarter hour I would be insulting the Office of Public Works.  Therefore, I will confine myself to the points that mainly concern me, but I suggest that we be given an opportunity later in the year to discuss this very important subject.  I congratulate the Minister and he may wonder at that but I think it is fair to say that although he <Col N="1986" /> was a full Minister, he is now in charge of the most important office in the whole Government.  I say that from experience I have had.</P>
      <P>As the Minister's immediate predecessor in that office, I can say that he has one of the most loyal staffs that any Minister could wish for.  Surprisingly, let me say, because I had always been told they were no good for anything, that they were slow and indifferent, I found when I went into that office that for years they had been carrying the can for every other Department.  I could not praise them highly enough, from the most junior member of the staff to the chairman &mdash; I found their dedication amazing.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I shall confine myself to the few points that I will be able to make in the ten minutes still available to me.  I should like particularly to emphasise that in the Office of Public Works we have an agency which could do more to solve our unemployment problem than can be imagined because that office could initiate schemes that would create a vast amount of employment right throughout the economy.  There is no area of the Government's structure in which the Office of Public Works are not involved.</P>
      <P>With regard to national parks, we have built up an expertise and a definite commitment and interest by people from the top down and they have developed parks in a manner in which we can all be justly proud.  It is the showpiece of the Office of Public Works and they have done a magnificent job.</P>
      <P>I take a great interest in the waterways on the Shannon and canals because I come from an area which is served by the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal.  There is marvellous potential for developing the waterways further.  The Office of Public Works should pursue this policy in a constructive way.  They have already proved they can do this with the development of the Shannon waterways.  We were led to believe at one time that there was legislation pending which would hand over the waterways of the canals to the Office of Public Works and that they would be developing that in the same way as the Shannon.  It would be a tourist attraction and a great amenity for our own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1987" /> In the area of building and division of offices, there has been talk in the last few years about privatisation and how other people would be asked to build offices.  It has been proved that, given the money, the Office of Public Works would provide the accommodation necessary for our huge civil service.  Protests are being made daily from Government employees who need accommodation.  The money is just not there and I sympathise with the Minister in that regard.  Although he is the only junior Minister who has an Estimate, he cannot fight his corner in the Cabinet because he is under the control of the Minister for Finance.  That is a serious disadvantage.  The Office of Public Works have a great potential for the creation of employment and that is the most important problem facing us at present.</P>
    <P>The great achievement of the Office of Public Works has been in providing one of the finest concert halls in Europe.  It is not the biggest hall, but they turned a poor building into a magnificent showpiece. I wish to congratulate the people who worked on that from the ground up. It has been favourably commented on by experts all over Europe.</P>
    <P>When I had the honour to be the Minister of State at the Department of Finance I initiated a study of arterial drainage.  It was carried out by financial experts in the Department and their principal aim was to see how employment could be created in that area.  We could create jobs in the west at a net gain to the Government.  The 50 per cent grant in the west could help to pay some of the permanent staff who would be involved in any permanent scheme.  Social Welfare payments in the west are also above average because people are inclined to have larger families.  If some of these people were employed there would be a great saving in these payments.  They would also be paying income tax and this also would benefit the Government.  We could, in effect, produce jobs for less than cost.  When that study was finalised it was placed with the Department of Finance.  I urge the Minister to continue examining that area because we are paying <Col N="1988" /> at the rate of £7,000 per job to the IDA and they are not even creating employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barret, Clare) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barret, Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barret,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Clare</i>): I would like to thank Deputies for their contributions and their words of congratulation.  I would also like to thank them for their words of appreciation in regard to the personnel in the Office of Public Works. It is true they have been subjected to much criticism &mdash; wrongly, in most instances &mdash; over the years.</P>
      <P>There were a number of points raised here and, if I cannot cover them all, I will communicate with the Deputies concerned. Deputy L'Estrange raised a number of points in regard to Leinster House. There are some that have nothing to do with the Office of Public Works, such as ushers' uniforms and telephones.  They are matters for the House authorities. The differences between temperature in rooms is the fault of people who occupy them.  In one room it has to be turned up if it is cold and in another room it has to be turned off.  There is a serious accommodation problem in these buildings.  We have a growing number of Deputies and growing staff numbers over the years and the only acquisition we could make during that time was the College of Art which was refurbished as quickly as possible to relieve the overcrowding.  The only way we will ever solve overcrowding is to build new Houses of Parliament because I do not know where we are going to find more accommodation.  We have some in Senanta House, near enough so that Deputies and Senators will be available in the event of their having to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange mentioned that national schools were in a bad state.  We are the agents for carrying out the works required by the Department of Education in regard to new national schools and extensions to old national schools. We do not set the priorities.  The Department of Education set the priorities.  We do the work in accordance with their priorities.  There are over 400 major school schemes on at present but we have <Col N="1989" /> to go by the priorities set by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>The Shannon study has been mentioned. It has been spoken about for very many years.  There was mention of a small sum in the Estimates but that sum in the January Estimates for this year would only cover the cost of the study.  There was no provision for the extra staffing which is all-important.  In May 1981, before Deputy Bermingham went there, the Office of Public Works received sanction for three new engineering posts because there was a tremendous shortage of engineers there.  When the embargo was imposed a senior engineer was appointed but because of the embargo the other two engineers were not appointed.  It is hoped to recruit the staff in the not too distant future.  The embargo still exists at the moment.  It is not the fault of the Office of Public Works that this has not proceeded either last year or this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham made a very valid point in regard to the creation of jobs in the Office of Public Works.  We can have a net gain of over £400 out of the creation of each job in the Office of Public Works in the west where there will be a 50 per cent EEC grant and this compares with the huge sums which industrial jobs cost each year.  The Deputy can be sure that I will continue stating the case as he did, explaining the importance of this and trying to improve the situation as we go along.</P>

      <P>As a relative newcomer to this House, having been here 12 months now, I deplore the fact that this Estimate will, effectively, finish at 4 o'clock this afternoon.  It is not the Minister's fault and I am not blaming him. But we are talking about what I would regard as one of the major Departments of State with enormous functions from security to law reform.  We are talking about a Department the Estimate for which is in excess of £241 million.  In addition to the Minister speaking there will be no more than two or three other Deputies in the House contributing to the debate on the Estimate for this Department.  I deplore that fact.</P>
      <P>The manner in which we are dealing with Estimates in this House requires urgent re-examination.  I know I am echoing the sentiments of predecessors of mine in this House from all parties.  We have now reached the stage where we are turning this House into an irrelevancy. We have inherited the Westminster model of parliament without seeing fit to even introduce the reforms that have been introduced into that model over the years.  The time limits on the Estimates debate of the Department of Justice is a very real indicator of the inept and peculiar manner in which we deal with enormous sums of the public finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would regard an Estimate debate as effectively having two principal functions. First, it gives the Minister an opportunity to tell the House how much expenditure will be incurred in various sections of his Department over the year. It also gives the Minister an opportunity to indicate to the House what new steps he intends taking or what the policies will be within his Department, in particular, in the context of the Department of Justice, what areas of reform, be they legislative reforms or administrative reforms, are within the responsibility of that Minister that will be dealt with in the year.  It is the only time in the year that this House is given an opportunity of discussing in <Col N="1991" /> general the policies that we would like to see a Minister implementing in his Department.  In the context of the Department of Justice it is the only opportunity we get to discuss general policy matters in relation to the Garda, in relation to the courts, in relation to our prison system, in relation to law reforms. The only other times at which we can raise these issues is either by specific Dáil Question or when particular legislation comes before the House, and then of course the debate is confined to the legislation.</P>
    <P>Because of the limited time I have at my disposal as spokesman on law reform for Fine Gael I want to confine my remarks to that area, in that area the Minister's speech is more remarkable for its omissions than for its substantive content. I was extremely disappointed with the speech delivered by the Minister on the Estimates debate.  It contains no indication of any nature of any areas of reform that the Minister intends to introduce in the coming year.  We have heard promises, and comments have been made about different legislation some of which has been commented on by the Minister outside this House.  But we have had no specific proposals brought by the Minister before this House that within the next 12 months we are going to enact legislation in particular areas and introduce reforms in particular areas.</P>
    <P>In the area of law reform a vast amount of work has to be done.  I apreciate and understand that the Minister may have some difficulties in this area because he is responsible for the enormous area covered by the Department of Justice. Indeed, in recent years the security area, for very obvious reasons, has been a matter of major concern to all Ministers.  The area of law reform is of grave concern to many people and our failure to reform whole series of laws is adding a great deal to unhappiness and misery and creating tremendous problems for the future which are eventually going to have to be tackled by this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister's difficulty in dealing with this area is compounded by the failure of the Taoiseach to appoint a Minister of <Col N="1992" /> State with responsibility for law reform, a responsibility that the present Minister for Justice had in a previous Fianna Fáil administration.  The failure to appoint a Minister for law reform is indicative of the failure of the Government and of Fianna Fáil to fully appreciate and understand the need for and importance of reforming vast areas of our law.</P>
    <P>What areas need reforming? Under the Whips' agreement I understand I have approximately five minutes to cover them.  What areas require reform that are not referred to at any stage in his speech by the Minister? There is the whole area of illegitimacy, the concept of children being discriminated against because of the circumstances of their birth, and the way we regard one child as inferior to another and discriminate against that child in a whole series of ways within our legal system.  Reform of this area of law is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The Irish Commission for Justice and Peace in a recent statement on this matter said that there is a general obligation in justice for everyone, including Christians, that no one should be stigmatised and made to feel inferior because of the circumstances of their birth, for which they carry no responsibility.  In response to that statement the Minister made a comment outside this House, which he subsequently repeated in reply to a Dáil question, to the effect that in general he accepts that the law in relation to illegitimacy should be reformed.  If that is the case why has he not stated that legislation will be introduced in this area and why has he not promised a Bill before the end of this year? The reason is that, as in other areas of law reform, this ministerial responsibility has been abdicated to the Law Reform Commission.  The buck has been passed to them and as yet they have been unable to come up with any specific proposals.</P>
    <P>Then there is the problem in relation to the law of nullity.  Many hundreds of couples have obtained Church decrees of annulment and in the context of their religious beliefs they no longer regard themselves as married.  A number of them have since remarried in the Church. There is an enormous discrepancy <Col N="1993" /> between the number of Church annulments and the number of civil annulments. In the period 1976-1980 there were 462 decrees of annulment granted by the marriage tribunals of the Roman Catholic Church while in the same period there were only 17 civil decrees granted. We have no proposals for law reform in this area.  Why is this the case? The answer is that the Law Reform Commission are examining the issue.  Again political responsibility has been abdicated.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in the first report produced by the Law Reform Commission in 1976 they stated that they felt there was no reason for them to report on the law of nullity because the Attorney General's Office had done so in some detail.  We now note that the Attorney General's report has been referred to the commission for another report. The commission say they have difficulties regarding what should be done because the decisions now required are of a political nature.  These are decisions which the Law Reform Commission cannot make and are not statutorily required to make. We are not merely talking about lawyers' law in this area but the need to decide what type of reform is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech does not contain a specific reference or suggestion regarding the reform of our courts system.  The only reference made is to the fact that the Minister's Department have obtained additional buildings in order to provide a certain number of new district courts or circuit courts.  There is no suggestion in relation to the family law area that the Minister might even be considering the provision of family courts so that we could have a coherent and unified court system dealing with family problems instead of the disparate, overlapping and sometimes contradictory jurisdictions we have at present.  Why has the Minister not proposed family courts?  It was suggested by Fianna Fáil during successive elections that they were in favour of family courts, yet it appears there is no intention to introduce the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>It was even more depressing to hear the one comment in the Minister's speech in regard to the Children's Court system. <Col N="1994" /> The Children's Court in Dublin Castle was criticised for many years as a facility which should be replaced by a very different form of court.  The Minister's only comment was that due to the fact that a portion of the building in Dublin Castle was condemned, the Children's Court had to be moved to Morgan Place and will be moving to a different building in the not-too-distant future.</P>
    <P>It is depressing that the Minister's speech does not contain any reference to the Task Force on Child Care Services whose report contained comprehensive recommendations not merely for changing children's law in the area of taking children into care but in relation to the whole sphere of juvenile justice.  There were suggestions in the minority report for the introduction of a different form of court system and in the majority report there were concrete recommendations for the introduction of a number of changes in children's law generally.  I do not understand why the Minister's speech did not contain a reference to this Report.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that the Minister for Health intends to introduce legislation to implement some portions of the report in a Children's Bill.  Will that Bill deal with the whole area of juvenile justice and the criminal responsibility of children?  Will it provide a new form of court structure to deal with children both who need to be taken into care and who come before our courts?  Is it intended that this Bill will be introduced solely under the auspices of the Department of Health or have there been discussions and consultations between the Department of Justice and the Department of Health as to what is to be contained in this Bill?</P>

      <P>I apologise.  Perhaps the Deputy would allow me to ask the Minister one question.  The Minister might be in a position to tell the House what is happening in relation to the strike by <Col N="1995" /> District Court clerks.  I hope he will not hide behind the defence that this matter is <i>sub judice</i>, which it is not, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Minister's Department.  The continuation of this strike is now causing severe distress and hardship to a large number of women who need to seek assistance from our courts in looking for both maintenance orders and barring orders. I had hoped that the Minister would use the opportunity presented by this debate to indicate what steps he is taking to solve the dispute and whether it is likely to be solved within the next couple of weeks. I hope the Minister will provide the House with an explanation as to why on 13 May 1982 he indicated that the dispute was settled when, in fact, it was not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance of the preservation of the family unit is now more evident than ever.  We must take an honest look at what has been allowed to happen over the years.  The predominance of outside influences is very evident in our society and the modern trend is to a large degree taking over.  In many areas traditions are dying fast and outside influences are being allowed to take over. Television, which I would describe as the modern day evil, advocates drug pushing and violence and these have crept into society.  The drug pushers must be flushed out and crime pockets must be eliminated.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's crime prevention campaign.  It is necessary and expresses a concern about crime and vandalism. It stresses the need for a contribution by the people in co-operation with the Garda.  This will make a significant contribution to crime prevention in our homes and on the streets.  The Minister has brought a new dimension to law enforcement and I congratulate him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also congratulate the Minister on the Garda recruitment campaign.  The recruitment rate has been accelerated. An extra 200 gardaí have been accommodated in prefab buildings in the training centre and there is extra rented accommodation in Thurles.  There are 200 recruits over and above the 300 maximum capacity of Templemore Training <Col N="1996" /> School.  Accommodation for a total of 500 gardaí has been provided and by the end of the year there will be an extra 1,000 gardaí appointed.  This recruitment campaign has been well backed up by the Minister for Finance with the contribution of £2½ million for the recruitment of equipment of extra gardaí.  It is the Minister's intention to keep the training centre filled to maximum capacity.</P>
    <P>Gardaí on the beat are more in evidence than ever before.  Last Tuesday night I walked through the streets of Dublin with my wife and felt a sense of security which I have not felt for many a day due to their presence on our streets in Dublin.  They are making a significant contribution towards crime prevention in Dublin and elsewhere.  I have now overstepped my time, but will communicate with the Minister on other matters with which I have not had time to deal.</P>

      <P>This is an Estimate for the Department of Justice.  However, I wish to place on record that justice in this country has broken down completely. People are being molested, raped, robbed, motor cars smashed and stolen and this House takes so little notice that there appears to be a party conspiracy to prevent free and deliberate debate on these important issues.  This is perhaps one of the most dangerous steps which political parties can take.  We must speak out loudly and strongly to put an end to this state of affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would always be delighted to bow to the seniority of Deputy Flanagan.  Firstly, I take the opportunity, in the few brief moments available to me, to congratulate Deputy Shatter on his appointment as spokesman on law reform.  I assure the House that I and my Government are committed to law reform as was evident during the time when I was Minister of State.  At that time, a considerable amount of legislation in the law reform area was put through the House by me and I got considerable co-operation from the Opposition Deputies.</P>
      <P>I refer to the points specifically relating to the questions of nullity and illegitimacy raised by Deputy Shatter.  I notice that the Deputy did not refer to the question of domicile.  As he knows all these are sensitive, delicate and complex matters. I am satisfied that it would be incorrect and, indeed, inappropriate of me to duplicate the difficult work being pursued by the Law Reform Commission. Regardless of what has often been said about this commission, it has been of considerable practical use to this House and to Governments in the past.  The Attorney General who referred a number of questions to the Law Reform Commission did so in the knowledge of the serious complexities which were attached to them.  For that reason, I am prepared to wait and am anxious and hopeful that the Law Reform Commission will produce as quickly as possible their final documents in all the areas referred to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the difficulties in our courts system at the moment, Deputy Shatter has expressed concern about that situation on more than one occasion.  At no time have I attempted, or in any shape or form used any mechanism, to hide myself away in any part of this House from the realities that face me in regard to the courts dispute.  The one thing which I am not going to do &mdash; and I want <Col N="1999" /> to put myself on record in this House on this &mdash; is capitulate to any single grouping of people, legitimately set up or otherwise. Many difficult problems face many different people and the democracy to be protected by us in this House is not such as will respond to pressure groups making extraordinary demands.  I am not describing the union involved as a pressure group, but demands which are not capable of being met cannot be accepted and will not be tolerated by me.</P>
    <P>At the same time I accept the very serious situation which this dispute has posed for so many, particularly women and children.  I am appealing to the people involved to use the mechanisms which are there to resolve this dispute, recognising that the State has not unlimited cash.  Certainly, I would like to do so many other things if the money were available.  I cannot capitulate and must honestly express myself in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows very well what I am saying.  He comes along and makes that remark and looks to the press gallery as if it is from that area that he will obtain political solace for the future.  That is unfair.  He knows the position as well as I do.  There are a number of legal changes which I will bring about.  The Criminal Justice Bill has been referred to and this will be introduced in this House.  I will introduce a Liquor Licensing Bill and a Gaming and Lotteries Bill.  I have already had circulated a Community Service Bill.  The Deputy smiles at that.  He has good reason to smile.</P>

      <P>Over the last few months, I have provided a number of additional welfare officers to the Department of Justice, and assistance and technical expertise by way of scientists and technicians in the laboratory run by Dr. Donovan, who suffered so tragically in recent times.  I have made progress on garda recruitment, on crime prevention, on additional equipment including radio equipment, on computerisation.  All these are being done in very difficult times.  We all have a co-operative part to play in this and we must become more law assisting.</P>
      <P>I understand the concern expressed by Deputy Flanagan about vigilante groups and similar activities.  I do not wish to see that type of situation develop here.  I want to ensure that the Garda and the public will have confidence in each other.  In many instances, I still find keys left in cars and keys left in doors of houses in Dublin.  People must take simple precautions to ensure at least the minimum protection.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be political about this. I have been three and a half to four months as Minister for Justice.  While a considerable amount of work has been done, there is much more to come.  I hope that the Deputies in the Opposition benches, particularly Deputy Shatter, will contribute and give me assistance, rather than try to attempt to score political points.  The people who will suffer most will be ourselves and the general public whom we represent.  We will not be treated seriously if we are seen to be in this House purely for the purpose of scoring political points off each other.</P>
