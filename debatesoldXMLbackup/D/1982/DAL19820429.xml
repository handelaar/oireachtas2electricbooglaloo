      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 12 (resumed) and 13 (resumed).  Before business is entered on it is proposed, by agreement, that Standing Orders be suspended under Standing Order 139 (1) to enable the Taoiseach and the leaders of the parties in Opposition to make statements, not exceeding 15 minutes in each case, as to the action to be taken to deal with the situation that has arisen following a recent District Court decision in respect of the law with regard to multiple voting by individuals and to enable statements, not exceeding ten minutes each, to be made by another Member of each party and by each of the Independents and that the leaders of the parties may each make a reply not exceeding five minutes each.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be aware that in a recent case in the District Court two persons were charged with personation.  It was alleged that they voted in their own names at two separate polling stations.  Apparently, their names were entered twice in the register of electors. Section 3 of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923 provides that:</P>
      <P>Every person who at an election applies for a ballot paper in the name of some other person, whether that name be the name of a living person or of a dead person or of a fictitious person, or who having voted once at an election applies at the same election for a ballot paper in his own name, shall be guilty of the offence of personation.</P>
      <P>The district justice dismissed the case. According to press reports the justice found that the prosecution had not proved that an offence had taken place and that, in his opinion, it cannot be proved conclusively that a person has actually voted because the ballot paper used by an individual elector cannot be positively identified.  Reference was made to the McMahon case on the secrecy of the ballot.  Prior to that case the elector's registration number was written on the counterfoil of his ballot paper and this provided a link by which the ballot paper used by an individual elector could, in theory at least, be traced.  This practice of writing the elector's number on the counterfoil was found to be unconstitutional and the practice was written out of the law by the Electoral Act, 1972.</P>
      <P>I think it is necessary to understand that what we are dealing with is a decision of an individual justice of the District Court on particular cases.  As the House is aware, a decision of a district justice in one particular case is not binding on any other district justice in dealing with a similar case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it appropriate also to place on record that there is a legal procedure whereby a decision of a District Court <Col N="1728" /> may be brought under review by a higher court.  I am advised that it is open to the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to have a case stated for a direction on the point of law involved.  The question of whether to take such action is entirely within the discretion of the director.  The House will be aware that the director is an independent statutory authority and in the discharge of his functions he is not subject to direction by any Minister or by the Government.  I have no knowledge of what way the director's intentions in relation to the present case may be.  I would emphasise that, in accordance with statute, the matter is one entirely within the discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>That much said, I would acknowledge that the publicity attendant on this case may have given rise to some misgivings about the adequacy of existing electoral law to deal with a particular type of electoral offence.  It seems to me that it may now be opportune to clarify the provisions of section 3 of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923, which I have already quoted.</P>
    <P>It is desirable on a matter of such fundamental importance for our electoral system that there should be agreement among the parties on what is necessary. If there is such agreement the Government are prepared at a very early date to introduce amending legislation to clarify the particular provision involved, and make good any defects which may be considered to arise in regard to the section 3 of the 1923 Act.</P>
    <P>By agreement this legislation could be enacted within a very short time, indeed, within the next few weeks.  I am advised that the introduction of such legislation would not in any way inhibit any action which the Director of Public Prosecutions may be contemplating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is taking place because, on behalf of the Opposition, I persisted yesterday, within the rules of order, in seeking to establish, by points of order, that the matter we wished to raise is one of urgent public importance, involving as it does the question of whether the forthcoming by-election in <Col N="1729" /> Dublin West can be held in circumstances that will offer a prospect of a result actually reflecting the wishes of the people.  The Taoiseach's statement this morning, which I welcome, vindicates the decision he made yesterday to endeavour, within the rules of order, to find means by which this House could properly discuss the matter.</P>
      <P>I have no wish to spend time this morning in restating yesterday's arguments. I will content myself by saying that an application of the rules of order that would have prevented us from securing from the Taoiseach a statement of his intentions on this matter, in advance of the time when the writ for this by-election would normally have been moved, would have been damaging to democracy.  I believe that, given the decision to transfer questions on this matter from the Taoiseach to the Minister for Justice, which had the effect of moving them down the Order Paper to a position where they could not be taken as oral questions with supplementaries until many weeks had passed, because of this the matter became one of urgent public importance, appropriate for a Private Notice Question.  Secondly, I believe that it would not merely have been within the rules of order, but in accordance with precedents set by the present Ceann Comhairle as well as his predecessors, to have allowed the matter to be raised on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research by one of my colleagues in the brief period of our discussions here last night has revealed at least 15 cases where the present Ceann Comhairle allowed matters to be raised with me as Taoiseach, or Deputy O'Leary as Tánaiste, in most instances raised by the present Taoiseach, between July and December last &mdash; matters which were not on the Order Paper and which, in many cases, related to precisely the kind of issue we were seeking to raise on the Order of Business yesterday, namely, queries as to what action the Government intended to take on matters not then on the Order Paper.  In scarcely any case did the present Ceann Comhairle intervene with any reference to this procedure being out of order, and in none of these <Col N="1730" /> cases did he proceed with this objection, but permitted the exchanges to continue until the matter in question had been fully probed.  In one instance, indeed, he did restrain the questioner &mdash; the present Minister for Health and Social Welfare &mdash; from continuing, but only, in his own words, so as to give me the chance to reply to him.</P>
    <P>The simple fact of the matter is that this interpretation of the rules of order was not enforced when we were in government because we were willing to answer queries put to us on the Order of Business and did not sit mute, seeking to avoid our responsibilities by hoping that the Chair would protect our silence as has occurred on a number of occasions since this Dáil resumed.</P>
    <P>I shall be submitting to the Ceann Comhairle these cases, which I shall also make available to the Press, and shall be asking the Ceann Comhairle to review his ruling in the light of his own practice during the second half of last year which, as can also be demonstrated, was in line with past practice as long as the memory of Members of this House takes us back.</P>
    <P>Turning to the issue in this debate, it concerns the matter of illegal voting, designed to falsify the results of an election and to secure the return, by a constituency, of a Deputy of a party whom the electorate of that constituency wish to reject, and ultimately to give the country a Government other than that which the people of the country wish to choose. This has rightly been seen as a serious crime and one deserving of a gaol sentence. It is a practice which has never completely disappeared in this country, and its continuance has necessitated, on the part of my party and the Labour Party, a continuing massive effort at elections to check the register and to challenge suspect voters at the polls.</P>
    <P>It is, however, fair to say that the evidence has been of a decline in this practice during the seventies.  In my own constituency it had been a problem, particularly at one polling station, prior to 1969, but between that year and 1977 there was little or no evidence of attempts by people to vote illegally &mdash; save in the local elections of 1974, when several <Col N="1731" /> cases were detected and reported to the police, not involving any of the major political parties.</P>
    <P>In the June election of last year, however, it came to our attention in my constituency, and I believe in others throughout the country, that illegal voting was being attempted again, and successfully, on a significant scale.  This was evident, both from a number of cases where attempted personation was detected and those challenged fled, and also from the pattern of results at certain tables, which showed distinct departures from normal voting patterns, due account being taken of the general swing in voting which was occurring.</P>
    <P>This matter was serious enough for both my organisation and my constituency formally to notify the City Sheriff of the apparent recrudescence of this practice and to ask him to instruct his staff to be especially vigilant in the February elections and for us in our party to have printed, at our own expense, notices to hang outside polling stations, warning against illegal voting &mdash; something, indeed, which the Sheriff and the County Registrar might themselves usefully do. Despite this, at several polling stations in my constituency personation occurred, with voters arriving only to find that their votes had already been taken by someone else &mdash; as, I myself observed in Rathgar Avenue polling station.  I shall not speculate as to why personation should have become more rife in these two elections, after a period when it had seemed to become fairly rare.  Members and the public will have to make up their own minds about that.</P>
    <P>The new situation alerted our organisation, in other constituencies as well as my own, to the danger that the election results could be falsified and the country endowed with a government that the electorate did not wish to see in power, unless we were especially vigilant.  This was true of our organisation in Dublin North &mdash; a very marginal constituency, the most marginal in the country, indeed. The organisation there, as elsewhere, were alert both to the danger of personation &mdash; people voting on behalf of others, <Col N="1732" /> by seeking a vote in their name early in the day before they would be likely to go to the polls themselves, or in the name of persons absent or dead &mdash; and to the danger of double voting by people whose names appeared more than once on the register.</P>
    <P>The latter may not appear to be likely to be a serious problem and many people may assume that it could not or would not be.  However, the simple fact is that, because of the extraordinarily defective state of the electoral register, many people entitled to vote &mdash; sometimes whole roads or blocks of flats &mdash; are excluded, while many other people are registered twice.  I can testify to the commonness of the latter phenomenon, because I and others registered at my address were, in fact, doubly registered in the 1981-1982 register, for both these elections and I found it necessary, when voting at the opening of the poll, to draw the attention of the presiding officer and polling clerk to this fact, lest anyone attempt to vote in the name of people registered in my house, using the second entry in the register.</P>
    <P>Given the frequency of double registration on grossly defective registers the opportunity exists, not alone for personation but for double voting.  Double voting is covered by the relevant section of the 1923 Act, a section which, contrary to one press report, was not repealed by the 1963 Act.  It only repealed certain sections of the 1923 Act.</P>
    <P>This section of the Act makes it an offence for someone having voted once in his or her own name to ask for a ballot paper on a second occasion.  It is with this offence that Mr. O'Connor and members of his family were charged.  The evidence as to fact was conclusive, given by a presiding officer, poll clerks and Fine Gael personation agents in the two polling stations in respect of which Mr. O'Connor and his family had been irregularly registered. One presiding officer chose to change his evidence given to the police and had to be treated as a hostile witness, but the chain of evidence was completed without the evidence of this gentleman.</P>
    <P>The district justice stated that he had studied the law carefully but, as had been <Col N="1733" /> pointed out in well researched newspaper articles, he got his facts completely wrong, alleging for example, that Ms. Mairín de Burca had taken a case about the numbering of ballot papers when, in fact, she had nothing to do with that case. He chose to hold, contrary to all previous decision&mdash;and to a subsequent decision where the person concerned was less prominent than Mr. O'Connor and was given a prison sentence now being appealed&mdash;that the fact that Mr. O'Connor had gone to a polling station, sought a ballot paper, gone to a booth and returned and cast his vote in the ballot box did not prove that he had voted and that, therefore, it could not be shown that his second request for a ballot paper at another polling station where his name was on the register occurred after he had already voted.  The decision was as perverse and nonsensical as the district justice's facts were wrong.  It would make the relevant section of a sixty-year-old Act inoperative and would, if allowed to stand, impugn all previous convictions for double voting.  It has been universally condemned by lawyers as undermining the law and the electoral system.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach has said, this decision, taken in conjunction with the subsequent contrary decision in another case, is presumably being considered by the Director of Public Prosecutions, with a view to stating a case to a higher court, so that the judgment in this case, which would, if allowed to stand, destroy completely the efficacy of the law against double voting, can be reviewed and, I believe, set aside.  This would protect our democratic system against a danger not hitherto suspected to exist and ensure that justice is done and seen to be done on a fair and equitable basis, as between those coming before the courts, regardless of their position in life.</P>
    <P>But such a reference, which can be made within 14 days of a case being heard, would itself, if undertaken, not come to court for some time and the law would in the meantime remain in doubt and would encourage people twice registered in the constituency of Dublin West, of whom I am sure there are many, on the basis of the type of register to <Col N="1734" /> which we have been accustomed, to emulate Mr. O'Connor in the knowledge they would have as their defence if apprehended the existence on the record of a court decision that they had committed no offence by acting in the same manner as the election agent of a candidate had done.</P>
    <P>The existence of this possibility for the distortion of the election result in Dublin West is such as to require immediate legislative remedy.  Such a remedy is easily available: it involves only changing the wording of the section to make the offence one of having asked for a ballot paper, having already asked for and received a ballot paper in another instance which is, I believe, the law in Britain.  What we seek is such a change in the law.  I am glad the Taoiseach concurs with our view and I am sure we will have no difficulty in agreeing between parties as to the exact nature of the amendment required and passing it through both Houses of the Oireachtas rapidly so that it will be the law, signed by the President and in operation before the election takes place in Dublin West.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps add that such legislative amendment would not, of course, in any way prejudice the process of reference of the existing legislation by way of case stated to a higher court, which we would expect that the Director of Public Prosecutions would proceed with in any event, as necessary to clarify and uphold the validity of past convictions, and indeed of one subsequent conviction, and to provide a clear basis for a decision in other cases that we understand may be pending arising from the last election with its unusual incidence of personation.</P>
    <P>However that may be, I am glad that the Government intend to introduce at once, in agreement with all parties, legislation which will once and for all put beyond doubt the law on double voting, so that the moving of the writ for the Dublin West by-election may proceed with the sure knowledge that the democratic process in that election will be adequately protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The urgency in this matter is because of the pending by-election. <Col N="1735" /> It cannot be denied that there is doubt as to the law governing our voting procedures in the State.  It cannot be denied that there is no longer effective protection against double voting.  Therefore, the efficacy of our legal system governing the conduct of elections is open to query.  I believe the Oireachtas should not remain powerless in this situation and there are two methods of dealing with it. The Taoiseach said in his contribution here that either Director of Public Prosecutions seeks by way of case stated to the High Court clarification of the law after the ruling of the district justice in the case of the DPP <i>versus</i> O'Connor, or the Oireachtas itself amends the existing legislation.  In the case of the route open to the DPP, should the DPP be dissatisfied with the High Court ruling it would be open to him in turn to proceed to the Supreme Court.  It is clear from the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1857, as amended by the 1861 Supplementary Provisions Act, that any party dissatisfied with the decision of a district justice as being erroneous on a point of law can apply within 14 days to the district justice to state and sign a case stated and sign a case setting forth the facts on the grounds of such determination for the opinion of the High Court.  However, to proceed by way of case stated to the High Court and possibly to the Supreme Court, the aggrieved party here being the DPP, it is clear there would have to be adequate preparation of the necessary documentation. That would take time and there would also be a necessary period occupied in arranging for court hearings.  It means, therefore, that the pursuit of clarification of the present law through the courts would necessarily be a long drawn out process.  It certainly would not be a process which would be ended in time for what we understand to be the date of a pending by-election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the courts would say the present law remained intact: irrespective of that, court clarification would simply relate to the present case of the DPP <i>versus</i> O'Connor.  The time within which there could be such clarification would mean that if the by-election was proceeded <Col N="1736" /> with the law would be in doubt. It is clearly, therefore, beyond the bounds of possibility that a further judgment of any court would be made in time.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy Spring yesterday to a Limerick case referring to the same matter in which a prison sentence was imposed but in that case a point could be made that the efficacy of the present law was not tested since the defendant admitted he had voted twice. The conclusion is inevitable, that the processing of this matter through our courts could not re-establish the law in time for the pending by-election.  The Oireachtas in a sense is not concerned with any possible final determination of the courts on the case of the DPP <i>versus</i> O'Connor but the Oireachtas must be concerned with the outcome of that case without prejudice to any further consideration of that particular case by the courts.  The Oireachtas must, without delay, address itself to the amendment of the existing law governing electoral practice so that there is no doubt concerning the status of the law in the matter, either for the forthcoming by-election or any future election.  All that is required is a simple amendment to the Electoral Act which would govern electoral practices in the future.</P>
    <P>I would recommend an amendment along the lines of the British Representation of the People Act, 1947, section 47, which appears to place greater emphasis on the application for a ballot paper as a prerequisite of the offence as distinct from the actuality of having voted.  It appears in the case of the DPP <i>versus</i> O'Connor that the district justice considered that the actuality of voting in itself made impossible the proving of intent.  If that is the case, as the Taoiseach said this morning, we should proceed rapidly towards amending legislation.  This legislation would not require much drafting; it can be done either by addition to or amendment of the present Act.  If the difficulty appears to be along the lines of intent as against the actuality, in law the <i>mens rea</i> as against the <i>actus reus</i>, it would seem we should follow the British Act and make it clear that the application for the voting paper in itself is a prerequisite <Col N="1737" /> of the offence.  That would either mean a new, brief electoral Act or an amendment.  All that is required on the part of the Taoiseach is a readiness to give some time of the House to it and that time could be set aside early next week to do it and then we can proceed to the by-election without any worry about the status of the law.  It is necessary because counsel for the defence in the case of the DPP <i>versus</i> O'Connor made the point that even if you could prove that a ballot paper had been marked and put in the box, you could still not prove that voting had occurred.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of confusion that exists at present and that confusion must be resolved immediately, certainly before the by-election, because reference was made to the fact that there is a great deal of carelessness in the drawing up of the registers.  The leader of the Fine Gael Party referred to the doubling of names on the register.  To what extent double voting and personation is a laudable hobby in Irish elections is open to conjecture. In the recent election one of my supporters told me that a supporter of an opponent had told him in a boastful fashion that he had voted 50 times that day for a particular candidate.  That may be an exceptional instance but we could not prove it because we lack the organisation to have agents within polling booths.  I do not know to what extent this is permitted and tolerable, a joke in which the test seems to be how many votes can be accumulated in an election.  Our laws must be amended to stamp this out.</P>
    <P>While we are clearing up the Act in relation to electoral practices, perhaps we should also clear up the question of a mandatory sentence relating to the offence. If we clear up the constituent nature of the offence itself, what constitutes the offence, we should also clear up the penalty that attaches to the offence because there is a doubt about it.</P>
    <P>There is a case from Mayo wending its way through the courts at present as a result of the June 1981 election.  The question has been raised is there discretion for the judge to decide on a prison sentence or is the discretion merely one of two or four months?  This is a matter <Col N="1738" /> that could be quickly cleared up.  It should be made clear that a mandatory sentence follows on the offence in the Act and that there is no discretion allowed to the district justice in this matter.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the confidence of the public in our electoral laws must be unshakable.  It is important that that confidence should be restored and it is evident therefore that the Act needs amendment if the public are to have full confidence that the Act governing these matters would provide for mandatory sentences. That should be clearly and unambiguously set down in the Act so that the public will have full confidence in the efficacy of the law governing electoral procedures.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Act itself, surely it is about time for us to adopt a more scientific and reliable method of filling out the electoral register.  The idea of an official of a local authority arriving at one's door and asking at different times of the year &ldquo;How many people in the house?&rdquo; and to be told &ldquo;six&rdquo;, or &ldquo;12&rdquo;, &ldquo;This person exists&rdquo;, &ldquo;That person does not exist&rdquo; is ludicrous and it is ludicrous that the electoral register is formed on that basis.  Surely we can get a more reliable counting method of the number of people entitled to vote.  That is not an immediate matter but it is one we should address ourselves to.</P>
    <P>Putting it mildly, we have many problems throughout the country.  We have massive unemployment, we have not any growth.  In these circumstances many people are looking at this Parliament and asking: &ldquo;What are they doing above there?&rdquo; To what extent is this Parliament relevant to the numbers of people unemployed, to the other huge problems we are facing?  I do not discount the importance of the matters dealt with here yesterday &mdash; they were very important matters &mdash; and therefore I cannot see why legitimate questions of importance raised by Opposition speakers could not have been given a satisfactory response. Instead, an entire day was spent in procedural wrangling &mdash; an important matter, but procedural wrangling.  This <Col N="1739" /> House was caught in that paralysis for most of yesterday.  The responsibility for that must rest inescapably on the Government side.</P>

      <P>I speak of the Government in particular.  They have been given the mandate to deal with the economy.  That is the most important matter before Parliament, so let us not have a situation which would hinder us in that work, that would get us caught up in complicated procedural wrangling for a whole day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make only a few points to show why a number of changes are desirable.  My first point is the difficulty encountered when we try to raise important matters like this.  I will refer to an occasion recently when I tried to raise the vitally important matter of exporting live cattle.  That was a matter of considerable national importance and I should have been given an opportunity to raise it.  What we are discussing now is another one, and there are several others.  When it has been clearly established that the problem is one of national importance, time should be allowed to debate it. Nobody came to my rescue at that time or said anything at all on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the matter now before the Dáil, I am clearly aware of the need for legislation to prevent abuses and to lay down penalties to prevent such abuses.  I have had much experience of <Col N="1740" /> such abuses, but following the last election I had to make representations to the Southern Health Board to carry out an investigation of the manner in which long-stay patients in an institution, some of them having been there for 20 years or more, were still registered in their native parishes.  On the occasion of the last election I know of two instances of patients on the register who were supposed to have voted but in fact had never left the institution.</P>
    <P>That will give an idea of how widespread abuses of the system are.  I hope this debate will have an impact outside so that people will become aware of the seriousness of this.  As Deputy O'Leary has said, the system whereby a franchise officer from the local authority receives applications for transfers or for inclusion in the register is totally haphazard. Indeed I would say it is the kernel of the problem.  If, as in the case before us, a person was included in two registers, obviously the person or persons responsible did not have proper knowledge. There is not any doubt that people are registered in more than one area.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it is on that problem that the start must be made.  Local authorities will have to be given proper staffs so that they will not have to depend on franchise officers or junior staff members. Each local authority should have a staff whose specific task it is to compile registers. At present there is not a proper checking method to ensure that the register has been properly compiled.</P>
    <P>We would welcome legislation which would eradicate the possibility of so many different interpretations, which resulted in a man getting two months in jail in one area and in another area it was decided that the case had not been proved positively. I hope this debate will have the effect of making people more aware of the problem.  I hope we will have early legislation which will lay down the law clearly so that it will be clearly understood by everybody and so that this abuse which has been widespread for years will be eliminated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In his statement the <Col N="1741" /> Taoiseach dealt fully with the main questions involved in this matter, but there are a few aspects I should like to touch on briefly.  First, there is the proposal for a new legislation.  The precise content of it, of course, will be a matter for the legal advisers and the parliamentary draftsman. I understand that already they have commenced their examination of the matter.  As a layman, I can see the Bill as a short and simple document which basically would clarify the situation and make clear what was the original intention of legislators when framing the statute.</P>
      <P>As explained by the Taoiseach, the main provision is section 3 of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923.  I have heard the views of Deputies on how the problem should be approached.  The House will find me very receptive to suggestions in this regard; Deputies may be assured that very full and careful consideration will be given to all such suggestions. Above all, the objective will be to ensure that such defects as exist will be made good and that any misgivings that may exist in relation to the adequacy of the law will be set at rest.  It is important too that the traditional method of dealing with the mechanics of the electoral law in this House on the basis of consultation and agreement between the parties should continue.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, another aspect to this matter which must not be lost sight of &mdash; it has been mentioned here this morning &mdash; that is, how it comes about that a number of people are registered more than once on the same register of electors.  Unfortunately the present example is not an isolated incident and this has been proven by the contributions here this morning.  Reports reaching my Department in relation to the last two general elections have shown that in many areas there were serious deficiencies, errors and omissions in the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have decided to establish a working party to carry out a thorough-going examination of the whole registration process and come up with positive recommendations designed to effect a real improvement in the standard of the register. I will be asking them also to examine <Col N="1742" /> certain other aspects of the electoral process &mdash; for example, to recommend a sensible postal voting system for the disabled and other categories that may have need of it.  My intention is that the working party will include representatives of the returning officers, of the local authority officials who at the moment compile the register, as well as officials of my Department.  They will commence work as soon as possible and I expect them to go about this task with a real sense of urgency.  By that I mean that I will expect recommendations from them within three months on the matters raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The case which gave rise to the discussion taking place here today attracted national attention from the very day of the election until the day of the trial in the District Court.  A great many people were shocked to find that the learned district justice dismissed the prosecution against Mr. O'Connor.  It was very proper therefore that the deputy leader of Fine Gael and the leader of Fine Gael, within the rules of order, should have raised this matter yesterday and persisted in spending a great deal of time on it, highlighting it to such an extent that, with all respect, the Taoiseach had no alternative but to agree to give time here today for this discussion.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to hear from the Taoiseach that he proposes to arrange to put through such legislation as may be necessary to amend the law to put it beyond all doubt.  It is of course necessary that any such amendment as may be necessary should be made immediately and that it should go through both Houses of the Oireachtas and be signed by the President and be law before the by-election in Dublin West is held.  We will of course facilitate the passing of such legislation. It is admitted that there could be a repetition of this and if the law is defective it should be made good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But I do not think that it should end there.  I believe that the learned district justice erred in law when hearing this case and that should be put right.  As has been stated here today, the district justice stated in court that because of the heavy <Col N="1743" /> penalties provided by statute in such a case he had gone into the law carefully. The average ordinary layman could be forgiven for thinking that the district justice looked at the law before going into court to see if there was any possible way out of convicting in this case.  If he did that it is a pity and he was wrong.  The Director of Public Prosecutions, who is an independent officer, should ask the learned district justice to state a case for the opinion of the High Court as to whether the district justice acted in accordance with law in hearing this case, and if he did not act in accordance with law the case should be sent back to him by the High Court with a direction to adjudicate on it in accordance with law.</P>
    <P>The district justice in this case dismissed it because he held that there was no evidence that Mr. O'Connor had voted in Malahide polling station.  Let us see briefly what happened there.  According to the evidence, Mr. O'Connor went into Malahide polling station; he asked for a ballot paper in his name.  The evidence is that he got a ballot paper in response to that request.  He then went into the voting compartment.  He spent some time there.  He came out of the voting compartment.  He went to the ballot box and he put the ballot paper, or what appeared to be a ballot paper, into the box.  If that is not <i>prima facie</i> evidence that he voted, I do not know what is. That evidence establishes the strongest <i>prima facie</i> case against Mr. O'Connor that could possibly be established by any evidence.  It certainly establishes a case to be met.  It certainly shifted the onus of proof on to Mr. O'Connor to prove that he did not vote.  Of course, if Mr. O'Connor could say that he went into the polling station and asked for a ballot paper in his name, got the ballot paper and went into the voting compartment but, having thought it over for a moment, had decided that he would rather vote in Kinsealy, of all places, than in Malahide and that he had then put an unmarked ballot paper into the ballot box, there might be some grounds for saying that the district justice was right.  But how the learned district justice could hold that <Col N="1744" /> there was not a <i>prima facie</i> case against Mr. O'Connor I do not know.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we have to bring this matter up in the House and that we have to talk about the duties of the Director of Public Prosecutions because I am sure that that learned gentleman will act in accordance with the law as he thinks fit and proper.  But I believe that he should send this case to the High Court and, as I understand the law, if the High Court believe that the district justice erred in law it has power to send the case back to the district justice with a direction that he hear the case in accordance with law and adjudicate on it.</P>
    <P>There is not very much more I want to say.  It happens that the register is not properly made up and it happens that people are left off who should be on and that people are on who should not be on. But I do not want to muddy the argument that I am making.  I am making two net points.  The first is that we should amend the law to put it beyond doubt, but amend it in such time that the law is effectively changed before the West Dublin by-election. But, more important, we should have whatever happened here clarified because, unless this case goes to the High Court, the confidence of the people of this country in the courts of this country will be shaken and that would be a bad day for the administration of justice; it would be a bad day for law and order; it would be a bad day for democracy.  In view of all the publicity this case has got it is imperative that it be clarified.  It is no wonder that it got publicity having regard to the fact that Mr. O'Connor was who he was.  If he was not an election agent for the Taoiseach, as he was, the fact that he is a solicitor and an officer of the courts would be sufficient to attract nationwide publicity.  I should like to make these two points: amend the law and send the case to the High Court.  Do that much to restore public confidence which has been so badly shaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the clarity we have been given concerning the proceedings of yesterday.  What seemed impossible to discuss in a clear and logical manner yesterday has come to pass this <Col N="1745" /> morning.  Possibly the grey cold dawn of a new day made it simpler.  As a younger Member of the House I was astounded at the curtailment of discussion on this item yesterday, an item of great importance in relation to the election system and democracy and the institution of justice.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with a specific instance in this discussion but we are all aware that we are discussing and revealing what is the tip of the iceberg.  We must not for a moment fail to appreciate the seriousness of the abuses which have been highlighted in the course of this discussion.  If we have any commitment to democracy and the workings of it, it must come from the House that we are standing by the effective administration of justice which will curb any electoral abuses such as those we have under discussion.</P>
      <P>Instances have been given by those who spoke of abuses in their own constituencies. There is probably not one Member in the House who, in his own career or in days gone by, could not refer to such instances.  As my party leader said, there is a dubious honour attached to the man who claims he voted 50 times or who is caught with 40 polling cards in his pocket, as happened in my constituency. My local justice referred to young people given these polling cards by a person who is involved in politics as lambs being led to the slaughter.  Those involved in politics and in seeking office must be seen to treat this matter with disdain and be seriously interested in stamping out electroal abuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all realise that the procedures and practice in relation to the compilation of the register and polling cards leave a lot to be desired.  I ask the Minister for the Environment, when reviewing the Act, to look at the question of the distribution of polling cards, which have no legal standing in their own right, in urban areas in particular.  We all know the situation in areas where there are many flats and apartments.  People tend to move around a lot.  Polling cards are put into letter boxes and left lying on the hallways of flats.  They are a temptation to people to use them at a future date.  Some form of registration is necessary if we are to make <Col N="1746" /> a serious attempt to curb electoral abuses.  There may be necessity &mdash; I ask the Minister to consider this&mdash;for people to produce some form of identification at polling stations, be it a driving licence or whatever.  That may go a long way towards stamping out abuse.</P>
    <P>The question of people being issued with polling cards in various areas can only be stamped out by the effective compilation of the register, which should be better scrutinised than the haphazard way it is done at present.  That is no reflection on the people who are attemptting to do it at present.  However, the system has outgrown itself and they are not capable of compling the register in as rigid a manner as it should be complied.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's statement and the manner in which he met the request for the suspension of Standing Orders and also the acknowledgement of the independence of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The seriousness of the case under discussion must not be underestimated.  If this was a minor incident in any other constituency it would still deserve the same clarification both in this House and in the courts.</P>
    <P>It is particularly important to the layman that this case is seen to have the full effect of the law.  We must not be seen as attempting not to give this matter a full airing in our courts.  There is a procedure open to the DPP and without attempting to undermine the independence of that office as spokesman for justice on behalf of the Labour Party I urge that this matter be dealt with in the High Court.  It is necessary that this be done, considering the inconsistency of judgments delivered relating to similar cases.  I urge that this matter be dealt with in a higher court.  It is the system provided for in our law and I hope it will be availed of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>My knowledge of this case is confined to what I have read in the public print.  I took time to study the evidence very carefully as a student of politics and as a practising politician.  I studied the verdict given by the district justice in the O'Connor case.  I can say <Col N="1747" /> without any hesitation that I have been dismayed and alarmed at the verdict given.  It appeared to me that the justice concerned went to extraordinarily great lengths to reach that verdict.</P>
      <P>I read the evidence and there was no doubt in my mind as to the outcome of the case, but the justice turned the law on its head to search for every loophole possible to let Mr. O'Connor off.  The whole case in my book was designed to find some loophole to let Mr. O'Connor off.  That is what happened.  However, one cannot carry out a travesty of justice regardless of the people outside the courts or this House.  The people have intelligence and commonsense and this verdict by the justice concerned was an affront to commonsense and intelligence. It was a legal scandal that will go down in the statute books when people examine and weigh carefully the verdict of the justice concerned.</P>
      <P>There was great disparity and discrepancy in this decision because I read in last Friday's <i>Limerick Leader</i> of a man being jailed in County Tipperary for a similar offence.  This man pleaded guilty.  Perhaps he did not have powerful or influential friends to advise him.  He was sentenced to jail.  I thought everyone was equal in the eyes of the law.  I do not understand how there is one law in Limerick or Tipperary and another in Dublin.  There is only one law for the country.  I do not understand how different verdicts were given.  I accept the cases were held in different courts.</P>
      <P>The justice said he found it hard to prove that anyone voted at all.  I laughed when I read that because I wondered what happened to everyone who voted. Could he just conjure away people who voted in the election?  I do not understand how anyone could face the public and say he did not know that people had voted in the election.  This was the means used to let Mr. O'Connor off.  I should have thought a more sophisticated attempt would have been made to pull the wool over people's eyes rather than this blunt, brazen affront.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was mentioned earlier that this was merely the tip of the iceberg.  All parties <Col N="1748" /> have done this.  In 1932, when Fianna Fáil came to power, they did so through a lot of personation.  Ever since they have become past masters at this not only in Dublin but in Limerick, Tipperary and elsewhere.  From where I come in Limerick it is done on a very organised basis and the flatland effort mentioned by Deputy Spring is used as a central machine in getting polling cards from hotels, flats, and so on, and people are brought in from rural parts to cast their votes for certain parties.  In the last election I caught six people impersonating and I booted them out of the polling booth.  I did not go any further with that, but they ran like rats.  I am sure hundreds more impersonated on that occasion. This was not confined to Fianna Fáil, although they are the best at this practice. They have the most experience at it, they are the most efficient and it works for them, especially in urban areas, but other parties have been guilty also.  As a member of a very small party with only minute representation in this House I feel that this practice discriminates against small parties and Independents because it is done through money, organisation, transport and so on.  It is a denial of democracy.  It flies in the face of the democracy in which we all profess to believe.  This practice should be stamped out and stopped.  It is a despicable, Tammany Hall practice.  It is a pernicious practice which has no place whatever in our democracy or in Irish politics.  An independent commission should be set up outside politics to examine this abuse and to bring in recommendations to stamp it out once and for all.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Fitzpatrick asking that the case be referred to a higher court, but I have not much faith in the courts in this connection because in the past I have seen powerful and influential figures in Irish public life and supporters of the main parties trying to stop democracy and to stop the law from taking its course. I am very sceptical about the chances of this practice being stopped at a higher level.  I am cynical about the process of law in this country.  If it is possible to bring the matter to a higher court in order to show that this was a very bad decision <Col N="1749" /> and a travesty of justice, I would have no objection to that course.  However, I would prefer to place &mdash; or maybe misplace &mdash; my faith in an independent commission who would examine the whole electoral system here and bring in recommendations which would end once and for all these abuses of the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The bewildering wrangling that took place here yesterday indicates clearly to me, a new Member of the House, the need for some kind of rationalisation of the procedures, rules, Standing Orders, precedents and so on in order that issues of national importance can be brought forward here in the Dáil by any party or Member of the House.  Concerning the electoral loophole that has been found, it is essential that whatever amending legislation is being brought in would be effective before polling day in the Dublin West by-election because it is very important that the electorate retain their confidence in the democratic process.</P>
      <P>In relation to the further review of the electoral process itself, the franchise, how the register books are complied, postal voting for the disabled and so on, I ask the Minister to consider also the question of mobile polling stations for people on short-term stay in institutions where postal voting would not be quite adequate for their needs.  Need exists also for a public educational programme to familiarise people, particularly the young people, with the election process.  If that was done on a regular basis the opportunity for personating would be reduced considerably, because a large number of people do not vote simply because they do not know how to vote.</P>
      <P>Finally, whatever changes are made in the procedures of the Dáil and in the Electoral Acts, it is important that we do it as mature individuals attempting at all times to ensure that the electorate have confidence in our ability to look after their interests.</P>

      <P>By contrast with yesterday we appear this morning to have made some progress in this matter.  It appears that there is willingness to take on immediately the task of amending the law and various speakers have referred this morning to ambiguity in the present law and the need to clarify it.</P>
      <P>In my contribution I made the point that clarification is required that the offence consists in the act of applying for the vote rather than the actuality of the voting process itself.  That appears to have been the difficulty.  The difficulty of proof appears to have been the element of the problem in the case of the DPP <i>versus</i> O'Connor.  That appears to be the view which the district justice entertained in that case and I have recommended that a change be made in our law to approximate it more closely with the corresponding British Act.  Also I have made the point that the matter of the penalty to be attached to the offence should be clarified. The vagueness which surrounds the issue of whether the district justice has discretion to go for a suspended sentences rather than a mandatory prison sentence should be clarified also if we are to change the Act.  I accept that the most important aspect of the law as it obtains at present is clarification of what constitutes the prerequisite of offence.  That appears to be the main issue to be decided and that would require a very trifling operation in the existing law by way of either amendment or a new section.  In any case no great time would be lost in drafting it.  It is not a monumental work.  It would be done in a matter of hours, or even minutes, because I do not know anyone on any side of the House who would object or has any query of objection in relation to such a change.  It appears that we can proceed to that work rapidly so that it will relate to any future offences in respect of this matter.  It should apply in the case of Dublin West, because it is very important that the law be clarified in this respect in time for that by-election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made here to the rather haphazard way in which registers <Col N="1751" /> have been complied.  Undoubtedly there are people in Dublin West whose names appear more than once on the register, and if the law is not clarified such people will have an open invitation to engage, if they so wish, in double voting in that by-election.  Clearly, it is not in the interests of anyone in this House that that should occur and, therefore changes should be made in the law without delay.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, in my initial contribution this morning I said I hope that we could proceed as rapidly as possible to that change in the law.  The point has been made very clearly that the DPP, being an independent officer, should, immediately, take whatever measures, remedies or steps he believes are advisable through the courts.  In the Oireachtas our primary concern must be the outcome of that court decision on the existing law.  That existing law being at present open to doubt, the Oireachtas must resolve that doubt and make the necessary changes in time for the by-election, because it is important that the people have confidence in the legislation governing elections and that this House should correct any anomalies that have arisen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to a number of points.  I hope that the DPP, acting independently with the powers given to him so to act by our Government eight years ago, will take note of what has been said in this House on all sides, and that in view of the cogent arguments advanced he will take the necessary steps to clarify existing law and ensure equality of treatment of people under the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is certainly unsatisfactory that after Justice Kearney had given his verdict a case was taken in Tipperary and the district justice there allowed that case to proceed.  The person concerned pleaded guilty, leaving the district justice with no alternative but to find him guilty and sentence him.  I would have thought, following the case before Justice Kearney and the verdict given and since the time for a case to be stated had not yet elapsed, that the proper procedure would have been for the district justice to adjourn the <Col N="1752" /> case with a view to seeing whether steps were to be taken, rather than allow the defendent to go ahead and be trapped, perhaps, because he had not the same kind of legal knowledge or advice as Mr. O'Connor had.  This person pleaded guilty and found himself subject to a jail sentence in respect of something where the law had been stated &mdash; wrongly, I believe &mdash; in another court that he could not be so guilty.  I do not think ordinary people can accept the justice of that and the correct course of action for the district justice would have been to adjourn the case to give the DPP time to take his decision within the 14 days before a case was heard.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary has raised a point about the nature of the penalty.  We suffer from the fact that in this country &mdash; and it is a situation which is different from that in other countries &mdash; there has continued to be a certain tolerance of personation, despite which it has until recently tended to diminish.  That tolerance is aided by the fact that the proving of personation is rendered somewhat difficult by the procedures required and also by the fact that the sentencing situation is by no means clear.  The sentence should be mandatory to mark the gravity of the offence and anybody committing an act of personation should know that there will be no freedom on the part of any district justice for any reason, whether good or bad, to suspend the sentence.  It should be understood that by an act of personation the person concerned is incurring the risk of a mandatory jail sentence.  This could be discussed in the context of the amendment in respect of double voting.</P>
    <P>This debate has also brought out the general concern about the equality of the register and the whole electoral system. While we cannot deal with all that in the next week or so while preparing the necessary legislation on the immediate issue in advance of the Dublin West by-election, the concern expressed is such that the Taoiseach will probably agree that it would be useful for the parties to have some discussions on whether and how the present system and the register could be improved and difficulties overcome.  Not <Col N="1753" /> every suggestion made here in this respect would command my support and some of the suggestions might create more difficulties than they would solve. Discussions between the parties might lead to some useful improvement in the system, which is not operating successfully. One of the reasons is probably that the very large increase in the electorate due to the increase in population and the lowering of the voting age ten years ago has overstrained the limited resources of those concerned, leading to a situation some years ago where my party found 1,100 people had been omitted from the draft register.  When we went along rather proudly to the city sheriff with these names he said he had already 5,000 such names.  Out of 42,000, to lose 5,000 from the draft register and pick them up in the interval suggested a degree of weakness in the system which needs to be examined.  Apart from any discussion which may take place on an amendment the Taoiseach may well agree that it would be useful to have some discussions on general improvements in the system.</P>
    <P>In view of the need for consultations on the legislative change required now and the fact that time will be required for the matter to be dealt with in both Houses and for signature by the President, I will not press for the moving of the writ for the by-election in advance of the expiry of the four days' notice running from last Monday, which could leave a very tight time scale.  We want to be sure that the matter will go through both Houses and I seek the Taoiseach's assurance that the Seanad will be fully constituted in time to take the legislation before the by-election. We can leave time for that process if we move the writ after the expiry of the four days' notice next week.</P>

I reiterate that the way the system works often puts us in this false position and I repeat in a non-tendentious manner that I had to sit here all day yesterday and could have resolved the situation had the rules of order allowed it.  I was anxious to do so.  The Opposition will admit that as soon as we got an opportunity to resolve this situation in a constructive manner we availed of that opportunity.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to personation and a lot of partisan remarks have been made in regard to it.  The Fianna Fáil organisation maintain a very comprehensive system to prevent personation. That system is intended to work impartially and objectively.  We try to man polling booths to ensure to the greatest extent we can that there is no personation by anyone.  I want to give this assurance to the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad to have that assurance.  This Government are concerned to ensure that our laws are fully, fairly and impartially administered in respect of every citizen without fear or favour.  Nobody is above the law.  The officers appointed under our laws to discharge their functions and to execute the required procedures are completely independent in the exercise of their duties. This Government do not, and will never, interfere or attempt to interfere with the due process of law, particularly the criminal law.  This is a basic element of our democratic system and of the administration of justice and the Government are resolved to uphold that principle.</P>
      <P>I conclude by saying to Deputy FitzGerald that, of course, we will bring forward a draft amendment which we will discuss with the parties.  I do not believe we will have any difficulty in agreeing on the form of that amendment.  We will have it implemented into law in good time for the forthcoming by-election.  We will also be prepared to discuss in a constructive way with the parties in Opposition what other more far-reaching changes might be made, particularly in the areas outlined by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>It is a matter about which Fine Gael need not be unduly concerned if they decide to move the writ for the by-election today.  They should feel free to do so because I have no doubt that we can implement the legislation in good time for the by-election one way or another.</P>

    <Title>Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1982: From the Seanad (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The Dáil went into Committee to resume consideration of an amendment from the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the Committee do not agree with the Seanad in Amendment No. 1 to the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1982.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned last night I was replying to the point made by the Minister that there was a danger that the 7 per cent would become the norm rather than the ceiling figure.  That point was, rather oddly, taken up by Deputy Sherlock who announced last night on behalf of his party that if this matter comes to a vote he will vote with the Government.  In the past few days Deputy Sherlock's party have changed their name to The Workers Party to emphasise their concern for the workers and it seems extraordinary that three days later he should announce his intention to vote against a measure that seeks to put a ceiling on the amount of rent that can be charged for what are now controlled dwellings but which will become de-controlled after 25 August.</P>
      <P>Last night I gave an example of a landlord in Cork who owns 200 small terrace-type houses and who has been sending eviction notices to the tenants. These notices to quit have been drawn up by the landlord and have not been processed through the courts.  The tenants have been told they must leave if they do not pay rents that vary between £25 and £35 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy will help me by making this relevant to the 7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The landlord in question has been demanding rents of £25 to £35 per week but a similar type house was sold in the past 12 months for £14,000. That works out at less than a rent of £25 per week.  If the Bill does not provide a ceiling figure, it is possible that when tenants appeal to the District Court or to the tribunal they will be told that the amount being charged by the landlord is fair taking into consideration the criteria they must apply in assessing the rent.  In that case it will be in excess of the 7 per cent.  The Seanad sought to put a ceiling on what the courts would charge.  We are not saying that the courts must charge 7 per cent.  The amendment states that the gross rent shall not in any case exceed 7 per cent.  District Justices are accustomed to interpreting the law and they would <Col N="1758" /> read that as meaning precisely what it says.  It does not mean that the figure has to be 7 per cent or even 2 per cent but that the figure shall not exceed 7 per cent. The fear that it will become the norm in cases referred to the court is unjustified and the House should not take it as a serious threat.</P>
      <P>The other plank in the Minister's argument for rejecting the amendment was that it may be unconstitutional.  The Minister has a duty to try to introduce legislation in keeping with the Constitution. On two occasions legislation passed by this House in good faith was found to be unconstitutional by the courts.  It is only a matter of opinion whether a clause such as this would be constitutional or unconstitutional. That is a matter for the court to decide.</P>
      <P>In many other areas we control prices and they are not appealed to the courts as being against the Constitution.  A wide range of legislation controls prices in other areas.  I am thinking of price controls in relation to drink and tobacco which are subject to maximum price orders but, for instance, tobacco manufacturers have not appealed to the courts when the Government did not allow them what they considered a fair market price. They have not taken their case to court with the plea that the legislation controlling their prices is unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>The duty of the legislators is to protect the people.  When we control the price of tobacco we do so to protect the users of the product, and the same applies with regard to control of house prices. Tobacco manufacturers have not appealed to the courts to declare unconstitutional legislation controlling the price of their product.  When a fair return is being given to the property owners I do not believe the court would uphold an appeal against this section as being unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My opinion and that of lawyers on this side of the House who examined this amendment, is that it is constitutional and would stand up if appealed in court.  The Minister is probably getting different and opposite advice from the lawyers in his Department and the Attorney General's <Col N="1759" /> Office.  It is reasonable for this House to tell one group of lawyers we are rejecting their advice because it does not protect tenants and that we are accepting other advice, even though it comes from the other side of the House, because we are told the amendment is not in breach of the Constitution and is a protection for the tenants who come under this legislation.</P>
    <P>This matter was debated very fully and fairly in the Seanad &mdash; a number of people contributed, including the Minister, Senator S. O'Leary, Senator Robinson, Senator Whitaker and others &mdash; and they made a very sound case for this amendment.  Therefore I believe we should accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a number of points on what I see as an effort to introduce obscurantist legislation. This amendment is quite clearly unconstitutional.  There is nothing sacred about the advice given by Fine Gael lawyers to their front bench Deputies.  In this instance the advice received by their Deputy Leader is wrong.  This amendment is clearly discriminatory.  Of course we want to do the best we can for the tenants but we also have an obligation to the landlords.  This is what democracy is about.  We have to ensure that both parties are given a fair deal.  Naturally one's inclination is to assist those we consider to be the weaker party, namely the tenants. In my view this amendment was put down in a fit of pique by some maverick Senator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it was not put down in good faith.  That is why I ask the deputy leader of the Fine Gael Party to withdraw the amendment and to recognise that the advice he got from his lawyer pals is wrong.  I have spoken to lawyers &mdash; and they could not be described as Fianna Fáil lawyers &mdash; about this amendment and they are satisfied that the legislation proposed by the main Opposition party is discriminatory.  We are not in the business of introducing legislation which discriminates against one or both parties.  We are here to proclaim our intention of putting through this House legislation based on justice and equity and I do not believe this amendment measures up to justice and equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the original Bill which was introduced as a short-term urgent measure to afford some protection to tenants who are facing what could be a very vulnerable situation, and I intend to vote against the amendment because I believe it would not be in the best interests of the tenants.</P>
      <P>I have listened to the arguments for and against this amendment and found myself in agreement with the very clear arguments put forward by the Minister, particularly the view that once a maximum is fixed, sooner or later&mdash;and I believe in this case it would very much sooner&mdash;that maximum becomes the norm.  I have no doubt that if 7 per cent became the norm this could weigh very heavily on a great number of tenants and would not be in their best interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some speakers for the amendment agreed that if it is passed it could result in the 7 per cent becoming the norm and they felt there was no great difficulty about this.  Other speakers also in favour of the amendment contradicted that statement.  That confusion among those supporting the amendment has, if anything, strengthened my resolve to vote <Col N="1761" /> against it.  I do not intend to delay the House further but, as the previous speaker said, there does not seem to have been a great deal of thought put into this amendment and its only result so far has been to delay a very badly needed measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the measure is badly needed but it has not delayed the measure.  This is not a short-term measure. The short-term measure is already law and is effective until 25 August and we have until that date to see that the best legislation possible goes through this House.  This is the long-term measure.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gregory and Deputy D. Andrews said this was an ill-conceived, badly thought out, rushed amendment in the Seanad and he referred to a maverick Senator.  Outside the language which the Chair rightly corrected him about, it is no function of any Deputy to criticise a Member of either House in such language. I pointed this out to the Minister last night because he did the same thing outside these Houses.  If one uses such language one lets down oneself, one's party, and diminishes the respect the ordinary people have for this House and for the Seanad.  The Minister was even more hypocritical than Deputy Andrews because he attacked Senator O'Leary outside this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to deal with one or two points.  We are wrapping up this legislation and obviously the Government have wrapped up the Independent votes, so why delay the agony much longer?  Once this Bill becomes law, in the vast majority of cases the tenants will be worse off than they are at present. With very few exceptions rents will increase and tenants will be worse off because the Minister, with the skill he has acquired over many years, has succeeded in dumping on the shoulders of the unfortunate Department of Social Welfare the responsibility to administer the rescue system which is designed to pick up the pieces when this regrettable Bill has been forced upon the House because of an interpretation of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to go over old ground. We are all beginning to sound like long-playing records.  I presume Uachtarán na hÉireann will be reading this debate and consulting with the Council of State on the Bill.  In view of the learned contribution made by the humble backbencher, as he described himself, on the top row of the Fianna Fáil benches about the constitutionality of section 13, the <Col N="1764" /> Government's interpretation or the one put forward by Senator O'Leary, it is reasonable and proper for me to request the President to have due regard to the frequent references to constitutionality by the Minister in his opening speech, by the deputy leader of Fine Gael and by others, and to try to get this matter clarified. We are probably within the timetable to get a referral to the Supreme Court and to get a decision back from them before the third temporary short-term Bill expires.  I accept that the Minister has indicated that it is very tight. Perhaps the judges could come to a fairly quick conclusion in view of the fact that already it has been argued in substance. We will be supporting this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go over all the constitutional arguments which were made last night and my reservations on the constitutional validity of this amendment.  My fear, and the fear which has been accepted by a number of speakers, including Deputy Quinn, is that, rather than being a ceiling which is the intention behind the amendment, the 7 per cent will very rapidly become the norm.  That would be to the detriment of the weaker parties involved, the tenants. For that reason I continue to reject this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>In many ways this was a unique budget.  I do not think any Member of the House should forget that this is the fifth successive budget introduced by the fifth different Minister for Finance.  During those five budgets we have had three Governments.  If one examines the philosophy, if one can so describe it, of those budgets one finds they are quite different and none of them succeeded in any way in tackling the fundamental problems besetting our economy.  The one thing that must be said about this budget, the March budget of this year, is that it was a budget of lost opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was an unique budget in more than one sense because it was brought about because of Deputy Bruton's defeated <Col N="1768" /> budget in January and it came about as a result of a general election result which changed the Government.  I believe that the political and financial cost of the general election held in February would have been well justified if the budget introduced by Deputy MacSharry, Minister for Finance, had been different.  The changes that were made were largely superficial and I shall discuss the effect of those changes on the January budget.  I wish to remind the Minister for Finance and other Deputies that they cannot claim from the election result to have obtained a mandate from the electorate to act as they have acted in bringing in their budget and particularly to act as they have acted ever since.</P>
    <P>I shall not claim that Fine Gael had a moral victory in the recent election but it is important that Deputies, particularly Fianna Fáil Deputies, bear in mind that the Fine Gael Party increased their vote in the election and achieved the greatest vote they ever achieved in the history of the State.  That was an extraordinary occurrence given that the January budget was the most difficult budget ever introduced. In fact when the election campaign was fought on that budget the electorate responded to the leadership they had received from the Coalition Government over the seven or eight months they were in office and were prepared to follow that leadership.  Indeed in the days immediately after the January budget Fianna Fáil initially reacted quite differently from the way the electorate would have found acceptable.  Having canvassed a few houses they read the signs reasonably well.  They changed their tack and Deputy O'Donoghue who had recently been brought back as Fianna Fáil spokesman on Finance recognised that financial rectitude had become popular. It was ironic that he should come back into that position because he was probably the one person who could easily be identified with the man who made financial rectitude unpopular in 1977 and in the years immediately following.</P>
    <P>The result of the election shows that the electorate wanted to see our economic problems dealt with.  I think everybody who canvassed door to door in the <Col N="1769" /> election would readily admit that it was on everybody's tongue that our borrowing, particularly our foreign borrowing was a disgrace, that the benefits we were to achieve from the foreign borrowing were not there to be seen and that people were very dissatisfied and very concerned and fearful of what would happen in the future.  When Deputy MacSharry introduced his budget he gave the appearance of concern and caution and indeed was not to dismiss the necessity for financial rectitude.  He got his budget through the House and for a few weeks afterwards seemed to be satisfied it would remain that way, that things seemed to be all right.  This was before the PRSI issue erupted and before Independent Members who had found it a &ldquo;well-balanced and fair budget&rdquo; decided to change their minds about it.  When people began to examine the budget it was seen that all was not as clear as it seemed to be and the PRSI revolt occurred and protest marches were threatened and Independent Deputies were coming on radio and television saying that they were not satisfied, that they did not really understand it when it went throught in the budget and that they wanted to change their position.</P>
    <P>Even then for a few days the Minister for Finance stuck his heels in and said that there would not be any change; that perhaps there might be a change when he received the report from the Commission on Taxation but certainly not before then.  That was the position he adopted. Then, lo and behold, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions meet the Taoiseach and a new tax allowance costing the country £45 million is announced to pay for alterations the intention of which would be to reduce for people on high incomes the PRSI contribution they must pay.</P>
    <P>It is no surprise that every national newspaper described almost with incredulity the Government's climb-down. One newspaper said it was not a climb-down, that it was a total collapse.  Editorials spoke of the fact that the Government were not able to govern, that they were running from crisis to crisis and in one newspaper article, published I think last Sunday, they used the phrase which <Col N="1770" /> I rather like, that &ldquo;good time Charlie&rdquo; was back.  I think that is really what it is all about.</P>
    <P>The very sad thing about the budget is that the effort which was made during the previous eight months has been lost.  Public opinion was mobilised and the electorate were willingly prepared to suffer sacrifices.  They recognised that we had economic problems, they wanted to see them resolved and they were prepared to make the necessary sacrifices.  They wanted to see a Government that were prepared to say to them: &ldquo;This is not nice, it is difficult but it is necessary, it is in the national interest and must be done&rdquo;.  Provided the Irish electorate are satisfied that whatever Government are in power, a Fianna Fáil Government or a Coalition Government, will conduct themselves like that, they are prepared to say they are happy with the Government.</P>
    <P>The results of the election prove this point.  The Fine Gael Party actually increased their vote.  I am not claiming any moral victory nor am I making anything out of it like the Taoiseach did when he complained about losing the election last June because of the proportional representation system.  The reason Fine Gael lost the election was that they fouled up their organisation in about four constituencies. It is not appropriate for me to go through those constituencies but it is apparent to anybody who has carefully analysed the results or who watched developments in the media during the course of the election campaign that that is the only reason there was a change of Government.  I wish Fianna Fáil well in Government because the country needs a decent Government.  I do not know if they will get it, Fianna Fáil should bear in mind that the electorate were satisfied with the government they were getting before the general election.  That is the only result one can read into the polling returns after last February's election.</P>
    <P>People in business, older people who are settled in their lives or older people who are unemployed have mellowed. The businessman can batten down the hatches and reckon he can pull through; the middle-aged person who is unemployed, <Col N="1771" /> although depressed, at least recognises that it may be best to take those things philosophically and the older people who are not very well off although they have the worry of old age are wiser and perhaps better able to deal with the type of problems that economic difficulties can face them with.  Young educated people who are aware of the shenanigans behind the dancing that has gone on by the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the Government since the budget, are in despair that nobody cares for them or for their future.</P>
    <P>I want to nail the lie regularly written by one <i>Irish Times</i> correspondent, who claims that the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, preferred to run an economy rather than a country. That is all very fine when things are going right but our economy has gone beyond a situation where one could make any claim like that.  The reality is that the dreadful state of our economy is damaging the country.  If John Healy, the correspondent in question, has any doubts about this let him ask the thousands of young Irish people who are unemployed and ask the very poor people who have very little hope to look forward to, when they see what is going on at present, what they think.  Perhaps he can come back then and talk about running the country and running the economy.</P>
    <P>The situation of young people and those who are deprived will get worse if our economy is not brought under control. We cannot afford more taxation. We have reached saturation point.  All the money we have borrowed and all the taxation we take from the public is not delivering the type of services and the type of goods the electorate want.  They are dissatisfied with what they are getting. Despite that we have within the community a growing pocket of people who are neglected and will continue to be neglected.  I am speaking particularly of young people who cannot get work.</P>
    <P>There is not a great deal of difference between the two budgets we have had this year.  I want to talk about some of the differences because a lot of nonsense is being spoken about them.  There were <Col N="1772" /> three major facets of Deputy Bruton's budget which caused offence to Fianna Fáil, the VAT imposition on clothing and footwear, the food subsidies and the taxation of short-term social welfare benefits. There has been so much talk in the House over the years about food subsidies by Governments who introduced them and took them away and Oppositions howling when things like that were done, that there is very little one can say about them.  Nobody likes introducing a tax or removing a subsidy because it is not the popular thing to do at the particular moment.  Fine Gael have introduced them a lot more often than Fianna Fáil have done.  Fianna Fáil have removed them more times than Fine Gael have done.  The boot has been on both sides of the House.  The only thing I can say is that in the future the boot will be on the other foot so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned.  We must bear in mind that it is highly questionable if food subsidies benefit the people who really need to benefit.  I accept that Fianna Fáil would have been foolish not to grab that as a good election platform.  If the Coalition Government recognise that there would be an election immediately following the budget they might not have gone for the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>I believe the VAT imposition on clothing and footwear deserves more scrutiny because I believe it is a mistake that that tax was not introduced.  I preface my remarks by saying nobody likes to introduce a tax but we are not living in times when we can simply do what we like despite the fact that many Members of the Government seem to think we can. A clothing tax is a very emotional thing. Now that the election is over perhaps we could look at this more closely.  We hear a lot of talk about clothing and footwear being a necessity and they should not be taxed.  I am not sure that the presumption of necessity is fair.  When one sees shoes being sold at from £40 to £70 a pair, items of clothing sold at £100, £150 and £200, and in sales fur coats reduced from £2,500 to £2,000, one must wonder that goods of that nature can be purchased without the imposition of one penny in taxation. When one goes to buy a pint, a newspaper, <Col N="1773" /> a gallon of petrol or almost anything else, one is subjected to tax.  I do not accept the argument that because clothing is necessary it should not be taxed.  A lot of things that are necessary are taxed. I do not see why clothing or footwear should be any different from anything else.</P>
    <P>Up to 70 per cent of all the clothing bought here is imported.  We cannot apply duties on imported goods for obvious reasons, membership of the EEC and other trade agreements, but we should do everything we can, when taking our balance of payments problem into consideration, to try to control that.  It does not seem to make a lot of sense not to have tax imposed on clothing when so much of it is imported.  It is widely accepted that a tax on clothing is a progressive tax because the higher the income one has the greater the percentage of one's salary one spends on clothes. The most expensive clothes are purchased by the people with the highest incomes and the most expensive clothes purchased here are imported clothes.  It seems to make good sense to tax clothing.</P>
    <P>I say this with no disrespect to people in the trade.  I understand there is a massive mark-up in the retail clothing industry, 100 to 150 per cent.  This seems to me to be an area, with that type of mark-up, which is ripe for taxation.  I suspect that people in the clothing industry would not agree with me in relation to that.  There were two arguments against clothing tax which one has to consider seriously, one of which is employment.  That seems serious enough on the face of it but when one thinks about it, it is a spurious enough argument because any tax which is introduced must have the effect of dampening employment prospects.  In difficult economic times it must have the effect of causing unemployment.  If one makes inquiries from either the drink trade or the motor trade about the effects of taxation in recent years one will ascertain that the result has been a drop off in employment and this is true also of most other trades.</P>
    <P>The claim by Fianna Fáil that 5,000 people would have lost their jobs because of what we were proposing was simply <Col N="1774" /> rubbish.  It was a claim that Fianna Fáil were not able to substantiate.  I understand from inquiries I have made from the CII and other quarters that the true figure would have been fewer than 1,000. I have no wish to see anyone lose his job but we must examine the situation in the context of what happened elsewhere and I will be dealing in a few moments with what Fianna Fáil proposed by way of making up the money they were losing by not imposing a clothing tax.</P>
    <P>There is only one argument that is valid about not imposing a clothing tax and that is that there are some people, particularly those on low incomes and those with large families who could be affected badly by such a tax, but my answer to that is that those people should be subsidised in some way.  We have a problem generally in regard to our very expensive social welfare system in that money does not always seem to go to those who need it most.  I would argue that the income credit tax system which was proposed by the Coalition but abandoned by Fianna Fáil, together with the child benefit situation plus the payment of £9.60 per week to wives working at home, would have come readily to the assistance of those who are worst off.  Perhaps more was needed and, if so, it should have been delivered; but the mere fact that some people would have been put in difficulty was not a sufficient reason to abandon a tax.  It would cost only a fraction of the overall revenue generated to cushion those people who would be affected by the tax.</P>
    <P>However, that was not good enough for Fianna Fáil and they decided on the gimmick of asking industry to pay at an earlier date their VAT liabilities on imports and also their corporation tax liabilities.  The VAT revenue of £140 million is, with the exception of, say, £40 million in respect of goods that can be disposed of quickly, a permanent loan to the Government.  This £100 million will have to be carried by the manufacturing industry particularly since they import raw materials and must now pay the VAT within 15 days of importation.  They must process, market and sell the goods before they can get the VAT back and that may <Col N="1775" /> involve up to six months.  They will be out of pocket to the tune of £100 million for that time.  That is why I say the money involved is a permanent loan to the Government, a loan that goes way beyond this year and next year.</P>
    <P>If all this money is to be borrowed on the Irish market what will be the effect on interest rates?  Surely it will have the effect of increasing them.  We know that interest rates are at an all-time high and we do not appear to be able to lower them.  I believe that to be as a result of our weak currency, that people are afraid to borrow abroad unless they have a guarantee from the Government on the exchange risk.  Another £100 million taken from the home market must increase interest rates from their present 21 and 22 per cent levels unless the Government decide to take the exchange risk on themselves, but what happens then is that industry becomes an agent for foreign borrowing by the Government.  This exacerbates the problem and renders the budget farcical.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the consequences on employment of the imposition on industry of this £100 million.  In other words, industry will fail to invest the £100 million which they might otherwise have to invest.  They must either borrow this money or take it from cash reserves and I do not think that they have cash reserves.  The IDA reckon that the capital cost of a job is about £19,000.  That is high even allowing for the fact that they are at the de luxe end of the market.  The CII in their Newsletter of 1 December claimed that £20 million was the equivalent of 3,000 jobs.  That means that £6,500 represents one job.  It is a fair average to take a figure of £10,000 capital cost as equalling one job.  This means that 10,000 jobs must be lost to industry because of £100 million being taken out.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how the Government can stand over their argument against the Coalition's proposals for a clothing tax costing, at the Government's exaggerated figure, 5,000 jobs, when their own proposals will result in depriving the industry of £100 million and must <Col N="1776" /> therefore result ultimately in the loss of 10,000 jobs to industry.</P>
    <P>All that can be said of the Fianna Fáil budget is that it is massively anti-business and anti-employment.  Though they looked after their friends in the construction industry, the Government must accept that while some jobs may be generated in that sphere this will not go any way towards compensating for all the damage that will be done right across the board to industry because of the proposals in relation to VAT.  There is no hope in the budget for younger people who are unemployed.  Despite all the lip service paid during the election campaign by Fianna Fáil to employment prospects for young people, there is no hope on this front so far as the budget is concerned. Indeed, I would argue that the budget provisions make the employment position considerably worse for young people.  One can only have the greatest sympathy with young people, with those who are poor and with those who are not organised to go out on the streets and shout loud enough to bring about action from the Government, as some sectional interests are able to do, interests who are in a position to deal with Good Time Charlie.</P>
    <P>There are some very fundamental problems in our society.  Apart from the problem of unemployment there is the problem of poverty.  Despite the existence of an expensive social welfare system every Member of this House will be aware from his constituency work as well as from various reports that are available that there is the real problem of poverty. We seem to be unable to provide sustenance and support on the scale necessary to help those concerned.</P>
    <P>There is the major problem of foreign borrowing.  We have a very high level of taxation and we seem to have an electorate who do not relate high taxation and foreign borrowing to the services they continue to demand.  There is also general lack of incentive to work.  There is absenteeism from work.  We have very considerable participation in black economy.  There is a loss of competitiveness in industrial production.  All of these factors appear to be the symptom of some <Col N="1777" /> similar disease.  One cannot find that any of the last five budgets and particularly the one we are talking about has made any serious attempt to deal with any of these problems.  Deputy Bruton, as Minister, attempted in different respects to deal with some of them and there were promises from previous Ministers of Finance that something would be done about the situation but on this occasion the reverse has been the case.</P>
    <P>I cannot propose solutions for all our problems but it is time that we took a hold of ourselves and looked at everything we are doing.  With all the borrowing that has gone on and the massive increases in public expenditure one must stop and ask the question, as people in the street are beginning to ask; &ldquo;What have we seen&rdquo;&mdash; for example from 1977 to 1982 &mdash;&ldquo;for the phenomenal borrowing spree or the increases in taxation?&rdquo; There is only one conclusion one could come to and that is that we have many more people employed in the public service. Without denying or begrudging what they are getting the people in the public sector are being paid a lot more than those in the private sector.  It should be remembered that 25 per cent of our work force is in the public service.  Their pay and pensions amount to £2.1 billion per annum and it takes 50 per cent of all our tax revenue to pay for this.  Increases in numbers employed in the public service far outstrips increases in numbers employed in the private sector and wages in the public sector have far outstripped wages in the private sector.  I have no objection to that but I pose the question: what have we gained from it?</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the various services that are on offer.  The Health budget is a very big one but can we say that we are any healthier or that there are fewer people going to hospital?  In fact, the contrary seems to be the case.  It seems extraordinary but there are many more people claiming short-term sickness benefit than a few years ago, so much so that doctors have expressed alarm about the situation.  Reports are being published about it.  We do not appear to be any healthier.  Can we say that we have <Col N="1778" /> engaged in any form of campaign of preventive medicine that has proved itself worthwhile?  I do not think there is a scintilla of evidence to suggest that.  I should make it clear that I am not in any way referring to the quality of those working in the public service.  I do not have anything to complain about in regard to those working in the public service, those concerned with security, education or the local authorities.  I am sure they are doing the best they can and many of them operate under very difficult circumstances.  However, we are responsible for the cash of the country and we must examine the returns we get for that expenditure.  It is my view that returns from services are highly questionable taking into consideration the amount of money that is spent.</P>
    <P>The education budget has been massively increased in recent years but there has not been any significant reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been any significant reduction when one adds together the tens of millions of pounds that have been spent on education.  I should like to ask, in relation to education, if the right people have been benefiting from all the expenditure on education or have the people who can afford to pay, or pay more, been drawing the benefits from it?  I am not blaming the former Minister for Education for this but the reality is there: we spend a lot of money on higher education but can we say honestly that the disadvantaged in our community have had an opportunity to get there as a result of the millions of pounds we have spent?  I do not think that is the case.  Can we say honestly that our national schools are more presentable than they were?  Are we satisfied with the conditions of those schools?  We have seen television programmes about the disgraceful condition of national schools behind the Minister's former headquarters.  Can we say that more money has been provided to maintain them?  The reality is that it has not been made available.  The bulk of the money <Col N="1779" /> has gone to employing new staff, not all teachers, and to meet a massive increase in wages.  Is the quality of the service significantly better?  I do not think it is.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Garda the force size increased between 1977 and 1981 by 17 per cent but the crime rate has soared and the detection rate is down.  I am not blaming the Garda for that.  As a solicitor I understand the frustrations the Garda have in trying to deal with their difficult job but we have pumped that money in and we must ask if we have got a return. I do not think so.</P>
      <P>Can we say that we have better roads? Are our communications any better or is our infrastructure any better?  The reality is that they are not.  We should not cod ourselves.  The fact is that the politics of profligacy have benefited the country damnably.  This generation of politicians got the country largely debt free, a country that had gone a long way towards bringing under control the problem of emigration.  We were able to employ people.  What are we about to pass on to the next generation?  We are passing on a country that is up to its neck in hock, a country that cannot employ people and is rejecting tens of thousands of people annually.  We are passing on a country that has a fierce problem in regard to poverty and cannot deal with it.  We have a community which seems to have developed very selfish habits and seems unconcerned about cost.  I do not think the community can be blamed all the time for that.  In my view politicians have helped considerably in leading people to believe that all is possible in our little country, that we never have to count the cost, that Knock airports can be built and justified and more of the like.  What has been neglected in all this spending?  I should like to highlight some of the things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am chairman of North Tipperary County Council and we have had our estimates meeting and our special housing and sanitary services meetings.  We are all aware that our roads are the greatest national asset we have.  Even though we complain a lot about them in terms of capital expenditure if we were to build <Col N="1780" /> them now from scratch they would cost a lot of money.  The county manager in North Tipperary was asked to estimate the value of the road system in his area. At the end of December last we had 1,738 miles of road and the county manager estimated the capital value at £100 million. We have been getting so little money for roads in that area in the last few years that there is nothing new we can do about them but we are concerned about retaining and maintaining the road structure we have.  Unfortunately, in common with many other councils, our roads are getting worse.  The potholes are now so big that the foundation of the roads are beginning to give way.  In the course of a report to the council the county manager stated:</P>
    <P>It is clear that much more money would need to be spent to keep this extremely valuable asset in a proper state.  To do so requires substantially greater investment for all types of road.</P>
    <P>The county manager then referred to a report of the acting county engineer which stated that:</P>
    <P>The lagging of funds allocated behind increased costs has resulted in a continuously widening gap between the required level of maintenance, including surface dressing, and that which can be achieved with the limited funds available.</P>
    <P>The county manager continued:</P>
    <P>The current attainable cycle for the surface dressing of county roads is 15 years while the desirable cycle is nine years.</P>
    <P>Therefore, just to maintain our roads we need to resurface them every nine years but we only have enough money to carry out that work every 15 years.  The consequence for our roads is plain for everybody to see.  They will get worse until they ultimately collapse.  When that happens we will have lost far more of the £100 million than can be imagined now. That problem must be arising throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The sanitary services area is not often <Col N="1781" /> identified as being important but in my view it is.  There will not be any orderly development of any area, particularly a rural area or an area near a town unless there is a water supply scheme and a sewerage scheme.  In North Tipperary we have 32 schemes for construction listed on our priority list.  In relation to that the county manager stated:</P>
    <P>The cost of completing the first ten schemes on the priority list, including the two regional water supply schemes for Nenagh and Thurles, would be of the order of £16,500,000 which, if based on the level of capital allocation received in 1981, would take about 22 years to construct.</P>
    <P>That means that one-third of our plans on present levels of allocation will take 22 years to complete.  What hope is there to get houses built for our young population with that sort of financial provision and all the talk we have heard from the Taoiseach about the importance of borrowing to invest in the future of our country and infrastructure?  That is all rubbish because the reality is that the Government while in power over four years completely ignored local authority spending on the capital side, housing, sanitary services and roads.</P>
    <P>The awful waste in the country has been spoken about by enough people and I do not wish to go into detail on it.  I am concerned about my time allocation and wonder about how much time is left to me?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other things I wish to say which are of importance.  We must bear in mind this massive waste. Over £100 million spent on the attempted eradication of bovine diseases has been lost.  We have not advanced one iota in our campaign, because of bad management and bad expenditure.  This is not the occasion to ask why, but the scheme has not worked and this should be known.  The responsibility for the bad management is not just with the Department of Agriculture, the vets or the farmers. <Col N="1782" /> The responsibility lies with the Members of this House who vote these moneys to see that they are properly spent.  The money has been spent over years and it should have been possible to identify the mistakes which were made and arrest them.  These mistakes are, unfortunately, still being made and millions of pounds are being spent on that scheme.</P>
      <P>Expenditure under the heading of the NET plant in Marino, Cork, is £137 million for 1980.  I will not detail everything that happened in that connection, but that situation developed over a few years. The promoters of the plant, extraordinarily, did not always tell the Government, or the Government Department, everything that they should know.  There was a lack of communication about something which ultimately cost £137 million. This plant was to lose millions of pounds every year and it is to have the benefit of a subsidised rate for our national gas from Kinsale.  This is mind-boggling.</P>
      <P>CIE, a semi-State body, are losing £100 million every year.  There have been three consultants' reports in this connection. The second-last Minister responsible, Deputy Reynolds, asked for a debate in the country.  He wanted a debate anywhere but in this House.  He was not prepared to indicate what his decision would be.  I make no apologies, when we were in power we did not do it either. This was the third consultants' report, which cost a fortune.  I am not complaining about CIE employees &mdash; I understand that the morale there is very low, because they do not know what has happened. However, we cannot have this situation continuing, with no plans being made and nobody deciding what is going to happen. We lack either the inclination or the courage to face up to the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that there is difficulty in cutting back on public expenditure.  What is really necessary is responsibility in Government. You must have public opinion behind you and no effort is being made by this Government to get this.  The Knock airport is a notorious scandal.  The conduct of the Minister for Finance since the budget has disimproved.  I have to say that.  He had a facade of concern when reading his budget statement to the <Col N="1783" /> House some weeks ago.  Indeed, a lot of people believe he did a good job, better than that done by Deputy Bruton.  His budget did not seem to be quite as stinging as the previous one, but at that time people did not appreciate the size of the PRSI bite.  People have not yet appreciated the proposed reduction in the standard rate of tax band.  It was wrong of the Minister to hit the width of the standard rate of tax band, at the same time knowing that the PRSI increase was so significant. That was a bad mistake.  However, that was a choice which he had to make. But even he did not appreciate the consequences of his PRSI proposals.</P>
    <P>I do not know how one should judge what the Minister has done.  The utter inconsistency and total collapse of the position he adopted do a great deal of damage so far as mobilising public opinion is concerned.  People now recognise that, if you demand and threaten, you will get your way with Good Time Charlie. However, you have to be well organised to do that.  The poor, the blind, and widows are not well organised and do not succeed that much.  People who have jobs, many with good and secure jobs and unions behind them and who pay pay-related social insurance, are organised and can succeed.  In fact, the increase in the PRSI is not sufficient to pay for all the benefits which the PRSI-paying people will get in the course of the next 12 months.  As I understand it &mdash; perhaps the Minister or someone wlse will be able to correct or advise me on this &mdash; the whole PRSI fund is 25 per cent lower than is necessary to pay all the demands which the PRSI claimants make on that fund.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that our taxation levels are very high and people will not take any more.  I understand and accept the frustration of the PRSI sector who are faced with this further theft, as they would call it, from their wage packages every week.  What I do not accept is that it is right for a Minister to say that he will credit them with £45 million which he will find somewhere else, without saying where he will find it other than general taxation and savings, and Fianna Fáil <Col N="1784" /> have never been good at savings.  No indication has been given of who has to pay this £45 million.  Is it right that people outside the PRSI scheme, some of whom are not working, will have to pay for this? Is that fair?  I frankly do not think so.  It is not fair to put this extra on cigarettes, drink, or anything else.  I acknowledge that PRSI is very high and I do not know if it is being spent to our best advantage. I would remind the Minister that there is evidence of very considerable waste there.  Concerning short social welfare sickness benefits, for example, a report was published by the Economic and Social Research Institute in January of this year, authored by Gerald Hughes.  I quote from this report:</P>
    <P>During the last 25 years the number of spells of illness for each insured person has doubled and the number of working days lost per person insured has increased by three-quarters.</P>
    <P>I quote now from another part of this publication:</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the 1950s, absence from work due to sickness in Ireland was not exceptional by international standards, nor was its rate of increase exceptional up to the end of the 1960s.  During the 1970s, however, the rate of increase in the frequency and duration of certified incapacity way exceptional, compared with Britain and Northern Ireland and at the end of the 1970s the absence rate in the Republic was slightly higher than in Northern Ireland and nearly double the British rate.</P>
    <P>Effectively, this report established beyond all doubt that we are getting sicker and sicker on a short-term basis in this country as the years go on.  It also indicates that this situation seems to be associated with the fact that one is well paid when one goes sick.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of a report published by Dr. Andrew Rynne, a medical practitioner who set out to examine this extraordinary increase in short-time illness. The Irish Medical Association have been concerned about this for some time and they reckon that many of the shortness <Col N="1785" /> term absences are due to socio-economic, rather than medical, reasons.</P>
    <P>Dr. Rynn's report was published a few weeks ago and he concluded that 25 per cent of people in receipt of disability benefit are &mdash; I use his words &mdash;&ldquo;dossers&rdquo;. There is nothing wrong with them at all. The cost to the State is £36 million per annum, or £3 million per month.  I quote from Dr. Rynne's publication:</P>
    <P>Anyone paying PRSI can claim to have a back ache or anaemia and draw certificates without the slightest difficulty. The chances of them being brought before a referee after three months is minimal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the precise title of the publication, but it is a report published by Dr. Rynne.  I expect that it was published by the Irish Medical Association. I should have known this.  The point was also made by Dr. Rynne that national health insurance certificates are signed by nurses, doctors' receptionists and other non-medical people.  It appears that the whole system is fouled with abuse and waste.  There are 220,000 medical certificates going into the Department every month and there are only 15 referee doctors.  General practitioners are in a position where they are unable to refuse medical certificates because there is no independent second opinion to which doctors can refer a patient who is complaining of back ache and which the doctor cannot diagnose as being there or not. If there was an independent referee the doctor might be able to stop somebody making a fraudulent claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Doctor Rynne estimated that if 50 doctors were employed on a referee panel by the Department the matter could be brought under control.  He also suggested that short-term social welfare benefits, if taxed, would help to bring this problem under control.  We recall that Deputy Bruton in his January budget proposed taxation of short-term social welfare benefits but Fianna Fáil, for some reason, <Col N="1786" /> found this unacceptable.  It is strange that they found it so unacceptable because in the budget speech of 1978 the then Minister for Finance identified this as a growing problem and felt something should be done about it.  In the 1979 Finance Bill there was a section covering the whole problem of taxation of short-term social welfare benefits and making provision for it.  In 1980 when &ldquo;Good Time Charlie&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When Deputy Haughey became Taoiseach for the first time that proposal disappeared.  In the budget debate at that time Deputy O'Kennedy stated at columns 726-727, Volume 318 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>The Government have been reconsidering the planned taxation of short-term social welfare benefits from 6 April next, which was provided for last year.  The new tax exemption which I have proposed for those on lower incomes would reduce any revenue gain from the effects of making short-term social welfare benefits taxable and, moreover, the new tax structure will improve the incentive to work.  In these circumstances the Government have come to the conclusion that the proposals should not be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was saying at that time that, if there was any evidence of abuse, short-term social welfare benefits should be taxed.  In case anybody thinks I am a miserable soul who wants to tax social welfare benefits, he should not forget that widows' pensions are taxed, old age pensions and any long-term social welfare benefits are also taxed.  The incredible thing is that the reason people seek disability benefits is to avoid going into a higher tax bracket or to get back tax. <Col N="1787" /> They not only get their short-term pay-related benefit, they also get back tax.  I do not think that is fair to people who work all the time and have to pay for this. The PRSI lobby should be reminded that there are millions of pounds wasted on people who are abusing the system.  Dr. Rynne estimated the figure at £36 million. Taxation of short-term social welfare benefits would bring in £10 million and there seems to be a great justice in doing this.  Those two sums added together make a total of £46 million.  I wonder why the Minister, Deputy MacSharry, did not see fit to eliminate waste in the PRSI system and save £46 million which he now must find elsewhere in taxation.  Is it because he is cowardly?</P>
    <P>When I was canvassing in the recent election&mdash;and I am sure other Deputies had the same experience&mdash;I was hounded about people abusing social welfare.  It will develop into a major issue and we have the responsibility to see that the system is not abused.  I do not want to see people prosecuted or going to jail but I find it hard to blame them for abusing the system because it seems that politicians are playing a part in it and are happy that it should occur.  We should design systems which will not be an incentive for people to stay out of work.</P>
    <P>Mr. Con Power of the Confederation of Irish Industry claimed that in the four to six weeks before the end of the tax year the applications for disability benefits soar.  He said in some cases the level of absenteeism reached a level of 20 per cent during that period.  We have a responsibility in this area which we are not discharging.  We have a similar responsibility in relation to tax evasion. We have taken some steps with regard to tax evasion but in all these areas people like to cheat the system and to operate in the black economy.  We have not made any effort to deal with this problem.  I do not believe that the Minister for Finance, when preparing his budget speech, really thought about all our problems, it was simply a question of balancing the books for the next 12 months.  That type of approach is something we can no longer afford to follow because people are <Col N="1788" /> beginning to wonder what politicians are doing.  They are asking why we are so much in debt, why our taxation is so high and what we are getting for it.  We must mobilise opinion behind us.  The tragedy of the performances of the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach since the budget means that we have lost something which was built up.  It was accepted that we had economic problems, that the Government had to deal with them and that whatever Government were in power deserved the support of the people in dealing with these problems.  We must face up to the reality and we should be discussing these problems a great deal more than we do at present.  Each member of this House has a responsibility to keep a check on how money is spent.  I hope that the paper published by the last Minister for Finance, &ldquo;Better Way to Manage the Nation's Finances&rdquo; will be put into effect because if that is done people will not be able to stand up here and criticise taxation and at the same time demand benefits.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies serves a very useful function in that regard and is worth &mdash; I say this with no disrespect&mdash;hundreds of sitting days of this House because it makes proposals in problem areas.  I cannot say it solves problems but at least there is great co-operation between members of different political parties.  I would ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to try to get public opinion behind them in their efforts to bring things under control.  We have a very young population and in many ways our problems are only starting because we are not able to provide them with housing, schools, hospitals or infrastructural requirements which are needed. Even if we never took on another person in the public service the cost of maintaining it will soar because, as civil servants retire, money will have to be found to pay their pensions.  I do not feel confident that the Government are going to tackle this problem.  Perhaps when the Dublin West by-election is over sanity will return but I fear that the Government have lulled themselves into a feeling that it is wrong to tell people the truth and wrong <Col N="1789" /> to face reality.  They do not know the difference between reality and the twilight zone in which they appear to be living.  I wish them a very short term in office, and even though none of us likes fighting election after election, if the Government are not prepared to face realities and to deal with the problems, they do not deserve to be in office and for the sake of the country and in the interests of the people they should leave that position.</P>

      <P>Many people have decried the sense of pessimism that was created by the previous Government.  I myself have done so on occasions, but until I listened to Deputy Molony I had not thought that the spreading of that philosophy had been so effective.  Here we have a young intelligent man, just starting out on his political career, obviously injected with large doses of pessimism.  He allowed it to surface right through his speech &mdash; there is no ray of hope, no rallying cry for young or old in any aspect of our national life.  This saddened me because I know Deputy Molony is capable of better than that.  I hope that sometime the evil effects of that injection of pessimism will wear off.</P>
      <P>I should begin my contribution to today's resumed budget debate by briefly reminding Deputies of the objectives and principal provisions of last month's budget.  It had, in summary, three principal objectives, namely, the stimulation of employment, the reduction of inflation and the alleviation of poverty.  I am surprised Deputy Molony did not advert to this.  Our budget is less inflationary than its predecessor.  The effect of this budget on the consumer price index will be to raise prices by 2¾ per cent; the Coalition's increase would have been 4¾ per cent. Our decisions to maintain food subsidies and to freeze all CIE city fares, among other things, reflect our concern to reduce householders' bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are stimulating employment directly by injecting an additional £50 million this year into building and construction in order to improve housing, education and sanitary services.  We also <Col N="1790" /> increased social welfare benefits by 25 per cent in order to improve in real terms the living standards of social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>Our purpose was to eliminate the effect of the Coalition's decision to increase VAT on clothes and shoes from zero to 18 per cent.  Deputy Molony treated rather cavalierly the whole question of employment, something which we were very concerned about.  All the representatives of the clothing and shoe industry, from manufacture to retailing, indicated that there would have been very heavy losses of jobs, but this was defeated when Deputy Bruton's budget was rejected here in January.  Notwithstanding the difficult state of the public finances, we decided that it was necessary to take these measures to improve employment and protect living standards.  We accomplished this without straying from the Coalition's own broad financial objectives. When introducing his budget last month, my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Ray MacSharry, indicated that we sought to reduce the current budget deficit for 1982 to £679 million and the total Exchequer borrowing requirement to £1,683 million.</P>
    <P>These remain our financial targets and they compare favourably with the Coalition's targets of £715 million and £1,661 million respectively.  When one takes into account the loss of the two months this year due to the defeat of the Coalition budget, it is no mean achievement to have been able to retain similar financial objectives.  The Opposition benches, as they would like the country to believe, do not have a monopoly on financial rectitude.</P>
    <P>As first Government speaker in the resumed budget debate, it is appropriate for me to comment on the recent decision by the Government to provide a special tax allowance of £312 this year for workers paying the full rate of PRSI.  At the outset I should say that since the increased PRSI rates were applied some weeks ago, much of the comment, I feel, has been rather unbalanced.  The immediate reaction seemed to be one of dismay, even anger, among many of our citizens at the reductions in take-home <Col N="1791" /> pay.  This is, I suppose, understandable, but I think that we, as politicians, perhaps failed to communicate to the community at large the purposes to which these increased rates would be applied.</P>
    <P>This was glossed over superficially by Deputy Molony, who seemed to think of it as a party political investment, something which the House, in its wisdom, would reject.  I want to point out that this was simply in keeping with what we have been doing in Government for some years.  I should like to comment briefly on the remarks of the previous speaker about social welfare benefits.  It has been the objective of the Fianna Fáil Government to give substantial increases in social welfare benefits where the need was greatest.  Fianna Fáil Governments have been equally dedicated to weeding out any people in receipt of such benefits who are not entitled to get them.  The present Taoiseach, as Minister for Health and Social Welfare, made great progress along those lines.  The ideal of those who were in need of benefits getting substantial increases and those who were trying to work the system being eliminated was well under way during the term of the previous Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Of the total PRSI increase of 2¾ per cent, 1 per cent will directly stimulate youth employment, which this Government rightly holds as their principal priority in the years ahead.  The remaining 1¾ per cent finances in part the significant and necessary increases to social welfare recipients.  These additional moneys are therefore being applied to alleviate poverty and unemployment, which we all recognise as priority social areas.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to the House that the imminence of the PRSI increases was known from January when they were announced by the Coalition Government in their budget.  Consequently, the time available for mental re-adjustment was longer than it usually is when such important impositions are made.</P>
    <P>Our recent decision to allow these PRSI increases as an offset against workers' tax bills reflect a belief on our part that workers were justified to some extent in complaining about the relatively <Col N="1792" /> significant increase in PRSI contributions. I regard the new allowance as generous, given the State's considerable financial difficulties.  In percentage terms, the new allowance favours the poorer-paid worker <i>vis-à-vis</i> the high income earner, and I regret that this fact did not receive due attention when the announcement was made last Thursday. Indeed certain statisticians and financial commentators went out of their way to try to indicate that this is not true.  I call the attention of the House to what the ICTU pointed out in a statement on Monday, namely, that the vast majority of the 550,000 workers paying the full PRSI rate would benefit to the extent of at least £2.10 per week, equivalent to a pay rise of £3.23 a week.  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate congress on their balanced contribution to this debate.</P>
    <P>The recent increases in PRSI contributions have again renewed calls for equity in taxation.  In establishing the Commission on Taxation two years ago, this Government recognised that reform of the taxation system was necessary. While any major overhaul of the taxation code must await the deliberations of the Commission on Taxation, nevertheless this Government took a number of steps in this budget to widen the tax base by increasing the standard rate of corporation tax from 45 per cent to 50 per cent and the small companies' rate from 35 per cent to 40 per cent, by imposing substantial levies on the banking and insurance sectors and by new measures to tax capital gains and capital acquisitions.  All of these measures are designed to achieve greater equity in taxation, which we see as necessary in order to reduce social inequality.  I have dwelt of necessity in the earlier part of my script on the more topical aspects of PRSI and equity in taxation.  As I have said, the Government in this budget have been very careful to spread the taxation burden in a compassionate manner, notwithstanding the difficult state of the public finances.  Our major efforts in the months ahead will, however, be directed into employment creation.  At present, we are trying to create the right climate for renewed <Col N="1793" /> growth.  It is folly to undermine, as the previous Government did, our economic confidence and international credibility with talk of bankruptcy and other so-called intractable economic problems.</P>
    <P>It was apropos of this that I made the remarks at the outset that I was disappointed to see and to hear that a young man at the beginning of his career should be so infected with pessimism that he does not seem to hold much hope for this country in the near future.  Such talk was demoralising and only tended to promote regressive attitudes to national development, thereby creating the climate where such prophecies would tend to be self-fulfilling.</P>
    <P>In this type of morale situation this is what tends to happen.  Prophecies of gloom and doom tend, by the way they infect the people, to become self-fulfilling.</P>
    <P>It is common cause on all sides of the House that one of our most urgent infrastructural needs, if we are to ensure economic and social progress, is the upgrading of our telecommunications service to the standards generally obtaining in the European Community.</P>
    <P>It is the aim of my Department's five-year development programme to raise the standard of our telecommunications system to that of our EEC partners and there is every reason to believe that the programme targets will be met.  The improvement cannot but be helpful to the economy.</P>
    <P>The development programme was launched in 1980 and much of the effort of the last two years has been directed towards the acquisition of sites, design and provision of buildings, the ordering of exchanges and network planning.  Of themselves these activities do not lead to a direct improvement in the telecommunications system.  They are however a very important step along the road towards that improvement.  Nevertheless some improvements are already evident.  The STD service is much better than it was two years ago, although still a long way short of the 4 per cent failure rate we are aiming for.  The first digital exchanges in Athlone and Kells have been brought into operation and we are now reaching <Col N="1794" /> the stage where the waiting list is now stabilising if not actually declining.  In 1982 new exchanges will be brought into service in Dublin, Ballinasloe, Galway, Naas, New Ross and Tralee to mention but a few.</P>
    <P>The scale of investment necessary to bring about the improvement is massive &mdash; over £220 million last year and £238 million this year.  Investment at this high level is essential to break the back of the problem but it does not have to continue indefinitely.</P>
    <P>It will, however, have to be paid for. That is one of the reasons for the steep increase in charges in recent years.  It would be my hope that, as investment demands ease, and numbers of subscribers grow, the service will be able to meet its financial targets while keeping price rises well below the level of inflation. Experience in other countries suggests that this should be possible.  I am sure it is a matter that Bord Telecom Éireann will be giving urgent attention to when it assumes responsibility for the service.</P>
    <P>Improvements in a service such as telecommunications take time and as is clear from the figures I have just mentioned, lots of money.  Rome was not built in a day and the deficiencies in the telecommunications service &mdash; caused, let it be said, through lack of investment over a long number of years &mdash; cannot be rectified in a week or a month, a year or even two years.  Progress has been made and progress will be made on an accelerating scale over the coming years and I am confident that the targets of the current development programme will be largely met within the time-frame of the programme.</P>
    <P>The substantial investment in the telephone service will provide a spin-off to the economy in a variety of ways.  In addition to the benefits that an improved telephone service will give the business and industrial sector and the community generally, the investment will also have the following advantages for the economy: it will provide continuing substantial employment in the Department in the development of the service; it will provide appreciable employment in firms supplying stores and equipment for the <Col N="1795" /> expansion programme; it is enabling a continuing level of employment to be maintained in the building industry on work for the Department; it is putting substantial money in circulation in the economy since much of the investment is in staff, in stores and equipment manufactured in this country; it is grant aided by the European Regional Development Fund and loan aided by the European Investment Bank and other EEC institutions.</P>
    <P>Altogether, therefore, investment in the telephone service is highly desirable from many points of view.  It is clearly desirable from every aspect that it should be continued, and there is no need to offer any apologies for the borrowing of funds to develop the service.</P>
    <P>In so far as the postal service is concerned, my Department's aim has been to provide an efficient, reliable service. However in recent years the standard has been rather less than satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Regular monitoring of the standard of postal service in 1981 showed that about 84 per cent of letters were delivered on the next working day after posting; this is about 6 per cent short of the target which is aimed at.  Failures to meet the target arise when the volume of letters posted cannot be handled by the available sorting staff within the tight time limits which exist between letter collections and mail despatches.  Difficulties arise from road traffic congestion in the cities and towns and some staffing inflexibilities. These problems tend to arise especially in Dublin which handles over half of all the mail in the country.  Dublin is the hub of the mail network and difficulties there can be reflected in the standard of service throughout the country. Management efforts are being directed to overcoming such problems as exist and improving the quality of service to the excellence which was maintained over a long period of years.</P>
    <P>The public's perception of the postal service is, of course, influeced by cost as well as quality.  I regret the necessity for the charge increases which were implemented on 1 April.  These increases were approved by the previous Government <Col N="1796" /> and announced in the draft budget on 27 January last.  The increases are necessary to enable the postal service to approach break-even this year.  It has been the accepted policy of successive Governments that the service should pay its way taking one year with another.  The postal service is highly labour intensive, over 80 per cent of its expenditure being on pay and pay-related items.  By and large, increases in charges arise because of pay increases, and these increases are negotiated under the general conciliation and arbitration machinery for regulating pay in the civil service.  In fixing pay rates regard is had to comparisons with outside employment and to the provisons of national pay agreements or national understandings.  These latter usually provide for minimum increases for lower paid workers which apply to the large numbers in the basic grades in the postal service, with the effect of pushing up the average percentage increase for these workers.</P>
    <P>The postal service has been incurring large deficits in recent years: £17 million in 1979, £14.5 million in 1980 and £10.6 million, estimated, in 1981.  The relatively frequent rate at which increases have occurred in recent years, therefore, includes an element of &ldquo;catching up&rdquo; with increases in costs.  Of course the service has also been hit by the high increases in the cost of transport and energy which have been a feature of recent years.</P>
    <P>The only alternative to meeting the costs of postal services from charges to the public is to meet them from taxation. That has never seemed to be an equitable solution and there is no reason to adopt it now.  It was suggested in recent weeks that the cost of services might be carried in a different way by users.  A spokesman for the Confederation of Irish Industry stated, for example, that private users should pay higher charges than industry. The <i>rationale</i> for this proposal was that industry is competing internationally and would suffer the effects of higher costs. While I can sympathise with the <i>rationale</i> I am not sure that it is a good principle to apportion costs other than on the basis of use of services.  There are, in any event, other considerations in the case of the <Col N="1797" /> postal service.  Private users originate only a quarter of all mailings and charge increases to them would, therefore, have to be very large indeed if the proposed policy were to be implemented.  Moreover the present printed paper class of its nature benefits business primarily and this class is effectively subsidised to the extent of about 18 per cent by first class mail.</P>
    <P>The problem of expenditure growth is being tackled and it is not the case that cost rises are automatically passed on to the user of the services.  Sustained efforts are made to identify and trim any superfluous spending.  Some savings are, of course, dependent on investment in, for example, new transport or better buildings to allow for more efficient operations, and I am hopeful that the funds required will be available to the extent possible in present circumstances.  Substantial savings have been made in recent years with the continued motorisation of rural postal deliveries and as a result of eliminating Saturday deliveries in response to a staff claim for a five day week.  It is a measure of the commitment to cost containment that over the past ten years staff numbers in the postal service have actually been reduced by about 650.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the increase in telecommunications and postal charges, fees in respect of licences for radio equipment and wireless telegraphy examinations have been increased by 20 per cent.  The items covered under this increase are business radio licences, experimenters' licences, ship and aircraft radio licences, the examination fees for radio communication operator's general certificate and radar maintenance certificate. The fees involved remain quite modest &mdash; for instance the licence fee for a radio system comprising a base station and mobile stations rises from a fixed sum of £8 plus £8 for each station to a fixed sum of £10 plus £10 for each station. There has been a very rapid growth in recent years in the use of mobile radio systems &mdash; in the past five years the number of licences taken out has increased by about 122 per cent.  This growth reflects a growing sophistication within the commercial and also the professional community <Col N="1798" /> and a greater appreciation of the importance and value of good communication facilities.  It is also, of course, a recognition of the contribution which mobile radio communication can make towards cutting energy costs for industry.</P>
    <P>Revenue from these sources currently amounts to around £140,000 per annum and it is expected that the increases granted will bring in an additional £30,000 over a full year.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that it is proposed to reorganise the postal and telecommunications services in the form of separate State-sponsored bodies.  As announced in the White Paper, which was published in May 1981, it is the aim of this Government to have the two State-sponsored bodies set up at the earliest possible date I expect to introduce draft legislation dealing with the setting up of the State-sponsored bodies early in the current session.  I cannot, of course, anticipate the decision of the Oireachtas by forecasting a date by which the legislation will be enacted but my aim is to have the new State-sponsored companies in operation in the Autumn of this year.  Comprehensive consultations with staff organisations, and I lay great stress on this, are in progress and will be continued during the coming months.</P>
    <P>A State-owned company, Irish Telecommunications Investment Limited, was established by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in April 1981 to facilitate participation by the private sector in the financing of telecommunications development.</P>
    <P>The company arranged borrowings of £92 million from a consortium of Irish financial institutions in 1981 to meet part of the cost of the approved telecommunications development programme for that year.  The approved programme for 1982 amounts to £238 million of which £80 million will be made available by the exchequer by way of repayable loans. Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited is expected to raise the remaining £158 million.</P>
    <P>As indicated by my predecessor when the Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited Bill was before this House towards the end of last year, the intention <Col N="1799" /> is that the company will be taken over by the new State-sponsored body for telecommunications when it is set up.  The draft legislation dealing with the reorganisation of postal and telecommunications services will provide accordingly.</P>
    <P>Before turning to deal with the Government's programme of investment in transport infrastructure for 1982, I should like to comment briefly on the provision in the budget of an additional £16 million in subvention for CIE.  In this connection when the board's original estimates were drawn up, the terms of the public sector pay agreement had not been finalised. Sufficient provision had not, therefore, been included in the CIE estimates to cover the full cost of the application of the public sector pay agreement to the CIE work force.  This factor together with the Government's decision in relation to CIE fares, which we regarded as an integral part of our anti-inflation strategy, made the provision of additional subvention essential.  It would not have been possible for the board, with the £80 million originally provided, to meet their commitments in the current year, even with any economy measures that may be practicable.  The additional provision of £16 million will bring the total subvention for the year to £96 million.</P>
    <P>The biggest item in the transport sector of the capital budget this year is an allocation of £55 million for CIE.  Over half of this is for work on the electrification of the Howth-Bray suburban rail project which is scheduled to come into operation in 1983.  This reflects the Government's continuing support for public transport in Dublin city.  When this electrified system becomes operational it will actively discourage the use of private cars by commuters from those areas served by the railway.</P>
    <P>The Public Capital Programme also provides £20 million for the supply of new buses from the Bombardier plant at Shannon.  The first buses produced were 50 single deck vehicles to meet CIE's requirements for their provincial services and their tour operations.  Since then production has concentrated on double deck vehicles with the aim of improving CIE's <Col N="1800" /> urban bus fleet.  To date over 150 double deck buses have been delivered from the factory and have been put into service. The new buses in their distinctive livery are appearing daily on the streets of Dublin and on CIE's expressway services. The new buses should lead to an improvement in the reliability of Dublin city services which when coupled with the operation of the bus lanes will further contribute to a move from private car commuting to the use of public transport.</P>
    <P>A provision of £3.5 million is included in the Public Capital Programme for the commencement of work on the assembly over a six year period of 124 mainline carriages for CIE.</P>
    <P>CIE recently signed a contract with British Rail Engineering for the supply of components with which CIE will assemble this fleet of 124 new mainline rail coaches.  Production plans for the project which will be undertaken at CIE's Inchicore works are currently being prepared and CIE hope to have the first train set operational before Christmas 1983.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance also announced the Government's intention of completing the Connacht Regional Airport.  The estimated total cost of this project is a little above £12 million.  The Government decided to go ahead with it because they see it as a fundamental project which will act as a trigger for further development, both industrial and social, in that region.  It also reflects the Government's intention that all regions of the country will have a share in future prosperity. For too long there have been allegations that the west was being deprived of needed investment, and I am using the word &ldquo;west&rdquo; in the broadest possible sense.  Proceeding with this project will show the Government's intention of accelerating development in the lesser developed areas.</P>
    <P>The adequacy of facilities at the three State airports is kept under continuous review by Aer Rianta and my Department so that any improvements necessary to cope with traffic growth, with changes in aircraft types proposing to use the airports, as well as with safety, security and <Col N="1801" /> general accommodation needs are introduced in good time.</P>
    <P>A provision of £2.6 million to meet the cost of constructional and other capital works at the three State airports is being made available for 1982.  The main projects to be carried out this year include the provision of additional car parking facilities, improved cargo facilities, provision of new accommodation for the training of foreign students in aspects of airport maintenance, additional accommodation for Customs staff and the acquisition of new fire-fighting equipment for Dublin Airport.  Work will commence later this year on a large apron extension to provide additional parking space for B 747 aircraft at Shannon Airport and the work is expected to be completed early in 1983.  Two new fire tenders will be ordered during the year to replace existing vehicles which are coming to the end of their useful life.  Improved standby plant facilities are being installed on the main runway to provide increased reliability to meet present-day requirements at Shannon.</P>
    <P>As regards Cork Airport, the major projects include the completion of invalid lifts and toilet facilities, for disabled persons, additional standby plant to cater for the increased load arising from the expansion of facilities over the past number of years, a new fire tender and an extension to the airport apron for aircraft parking.</P>
    <P>Expansion and development of Ireland's ports is essential if we are to meet the demands of our sea-borne import and export trades.  The investment in harbours in the public capital programme is designed to meet these demands by providing expanded harbour facilities at the larger ports and by enabling smaller capital works or essential maintenance to be carried out at other ports.</P>
    <P>In particular I would like to refer to the decision of the Government that the construction of a deepwater berth as part of the Cork Harbour Development Scheme at Ringaskiddy should be proceeded with.  As announced in the budget speech, the Government are providing £2 million to Cork Harbour Commissioners <Col N="1802" /> to enable work on this very desirable project to be commenced this year.  Work on that portion of the scheme which had already been approved is near completion with the provision of the roll-on/roll-off ferry terminal facility which will be in operation early this summer. The provision of the deepwater berth will enhance Cork lower harbour as an area for the siting of heavy industry.  The deepwater berthage will accommodate vessels up to 60,000 tons deadweight and this facility taken in conjunction with industrial land and fresh water availability will put Cork Harbour Commissioners and the IDA in a strong position to attract port-related industry to Cork.  The added advantage of the deepwater berth will be that larger vessels now being used in the coal and timber trades will be able to use the port.  It is expected that work on the deepwater berth will commence later this year and construction will take two-and-a-half to three years to complete.  The employment content will average 75 jobs over the period which should give a needed boost to the construction industry in the Cork area.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Limited will be undertaking capital investment of the order of £19.5 million in 1982.  Of this sum, £16 million is being expended on the purchase of a secondhand ferry, which went into service on the Rosslare-France run on 1 April 1982.  This ferry replaces the <i>St. Patrick</i> which has been sold to the Northern Ireland Company in which Irish Shipping Limited have a shareholding and which will be operating the Belfast-Liverpool service.</P>
    <P>The remaining £3.5 million represents part of the cost of the lengthening of the <i>St. Killian,</i> fitting additional cabins and other accommodation.  The <i>St. Killian</i> is now back in service on the Continental route.  I have to express a special interest in the <i>St. Killian</i> because St. Killian himself was a Cavan man.  This expenditure by Irish Shipping Limited has substantially increased capacity for passengers and vehicles on the Ireland-Continental route.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I have been experiencing financial difficulties in recent years and turned in losses of £1.1 million and £2.8 <Col N="1803" /> million for the years 1979 and 1980 respectively.  A loss in excess of £7 million is projected for 1981.  The company initiated a series of measures from 1980 onwards involving a reduction in the level of services, a ban on recruitment and reductions in personnel and other economies with a view to improving their position.  Despite these measures, the company are in a serious financial position and have taken further steps since the beginning of the year to rationalise their operations.  The Jetfoil has been laid up and is on the market for sale or lease. The Cork-Pembroke and Rosslare-Pem-broke services are being operated with one ship only and a buyer is being sought for the surplus ship.  As part of their rationalisation programme B &amp; I have negotiated an agreement with Sealink for access to the port of Holyhead by B &amp; I vessels.  Unfortunately there had been a delay in the introduction of this service but I am glad that this was only a temporary set-back.  I had talks with the Sealink workers, with the company themselves and with Plaid Cymru from Wales where Holyhead is situated, and I am glad to be able to record that the setback was only temporary and that the service is now in existence.  I will continue to support the B &amp; I initiative, which should have benefits in more economical use of vessels and saving in fuel and other costs.  While I appreciate that Sealink staff may understandably have misgivings about the effects of the proposed new service on the existing Sealink services, I believe that their fears are groundless. B &amp; I will not be increasing their overall frequency on the central corridor nor will they be adding any further capacity.  It is generally agreed that development of the service between Dún Laoghaire and Holyhead will be to the benefit of both companies plying the routes Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead and Dublin-Holyhead.</P>
    <P>The financial problems of the B &amp; I Company have been examined under the aegis of my Department and I have put forward proposals to the Government on financial and other aspects.</P>
    <P>The air companies' capital programme <Col N="1804" /> for 1982 involves expenditure estimated at £13.25 million, the major item in the programme being the acquisition of another Boeing 737 aircraft, bringing to 14 the number of such aircraft in the Aer Lingus fleet.  The aircraft being acquired is an advanced version, specially designed for long-haul operations and Aer Lingus envisage using it primarily to serve European inclusive tour charter destinations to places such as Greece, Malta and the Canary Islands.</P>
    <P>Besides expenditure on the Boeing 737, the air companies' programme includes provision for expenditure on aircraft modifications, spare parts and equipment and aviation-related ancillary activities, including completion of the Airmotive project at Rathcoole, County Dublin.  That project is, of course, making a significant contribution to the creation of high-level-technology-related employment in this country.  At present, the Airmotive project employs 220 and when in full production will employ 600.</P>
    <P>Because of severe losses on their North Atlantic operations, the air companies have made a detailed case for additional equity investment.  As I pointed out in reply to a parliamentary question on this subject on 30 March last, a thorough examination of the Aer Lingus application, which was initiated by my predecessor with the agreement of the board of Aer Lingus has now been completed and is being brought to the attention of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government's attitude towards public transport in Dublin is one of encouraging its use, as evidenced by the additional moneys allocated in the budget to the CIE subvention, which will avoid the need for further fares increases. My Government colleagues and I are convinced that the increased use of public transport is in the overall interest of inner city residents, members of the city's business community, and commuters generally.</P>
    <P>This objective is currently being pursued by the Dublin Transport Task Force, the non-statutory interim body which will be replaced by the Dublin Transport Authority.  I will be bringing legislative proposals for the authority <Col N="1805" /> before the Government shortly.  I plan to introduce the necessary Bill before the summer recess, and to establish the authority before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The use of public transport is being promoted principally by the implementation of bus priority measures, by the introduction of new buses into CIE's fleet, and by the discouragement of all day parking through strict enforcement of the parking regulations and through conversion of free on-street parking spaces to metered short-stay spaces. Pedestrianisation of selected streets or precincts is a further measure which can be employed to make the best use of the street network for both pedestrian and vehicular traffic.</P>
    <P>Improvement and extension of suburban rail services is also in hands.  I have already mentioned that the electrified Howth-Bray line is expected to be in operation by late 1983.  Services have been provided in recent months from Connolly Station to Blanchardstown and points beyond as far as Maynooth, and I would hope that all of these developments will divert commuters from car travel to public transport.</P>
    <P>I would express my belief that a continued high level of investment on our transport facilities and infrastructure has two highly desirable effects.  At a time of economic difficulty such as we&mdash;together with the rest of our trading partners&mdash;are experiencing at present, the contribution of transport to maintaining employment and economic activity generally is significant. In addition, it is only by having the infrastructure in place that we can extract the maximum benefit from the up-turn in the world economy which we hope will not be delayed for too long more.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the reorganisation of the posts and telecommunications service.  I have been working on the preparation of the legislation and the work is nearing completion.  I have had exhaustive discussions with the officials of my Department and I have also met the chairmen and executive officers of the boards.  I am convinced that with the amount of effort they are putting into the establishment and development of this departure there is a very bright future for <Col N="1806" /> both the postal and telecommunications services.  Many developments of interest in the postal services of other countries have been studied.  I know that the chairman and chief executive have some very enterprising ideas about the development of the service.  They have ideas on electronic mail and on greater use of sub post offices, both from the point of view of the savings bank operation and even usage in connection with the Department of Social Welfare.  They have studied the effects of the setting up of independent boards in other countries.  This has already happened in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia and we have through their studies the benefit of the experiences of those countries.  These people have dedicated themselves with such zeal, enthusiasm and thoroughness to the task which was given to them as chairmen and chief executives of the interim boards that there is a particularly bright prospect for the two boards.</P>
    <P>We will have an opportunity for further discussion in the House when I bring in the very important legislation setting up these boards.  It will be long and complicated but I am sure that at the end of the day the discussion will be to the benefit of the boards.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that I attach particular importance to discussions, agreement and arrangements with the existing staffs on both the postal and telecommunications side.  There are no problems which are totally intractable and which cannot be solved through patient, understanding and sympathetic negotiation between the two sides.  There will be a guarantee on my part as Minister, acting for the Government, that the conditions of service will not be changed to the detriment of anyone working in the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the Minister's comprehensive speech which was most informative on a wide variety of topics.  I had hoped for more of a philosophical input into the background to the budget which was presented to the House on 25 March.  Perhaps it is understandable that there was not a high philosophical content in the Minister's speech because there appears to have been a lack of any philosophy whatever in the thinking regarding the budget which we are debating now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that during the seven months when the Coalition Government were in office between June 1981 and February 1982 a new word had entered the vocabulary in Irish political life.  Many people used the word &ldquo;realism&rdquo; to describe the policy the Coalition Government put in train.  It was an extremely new and not an easy concept to live with because for four years before June 1981 we had a kind of economic fantasy land where realism was a word that was kept firmly outside the door.  When the Coalition Government <Col N="1808" /> came to power in June 1981 one of the first things they had to tackle was the lack of any kind of reality on the part of people who had been given a licence by the politicians to get away with any demands they made.  In June 1981 it was one of the most difficult tasks for the Government to bring back the concept of responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Minister used a new word to describe that sense of realism.  Other words were used by Fianna Fáil also such as &ldquo;defeatism&rdquo; and &ldquo;fatalism&rdquo;.  The actions of the Coalition Government were described as &ldquo;economic sabotage&rdquo;. Certainly Fianna Fáil did not like the sound of the word &ldquo;realism&rdquo; and it is quite clear from the budget we are debating that they still do not like the sound of that word.  The Minister's new word today was &ldquo;demoralising&rdquo;.  He chided my colleague, Deputy Molony, for having been infected, as he said, with pessimism so early in life.  If this country had the kind of leadership earlier in its life that it had for the seven months when the Coalition Government were in power, the country would be in a much better state.</P>
    <P>That realism has been shown to be right.  In February the Irish people for the first time were asked to express their opinion.  When that election was called on the previous budget it was confidently expected that the people did not want to know about realism and it was thought the Government would sink without trace.  Instead, the highest percentage ever of the electorate, 38 per cent, voted for the party of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance who had introduced that realistic budget.  That was an extraordinary development in Irish political life and one that must give hope and confidence for the future.  A very high percentage of the electorate voted for a budget that was generally considered to be the most stern and realistic that any Government ever had the courage to put before the people.  The people signified their willingness to face reality and to lay the foundation for economic recovery. By any standards, it was a remarkable answer.</P>
    <P>When I was preparing my contribution <Col N="1809" /> I went to the files of newspapers and the various commentaries that were written. There was such a consensus about the triumph and the realism of the Irish people that I was overwhelmed but I will quote on extract from a commentary by Bruce Arnold on 27 March when he stated:</P>
    <P>It is a measure of the degree to which the general public had been conditioned to realism during the previous seven months that even with the bizarre circumstances in which the 22nd Dáil came to an end, even with the cushioning effects offered by Fianna Fáil to salvage their own campaign, we still ended up as we did with the balance of power held by Independents.</P>
    <P>This was just one example of the general agreement of serious commentators that something extraordinary had been achieved by seven months of responsible government.  It was a magnificent response by the people to a budget it was confidently expected would be rejected completely.</P>
    <P>As a result of that indecisive election which saw an increased number of Independents in this House, Fianna Fáil found themselves in the position of putting a budget before us on 25 March. That is what we are discussing today. There has been time since that budget was introduced to react to it, to discuss it and to judge its effects on our economy this year and in future years.</P>
    <P>Before the election and before this budget was laid before us, it seemed that Fianna Fáil finally appreciated that the Irish people had reached a stage where they wanted responsible government.  It seemed from the <i>volte face</i> Fianna Fáil indulged in before the election that some voices had finally been heard by the people in Fianna Fáil who made the decisions and that we would have a budget which showed we were getting responsible government.</P>

      <P>University College, Dublin, discharge their functions in this regard under the relevant statutory authority and regulations made by them are not subject to the sanction of the Minister for Education.  I have had inquiries made in the matter, however, and the following information has been supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The college, based on their experience of competitive admission over the last <Col N="1811" /> decade, consider the present arrangement concerning the calculation of the point score as being the fairest method in their own circumstances.</P>
    <P>The college have, however, always been concerned and given special consideration to various categories of applicants who are not ordinary leaving certificate school leavers.  Provisions have been made for: (1) applicants aged 24 years or over without matriculation qualifications; (2) applicants aged 24 years or over with matriculation qualifications for whom there are non-competitive places in several faculties; and (3) NCEA transfer students.</P>
    <P>In addition admission to the evening courses in arts, commerce and public administration have not been fully subscribed in recent years.  Basic matriculation is sufficient for entry to these courses, and matriculation can always be obtained by accumulating subjects from different examinations.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if his attention has been drawn to reports of a recent survey carried out by the INTO into the standards and conditions obtaining in national schools throughout the State; and the action he is taking to combat the deplorable conditions outlined in that report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with circulars and guidelines issued to chairmen of boards of management of national schools in August 1977 and May 1981, grants are available for improvements which the school authorities may have carried out on their own initiative. <Col N="1813" /> Such improvements would include the installation of sinks and running water, the provision of floor covering and furniture, the replacement of doors and windows, the installation of water-flushed sanitation, the provision of adequate heating and lighting, the improvement of playspaces and, in certain instances, the making good of minor structural defects which have arisen otherwise than by neglect of maintenance.  Maintenance is a responsibility of school management.</P>
      <P>As recently as last month my Department again circularised all chairmen of boards of management regarding the carrying out of improvements and it is hoped that the authorities of any school in which conditions are unsatisfactory will make the necessary arrangements to have the required improvements carried out during the summer holidays in accordance with the guidelines issued to them.</P>
      <P>A sum of £27 million towards the cost of the national school buildings programme has been allocated in the current year.  It is understood from the Commissioners of Public Works that work is in progress on 63 new schools and 76 extension schemes and that contracts have been placed, but work not yet commenced, in the case of two further new schools and six extensions.  An additional 86 new schools and 113 extension schemes are at various stages of planning by the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
      <P>While first priority in this programme must be given to the provision of school accommodation for pupils for whom no accommodation exists, a high priority is also attached to bringing unsatisfactory or substandard schools to a satisfactory standard, either by replacement or by reconstruction and extension where necessary.</P>

If he is not satisfied, does he accept that repeating the issue of a circular to school managements, which so <Col N="1814" /> far has not improved the situation, is hardly likely to do so now?  What concrete steps is he going to take to ensure that the deplorable Dickensian conditions shown up in the recent INTO survey will become a thing of the past as soon as possible?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will recognise, the existing number, locations, and physical characteristics of national schools are not an overnight occurrence but the product of more than a century of educational history.  If we place the matter in perspective, the Deputy will agree that successive Governments have arranged for substantial programmes of new school buildings and improvements to existing buildings over recent decades.  There has been substantial progress made towards the objective of ensuring that all children attend schools which fully reach present-day standards.</P>
      <P>We recognise that there is still a number, happily a diminishing number, of schools that would not meet these standards. For that reason the action to which I referred in my reply has been taken in recent years, namely, providing a much more free and discretionary system of financial support for schools which wish to remedy any of the defects which have been listed.  A number of schools have availed of the provisions of that scheme. So far as more specific action is concerned, I have already had discussions with the INTO on these general matters and have had preliminary discussions with other interested parties.  I will be following up those discussions to encourage remedying these defects.</P>

If so, does he not agree that one of the problems involved is obviously the grant aid system, which is a partial grant aid system, and that the work needing to be done, in some cases work of a very extensive nature, cannot be done because the local schools do not have the money to <Col N="1815" /> complement the partial grant made available by the Department, and which was the subject of a circular?

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the action he proposes to take, in conjunction with the Minister for Labour, to increase the training of (a) fitters, mechanics and mechanical production and industrial engineers, as these were shown to be the occupations with the largest vacancy levels in a recent National Manpower Service survey of industry and (b) bricklayers, carpenters and other woodworkers which are occupations with high vacancy levels in the construction industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision is made in conjunction with AnCO for the educational input to courses for apprentices in the designated trades, including the areas mentioned in the survey referred to by the Deputy.  Intake to certifacate, diploma and degree level courses in mechanical, production and industrial engineering at universities, national institutes of higher education, regional technical colleges and vocational education committee colleges have increased markedly in recent years but the full impact of this increased output is not yet apparent, particularly at diploma and degree level, because of the length of the courses.  Under the education manpower programme initiated in 1979, steps have been taken to double the output of graduate engineers over the current decade.</P>

      <P>Yes, I shall certainly undertake to do that.  As the Deputy is aware, the general provisions relating to the numbers and arrangements for intake of apprentices and so on into the various crafts is organised primarily through AnCO and, to that extent tends to come under the aegis of the Minister for Labour.  But if there are aspects of it which fall within the problems of education I shall be delighted to take them up for the Deputy.</P>

Would the Minister consider perhaps launching a national publicity campaign in this matter with a view to orienting young people towards those trades in which skill is still deficient and the lack of which is continuing to hold us back economically?</P>

Is he aware that every doctor or politician appearing in the Irish text-books is a man?  I do not think that reflects our society at the present time. It is limited to women from an early stage.  In view of that would the Minister <Col N="1830" /> not give us some hope that the matter will be considered by his Department given that regularly it has come up at INTO meetings and that it is particularly at primary school level that the stereotyping is occurring most extensively?</P>

Even now, if anybody does so, I shall certainly arrange to have it investigated.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I believe I am right in saying that some of those children started going to Bawnboy school on the very same day and were granted fare-paying facilities while the McGoldrick family were not.  It is not helping Tullyveela because this child has been going there now for approximately two years and will continue to go there. The only effect of what the Minister is doing and what her predecessor as well as his predecessor did is to infuriate this family.  It is not fair.  Will the Minister take this matter up with the board of management or whoever else is concerned and end this discrimination?  I know that somebody may have gone asleep and the other children may have got on and then Tullyveela kicked up a row and now this family are being deprived.  This is discrimination of the worst type.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have to appreciate that this child's family have two other children who will be commencing school later this year.  If one were to grant fare-paying facilities to the existing child one would also be discriminating against the school because they would be losing two other pupils as well.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 to 19, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department received in the order of 700 applications for capital grant assistance under the community, youth, recreational and employment programme, included among which are applications from Rathnure GAA Club, Taghmon Community Centre Committee, Ballyhogue GAA Club, Bree, and Bannow-Ballymitty GAA Club, in County Wexford. These four applicant groups were <Col N="1834" /> not nominated for assistance and as all funds placed at my Department's disposal for the purpose of the scheme were fully committed by the previous Government the question of making grants available to these groups cannot be considered at this stage.</P>
    <P>Both Rathnure GAA Club and Ballyhogue GAA Club have submitted applications for assistance under my Department's temporary grant scheme for youth employment.  These applications are receiving consideration in my Department with regard to the terms and conditions of that scheme and it is hoped to have a decision in this matter shortly.  An application form issued in the case of Bannow-Ballymitty GAA Club has not, as yet, been returned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that her predecessor issued a letter to me on 11 February stating that three of those particular clubs, Bannow-Ballymitty, Rathnure GAA Club and Ballyhogue GAA Club were approved for grant aid under the temporary youth employment scheme?  Is she further aware that timing is of utmost importance in this case as many of those clubs and community organisations have entered commitments with contractors and there are real limits to the finances they can raise through collections in their parishes? If they are to succeed it is imperative that they get an early decision and sufficient grant aid.  In view of the decision of the Minister of State's predecessor how can she now say that there is no decision in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Rathnure GAA Club, Taghmon Community Centre, Ballyhogue GAA Club, Bree, and Bannow-Ballymitty GAA Club submitted applications to my predecessor under the capital grants scheme.  All of these were not included in the allocations that he subsequently made.  However, for some unknown reason, the former Minister of State informed all four that they were considered for assistance and that they would qualify under the temporary youth employment scheme although none of those mentioned had applied for <Col N="1835" /> assistance under that particular scheme. It is only since the Department submitted application forms to all of those that the applications have come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I detect that under the new Minister of State there is a deliberate attempt to delay the approval of grant aid for those?  There is no difficulty for the Minister here because approval had already been given.  It is just a simple matter of finding the funds to pay for this. The Minister has not addressed herself to the very serious situation with regard to the timing.  It is essential that those varied groups get the go-ahead.  I detect from the Minister, in regard to the political answer she gave, some indifference in this regard.  Will the Minister give some definite commitment in the House to these genuine requests?  If we take the Rathnure GAA Club, for the Nicky Rackard Park £70,000 is the total outlay involved and there is no way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's difficulty because I am faced with many of the same schemes in my constituency.  No Minister has a right to approve any kind of grant when he or she has no application for that grant in front of him or her.  I am not being political in any way.  I am telling the Deputy that all the areas he is interested in had applied for assistance under the capital grant <Col N="1836" /> scheme.  Their applications under that scheme were refused.  They never submitted applications under the temporary youth employment scheme although I admit they were informed by my predecessor by letter that they had qualified under that scheme.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that one cannot give approval when no application has been made or is on record in the Department. Since my appointment as Minister of State application forms were sent to all of those clubs.  Rathnure and Ballyhogue have sent back their completed application forms and they are being dealt with as speedily as possible in my Department.</P>

      <P>I have two questions. First, will the Minister state when the applications for capital grant aid from the clubs she refers to were refused?  Is it not the case that they were not refused at any point?  Secondly, is it not the case that approval under the youth employment scheme was given by accepting the information contained in the capital grants scheme and by approving in principle the applications subject to full compliance with all the terms of the scheme?  If the Minister accepts that statement of fact, will she accept also that she is appearing to do her predecessor, namely myself, a disservice by the manner in which she has presented her reply?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There were not refusals in the sense that some applications had been considered and approved while others were still pending.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth is that Deputy Yates and many other Deputies have been under an illusion because applicants were informed at one point that they would qualify for grant assistance under the temporary youth employment scheme when in fact no application had been made by any of the clubs that Deputy Yates is interested in under that scheme.  There are hundreds of such clubs around the country who are in the same position.  This puts all Deputies in the unfortunate situation that their local clubs and community centres do not know what is happening in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that an unprecedented sum of money &mdash; five times the previous year's figure &mdash; is being made available under the aegis of the temporary youth employment agency for the temporary youth employment scheme?  Is it not then highly probable <Col N="1838" /> that any applicant to whom approval has been issued in principle, without specification as to any sum involved and subject to full compliance with the terms of the scheme, will be so approved if the Minister so wishes?  What the Minister is trying to do is to go back on commitments entered into properly and for which full resources were available and are still available in the Department.  Is it not the case that any approval that issued was at all times qualified by the reference that such grant would be paid only if the application was in full compliance with the terms of the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>For the information of the House I should point out that the two schemes operated by my section of the Department are two totally different schemes.  One is a capital grant scheme and the other is a temporary youth employment scheme.  One very often finds that applicants under the capital grants scheme would not be interested in getting assistance under the temporary youth employment scheme because that situation would not suit them in terms of the type of work they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that the former Minister of State would try to insinuate in some way that I might be telling lies in the House.  In the four cases concerned there was application for assistance under the capital grants scheme but there was no application in the Department from any of them under the temporary youth employment scheme at the time when they were informed by the previous Minister of State that they were to be given assistance <Col N="1839" /> under the temporary youth employment scheme.  Since I assumed office application forms have been sent to those concerned and two of those have been returned.  I have assured Deputy Yates that these will be dealt with as speedily as possible and so long as all of the criteria are met by those two groups they will be allocated grants under the temporary youth employment scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one final question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will allow Deputy Yates a final supplementary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four questions being taken together so perhaps you should allow as much latitude as possible. I am alarmed to hear the Minister say that nobody knows where they are in regard to this whole matter.  Concerning the illusions she referred to, I put down these questions so that any illusion might be cleared up.  As one who is representing the clubs concerned here I am not satisfied with the reply that the applications will be dealt with speedily.  I want a commitment that grant aid will be given.  I was given such a commitment on 11 February. If such a commitment can be given, what is to be the basis of it?  Will it be by way of a percentage of the total cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, this is the illusion that those involved seem to be under.  There is no question of a percentage when talking about the temporary youth employment scheme.  The only case in which a percentage operates in this area is under the capital grants scheme.  When talking about the temporary youth employment scheme one is talking about providing employment for young people for a set number of weeks and about remunerating somebody to act as supervisor during the time that the work in question is continuing.  Applications have been received from the Rathnure and Ballyhogue clubs.  An inspector from the Department will be visiting both clubs and that inspection will be starting on 3 May.  Depending on whether all the <Col N="1840" /> criteria can be met, they will be considered for financial assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any indication on the Minister's files of any case in which a letter of approval for grant aid issued either under my name or in the name of the Department in which reference was not made to the need for compliance in full with every aspect of the scheme?</P>

      <P>We had arrived at a situation where Fianna Fáil had been forced during the course of a general election <Col N="1876" /> campaign to accept a current budget deficit of £715 million.  That represented a major breakthrough by some in Fianna Fáil against those who wanted to run away once more into fantasy land.  Having agreed that that current budget deficit was necessary Fianna Fáil put an election budget before the people.  It was quite obvious that the conversion of Fianna Fáil to economic realism stopped short at the acceptance of that current budget deficit.  Not content with pretending to accept that deficit on March 25 in the budget we were presented with a lower deficit of £679 million but as one read the Minister's speech it was obvious that the lower deficit had been achieved by means which were inept, dishonest and deeply damaging to the economy.  It is true to say that since 25 March the figure of £679 million has been abandoned in the face of difficulty.</P>
      <P>In the March budget a device was used to reach the figure of £679 million, the demanding of £200 million in advance from industry by the early payment of VAT at the point of import and the advance payment of corporation profits tax.  The device was simple but it will be extremely damaging.  It did not solve anything and was a desperate ruse to put off until tomorrow what Fianna Fáil cannot and will not face today, the need for the Irish people to pay their way in the economic world.  Economists, commentators and industrialists were unanimous in their condemation of this extraordinary attempt at sleight of hand.  The professor of economics at UCD, Brendan Walsh, in the course of an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 26 March stated:</P>
      <P>...the ploy of bringing forward the date of payment of VAT on imports and of corporation profits tax is of course an non-recurring item.  The underlying deficit is therefore understated this year as will become apparent when the 1983 budget is presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the most mild comments on the device adopted by the Government but it is representative of the type of reaction.  Another comment was contained in the Central Bank's statement <Col N="1877" /> on monetary policy of 1982 circulated on 17 April 1982 where, in very typical, restrained language, the Central Bank point out that part of the expected improvement in the Exchequer's finances this year is attributable to revenue intake of a non-recurring nature.  Put simply, it is basically tomorrow's money.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing about that figure which it was hoped to raise by this device was the question mark over its accuracy.  In February, when Fianna Fáil produced their election budget, the figure for VAT on imports at the point of entry was £45 million.  This grew by £100 million and it is expected to obtain £140 million for only three-and-a-half months of imports.  These figures which change and shift are, in themselves, questionable and the whole philosophy is damaging.</P>
    <P>In February, Fianna Fáil were talking about increased buoyancy which concept the Minister, in his speech on 25 March, very hotly defended as being soundly based.  This is a suspect concept at the best of times, but it had doubled to £45 million by March 25, as opposed to the Fianna Fáil pre-election budget.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil used to use the phrase &ldquo;self-financing subsidies&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;increased buoyancy&rdquo;, but this was greeted with such derision that they had to drop it for the phrase &ldquo;increased buoyancy&rdquo;. Even this figure of £200 million to be taken out of industry this year is suspect. It was given by the present Minister for Education when he was in the unhappy position of trying to meet Fianna Fáil's demand for an election budget.  He must be a happier man in his present position, but God help the school children of Ireland.  We are presented with this figure of £200 million &mdash; an extraordinarily heavy blow to our industry, which will make the 1983 budget position much worse.  Where will the substitute for that crock of gold come from in 1983?  The mind boggles at the thought.</P>
    <P>It is important to look a little more closely at that figure of £140 million.  It is generally reckoned that 70 per cent of that amount of VAT on imports at the point of entry is expected to come from imports of raw materials for industry and capital goods, some would be VAT on <Col N="1878" /> capital goods for agriculture, some for construction.  That leaves an estimated £70 million or £80 million to be found by manufacturing industry in a period amounting to slightly less than four months.  This figure is being demanded by Fianna Fáil from our manufacturing section &mdash; the most valuable, most necessary and most shrinking element of our economy.  Indeed, it is frightening to consider the effect on employment of that sort of demand.  The Minister began his budget speech with the phrase &ldquo;The greatest problem facing this country today is unemployment and policy must have regard to this&rdquo;, and then proceeded to deal manufacturing industry this extraordinarily heavy blow, an example of the inconsistency which we have come to expect from Fianna Fáil.  Where is that money to come from?  It will come from borrowing once more, but in this instance the Government are using the company sector as an intermediary for their borrowing, with all the implications which that has for the future of financial stability and, in the short-term, the implications for our interest rates.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to spend some time on that aspect, because this budget device of raising tomorrow's money from industry today is central and pivotal to the whole budget.  It was the tool used to allow Fianna Fáil to remove everything which was then controversial in the Coalition budget.  They removed every fund-raising aspect of that budget which was found to be unpopular or controversial, by the simple device of taking money from next year.  Doing so will have a disastrous effect on employment and will take exactly £198 million out of a sector which Fianna Fáil themselves have described as the engine of the economy's growth, a sector on which our future depends.</P>
    <P>At this point, it is also necessary to talk about an aspect of this budget which has been brought to our attention in an unprecedented campaign by the Irish Stock Exchange &mdash; a body which has never before involved itself in lobbying of the kind which it feels is necessary now.  If it were not enough to damage industry, particularly the manufacturing sector, by this kind of budget device, the <Col N="1879" /> Minister then turned to the stock exchange.  A 60 per cent capital gains tax on short-term gains will effectively remove the stock exchange as a potential source of funds for industry, one of the main areas to which industry could turn for more cash.</P>
    <P>On the whole area of capital gains, I am certainly among those calling out for penal taxation on land and property speculation and entirely support capital gains tax in that area.  However, in this extraordinarily ill thought-out and heavy-handed budget, the Minister either forgot, or did not care, about the effect of this 60 per cent tax on the stock exchange, a vital tool in the growth of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The stock exchange took the unprecedented step of circularising and visiting TDs and Senators and circularising journalists, because of the extraordinary damage which they feel that this tax will have on the Irish economy.  It is worth mentioning some of the points which they raised.  It will damage the marketability of shares in Irish public companies.  The market in Irish industry and financial companies is not in a position to withstand a gains tax like that proposed.  It will also damage, in time, the market in gilts, in Irish Government securities.  It will make it extremely difficult to raise additional capital for Irish industry through rights issues.  Last year, Irish listed companies raised £110 million by way of new equity.  It will discourage further investment of savings in the form of productive assets.</P>
    <P>The extent of the country's balance of payments deficit has been recognised as a major problem by successive finance Ministers.  This deficit represents an excess of investment over savings, leaving the balance to be borrowed abroad. The proposal to increase the taxation on capital gains, particularly where no indexation relief is allowed at all in the first year, constitutes an additional disincentive to saving.</P>
    <P>It will dilute the State's revenue from other forms of taxation, for example, stamp duty on share dealing.  There will be a strong disincentive to engage in active short-term share dealing, particularly <Col N="1880" /> in one year, and the very narrow tax base in Ireland, which is already narrowing continually, will be eroded as a result. Another important aspect of the effect of this 60 per cent will be the participation of Irish companies in offshore exploration for oil.  The potential income to the investor in this area consists solely of capital gains in excess of the rate of inflation. Therefore, if we have to use our money to finance offshore oil exploration this 60 per cent is punitive.</P>
    <P>There are many other reasons why the 60 per cent capital gains tax on one year gains is damaging; but we must remember that, quite apart from private shareholders, nearly every working person is an indirect shareholder through his pension scheme or life assurance policy. Therefore, contrary to popular opinion, capital gains tax and the stock exchange are not matters for the very few or not of concern to a great many people.  To summarise the fears of people involved in the stock exchange, it is felt that, should the proposals in relation to capital gains tax in the budget be implemented, the stock exchange would cease to be an effective market place, with grave consequent loss to the community and employment.  The revenue raising potential is trifling compared to the damage which will be done.</P>
    <P>I have given some time to the discussion on the problems facing the stock exchange because I believe it is causing ever-widening circles of concern in our manufacturing industry and in business generally.  It was hastily done and I appeal to the Minister for Finance to set up a different scheme to affect only investment in stocks and shares.</P>
    <P>There are some other aspects in the budget which are a disquieting sign of the priorities &mdash; or lack of them &mdash; of Fianna Fáil.  A new tax credit system which was designed by the Coalition Government was unceremoniously ditched.  This was the first real breakthrough in a review of a generally acknowledged unjust tax system. It was a new and fairer way of spreading the burden of taxation across the community.  Why was it ditched?  It was ditched because the Minister said it was administratively impossible this year. I would like to give an example of something <Col N="1881" /> which was administratively possible last week.  The Minister for Finance decided that £45 million would be given back to the taxpayers.  Despite major administrative problems involved in introducing this change in the tax code, the Government have shown that any budgetary proposal, no matter when it might be made in the course of the year, is game for a try, but they could not implement the new tax credit system.  I suspect the reason is simple and has nothing to do with administrative problems &mdash; it is because Fianna Fáil have demonstrated over the years that they cannot bear anybody else to get the credit for a good idea.  We have seen it again and again in the legislative process, in Private Members' Bills and in any item that might come up for public discussion.  I believe that the reason the tax credit system designed by the Coalition was ditched in this budget was because of the vanity of Fianna Fáil.  An opportunity was thrown away to reform the tax system, to set out on a new road towards tax equity and to answer the ongoing anger of taxpayers who feel that nobody knows or cares about their plight.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molony mentioned earlier that a vital component of the tax credit system was thrown out, the recognition for the first time of the fulltime home maker's share in the family income, the famous £9.60.  The Minister not only decided to throw it out, but he did so in very insulting words which were carefully noted by very many people.  He said that the £9.60 weekly payment for spouses who work in the home would not be implemented, that the response to the scheme had illustrated clearly that the general public saw no merit in a cumbersome, complex scheme which merely transferred money from one spouse via the Revenue Commissioners to the other.  The language barely conceals the Minister's distaste for equity in this area.  The Minister does not talk about any substitute for this first recognition of the role of the home maker or any restoration of the principle of that scheme.  His speech echoes the calamitous series of advertisements which Fianna Fáil placed in the national newspapers last June which described the <Col N="1882" /> scheme as robbing Peter to pay Paula. These were disastrous advertisements which summed up the fact that Fianna Fáil know nothing and have learned nothing about how women in the home feel about their lack of financial and legal status.  That £9.60 scheme was introduced as a response to the calls of women's organisations for many years for a first step towards some recognition of the rights of fulltime spouses to family incomes.  It was welcomed by women's organisations and by the Council for the Status of Women who felt that, despite the very small sums involved, it was nevertheless a major first step.</P>

      <P>I should like to remind the Minister that I am making my maiden speech.  The extension of that scheme to the very lowest paid as a family income supplement was also ditched without ceremony by Fianna Fáil.  The extraordinary thing was that the Minister said that the <Col N="1883" /> £4 million, which was to be allocated for the family income supplement and which was part of the £9.60, would be used as a double payment in respect of the children of those in receipt of social welfare payments.  In the subsequent debate on the budget the Minister hotly defended this and said that the £4 million would go to the same people who would have got it anyway, those on social welfare.  That was manifest nonsense, but the Minister seemed unable to understand that one of the points about the supplemental payment was that it would go to families of workers at the lowest pay level.  It was intended to be part of an incentive scheme to keep people from giving up work because they would be better off on social welfare.  The Minister tried to pretend not to understand that.  A double payment to the children of people on social welfare is not the same thing as a supplement to the families of the lowest paid workers.</P>
      <P>In deciding to ditch the tax credit system, the £9.60 a week system and the family income supplement, Fianna Fáil displayed insensitivity to a first step in the right direction in terms of work attendance, and when we were campaigning in the February election it was a feature at the doorsteps that honest, decent, working people displayed extreme unhappiness about the widespread abuse of the social welfare system.  There was a widespread feeling that people would be better off to ask the State to pay them rather than to get up in the morning to go to work: would it not be better for them to have a life of ease because they would have only £9 or £10 more if they were working, and at certain times of the year they would be better off if they were not working?  That system has been generally recognised as making nonsense of State finances.</P>
      <P>The burden of the State in respect of each person not working is enormous compared to the situation if the State did not have to pay persons because they went out to work.  People on the doorsteps were very angry and it became a definite general election issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1884" /> Two actions were taken in the Coalition budget which were eliminated in Fianna Fáil's rush to placate the people. One was the £9.60 family income supplement and the other was the tax on short-term social welfare benefits.  Fianna Fáil turned their back on any attempt to cut out the social welfare system abuses because they wanted to avoid displeasing anybody.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to a statement by Dr. Andrew Rynne that 250,000 health certificates a month are sent to health boards.  He stated that £3 million a month is paid out to those sending in medical certificates.  He believes that £3 million a month, £36 million a year, is going out to healthy people who do not need it.  It amounts to a positive incentive to people to stay out of work because an untaxed PRSI system means that at certain times of the year people gain if they do not work.</P>
    <P>Absenteeism from work in Ireland is six times higher than in Japan and twice the rate in the US.  Deputy Molony earlier spoke about the problems that are worrying Dr. Rynne and I do not propose to repeat them, but I should like to know what do Fianna Fáil intend to do about the well-founded suspicion of abuse.  I do not hope to get an answer because I realise that it is too difficult, too delicate, and would be too unpopular.  It is possibly too much like responsible Government to expect Fianna Fáil to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>At the other end of the scale we have had a new scheme introduced in respect of company cars.  In our budget we tackled the question of company cars and any unfair element in the provision which might give people in managerial capacities too much money outside the tax paying net.  The Fianna Fáil adjustment of that has been a matter of overkill.  Mr. Seán Condon, the Foras Trachtála head, made a speech, reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday, about the vital need to attract and to keep managerial skills in Ireland.  He particularly emphasised the need to attract managers, whereas I particularly stress the need to keep the managers we have.  It is important to look at international figures so that we can compare <Col N="1885" /> the disposable incomes of managers here, in the US and in Great Britain.  In the US, a top manager on £35,000 a year in 1982-83 would have a disposable income of £25,831, nearly £30,000, including the benefit in kind of a car.  The comparable figure in Great Britain is £26,449.  In Ireland it is £19,932.  Therefore, at the top rate of managerial pay there is a difference in disposable income of £5,000 between a manager in the US and Great Britain and in Ireland.  If we follow the rates down the managerial ladder and come to a manager earning £12,000, we find that a manager in the US will have a disposable income of £9,936, in Great Britain £9,448 and here the disposable income would be £8,706, a difference of about £1,000 a year.</P>
    <P>That is another blow to management and progress in industry here.  In their attempt to put together a budget that would appear to please nearly everybody, Fianna Fáil decided to raise money from an area where it would not appear to be unpopular.  In doing so they have laid the seeds of widespread economic damage.  The budget provisions which they said would reduce the Exchequer deficit by £679 million has now been completely abandoned, completely let rip, particularly in the £45 million tax scheme which has been a complete leap backwards. But we have also had concessions to keep mortgage interest rates from going up at all.  So the Government steps in with more guarantees for foreign borrowing. The threat to interest rates has called forward another Fianna Fáil promise to guarantee foreign borrowing up to £200 million.</P>

      <Col N="1886" /> I see that the Minister for Social Welfare is bringing forward a new rate of children's allowances at a cost of £12.5 million which he describes as a mere drop in the ocean in his budget.  This sum is a drop in the ocean of foreign borrowing by Fianna Fáil.  That is the sad truth.  Well may <i>The Irish Times</i> in an editorial say that any remaining vestige of hope that this Government were going to tackle the very grave financial crisis now afflicting this country has disappeared.  It disappeared with the Government's cave-in on the PRSI issue.  Indeed, when Deputy MacSharry came into power he used an extraordinary expression.  He said he foresaw a time of boom and bloom for the Irish economy.  Well may we ask if the kind of measures and the kind of foreign borrowing being indulged in once more by Fianna Fáil will end up with the economy in a state of boom or bust.  As Paul Tansey says in <i>The Irish Times</i>, the odds favour the latter result.  Fianna Fáil are playing fast and loose with Ireland's economic stability, with our international credibility, with the future of young people who have to live and try to work in the atmosphere which politicians will leave behind them.</P>
    <P>But one note of optimism remains.  In the February election it was made quite clear that Fianna Fáil are nearing the end of their dominance of Irish politics.  There are clear signs in this budget and in its dismemberment since that the country's demands have finally caught up with Fianna Fáil and that the foundations for realism laid by the Coalition Government will pay off in the return of the country to a Government who are not afraid to lead.</P>

      <P>While not agreeing with a lot of the content of her speech I would like to congratulate Deputy Hussey on <Col N="1887" /> her maiden speech and wish her well in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>I wish to welcome the proposals which are contained in this budget of 25 March, the main outline of which was accepted by the electorate in the election of 18 February last.  That is a fact which is conveniently forgotten by many people when commenting on the budget.  An election was fought and won by Fianna Fáil on the major content of this budget and certainly on any item of principle. Never before was an election fought with so much detailed knowledge of the alternative budget an Opposition Party were prepared to introduce.  Fianna Fáil were returned to Government following the outcome of the electorate's judgment on the merits of the proposals put before them.  It is quite evident from the election results that the endorsement of the electorate was overwhelmingly in favour of the Fianna Fáil proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the election campaign Deputy O'Leary and his colleagues sat around the Cabinet table and pronounced that the proposals of the January budget were sacrosanct and could not be changed.  Nevertheless when their Government was defeated in this House and a general election ensued the Labour Party members quickly distanced themselves from the more obnoxious proposals which had been contained in that budget.  Fine Gael and Labour, until the downfall of the Government, were totally united in imposing these tax proposals on the population at large, but as soon as the defeat occurred in this House they diverged rapidly.  Statements were issued by the leader of the Opposition, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, that the proposals they had introduced were unalterable and that no detail of them could be changed.  The campaign wore on and the facts of life began to dawn on those gentlemen and we saw a feat of acrobatics that would do justice to Duffy's Circus. I have no doubt that if there are ever any vacancies in that esteemed establishment the two gentlemen in question, by their performance, would easily qualify to take them up.  In contrast, Fianna Fáil spelled <Col N="1888" /> out clearly and positively the proposals they intended to introduce when returned to office, emphatically stating that they would not countenance the Coalition proposals to impose VAT of 18 per cent on clothing and footwear or to impose the draconian measure of removing subsidies from foodstuffs, measures calculated to hit the very poorest sections of the community mosr severely.  Nor were we prepared to engage in the penny-pinching exercise of Deputy Boland in continuing to prohibit the entry into our schools of four-year-old children. The electorate were fully aware of the alternative proposals and accepted them overwhelmingly.</P>
    <P>This budget, even though its broad outline was clearly drawn during the course of the campaign, nevertheless contains a number of innovative features which have been widely welcomed.  I would submit that the job of any budget is to introduce measures to secure and expand employment in the medium and long term, to bring order into the public finances and to promote equity in the tax system specifically to assist the low income families.  These are attributes one would wish for but the achievement of these objectives differ depending on which side of the political divide one stands at a given point in time or how one sees that these objectives should be achieved.  On this side of the House we believe they should be accomplished in a humane, caring fashion.  This is where the two budgets in question, the one which never became fact and this one, differ greatly.  Items which have been widely welcomed include the double payment of social welfare benefits on specified dates in respect of the children of social welfare recipients.  I shall comment later on a point made by Deputy Hussey and others on that matter.  Other items were the issuing of medical cards to recipients of old age pensions, ratification of the situation regarding interest rates on SDA loans, decentralisation of Government Departments and the complete removal of VAT from books.  During the course of my submission I will refer to these and other matters and put before the House the philosophy behind the <Col N="1889" /> Fianna Fáil thinking in introducing these measures.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the budget was constructed in such a manner as would instil confidence into the community at large and at the same time introduce order into the nation's finances.  Its impact and scope have been so designed that the burden will not fall unevenly or heavily on any section of the community. It has been described by some of our more notable commentators in the media as an election budget.  That is a charge I do not deny.  It was an election budget. It was proclaimed before the election and the election was fought and won on it.  It was a budget in which Fianna Fáil and the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, are fulfilling their commitment to the electorate having received their endorsement.  They are carrying out their proposals in full.</P>
    <P>Without question or doubt, and a matter which was admitted by the Opposition parties in the subsequent inquests of their defeat, the major item in the election and the factor which influenced the decision of the electorate&mdash;it also brought about the downfall of the previous administration &mdash; was the ill-conceived attempt to impose a rate of 18 per cent VAT on clothing and footwear.  This above any other measure was an indication of the complete divorcement from reality which members of the previous administration's cabinet indulged in.  Had they been in touch with reality they would never have attempted this measure.  The impact of this measure on a working class family would have been catastrophic and would have brought about a reduction in their standard of living which would not have been compensated for in any way by any alternative measure.  It was as clear a demonstration as was ever needed of the political naivety of Deputies Bruton and FitzGerald.  I am certain these Deputies are now well aware that the political pulse of Ireland does not beat very well in the ranches of County Meath or the mansions of Donnybrook whose respective inhabitants, I would hazard the guess, could have afforded these measures without undue concern and could have afforded the luxury of advocating that they should <Col N="1890" /> be introduced.  However, these people are a small segment of the population.  I have no doubt that they encouraged Deputies FitzGerald and Bruton to continue to live in their dream world totally unaffected by the reality of the ordinary individual's struggle to make ends meet. This would have been made doubly difficult had these proposals been implemented.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton showed scant regard for the consequences of these proposals, either for the unfortunate people who would have had to bear the impost when purchasing clothes and footwear or for the clothing and footwear industries. Coming from a constituency where many people are engaged in these industries and having been until quite recently an employee of a clothing company, I assure the Minister that his proposals to abolish these measures are widely welcomed especially by those whose jobs would have been jeopardised under the Coalition's proposals and whose children faced the prospect of having to make do with hand-me-downs as regards clothing and footwear.  Deputy Bruton appeared to be quite keen to adopt the role of Dr. Who, a popular television character, who travels around in space from time zone to time zone.  In that role Deputy Bruton was prepared to put his time machine into reverse and catapult us all back into a time zone when it was quite common to go to school without shoes.  The only problem was that his colleague, Deputy Boland, wanted to ensure there would be no schools to go to.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that their respective ridiculous measures have not succeeded and that the electorate were wise in their choice.  As a result we are debating the introduction of alternative more realistic and caring proposals.  The imposition of VAT at the point of entry on imports is a welcome measure.  I was amazed that it generated such a lot of irrational and uninformed comment.  During the course of the election campaign I listened to a radio broadcast when Deputy Bruton was commenting on the Fianna Fáil proposal to introduce this measure.  I was astounded to hear a person who was a Minister for Finance suggesting that <Col N="1891" /> these proposals would jeopardise the jobs of workers in the clothing and footwear industries.  I was amazed that he should make such a suggestion or that a Minister for Finance should be so ill-advised and show so little knowledge of the value added tax regulations as to suggest this.  Had he taken a very cursory look at the regulations he would have seen that all component parts of clothing and footwear goods, with the exception of zip fasteners and in some cases fur trimmings, are at present zero-rated and not subject to VAT, so the situation did not arise.</P>
    <P>There is no proposal in this budget, nor was there any proposal in the election programme, to alter the categories of items attracting the various rates of VAT and it is unbelievable that Deputy Bruton should have made such a nonsensical suggestion. I have to presume that, like the proverbial coward, he was whistling past the graveyard, being fully aware of the impact his proposals had made on the electorate.  At the stage when he made his comments he probably was fairly certain of the outcome and was making a last bid to persuade people by some means or other that the Fianna Fáil proposal was dishonest or unworkable.  Neither was true.  This proposal is very honest and workable and should be welcomed by all who have concern for Irish industry and the welfare of our economy at heart.</P>
    <P>I would have imagined that these proposals would be welcomed more readily and enthusiastically than they would appear to be by some commentators.  In particular I refer to a comment in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 26 March from a spokesman on behalf of the CII.  This gentleman was not particularly consistent in his approach but I have to presume that, like a number of other people at the time, it was a case of wanting to have his cake and wanting to eat it.  He stated that they would support the imposition of earlier VAT payments on imports of finished goods but pointed out that these accounts were only one-third of the total imports while the remaining two-thirds comprised materials for further production. <Col N="1892" /> I think that everybody is fully aware that we must import the necessary raw materials for processing into finished goods for consumption on the home market and re-export.  But a cursory glance at the accounts of a number of companies, either private or public, would demonstrate clearly that one of the factors affecting Irish industry and business at the moment is the level of over-stocking that is taking place and a reduction of these levels of stocks should be welcomed by these companies as well as by everybody else.  This new system will force people into deciding whether it is really necessary to carry stocks as large as they have been carrying in the past, and ultimate benefit will result to the companies themselves.</P>
    <P>That is not to ignore the fact that the Minister in his speech acknowledged that a problem might arise in certain industries and to that end he stated that he was prepared to consider &mdash; indeed, he gave a commitment to &mdash; looking at alternative financial arrangements for any company who might face financial difficulties due to these regulations.  If the company is being provided with the facility of the additional interest necessary to finance the payment of VAT at point of entry I cannot see where any valid objection arises.  I would have imagined that the CII, having seen this, would have welcomed a positive move which when implemented would go a long way towards curbing the escalating import excesses.  People on all sides of the House have paid lip service to the need for such measures over very many years and have acknowledged the desirability of reducing this import excess, yet no positive measure has been taken until now to accomplish that.</P>
    <P>I welcome very much this measure of imposing VAT at point of entry.  No bona fide manufacturer or importer should have any fears from this decision.  I believe that the State will gain a tremendous amount of revenue by this mechanism, revenue which under the present system is not making its way into the Exchequer and not contributing to the betterment of all sections of the community. One would need to be living in <Col N="1893" /> a vacuum to be unaware of the &mdash; I hesitate to use the word but feel it is necessary &mdash; rampant abuses of the VAT system and the collection of this revenue, particularly in relation to imported goods, and the advantage that these goods have at present as against the home-produced article.  These proposals to impose VAT payments at point of entry will now confer an advantage on our home-produced products which has been sought and advocated for very many years.  Now that it will be a fact I hope sincerely that those manufacturers at home will take full advantage of their new-found position and avail of the undoubted opportunities which will arise from the slowing down of imports and the creation of additional markets for their products due to the necessity for importers to pay this VAT at point of entry.  While I welcome the proposals, I hope that the Minister for Finance when introducing his Finance Bill, the mechanism governing the implementation of these proposals, will arrange a system which will ensure that abuses will not be capable of perpetration under the new system.</P>
    <P>The proposal is to make VAT payable on the 15th day of the month following the month of importation.  I submit that there is scope here to introduce in a number of instances a system of bonding to ensure that if all the bona fides of the importers are not in order the State will not in any circumstances be deprived of revenue.  At present, once the goods are cleared through the docks, if an importer is not bona fide he may escape scot free and the State will be at the loss of all of the revenue which would have accrued from such transaction.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the question of import deposit schemes generally.  This is not a system which is to be advocated in normal circumstances but many industries vital to the development of the State and its infrastructural facilities are being placed in some difficulty by foreign competition due, perhaps, to an illegal subvention being received by these companies in their native lands.  I refer particularly to Cement Limited, a company of national importance which has a large plant in my <Col N="1894" /> constituency.  There is at present a danger to this firm due to the importation of cheap cement of doubtful quality from doubtful sources.  Without contravening EEC free trade regulations, the relevant Minister might be in a position to introduce a scheme of selected import duty deposits in order to protect a native company from unfair competition.  I say this in the full knowledge that certain Deputies or persons outside the House may object to any curb on trade but we must take cognisance of the fact that this company have invested heavily in plant and equipment in my constituency and in the Limerick constituencies to gear themselves to be capable of producing 100 per cent of the cement and concrete needs of our building and construction industry.  I hope the Minister will consider this suggestion.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion by some Deputies opposite that there was some sleight of hand involved.  Deputy Hussey made this comment.  It shows how little they are aware of financial matters, how small were the attempts they made to understand these matters and also the magnitude of the attempts they made to confuse the electorate by making such suggestions.  The fact that the Minister for Finance intends to introduce these proposals from 1 September means that revenue will accrue to the State and will continue to accrue in the years to come, provided that the Minister or one of his successors does not decide to alter the regulations.  These proposals are fully welcomed on this side of the House in that they will have the double effect of raising revenue which is required to provide social services and infrastructural facilities and will lead to a large reduction in the import excess.</P>
    <P>I now refer briefly to the income tax proposals in the budget and to a number of comments which have been made about them.  The system as advocated by the previous administration of introducing tax credits has been abolished in this budget because of the administrative difficulty and because they may not be inherently correct for the situation existing here.  It begs the question why the previous administration were not prepared <Col N="1895" /> to await the report of the Commission on Taxation before rushing into a system which would not have conferred any great benefits on the majority of people.  I went through the exercise of trying to work out the benefit which would accrue to me under these proposals and I found them incomprehensible. I could not work it out.  Conveniently it was not stated clearly enough to most people that the income tax allowance in respect of children was being abolished and under the proposals for child benefit allowance I or, more correctly, my wife would have had a net gain of 92p per month.  These proposals would not have been of great benefit to anybody and therefore I support the Minister's contention that the time was not correct and that he is right in eliminating the proposals and awaiting the report of the Commission on Taxation.  In the light of that report we will see what can be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hussey referred to an item which has gained undoubted notoriety since June 1981.  The infamous £9.60 per week is probably the joke of the century and its elimination in this budget is unlamented. I believe this was the greatest fraud ever perpetrated on the electorate. Many people foolishly believed that if they were housewives performing the duty of staying at home fulltime the Coalition parties would by some magical means confer on them the benefit of £9.60 per week.  I suppose that to many hard-pressed housewives this was manna from Heaven until their husbands enlightened them that they were getting a commensurate reduction in income.  I have no hesitation in stating my belief that the vast majority of people shed not one tear for the elimination of this ludicrous item which was included in the January budget.  It was unasked for, badly thought out and put across to the public in an improper fashion, and nobody laments its passing.  An indication of the contempt in which it was held was the very poor level of application for it and had there been an opportunity to do so many people would have withdrawn their applications</P>
    <P>In the income tax proposals there is an <Col N="1896" /> item relating to the taxing of benefit in kind.  Some Deputies opposite have expressed indignation at this proposal, suggesting that in some way it would impinge on the ability of industry to recruit the proper calibre of staff for managerial positions.  I think this is an untenable point of view.  If there is to be tax equity we cannot have a situation where a person who is in the privileged position of being provided with a car by his company, and probably with the means of running it, does not pay the appropriate rate of tax on that benefit.  On a conservative estimate that benefit would cost a person between £2,000 and £2,500 per annum.  This kind of situation gives rise to claims of injustice in relation to the operation of the income tax code and has done so during many years.  It is only proper that when people receive benefits of this magnitude they should pay the appropriate rate of tax.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to two other items included in the budget and to ask the Minister to consider the points I put forward. The first refers to relief on personal interest.  This facility has been used extensively by those in a position to do so, namely, by the better off section of the community who had the highest tax bills.  It was a mechanism to reduce their tax liability by incurring as many loans and as much interest as possible within the limits of their resources.  Effectively such people reduced their commitment to society.  Of course people who were not able to do this could not avail of this facility under the income tax code.  It may be said that this is the politics of greed and envy but I do not agree with that.  It is only right that those who can afford to pay should be asked to pay.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to make more clear in the Finance Bill the proposal with regard to mortgage interest.  I understand and accept the thinking behind the restriction in the budget whereby income tax relief will be allowed only in respect of the borrower's only or main residence and that relief will be limited to the 25 per cent or 35 per cent rate as appropriate. However, I put the case of a person currently claiming relief on an existing mortgage who, of necessity, is obliged to <Col N="1897" /> extend his living accommodation because of family size, disability or some other feature.  I ask the Minister to ensure that a person who extends his house for genuine and bona fide reasons will be allowed to claim interest relief on any loan he may have to take out to finance the building of this necessary accommodation. Loans and grants are available through the local authorities to persons in certain categories of disablement for the provision of bathroom and toilet facilities suitable for invalids and those suffering from multiple sclerosis.  It is only right that these people should be allowed to claim on the interest that will arise on the repayment of such loans.  I have no doubt that the Minister will take due notice of this kind of situation and take the appropriate measures.</P>
    <P>The 25 per cent increase in social welfare benefits has been welcomed by all. All parties in this House are agreed that the old, the sick and those incapable of looking after themselves are entitled to the best treatment the State can give and are entitled to an amount that will enable them to live in dignity.  I welcome the implementation of the increases proposed in the budget, particularly the intention to provide a double week's payment in September or October for the child dependents of weekly social welfare recipients.  I welcome the abolition of the tax credit proposals and also the £9.60 per week.  In my opinion, and this view was shared by many, these proposals were nothing but an administrative extravaganza. They would not have contributed one iota to the benefit of the social welfare classes or those in need.</P>
    <P>However, I must raise a matter which is the subject of considerable comment among the public and one that gives rise to heated debate in many cases.  I want to make it clear that I am not suggesting that those in need should not receive a wage that will enable them to live in dignity.  In my early childhood I was reared on a widow's pension.  I know that everyone is entitled to a sense of pride and dignity.  People are entitled to be treated courteously by the State when they fall into circumstances not of their own making.  Having made that clear, I <Col N="1898" /> want to refer to a situation well known to all Deputies but which is one that many do not refer to because of fear of misrepresentation or misinterpretation.  I am talking about the situation that arises during the course of payment of disability benefits, particularly when the flat-rate benefit is coupled with the pay-related element.  I ask the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Social Welfare, to re-examine this area.  I ask him to ensure that the system will not allow a person to obtain more in take-home pay than he would normally receive if he was gainfully employed in his normal occupation.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that under no circumstances am I suggesting that social welfare benefits should be taxed.  The proposal by the previous Administration was wrong because it would not have discriminated between those genuinely in need and those who are not.  Therefore, I would not support the introduction of any system of taxation on social welfare benefits, but I ask the Minister to examine the situation very carefully to ensure that a person in receipt of disability benefit does not receive more in take home pay than if he were working normally.  I acknowledge that a person who is genuinely sick is entitled to get the same amount of money he would get if he were in work but it is quite wrong &mdash; and many people agree with me &mdash; that people should get more money when they are in receipt of disability benefit.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Waterford Factory Redundancies Threat.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me this question on the Adjournment. This is the second factory threatened with redundancies that I have mentioned here today.  This is indicative of the very serious situation that exists in Waterford city and county.  So far as employment is concerned Waterford has become a disaster area.  In recent <Col N="1899" /> years we have seen the closure of a string of old established industries &mdash; Denny's Bacon Factory, Goodbodys, the jute factory, the papermills, the chipboard factory, the CAP factory, Wellworthy's tool-making factory, Gouldings Plastics, Fismar and others.  One of the few remaining long-established businesses in Waterford, the ACEC factory which makes electrical components and equipment, particularly transformers has run into a very rough patch and redundancies are threatened.  Thirty workers have been told they would be put under notice from tomorrow, 30 April.</P>
      <P>In 1978 this company employed 300 people and at present they employ 210. The work force will not be very pleased if there is any further move to increase the number of redundancies.  I am asking the Government to bring pressure on the concerns involved to ensure that the employment content is not reduced further. There are two major industries involved, the ESB, a State-sponsored body, and the parent ACEC company based in Belgium.  It is a sad commentary when we see that this factory's problems arise because of non-investment in up-to-date equipment by the parent company, and as a result, that factory is not in a competitive position.  I am asking the Minister to put pressure on the parent company to up-date the factory and to see that the most modern equipment is installed so that they can be competitive.</P>
      <P>In fairness it must be admitted that a few years ago the parent company set up a new section to manufacture equipment for lighting effects.  That section has been so successful that they can barely keep up with orders.  The major labour content in the factory is involved in the manufacture of large transformers but that section has been run down to the point where the factory is now non-competitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other concern involved is the ESB. We must face the fact that the ESB must buy equipment on the best terms but home industries must be very seriously considered.  If the Government put pressure on the ESB to accept home produced equipment these threatened redundancies <Col N="1900" /> need not take place.  It would be much cheaper for the ESB to pay slightly higher prices for their equipment than for the Government to hand out huge sums of money by way of redundancy, unemployment and pay-related benefits.  I ask the Minister to investigate this.</P>
    <P>This is the only factory in Ireland which manufactures large transformers.  At the same time the ESB stores contain transformers, 80 per cent of which are of foreign origin.  Those transformers are the life blood of the factory in Waterford and that factory is having difficulties at present. It need not be in serious trouble if decisive action is taken in time.</P>
    <P>A new power station is being erected at Moneypoint.  County Clare.  I am told by the ACEC workforce that every transformer for that power station has been imported.  I am told also that 75 per cent of the transformers for the ESB power plant at Tarbert, County Kerry, have been imported.  The greatest irony of all is that in Butlerstown, a few miles outside Waterford city, the ESB in recent months installed a 31.5 MVA transformer costing about £100,000.  That transformer was imported, although the same type of transformer can be manufactured at the ACEC plant in Waterford city and would give up to two months employment.  One can imagine the annoyance and frustration felt by the work force in that factory when they see the ESB importing a product thay can produce but which they do not supply largely due to the fact that their equipment is not modern and up-to-date and therefore they cannot be competitive.</P>
    <P>It is a two-fold problem: poor equipment and a lack of resolve on the part of a semi-State body to endeavour to help home industry which is having difficulties. It is obvious that the ACEC factory and the directors must invest in the transformer division as a matter of urgency.  It is also imperative that the ESB should meet the ACEC management and work out a new contract under which ACEC will be given long-term commitments for the supply of transformers.  That is the short-term and the long-term solution to <Col N="1901" /> the problem.  The Government must halt the import of transformers until such time as the jobs in ACEC are secured.  That is another immediate short-term measure which we should take.</P>
    <P>In essence those are the points of the case I want to make here today.  The Minister was most helpful in his capacity as Minister for Transport and Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in the past.  He has outstanding business acumen.  I would ask him to take a personal interest in the problems of this industry which, as we all recognise, can easily be saved.  I would like the Minister to give a commitment to take that interest and to see that the jobs of 210 people in Waterford are saved.  We cannot afford any further closures or redundancies in that city.  As I said at the outset, it is the unemployment black spot in the whole of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the many problems appearing on the horizon because of the deep recession we are in.  We are trying to fight our way out of the recession. I will do my best to alleviate the problem as far as possible.  I should like to put on record the situation in ACEC from the information available to me.</P>
      <P>ACEC Ireland Ltd. are a wholly owned subsidiary of ACEC, Belgium, which in turn are 49 per cent owned by the Westinghouse Electrical Group. Westinghouse have a number of other factories in this country.  ACEC Ireland Ltd. were established here in 1951 to manufacture small transformers for the ESB rural electrification scheme and, since that time, the company have experienced steady growth to the extent that they now operate three separate divisions: transformer manufacture and fluorescent lighting in Waterford, and engineering and switchgear manufacture in Dublin.  The company employs about 280 workers of which 230 are employed in Waterford and 118 in the transformer division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 1 April the company notified the IDA and the Department of Labour that they intended to make about 25 workers redundant over the next few months due to a general decline in business.  These <Col N="1902" /> redundancies would be spread over the whole organisation.  During the previous recession the company were also forced to shed workers but, when the recession passed, they immediately began to expand and diversified into fluorescent light manufacture and switchgear manufacture. In their recent discussions with the IDA the company indicated that they were examining the possibility of moving into a higher technology area and they were also pressing the parent company in Belgium to transfer certain manufacturing processes to this country.</P>
    <P>The workers have been alleging that ACEC have failed, down through the years, to modernise their plant and that this is the reason why their transformers are no longer competitive.  To me this allegation seems to be without foundation. In December 1979 the IDA approved a grant towards capital expenditure of almost £1.5 million for the expansion and modernisation of the transformer division in Waterford.  In June 1979 a grant for the expansion and modernisation of the lighting division was approved.  Prior to 1979 the company had been approved IDA grants for various re-equipment projects estimated to cost in excess of £270,000.  The company also availed of various R &amp; D grants.  In the past month the company put proposals to the IDA for the computerisation of the production processes at the factory.  It is expected that implementation of these proposals will result in increased competitiveness and thus help to safeguard employment in the factory.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that ACEC are acting in a most responsible manner in trying to overcome their present difficulties, difficulties which are common to many managements throughout thhe country, where the classic situation arises of a drop in sales and a contraction in the market and, at the same time rising costs.  The question is what action they should take for the long-term well-being of the company. The small reduction in staff at this stage will probably ensure continued employment for the remaining work force and the long-term liability of this project in Waterford.  Since their establishment here the company have shown <Col N="1903" /> that they have the capability of overcoming adversity, and I have no doubt that they will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to what Deputy Deasy had to say about the ESB large transformers.  Deputy Deasy and the work force can be assured that I will take up this matter personally with the ESB from tomorrow morning onwards.  Whatever action can be taken within the capability of purchasing power should be taken.  I have said this many times in the short time I have been Minister for Industry and Energy.  I have taken a particular interest in the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sell Irish&rdquo; campaigns.  When I was in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs I initiated moves to show people in small and medium sized industries what products were needed, in what volume, and for what length of time.  The exhibitions I held in various provincial towns resulted in £3 million worth of business being kept at home in less than one year.</P>
    <P>I have had a message from Mr. Moriarty in relation to some of the points raised by Deputy Deasy.  He says that what was in the papers yesterday was incorrect.  The ESB are buying the vast <Col N="1904" /> bulk of distribution transformers in Ireland from ACEC and Unidare.  ACEC have no complaints about the ESB purchasing policy in relation to their products.  I got a note to that effect since the Deputy started to speak.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked me to take a personal interest in this matter and I certainly will.  I will speak again to the chief executive of the ESB and try to find out what the facts are.  The Deputy, the workers and the House may be assured that I will spare no effort.  I realise that we are in difficult economic circumstances. Nobody will solve our problems for us.  It is up to us to solve them.  It is up to management to take the action they feel is right for the long-term solutions of their problems.  It is up to the Government to take any decisions they can to help in these difficult circumstances.  Problems are there to be solved.  It is the essence of good management and of good Government to produce whatever solutions can be found.  We cannot do it in isolation. We need a co-operative effort and I will be working along those lines in this ministry.</P>

Inquiries made at the time revealed a conflict of evidence about the nature and origin of the incapacity and further investigation of the claim was necessary before a decision could be made.</P>
      <P>In the meantime disability benefit was paid as an interim measure, from 18 February 1981, fourth day of incapacity. When he had completed the period of 52 weeks in receipt of disability benefit in mid-February 1982 there was a delay in payment while inquiries were being made to establish whether he was entitled to further payment.

      <P>The person concerned reached age 65 years on 11 April 1981 and claimed retirement pension on 9 July 1981.  He was not entitled to a pension under the Social Welfare Acts as he had less than 156 paid contributions to his credit in this country since his entry into insurance.  As he had been employed in Great Britain his entitlement to a pro-rata pension under EEC Regulations was examined but while the total of Irish and British contributions was adequate he had less than the minimum of 52 Irish contributions required to qualify for such pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime the claimant was awarded a retirement pension by the British Department of Health and Social Security in respect of himself and his wife on the basis solely of his British insurance and the question of the payment of an increase in respect of his children was under consideration.  On completion of the necessary inquiries the arrears of retirement pension in respect of the four children were sent to him by the British Ministry on 11 April 1982.  He also had further contributions in this country which brought his total of contributions to the required minimum of 52 contributions and on attaining pension age of 66 years on 11 April 1982 he became entitled to a <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory pension from my Department in addition <Col N="1848" /> to his British retirement pension.  He is therefore qualified for an increase of Irish pension at the full rate in respect of his children from my Department as from that date.  The increase of British pension has however ceased to be payable, as a person in receipt of a <i>pro rata</i> pension from two EEC countries may receive the increase of pension only in respect of dependent children from the country of residence.</P>

On completion of the inquiries it was accepted that his incapacity for work arose out of his employment and his claim for injury benefit was allowed.</P>
      <P>The claim was adjusted on the basis of the decision regarding the occupational accident, and all injury benefit due to 1 February 1982, after which date he was certified fit to resume work, has been paid.

      <P>The person concerned was paid flat-rate unemployment benefit at the weekly rate of £22.25 and as this sum exceeds 85 per cent of her earnings, namely £16.09, pay-related benefit is not payable in her case.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 20 October 1981 and was paid from 23 October, fourth day of incapacity, to 29 December 1981, after which date payment was discontinued following a review of her claim.  At that stage it was discovered that she had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited in the 1979-80 contribution year which governed her claim and that she was not entitled to the payments which had been made to her.

It has since been established that she had sufficient weeks of insurable employment to entitle her to payment of benefit from 4 January 1982.

The allowance was awarded with effect from 16 November 1979.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions for payment of the prescribed relative allowance requires that no person other than the prescribed relative should reside with the incapacitated pensioner but when the local social welfare officer visited the household in January 1982 he found that, in addition to the daughter in respect of whom the prescribed relative allowance was being paid, there was also a son of the pensioner living in the house.

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 26 December 1981.  His title to benefit depended upon his insurance record in the 1979-80 contribution year in respect of the period up <Col N="1855" /> to 2 January 1982 and on the 1980-81 contribution year from 4 January 1982. As. according to the records of my Department, he had not the required minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited in either of those years he was not entitled to payment.</P>
      <P>Following inquiries, which proved protracted, it was ascertained that he had in fact been employed for 24 weeks in the 1979-80 year and for 40 weeks in the 1980-81 year.  He is, therefore, entitled to disability benefit from 4 January 1982 and payment of all benefit due to 24 April, less supplementary welfare allowance advanced, has been made.  He is not entitled to pay-related benefit.</P>

Payment of all disability benefit and pay-related benefit was made to 10 February, after which date he was certified fit to resume work.  There was a delay in payment for the period 3 February to 10 February as the final certificate on this claim was misfiled in my Department.</P>

All disability benefit and pay-related benefit due has been paid to 23 April.

The delay in delivery was caused by industrial action at Connolly Station which commenced on the night of 29-30 March 1982.

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 4 January 1982 and has been paid at the maximum appropriate rate from 7 January, fourth day of incapacity.  All disability benefit due has been paid to 27 March 1982, after which date he was certified fit to resume work.</P>
      <P>He is not entitled to pay-related benefit as the weekly rate of disability benefit payable exceeded the amount of his reckonable weekly earnings in 1979-80, the relevant tax year on which his entitlement to pay-related benefit was based.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 17 February 1982. He was not entitled to payment as, according to the records of my Department, he has less than the required minimum of 26 contributions, paid or credited, in 1980-81, the contribution year governing his claim.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of the Deputy's question the employers were contacted and they intimated that the claimant was employed as a sub-contractor in 1980-81 and that PRSI contributions had not been paid as the employment was regarded as not insurable.  The matter is being referred for urgent investigation by an official of my Department and on completion of the inquiries entitlement to benefit will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit in respect of an accident at work on 17 February 1982. He continued to work to 20 February 1982 after the accident.</P>
      <P>Before payment could be authorised it was necessary to make inquiries regarding the nature and origin of the incapacity.</P>
      <P>On completion of the inquiries it was accepted that the incapacity was in fact due to an accident at work.  Payment has now been made in respect of the period from 22 February 1982 to the 28 April 1982, date of the latest medical certificate received.  In addition payment of pay-related benefit has been made from 8 March 1982, thirteenth day of incapacity.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 14 December 1981, and was paid from 17 December 1981, fourth day of incapacity, at the maximum appropriate rate.  All disability benefit and pay-related benefit due to 30 December 1981, after which date he was certified fit to resume work, has been issued.</P>
      <P>The delay in payment was due to the failure of the claimant to obtain and forward medical evidence promptly to my Department.  The initial medical certificate, dated 14 December 1981, was not obtained from the claimant's medical certifier until 21 December 1981, and was not received in my Department until 30 December 1981.  The final certificate dated 30 December 1981 was not received until 15 January 1982.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit from 11 May 1982 and was paid from that date to 7 November 1981, at which stage his title to injury benefit ceased as he had been paid for the maximum statutory period of 26 weeks.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to 7 November 1981 the claim was treated as one for disability benefit and payment issued regularly on receipt of medical evidence of incapacity to 29 January 1982.  Payment ceased at that stage as the claimant did not furnish weekly medical evidence to my Department. A further medical certificate covering the period 9 November 1981 to 24 March 1982 was received on 31 March 1982 and payment to 24 March 1982 was then issued.  No further medical evidence has been received since that date.</P>
      <P>The claimant has been advised that it is necessary to forward medical evidence of incapacity at weekly intervals to my Department.</P>
