      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That Dáil Éireann approves the following regulations in draft:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pigs and Bacor Act, 1935 (Part II) (No. 8) Regulations, 1982 and Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, <Col N="1544" /> 1930 (Exporters' Licences) (Fees) Regulations, 1982.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. L. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. L. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. L. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>These proposed regulations would increase the fees payable in respect of cattle, horses, sheep and pigs presented for veterinary inspection under the Fresh Meat Acts and the Pigs and Bacon Acts.  The present rates of fees are quite inadequate to meet the cost of the veterinary inspection service provided by my Department and it is necessary that they be brought more into line with that cost.  It is proposed to raise the fee for cattle from £1 to £1.75 per head, for sheep from 17p to 30p per head, and for horses from 5p to £1.75 per head. In the case of pigs the increase would be from 0.01p to 50p per head.</P>
      <P>Hitherto no charge has been made for the veterinary inspection of live animals before export.  That inspection and the veterinary inspection at export slaughtering premises are both carried out by my Department's veterinary service and it is appropriate that both trades should contribute equally to the cost of the inspection facilities provided.  Accordingly, in order to ensure that there is equivalence of treatment between the export trade in live animals and that in meat I have introduced an identical fee in respect of the veterinary inspection service provided by my Department for animals exported live by sea or by air or across the land frontier for export from Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to 31 December 1980 the fee for pigs was 25p.  At that time the pigmeat industry was going through a difficult period and the Government decided that they would reduce exceptionally the level of fee from 25p to 0.01p per pig for the years 1981 and 1982.  This represented an annual relief of about £500,000.  It was envisaged that the industry would co-operate in centralised marketing through the Pigs and Bacon Commission and would pay to that body an administrative levy of 65p per pig.  However, following on a decision by the Court of Justice in Luxembourg and a Supreme Court decision here, which ruled against the charging of a statutory levy, the commission <Col N="1545" /> were effectively left without a source of revenue to enable them to function.</P>
    <P>The Government remain firmly of the opinion that centralised marketing is essential in the long-term interests of the pigmeat industry.  Because of the reasons I have outlined, however, this can be done only on a voluntary basis.  I am pleased, therefore, that the industry itself has decided to take over completely the running of the Pigs and Bacon Commission since 5 April.  To enable the restructured organisation to get off the ground with a clean slate, the Government for their part have taken over responsibility for the accumulated deficit of some £5.6 million of the old Pigs and Bacon Commission and I will be introducing a Supplementary Estimate later to provide for this.  In undertaking to clear this deficit the Government made it clear to the industry that a fee for veterinary inspection services would be reimposed on pigs and hence the draft regulation now before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The cost of providing the veterinary inspection service at meat export plants has increased steadily over the years. This is mainly attributable to increased salaries and inflation as well as to some expansion in the industry generally and increased diversification.  The cost has risen steeply in the past few years and the position now is that the present fees are much less than adequate to meet the cost of the service.</P>
    <P>The new rate of fees are expected to bring in £3.1 million in a calendar year while the cost of the meat inspection is estimated at £4.4 million.  When they are viewed in the context of the present-day values of livestock the rates of fees are very modest.  The veterinary inspection service is a vital element in our meat export business.  Without satisfactory veterinary supervision and certification our products simply will not be accepted abroad and as major meat exporters we must ensure that our products meet the highest standards of hygiene demanded by the customer.  It seems only reasonable that these interests which benefit directly from the service should bear the cost.</P>
    <P>I propose to bring the increase into <Col N="1546" /> effect on 31 May 1982.  The proposed increases have been cleared by the National Prices Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say at the outset that we support the proposals put forward by the Minister of State.  These are matters we intended to bring forward during our period in office and for that reason I concur with the reasoning outlined by the Minister.  However, I would like to add something to the very brief outline he gave of the reasons for taking this action.</P>
      <P>In relation to the pig industry, the levy now proposed at 50p per head is reasonable and the revenue from that in a full year at our present level of slaughterings would be in region of £1 million, which I understand, would not be sufficient to cover the total cost of the veterinary inspection at the piggery factories.  It appears that in spite of the fact that this levy is being applied, the full cost of the veterinary inspection is not being borne by the industry and to that extent it still represents a measure of support for the industry which I agree is justified in the present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the efforts being made in a sense to rationalise and update the position of the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  He referred very briefly to the fact that decisions of the European Court in relation to the collection of fees have created difficulties for that commission and for its financing through traditional channels.  I am very glad the discussions have proceeded and I gather from the Minister that they have been brought to a very wide measure of agreement as to how we approach this problem.  I remember that at the time when Bord Bainne were turned into a co-op having been a State sector organisation before that, the transformation was made because it was believed &mdash; and I think rightly &mdash; at the time that the status enjoyed by Bord Bainne and the methods by which they were financed were no longer fully in keeping with the rules and regulations of the European Community.  It has been very clear since Bord Bainne became a co-op that they retained all the dynamism they had <Col N="1547" /> shown up to then, retained their ability to deal in a very adequate, in a very positive way with the requirements for exporting one of our major products.</P>
    <P>At the time there was some discussion as to whether we should not do the same thing about the Pigs and Bacon Commission. It was decided for a number of reasons that it would not be appropriate to adopt the same approach.  Personally, I regretted that because I felt that the same logic applied to the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  Unfortunately, this was one of the cases where hindsight would prove those who held that opinion to have been right, because there is no doubt that over the last three years there have been serious difficulties in running the Pigs and Bacon Commission which call for a major change in the approach to running and financing the commission. That is why I took the particular approach that is now being followed by the Minister.  I hope that the arrangement he has outlined here &mdash; I can understand why he did not wish to go into it in a great deal of detail for very obvious reasons &mdash; will prove possible and that it will work out on the lines we have planned.</P>
    <P>On the beef side, we have a proposal to increase the veterinary inspection levy to £1.75, that is the levy that already exists in the beef factories, and also to apply the same level of levies in respect of veterinary inspection of live cattle exports.  As the Minister said, that will remove an anomaly which exists in the trade at present under which a fee is payable in respect of cattle slaughtered at meat export premises but no fee is payable on similar cattle exported live. This has been one of the irritants in the trade which has led to the claim that live cattle exports are being more favourably treated than exports of carcase meats or processed meats, There is, as the Minister said, a case for ensuring that some part of the cost of providing the service is met by the industry in question.  There is an external pressure on us in that it is becoming more and more the practice in the European Community to insist that the cost of such services be borne by the products concerned.  The figure of £1.75 <Col N="1548" /> per head on the figures which the Minister has presented would not seem to be entirely adequate to cover the total cost of the veterinary inspection, but to the extent that there is a difference I think it is justifiable in present circumstances that the State should continue to bear part of the cost.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that in the application of levy to live exports we have removed one of the areas of discrimination which had been felt as an obstacle by the meat factories.  I would also say &mdash; I hope the Minister will follow this line &mdash; that we have removed one of the possible tangents in the argument, because the Minister is well aware that this is one of the reasons brought forward by the meat industry for saying that it is in a difficult position, that it is being discriminated against in terms of competition.  I would never have felt, and I think the Minister would agree, that this particular difference was a major source of irritation; but now that we have equality of treatment I hope we will be able to focus the discussion of that important problem on the real issues involved which seem to me to have very little to do with veterinary fees.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I repeat that I support these measures for the reasons I have outlined and I hope the Minister will be able to pursue to a successful conclusion the action being taken on a wider basis on the Pigs and Bacon Commission.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his acceptance of this measure which was in preparation, I understand, before we took office.  I have always felt, like the Deputy, that the levy did not have a great bearing on live exports. Now, that the difference is removed at least there they will not have that excuse any longer.  It is true that the increase in fees will not meet the total cost but it will go a long way towards it and that is important.  I thank the Deputy for his co-operation.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Molaim go léifear an Bille an Dara hUair.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Bille an-tábhachtach don tír an Bille seo, tábhachtach do fhorbairt shoisialta agus eacnamaíochta na tíre.  Sa tsean córas tá cuid mhaith dul ar aghaidh déanta againn, ach táimid sásta go leanfar ar aghaidh leis an fhorbairt sin agus go gcuirfear leis le córas nua, le pleananna nua agus le smaointe nua.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill in a number of respects.  It has major implications for the future of postal and telecommunications services &mdash; two vital parts of the national infrastructure serving the economic and social needs of the whole community; for the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs; and for central Government finances.  The Bill provides for the transfer of the control and the management of postal and telecommunications services from the Minister and the Government to two new State-sponsored companies &mdash; An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  This involves transferring almost all of the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, comprising about 30,000 people and representing nearly half of the civil service, to the State-sponsored sector.  Only a small number of the present staff of the Department will be needed to deal with certain residual and policy functions which the Minister will retain.  The financial effect will be to remove from the central Government finances most of the expenditure on the two services.  In the 1982 Estimates for Public Services the gross estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is £613.5 million, including £238.5 million in respect of borrowing for the Telecommunications Development Programme.  It is the third largest of the 51 services listed and it accounts for over 11 per cent of the gross Estimates for Public Services as a whole. The purpose of the reorganisation is to give the public better postal and telecommunications services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before commenting on this Bill, which is designed to implement the reorganisation <Col N="1550" /> of postal and telecommunications services, it is fitting that I should give some background information about the two services and about the factors which contributed to the decision to wind up the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, as we now know it, and to hand over virtually all of its functions to the State-sponsored sector.</P>
    <P>Control of the Post Office was taken over by the new Irish State in 1922, so that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is one of our oldest Government Departments.  The postal service at that stage was well established.  The basic mail services were substantially the same as those in operation today.  They provided for collection, conveyance and delivery of letters, post cards, printed papers, newspapers and parcels.</P>
    <P>The telegraph service was also fairly well developed.  It was the major telecommunications service at that time.  The telephone service was still in its infancy. There were less than 20,000 telephones connected to a completely manual system and many parts of the country had no telephone service at all.  It was undeveloped and unsatisfactory, even by the standards of its time.  In the 60 years since 1922, telecommunications have been the major growth area.  That service is now considerably larger than the postal service in terms of revenue-earning capacity, numbers of staff employed and the amount of money invested in it.</P>
    <P>In 1979 the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Pádraig Faulkner, announced the decision to launch the Accelerated Telecommunications Development Programme covering the years 1980 to 1984 inclusive.  In their report which was published in 1979, the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group, about which I will comment in some detail later on, described the telephone service as being in a state of crisis.  There was shortage of spare capacity in the system due to under-investment over a long period and growing demands for service as the economy recovered from the recession in the mid-seventies.  By mid-1979 the service was at an all-time low and public awareness, particularly among the business community, of the importance for <Col N="1551" /> the country's economy of a high quality telephone service was sharpened.  The need for further heavy investment to bring our telephone service up to the level of that in other EEC countries was widely recognised.  Furthermore, the service had just emerged from a prolonged period of industrial unrest.  The Government's recognition of the need for remedial action culminated in the launching of the five-year development programme for 1980 to 1984 inclusive.  The programme had been prepared independently of the review body's report but that report confirmed that the programme was on the right lines.</P>
    <P>In the initial period of the programme, priority had to be given &mdash; and this is important &mdash; to providing the base necessary for expansion; that is, getting sites, providing buildings and designing and ordering telephone exchanges and trunk systems.  This is inevitably a lengthy process. The final design of buildings cannot be settled until sites are available, and to have a building of the type required to house a major telephone exchange within 18 months to two years from the time design work starts is a major accomplishment. However, as a result of various exceptional measures taken in collaboration with the Office of Public Works to speed up the provision of buildings, some of the special design exchanges required for the early stages of the programme have already been completed and work on most of the remainder is well advanced.  Each telephone exchange has to be designed to meet the needs of the area it serves.  This has to be done with care and following detailed analysis of the projected traffic levels.  Design, manufacture, installation and commissioning of the equipment takes at least a year-and-a-half.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from this that major improvements in the quality of the service could not have been expected before now.  But much has been achieved and the next two years should see a major breakthrough in raising the standard of service arising from the infrastructural work done or in hand.  Already the opening of a new trunk exchange in Dublin <Col N="1552" /> early last year and the substantial quantities of extra trunk circuits provided from it resulted in a reduction from 30 per cent to 20 per cent in the trunk call failure rate over most of the major routes out of Dublin.  A major extension of this exchange and a large new digital exchange will be brought into service before the end of this year.  These exchanges should provide sufficient capacity for the Dublin trunk exchange system for some time ahead.</P>
    <P>A major new trunk exchange became operational recently in Cork.  New digital exchanges were opened in Athlone and Ceanannus Mór last December and one in Bantry recently.  These will be followed progressively over the course of the current year by new exchanges at centres such as Naas, Galway, Athy, Carrick-on-Shannon, Drogheda, Ennis, Limerick, Sligo and Tralee.  All the key trunk centres in the country should be relieved by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>Extension of trunk exchanges must be accompanied by a corresponding strengthening of the trunk routes.  Much has already been achieved here.  Additional circuits have been brought into use over most of the major routes.  New microwave link systems have been provided on the Dublin-Sligo route, which will be extended to Letterkenny shortly, on the Dublin-Arklow, Dublin-Wicklow, Dublin-Athlone, Dublin-Waterford routes and on the cross-channel route. Work on a number of other microwave link systems is in hand or has been contracted for.  These include Dublin-Cork, Dublin-Limerick, Dublin-Galway, Cork-Waterford, Limerick-Tralee, Limerick-Portlaoise and Galway-Tuam. The capacity of many co-axial cables is also being increased and numbers of these are expected to be completed in the current year.  These include the Dublin-Navan-Drogheda cable, Castlebar-Westport, Cavan-Mullingar, Tralee-Dingle, Athlone-Ferbane-Banagher, Portlaoise-Carlow, Youghal-Midleton, Killarney-Kenmare and Newport-Achill Sound. Many smaller schemes are also in progress and planned.</P>
    <P>It will be evident from the examples I have given that we are well on the way to <Col N="1553" /> a resolution of the congestion problems in the trunk network, and the country can look forward to a greatly improved trunk service over the course of this year. There should be a continuing improvement next year.</P>
    <P>Subject to some minor exceptions, subscriber dialling of calls to Northern Ireland and Britain is at present limited to the Belfast area and to Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, London and Manchester.  Following detailed studies in consultation with British Telecom, arrangements are now being made which will lead to subscriber trunk dialling being extended to Northern Ireland generally shortly and to Britain generally beginning towards the end of this year with completion in the second half of next year.</P>
    <P>The programme for conversion of the remaining 430 manual exchanges to automatic working is being pressed ahead and all exchanges should be converted to automatic by the end of 1984 as planned.</P>
    <P>Turning to the provision of telephones for those who want them, the rate of installation has been increased from 32,000 in 1979 to 62,000 in 1980 and to almost 70,000 last year.  This year the target is to instal up to 90,000 telephones. The waiting list which had been growing for many years, was reduced in 1981 by 5,000 and this year should drop substantially. Already, the waiting list has been wiped out at many centres such as Athlone, Ballyshannon, Carlow, Killarney, Lifford, Limerick, Listowel, Nenagh, Tipperary and Shannon as well as in parts of our major cities.  By the end of this year there should be no waiting list in much of the Limerick, Waterford, Portlaoise and Sligo engineering districts, all of which extend over a number of counties, and in a growing proportion of the major cities and urban areas.  There is no reason why telephones should not be available generally on demand throughout the country by the end of 1984 as planned.</P>
    <P>The waiting list for telex has been virtually eliminated in the country generally outside Dublin and, with the current rate of installation in Dublin, it should be possible to get into a similar position <Col N="1554" /> there this year.</P>
    <P>A special effort is being made this year, too, to overtake the waiting list for data lines and achievement of this should be well on the way by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The present state of development of the telephone service might therefore be summarised as follows.  As of now there are over 700,000 telephones installed in the country, representing about 21 per 100 of the population.  This appears low as compared with most of the other member states in the EEC, where the number of telephones per 100 of the population in 1979 was 48 in the UK and 41, 43, 32 and 35 in France, Germany, Italy and Belgium respectively.  However, the position here is not directly comparable. Allowance must be made for the larger number of persons per household on average in Ireland and the high proportion of young people in our population. But, even allowing for these factors, the scope for further growth is considerable.</P>
    <P>About 91 per cent of the telephone system is automatic internally and about 65 per cent of subscribers can dial international calls without help from an operator. As I mentioned earlier, automatic subscriber trunk dialling will be extended during 1982 and 1983 to all Northern Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>About 40 per cent of applications for telephones are being met on demand at present and, under programmes already in hand or at an advanced planning stage, telephones should be available generally on demand in the whole country by the end of 1984.</P>
    <P>The network of trunk circuits and trunk and subscriber exchanges has been vastly expanded and capacity for future growth throughout the system has either been provided or is in course of provision. When the five year accelerated programme which was launched in 1980 is completed, roughly 30 per cent of subscriber exchange capacity and 50 per cent of trunk exchange capacity will comprise electronic equipment of the most up to date kind.  In fact it will be one of the most advanced telecommunications networks, technologically speaking, in <Col N="1555" /> Europe.</P>
    <P>The quality of service on local telephone calls is generally satisfactory with an average success rate of 97.5 per cent. On subscriber dialled trunk calls the position is not yet satisfactory, with an average success rate of about 80 per cent, but extensions to the trunk network to which I referred earlier, which are already in course of provision or planned, should result in a rapid and sustained improvement over the next year or two, and I expect that there should be a 90 per cent success rate in most areas by the end of 1983.  The international service is generally satisfactory.</P>
    <P>On the telex side there are about 6,100 installations at present, representing 17 per 10,000 of the population.  This compares very favourably with our European partners.  The service is fully automatic internally and virtually fully automatic to other countries.  The quality of service is good, the only less than satisfactory feature being the waiting list in Dublin which, as I have already explained, should be cleared soon.</P>
    <P>That is a bird's eye view of the present state of development of the main telecommunications services which will be handed over to Bord Telecom Éireann when this legislation is enacted.  While there is still much to be done to complete the current programme and while development will, of course, be necessary on a continuing basis after that, it will be evident from what has been said that the ground work for a first class service has been well and truly laid.  Indeed, the major task of Bord Telecom Éireann, as I see it, will be to raise the general level of efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the service so that this country will not only have good telecommunications services but will have them at the most competitive prices possible.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the fact that the postal service taken over by the State in 1922 was well established, the mail services being substantially the same as those in operation today.  Because of the relatively developed nature of the service, its history since then has been one of modest growth as compared with <Col N="1556" /> the more spectacular growth in the case of telecommunications.</P>
    <P>The postal service employs 11,500 people at present including over 2,000 postmasters on a contract basis.  The two major services provided by it are collection, conveyance and delivery of mail, including parcels, and the counter services available at all post offices.  Over 400 million items of mail are processed annually and deliveries are made to over 800,000 addresses, ranging from deliveries in our cities to the most isolated homesteads. By arrangements made at international level, letters from Ireland are conveyed and delivered around the world just as letters from places as far apart as Alaska and Australia are delivered here by Irish postmen.  Our postal network for collection, conveyance and delivery of mail.</P>
    <P>A great variety of services are provided at post office counters where transactions valued at about £1,300 million are handled. Apart from services directly related to posts such as sale of stamps, posting of letters and so on, one can buy a television licence, a dog licence or wet-time social insurance stamps, send a telegram, pay a telephone bill, collect children's allowances or old age pensions, invest money in State savings services, or withdraw money already invested, to mention but a few.  The range and variety of services handled by the staff at post office counters is probably greater than in any institution, whether private or public, providing counter services.  This country-wide network of offices and the staff who serve in them is one of the great strengths of the postal service and one of its most valuable assets.</P>
    <P>On the mails side the long-established standard of service aimed at is to deliver 90 per cent of first class mail on the day after posting and the balance on the following day.  The standards for second class mail&mdash;for example, e.g. newspapers, post cards and so on&mdash;is generally the same as for first class mail, but handling of second class mail may be deferred if this is necessary to ensure due course treatment of first class mail.  In the case of parcels the standard aimed at is to deliver 95 per cent on the second day <Col N="1557" /> after posting, the balance being delivered the following day.  In their report in 1977 the Post Office Users' Council concluded from their own checks on the internal service that the overall quality of the mail service was high, that we were fortunate to have such a good service and that it should be husbanded jealously.  Two years later, in 1979, the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group confirmed this. They stated that such international comparisons as they could make suggested that the range and quality of the service was high in normal circumstances.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately abnormal circumstances arose around this time owing to the prolonged industrial problems to which I referred earlier.  This resulted in a deterioration in the quality of the service. Unremitting efforts have been made since then to bring the standard of the service back to its former excellence. Those attempts have had some success but the standard at present being achieved still falls somewhat short of target. In 1981 an average of about 84 per cent of first class letters were delivered on the next working day after posting as compared with the standard of 90 per cent aimed at and previously achieved.</P>
    <P>The service also suffered fairly substantial losses of traffic in 1979 and 1980 but growth was resumed in 1981 when traffic achieved a modest increase of about 1 per cent.  However, there was a fall off towards the end of the year after the second increase in charges and it is not yet clear whether the 1981 level of traffic will be maintained this year.  The economic recession and the increases in charges which it was necessary to introduce in 1981 were probably the major contributory causes.</P>
    <P>Only a high quality service, sustained over a prolonged period, will restore full public confidence in the service and enable it to resume and improve on the growth achieved in the past.  It will be one of the major tasks of An Post to achieve this by building on what has already been accomplished by my Department, and I am confident from consultations I have had with them that they will do just that.</P>
    <P>In tackling this task, the company will <Col N="1558" /> be faced with a number of problems: the unsocial hours of work necessary to get mail delivered on time; traffic congestion mainly in Dublin and Cork; the sensitivity of the service to industrial action, not only from within but also in other organisations; use of containers to convey cross-channel parcel and foreign surface mail and a possible threat to mail volumes arising from developments in communications technology.  There is no need to go into details about these problems except perhaps to refer to the possible threat posed by developments in communications technology.</P>
    <P>In the medium and long term, the company will have to respond to the growing challenges which electronic communications will present.  The developing telecommunications sector and the increasing importance of the time factor in many business and economic transactions are creating demands for quicker services within a relatively small part of the mail market. This is where the greatest challenge to traditional mail services lies, but it is also an area of great opportunity for the new company.  It will have to go out and win a share of the market in services which new communications technology will make possible.</P>
    <P>A start has been made by my Department in developing high speed conveyance and delivery services and the new Expresspost and Faxpost services will be ready for introduction shortly.  Express-post will provide for hand to hand deliveries within hours in the major cities and between these cities on the same day. Faxpost will use the most up to date technology to transmit messages in minutes between public offices in Dublin and Cork and Britain, the USA and Canada. These services should provide a sound foundation on which An Post can build to meet the developing needs of customers in years to come.</P>
    <P>There is one other area which I should mention where the future will pose threats but will also offer valuable opportunities; that is the sub-post office system which has served the community so admirably up to now.</P>
    <P>The sub-post office system has made it possible to provide Post Office counter <Col N="1559" /> services which are readily accessible throughout the State.  The system of remuneration of postmasters who run sub-post offices is related to the volume of work handled in the office subject to minimum annual payments.</P>
    <P>The amount of work handled in sub-post offices has been reduced over the years arising from developments within the Department and in agency services provided by them for other Departments. Examples of these are conversion of manual telephone exchanges to automatic working, rationalisation of postal services by motorisation, introduction of the scheme of pay-related social insurance contributions deducted from income and membership of the European Monetary System and the break in parity with sterling.  All of these have resulted in a loss of business to the sub-office system but the availability of this nation-wide network of offices offers great opportunities for the future.  I know that An Post are very conscious of this &mdash; I have discussed it in some detail with them &mdash; and they will no doubt devote considerable attention to the maintenance and development of it.  I have great hope for it.</P>
    <P>So much for the services themselves. The organisational framework within which they were managed was considered by two independent commissions in recent years: by the Public Services Organisation Review Group chaired by Dr. Devlin in the sixties and by the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group chaired by Dr. Dargan towards the end of the seventies.</P>
    <P>The Public Services Organisation Review Group issued their report in 1969.  They recommended a radical structural reorganisation of the civil service based primarily on the concept of providing separate structures for policy formulation and for execution of policy.  As regards the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, they suggested that a &ldquo;Posts and Telecommunications Office&rdquo; responsible for day-to-day management of postal and telecommunications services should be set up as an &ldquo;Executive Unit&rdquo; of a new Department of Transport and <Col N="1560" /> Communications.  The group commented that there was little to differentiate between the combination of social and economic functions of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the tasks of State-sponsored bodies such as the ESB or CIE, and they listed a number of differences between postal and telecommunications services which pointed to the desirability of separation of the two services.  They suggested that the operation of the two services in a single unit should be kept under review and that the merits of full commercial operation should also be kept under consideration.</P>
    <P>The next major step came in July 1978 when the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Faulkner, set up the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group under the chairmanship of Dr. Michael Dargan.  The group's terms of references were:</P>
    <P>1.  To examine and report on the feasibility of giving to the telecommunications service such form of autonomous organisation as is likely to be most effective in meeting current public demand and providing for future development and expansion; and to make specific proposals regarding the nature, powers, and functions of the organisation recommended.</P>
    <P>2.  To examine and report on the organisational arrangements necessary to secure the modernisation of the postal system so as to promote an efficient delivery system nationwide.</P>
    <P>In their report, which was submitted less than a year later, at the end of May 1979, the group found that the postal and telecommunications services were separate and distinct businesses in their own right. They analysed their strengths and weaknesses and their prospects for the future, in the context of their vital importance for the social and business life of the community.  They decided that the shortcomings and inefficiencies they had identified were primarily structural arising in part from under-investment and in part from an inadequate organisational structure plus lack of managerial freedom.</P>
    <P>The Group considered various organisational <Col N="1561" /> options, including the &ldquo;Executive Unit&rdquo; as recommended by the Devlin Group, private enterprise, competition and a State-sponsored body.  They referred to the absence of a statutory basis for an &ldquo;Executive Unit&rdquo;; there was no fully developed model in operation on a statutory basis.  While accepting that it would be an improvement on the existing type of organisation, they felt that it would fall far short of providing the freedom needed to manage the service as a commercial enterprise.</P>
    <P>On the private enterprise option, the group adverted to the formidable opposition which a proposal to hand over the telecommunications service to private enterprise would generate; to the extent of State investment in this very large business which is deeply rooted in the public sector; and to the probable lengthy negotiations that would be necessary should a solution on these lines be favoured. They were of the view that control, as distinct from management, of both posts and telecommunications should be exercised through a public sector instrument which would point to the need for a State-sponsored body in any event.  They ruled out private enterprise involvement in either service as part of this reorganisation.</P>
    <P>On the question of competition they concluded that the telecommunications network is a natural monopoly for a country of our size, but, as I will refer to later, they recommended a modification of the monopoly in regard to supply and maintenance of equipment in subscribers' premises.  In the case of the postal service they considered that selective competition, if uncontrolled, could undermine the viability of the national postal system.</P>
    <P>The group finally came down in favour of the State-sponsored body as an established organisational model which is potentially flexible and adaptable.  They recommended it as the most suitable form of organisation to meet the current needs of both services.  They also came to the view that the circumstances of the two services required their separation.  It is worth quoting from the portion of the report which outlines why they reached <Col N="1562" /> this conclusion:</P>
    <P>Each service is a major commercial enterprise in its own right.  Each service faces grave problems but the problems are essentially different and require different approaches.  The telecommunications services are so seriously inadequate and the problems of development, from the present base, are so formidable as to require the full-time, single-minded attention of a commercially motivated board and chief executive. Organisational links with a major and fundamentally different service would be a distraction and would also carry the risk of a spillover of problems.  The link also gives rise to risk of cross-subsidisation between the services.  The management of the very large, labour-intensive postal service also demands the full-time, single-minded attention of its own commercially motivated board and chief executive. In a sense it faces more difficult problems than the telecommunications service, which will enjoy natural growth for many years to come.  The postal service will require the highest skills of marketing, imagination and innovation in the immediate future.  In the longer term the service faces technological change which seems likely to have major impact on its volume of business and profound implications for pricing, profitability, personnel and marketing.  The planning and retraining task ahead will be a heavy responsibility.</P>
    <P>Finally, the group considered what type of State-sponsored organisation would create the most suitable environment for tackling the management tasks facing the new bodies.  They favoured the statutory company because it seemed to be more flexible than the statutory corporation, it provided the opportunity for private participation on an equity basis to any extent that might be favoured in the future and it might also provide greater freedom and flexibility in the management of the enterprises along commercial lines.</P>
    <P>That is a brief summary of a detailed and comprehensive report which, I have <Col N="1563" /> no doubt, will continue to be studied by those responsible for postal and telecommunications services for many years to come.  I will be referring to other aspects of the report when I come to deal with certain sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In July 1979 the Government of the day announced their acceptance in principle of the basic recommendations of the review group's report and in May 1980 they issued a Green Paper containing proposals in general terms regarding the duties, responsibilities and powers of the new statutory bodies, the residual powers that would be reserved to central Government and the broad implications for the staff of the Department of the setting up of separate State-sponsored bodies for posts and telecommunications. Comments or representations relating to the Green Paper were invited.</P>
    <P>A White Paper &mdash; Reorganisation of Postal and Telecommunications Services &mdash; was issued by the Government in May 1981.  It contained decisions on the various aspects of the reorganisation and promised that legislation based on it would be introduced in the Oireachtas later on.  The Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill, 1982 which is before the House is designed to implement that White Paper.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the Bill, I should like to comment on one very important aspect of the reorganisation which can be settled by legislation only to a limited extent.  I refer to the implications for the staff of my Department.  Chapter 10 of the White Paper contains details of the main aspects of the reorganisation about which staff unions and associations expressed concern on behalf of their members in their submissions on the Green Paper and during the course of subsequent discussions with officials of my Department.  They were concerned primarily that staff should be given the option of moving to the State-sponsored sector or remaining in the civil service; that the transfer to the State-sponsored bodies would not result in any worsening of the superannuation benefits applicable to them as civil servants; that pension entitlements already earned would be <Col N="1564" /> protected; that the pay and conditions enjoyed by the staff prior to the changeover would be safeguarded and that their security of tenure would not be adversely affected.  Concern was also expressed about promotion opportunities; about the type of procedures for negotiating pay and conditions that will apply in the companies and about the pay and conditions of service in the new employment.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains two important safeguards for the staff.  Section 43 protects their position in relation to superannuation and section 42 protects them against a worsening of pay and conditions enjoyed immediately before the transfer to the State-sponsored sector.  In addition, under section 16 each company will be required to set up machinery for negotiation of pay and conditions of service with their staff and section 32 provides for election of employee directors to the boards of the two companies.  I am glad to have been able to meet the staff's requirements on those important issues. As for the rest, consultations with recognised staff unions and associations have been under way for some time past.  They will be continued during the course of the next few months and everything possible will be done to ease the changeover for the staff, consistent with the realities inherent in the reorganisation.  These are that the staff of my Department account for roughly half of the civil service and the work they are doing will be transferred to the new State-sponsored companies. The residual functions being retained in the civil service are minimal by comparison.  Accordingly, it will be possible for only a very small fraction of the staff to remain in the civil service &mdash; probably not more than 100 to 200 of almost 30,000 employed by the Department at present.</P>
    <P>I now come to the Bill, which is divided into seven Parts.  The first Part, comprising sections 1 to 8, contains general provisions. Section 1 contains the short title of the Bill and section 2 defines terms used in the Bill.  Section 3 contains the usual provisions about laying of orders and regulations made under the Bill before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for application of <Col N="1565" /> standard penalties to persons guilty of offences under the Bill as enacted.  Section 5 empowers the postal and telecommunications companies to bring and prosecute summary proceedings in respect of offences under the Bill as enacted and in respect of offences under Post Office Acts, Telegraph Acts, Savings Bank Acts and other Acts relevant to the day-to-day operation of postal, telecommunications and savings services. The type of offences involved are interference with the mail, obstruction of post office business or staff, unauthorised disclosure of the content of postal or telecommunications messages, fraudulent use of the telecommunications system, breaches of the exclusive privilege of either company and so on.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may also bring proceedings under the section in respect of breaches of either company's exclusive privilege.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides in accordance with standard practice that the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Act will be borne by the Exchequer.  Sections 7 and 8 provide for the repeal and amendment of the various enactments listed in the Third and Fourth Schedules to the Bill.  In addition, section 8 empowers the Minister to adapt any enactment as necessary to give full effect to the assignment of functions under the Bill as enacted.  He must do so by order, such orders being laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas under section 3.  The consent of the Minister responsible for an enactment which he proposes to adapt must also be obtained under the section.</P>
    <P>Part II, comprising sections 9 to 36, deals with the establishment of the two new companies, An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  Section 9 requires the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, to have the two new companies registered and to nominate the vesting day of the companies.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that the names of the two new companies shall be An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann and that they may dispense with the use of &ldquo;limited&rdquo; or &ldquo;teoranta&rdquo; in their titles.  It also lays down the maximum authorised share capital of <Col N="1566" /> each company.  This section together with sections 18, 27 and 29 covers the main elements of the financial arrangements decided on by the Government for the two new bodies.  I will deal with this question in a composite form when I have dealt with all the sections in this Part of the Bill and before I move on to Part III.</P>
    <P>Section 11 lays down that the memorandum of association of each company must be consistent with this Bill when enacted and be subject to the approval of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Section 12 lays down the principal objects of An Post which it must include in its memorandum of association.  These are to meet the industrial, commercial and social needs of the State for efficient postal services and to provide a money and postal order service and counter services for the company's own business and for Government.  It also has the object of providing consultancy services at home and abroad.  The principal functions of Bord Telecom Éireann as laid down in section 14 are to meet the industrial, commercial and social needs of the State for efficient telecommunications services and to provide consultancy services at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 and 15 contain the duties of the two companies in relation to financial matters.  They must pay their way and their charges must be kept at the minimum consistent with meeting approved financial targets.  Approved financial targets will be formulated by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in consultation with the companies and with the consent of the Minister for Finance, under section 104(5) of the Bill.  These targets will be settled in the context of the companies' rolling development plans normally covering a period of five years.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides that the articles of association of the two companies must be consistent with the Bill as enacted and must be approved by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Finance and, where appropriate, the Minister for the Public Service.  The articles must contain specified provisions about the number of directors, appointment and remuneration of directors and <Col N="1567" /> appointment of an auditor.  These are standard in the case of a State-owned company.  The section also requires each company to set up machinery for negotiation of pay and conditions of service of staff and that the approval of the Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs and Finance will be necessary for investment in any other undertaking.  Under section 17 no changes can be made in the memorandum or articles of association of either company except with the prior approval of the same Ministers and the Minister for the Public Service where appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 18 requires the two companies to issue shares to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in consideration for assets being transferred to them.  I will deal with this in detail later on.</P>
    <P>Sections 19 to 25 contain routine provisions about shares in the companies. Under section 19 one share in the share capital of each company must be issued to each subscriber to the memorandum of association of that company, the cost of such shares being borne by the Exchequer.  Section 20 prohibits the issue of shares, except those provided for in the Bill, except with the consent of the Minister who must consult the Minister for Finance.  The Minister may take up shares in the company and exercise the normal rights of a shareholder under section 21.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides that the cost of any shares acquired by the Minister will be borne by the Exchequer; that the Minister for Finance may borrow money to meet such costs; that such borrowed money must be paid into the Exchequer and that the cost of this borrowing would be a charge on the Exchequer.  These sections are enabling only.  It is not envisaged at present that there will be any issue of shares in either company except those provided for in the Bill.  The two companies will be wholly State-owned. Should it be decided at some future date to have a public issue of shares in either company, amending legislation would be proposed to increase the authorised share capital of the company in question.</P>
    <P>Section 23 requires persons who hold shares in either company as nominees of <Col N="1568" /> the Minister to pay any dividends received to the Minister and to transfer the shares in accordance with his instructions. Any sums received from the companies by way of dividends must be paid into the Exchequer or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer under section 24.</P>
    <P>Sections 25 and 26 deal with borrowing by the companies.  They are on standard lines.  Under section 25 the approval of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Finance will be required by the companies for borrowing for capital purposes, an upper limit for such borrowing being laid down.  Section 26 empowers the Minister for Finance to guarantee borrowing by either company. Similar provisions can be found in the legislation dealing with other State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides enabling power for the Minister for Finance to provide an amount not exceeding £50 million for postal capital works and to make grants to An Post of an amount not exceeding £20 million for current expenditure in the first three years after the vesting day.</P>
    <P>Section 28 contains a standard provision that moneys becoming payable by the Minister for Finance under the two foregoing sections, 26 and 27, will be advanced from the Central Fund.  Section 29 lays down the amounts to be provided for each company from the Central Fund for working capital purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 30 and 31 deal with the furnishing by the companies of annual reports and accounts which the Minister must lay before each House of the Oireachtas.  These sections are also on standard lines except for one innovation. Under section 31 both companies will be required to include in their annual reports information about the cost effectiveness of their operations in a form to be decided by the Minister in consultation with the companies and with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Section 32 deals with employee directors. In addition to providing that one-third of the directors of each company must be persons elected in accordance with the provisions of the Bill as enacted, the section deals with the period of <Col N="1569" /> appointment of these directors, filling of casual vacancies and specifies that elections must be held within 12 months after the vesting day, or later if this is agreed jointly by the company and recognised staff unions and associations, and that subsequent elections must be held every three years.</P>
    <P>The procedures for the holding of elections are set out in detail in Part I of the First Schedule to the Bill.  The provisions are on the same general lines as those applicable under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977.  Section 33 is allied to section 32.  It provides that employee directors will receive the same remuneration as other directors and that their pay as employees will not be affected by their part-time directorships of the companies.</P>
    <P>Section 34 provides for disclosure by directors of either company of certain interests.  Section 35 contains the usual prohibition on any member of either House of the Oireachtas or of the Assembly of the European Communities being a director of either company.  It also provides that, if a member of the staff of either company is nominated for election or becomes a member of the Dáil, the Seanad, or the Assembly of the European Communities, he must be seconded without pay from his employment with the company.  This too is standard.</P>
    <P>Section 36 provides for the appointment, as Chief Executives of the companies, of persons serving as Chief Executives of An Post and An Bord Telecom immediately before the vesting day.</P>
    <P>As promised, before moving on to Part III of the Bill, it is appropriate that I should comment in a fair amount of detail on the financial arrangements proposed for the two new bodies.  But before doing so there is one financial aspect of the reorganisation which is not dealt with in the Bill to which I would like to refer. That is the question of superannuation.</P>
    <P>The staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who will be transferred to the State-sponsored sector under the reorganisation are civil servants whose superannuation is governed at present by the Civil Service superannuation code. The outgo on pensions of former employees <Col N="1570" /> of the Department in 1981 amounted to £11.9 million and the provision for 1982 is £14.3 million.  The cost is borne on the Vote of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>An up-to-date actuarial investigation was carried out recently to determine the pension liability in respect of existing and former staff of the Department.  The findings were that the capital liability in respect of pensions of former employees of the Department amounts to almost £78 million and the capital liability in respect of superannuation benefits applicable up to 1982 of staff of the Department to be transferred to the State-sponsored bodies amounts to about £311 million.  It would be normal practice under the Civil Service superannuation code for the Exchequer to accept liability for this.</P>
    <P>However, the proposed transfer of the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to the State-sponsored sector is unique in two respects: its scale, and the fact that the revenue earned by the Department from postal and telecommunications services has traditionally met all or most of the costs of running the Department including the cost of pensions of former civil servants who had been employed in it.  If normal procedures under the superannuation code were followed, there would be a heavy and continuing draw on the Exchequer as from the vesting day, in respect of pensions of existing retired Post Office employees and in respect of the pre-vesting day service of transferred staff who retire after the vesting day.</P>
    <P>It is obviously desirable to avoid this immediate drain on the Exchequer particularly in present financial circumstances. Accordingly the Government have decided that the Exchequer will accept liability for existing pension costs and the accrued superannuation benefits of staff to be transferred to the new bodies on a contingent basis.  The arrangements will be as follows.</P>
    <P>The two companies will be required to make provision only to cover superannuation liability in respect of post-vesting day service of the staff transferred to them from my Department.  Actuarial advice is that in the case of posts this <Col N="1571" /> would amount to 16.8 per cent of payroll and 16.0 per cent of payroll in the case of telecommunications.  For many years these amounts will far exceed each company's share of the pensions of staff who retire after the vesting day.  Rather than have all of these excess funds tied up in their pension funds, the companies will be required to bear the cost of pensions of virtually all former employees of the Department and the full cost of superannuation in respect of staff retiring after the vesting day.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer Contingent Liability Fund will be drawn on when in any year the pension outgo of either company could not be met from its pension fund. Actuarial advice is that this situation is not likely to arise for about 30 years assuming that there is no significant reduction in the number of staff employed by either body.</P>
    <P>This proposal is fair both to the companies, to the Exchequer and to the general taxpayer who would otherwise have to bear the cost of Exchequer contributions in respect of superannuation benefits. It is to be expected that by the time the Exchequer Contingent Liability Fund is being drawn on, probably in about 30 years or so, both companies will be paying dividends to the State which should offset, in whole or in part, the Exchequer contributions towards the pension costs. The proposal also safeguards the position of the staff.</P>
    <P>One final point.  The annual provision which the companies will be required to make in respect of superannuation which, as I have said, represents 16.8 per cent of payroll in the case of posts &mdash; somewhat larger because of the age grouping &mdash; and 16 per cent in the case of telecommunications compares with 9.5 per cent of payroll provided for in the Post Office Commercial Accounts at present.  The net effect of the higher provision in respect of pensions to be made by the companies is that their projected outturn for 1982 is less favourable than it would be if the existing provision were maintained.  I will return to this aspect later.</P>
    <P>So much for the pensions aspect.  As <Col N="1572" /> regards other financial aspects, the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group Report and the Government White Paper on the reorganisation contained certain guidelines.</P>
    <P>In their report, the Review Group recommended that the capital structure of the new telecommunications company should be appropriate to a commercial enterprise; that it should recognise the major development needs of the new organisation and be designed to provide a balance sheet with sufficient equity to enable it to attract debt capital at home and abroad.  Their terms of reference did not require the group to deal with this question so far as the postal service is concerned.  The White Paper recognised the need for a postal development programme and the fact that it was likely to be some time before the postal service would be in a position to finance the investment needed for such a programme. It was stated that it was proposed to make capital available from the Exchequer for this purpose and that the form in which this capital would be made available would be dealt with in the draft legislation.</P>
    <P>In the case of telecommunications, the White Paper recognised the need for continued large injections of capital into the service.  However, it stated that the telecommunications company would be in a more favourable position than the postal company because of the unfilled and expanding market for telecommunications facilities; that the company should be in a position to generate a considerable amount of the money required to finance its development programme from its own resources within a relatively short period and that it should not require further advances from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Government have accordingly decided on the following financial arrangements for the two companies. Taking the postal company first, it is proposed that the assets appropriate to the service which are valued at about £30 million based on current costs at end 1981 will be assigned to the company in exchange for shares equal in nominal value to the value of the assets.  As provided for in section 18 the initial capital <Col N="1573" /> structure of the company will accordingly consist of 100 per cent equity capital.</P>
    <P>This does not involve a draw on the Exchequer.  Funds for investment in the postal services were met from the Vote of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs so that postal assets are debt free.</P>
    <P>Under section 29 of the Bill, it is proposed to provide working capital not exceeding £8.5 million for the company in exchange for shares equal in nominal value to the amount provided.  £8.5 million is the estimated working capital required by the postal service in 1982. The amount actually provided will depend on the net current assets of the service on the vesting day.  This may be less than £8.5 million but it will not be more than this figure.  This does not involve a new liability for the Exchequer nor will it involve a net draw on State funds.  It has always been the practice to meet the working capital requirements of the postal and telecommunications services from the Exchequer on a non-cost basis.  The value of the net current assets on the vesting day will cover the Exchequer liability in regard to the working capital.</P>
    <P>Projections of the financial outturn for An Post have been prepared assuming fairly optimistic growth in mail volumes over the 5-year period starting on the vesting day, that further increases in pay and in charges will no more than keep pace with the rate of inflation, taking one year with another and allowing for a provision of 16.8 per cent in respect of superannuation as compared with 9.5 per cent provided for in the Post Office Commercial Accounts at present.  On this basis the company would be in a loss-making situation for about four to five years before making any provision to finance development works.</P>
    <P>To put this in perspective, it must be remembered that the commercial accounts for the service have shown large deficits for the last few years.  The recent increase in charges was designed to ensure that the service would break even this year.  The main reason for the deficits projected now is the higher provision in respect of superannuation which, as I mentioned earlier, is based on actuarial <Col N="1574" /> advice and represents the amount needed to cover the company's liability in respect of service of staff after the vesting day.</P>
    <P>On the face of it, the obvious solution would be to increase charges further to meet the projected deficits.  However, there is a limit beyond which increases in charges become counter productive. While postal traffic had not been unduly sensitive to price increases in the past, there was a significant fall-off in traffic after the increases introduced in October 1981 and the recent increase is likely to prevent any quick recovery.  Further increases over and above the rate of inflation in the future might well result in a situation of diminishing returns.  Moreover the present level of charges is higher than in most if not all countries with which we are competing in export markets. The company will have to look to other means than rate increases to get back into a profitable position.  These include improving the quality of service in order to attract higher mail volumes, more cost-effective operations, imaginative marketing, acquisition of new profitable business, and so on, but it would be unrealistic to expect the new company to achieve instant results.</P>
    <P>Accordingly the Government have decided to provide enabling power for the Minister for Finance to make an amount not exceeding a total of £20 million available from the Exchequer by way of grants to meet current expenditure for a period of not more than three years of a five year development programme.  The extent to which grants will be made available to the company under this enabling power will be decided by the Government in the light of a five year development or corporate plan which the company will be expected to produce at the earliest possible date.  I will return to this later.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from the foregoing that it would be very difficult for the company to arrange for financing of a development programme itself.  This was recognised in the White Paper.  Accordingly the Bill contains enabling power to make available not more than £50 million from the Exchequer for postal development, either in exchange for shares in the company <Col N="1575" /> or by loan or a combination of these.  The amount that will be provided by the Exchequer under this enabling power and the method of financing will be decided by the Government in the light of the five year plan to which I referred earlier.  It is expected that this plan will contain details of pricing and marketing policies; development projects proposed, the capital costs involved and the return expected from such investment; proposals designed to gain new profitable business, to improve the quality of the service and to increase mail volumes and the strategies designed to achieve the full economic viability of the service within a period not exceeding five years.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the Government recognise that there is a strong case for providing some assistance for the postal service during an initial five year development period.  When a development plan is produced by the company the enabling provisions in section 27 of the Bill will be activated to provide the assistance deemed necessary and practicable by the Government.</P>
    <P>Lest the foregoing might be interpreted as indicating a lack of confidence in the potential of the postal service, I would like to place on record my conviction that the service has considerable potential for profitable development.  My meetings with An Post and the chief executive have convinced me that this is so.  Developments in communications technology may pose a threat to mail volumes in the future.  However this threat if it materialises can damage the service only if An Post does not win a proportionate share of the market in services made possible by the new technology. Moreover many postal administrations are now optimistic about the prospect of growth in mail volumes at least for the rest of this decade.  Some have achieved remarkable growth in recent years and are planning for continuing growth.  All these have been studied by the board.  The prospects in this country are potentially quite favourable.  We have an increasing population and a potential for further economic development, <Col N="1576" /> while existing levels of posting are relatively low compared with other developed countries.  I have repeated this a couple of times already and this will show the importance attached to it.  The countrywide network of post offices is also a very valuable asset.  Given the more favourable environment which a State-sponsored company offer, there is no reason why the postal service here should not be a profitable venture within a relatively short period.  I will go on now to discuss the financial arrangements for Bord Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>In the case of telecommunications we are dealing with a different type of service.  It is highly capital intensive.  The value of telecommunications assets at the end of 1981 amounted to about £660 million based on historical costs and £1,080 million at current costs.  By the end of 1982 the current value of the fixed assets is expected to reach over £1,350 million. Some £250 million of this amount will have been financed by way of loan or leasing arrangements with Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited by the end of 1982.  The balance of the assets were financed over the years by  of repayable advances made available by the Exchequer under the Telecommunications Capital Acts, 1924 to 1981.</P>
    <P>Repayment of and interest on the advances was provided for in the annual Vote of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  The nett sum outstanding at the end of 1981 amounted to a total of £630 million and this should reach about £710 million by end 1982.  The repayment and interest charges for 1982 is £82 million which will increase to £96 million in 1983.</P>
    <P>As in the case of the postal service, working capital of not more than £130 million will be made available from the Exchequer under section 29 in exchange for shares in Bord Telecom Éireann equal in nominal value to the amount provided but this will not involve a net draw on the Exchequer.  The net current assets of the service in 1982 which are estimated at £130 million will be available to offset the Exchequer liability.</P>
    <P>The total assets of the service, fixed and current, should amount to about <Col N="1577" /> £1,480 million at end 1982 of which some £495 million will be debt-free.  Of the remaining £985 million, £710 million represent Exchequer loans and £275 million represent loans with accumulated interest charges negotiated by Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited.  If the debt-free assets only were assigned to Bord Telecom Éireann in exchange for shares in the company, the debt-equity ratio at the end of this year would be 2:1. This would involve no change in the method of financing the service up to now.  Development has been financed by repayable loans, the repayment of the loan charges being a charge annually on the Vote of my Department.  I mentioned already £82 million for this year and £96 million for 1983.  The commercial accounts of the service have been drawn up on the same basis.  A 2:1 debt equity ratio would not be unsatisfactory for a State-sponsored company operating a public monopoly and having available to it a State guarantee of its borrowing as provided for in the Bill which is before the House.</P>
    <P>However, there are the facts that continued heavy capital investment will be needed for development of telecommunications services within the foreseeable future and that charges on the £985 million loan capital would be a continuing heavy drain on current income, as would the increased pension provision which I mentioned earlier.  The service would probably be in deficit for a number of years and, as Bord Telecom Éireann will be expected to operate on the basis that no further assistance will be available to it from the Exchequer, it would have to borrow to finance these deficits as well as the heavy borrowing needed to meet development works.</P>
    <P>Having considered the position, the Government decided that it would be undesirable to set up the company under such arrangements.  It would be contrary to the recommendations of the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group and to the guidelines laid down in the White Paper on the reorganisation.  It is accordingly proposed to transfer £355 million worth of assets covered by Exchequer loans plus the debt-free assets to the company in <Col N="1578" /> exchange for shares equal in nominal value to that amount.  This will give Bord Telecom Éireann a debt-equity ratio of about 1 : 1.35 at the end of 1982.  This will be a much more favourable financial structure than has applied to the service in the past.  It will involve a reduction for the company of £48 million in current expenditure in 1983.  £48 million is exactly 50 per cent of the £96 million I mentioned a moment ago and £355 million is 50 per cent of the £96 million I mentioned. The loan charges on the £355 million will be a charge on the Exchequer but the company will be required to pay dividends in respect of State shares which over a period of, at most, ten years will at least equal the loan charges.  Thereafter the annual dividends will be expected to be at a level which will provide a net gain to the Exchequer in return for the valuable State assets being assigned to Bord Telecom Éireann under the reorganisation.  The amount of dividends to be paid will be decided by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and Finance in consultation with the company. They will form part of the financial targets which will be laid down in accordance with section 104 of the Bill to which I will refer in greater detail later.  It is a very important and new kind of section.</P>
    <P>The potential gains to the Exchequer are considerable.  Apart from the net gains expected from dividend payments, the company should be in a position to fund from internal sources a rapidly increasing proportion of the capital needed for development purposes.  This would result in a proportionate reduction in the overall public sector borrowing which would otherwise be necessary. Because of the improved environment available to it, Bord Telecom Éireann should be in a position to achieve more rapid development and improvement of the service than has been possible for my Department owing to the constraints inherent in management of a commercial enterprise within a civil service structure. Users of the service will reap the benefit from this.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputies will agree that the Government have achieved a reasonable <Col N="1579" /> compromise between the desirability of launching these two major new State-sponsored bodies under the most favourable financial arrangements practicable and the constraints of the present budgetary position.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill, comprising sections 37 to 58, contains a number of miscellaneous provisions which apply to both companies.</P>
    <P>Section 37 provides for the vesting of land and buildings appropriate to the postal and telecommunications services in the two new companies as from the vesting day.  Section 38 provides for vesting of other property appropriate to the two services in the companies.  I have already dealt with the financial basis for transfer of these assets.</P>
    <P>All rights and liabilities of the Minister under any contracts or commitments made by him or by others on his behalf in relation to the functions being assigned to the companies will be transferred to An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann under section 39.  Examples of typical contracts or commitments covered by this section would include contracts for purchase of equipment or for provision of services, commitments to purchase sites, or to provide facilities such as telephone kiosks or letter boxes.</P>
    <P>Section 40 provides that vesting in the companies of property in accordance with the provisions of the Bill as enacted will be exempt from stamp duty and section 41 empowers both companies to acquire land compulsorily subject to compensation and with provision for arbitration in the event of a dispute.  The same type of provisions can be found in other similar legislation.  Section 41 also protects the companies against compulsory acquisition of their land by others and it provides that neither company may acquire State lands or wayleave rights over State lands except with the consent of the appropriate Minister.</P>
    <P>Sections 42 and 43 provide a statutory guarantee for the staff to be transferred that the pay, conditions and superannuation provisions applicable to them immediately before the vesting day may not be worsened in their new employment.  Section <Col N="1580" /> 42 also provides that existing pay and conditions will remain unchanged until such time as they were varied by the companies following consultation with recognised staff unions and associations and section 43 requires the companies to prepare superannuation schemes for the grant of pensions, gratuities and other allowances for their staff.  These schemes are subject to the approval of the Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs and the Public Service.  This is standard in the case of pension schemes of State-sponsored bodies.  The two sections contain other provisions of a technical nature which it is not necessary to go into at this stage.</P>
    <P>Section 44 empowers the trustees or managers of the Rowland Hill Benevolent Fund to provide for members of the two companies from the fund.  This fund which is peculiar to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is funded by subscriptions from the staff.  It helps out members of the staff and their dependants who are in need.  A second benevolent fund &mdash; the Post Office Sanatoria Fund &mdash; is covered by the section also should it be necessary for the managers to avail of the enabling power in it.</P>
    <P>Sections 45 and 46 deal with the establishment and functions of users' councils for each of the two services.  They are on the general lines envisaged in the White Paper.  These in turn were based broadly on the functions of the existing Post Office Users' Council who were set up in 1974.  There is one important modification. The existing council have no functions in relation to charges and it was envisaged in paragraph 7.6 of the White Paper that the new statutory councils would not have any function in relation to charges either.  However, I am proposing that under section 46 the councils would have the function of considering charges as appropriate.  They would also have the function of advising the Minister or the companies on any matter in respect of which he or the companies may seek advice.  My intention is to seek the advice of the two statutory users' councils on applications for increases in charges by the companies.  I will comment further on this when I come to section 49.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1581" /> The other detailed provisions about the two councils contained in these two sections can be discussed in Committee.</P>
    <P>Section 47 requires the Minister to set up statutory interim boards for postal and telecommunications services when this Bill is enacted.  In effect what is involved is conferring statutory status on the two existing non-statutory interim boards, An Bord Poist and An Bord Telecom. They will have the same functions as they have at present, that is, to prepare for the change over to State-sponsored status but the Minister may delegate other functions to them.  There is no legal basis for delegation of any functions to the present non-statutory boards so that legally the Minister is responsible for all of their actions.  It is clearly desirable in the interim period between enactment of the legislation and the setting up of the two companies that the Minister should have no function in regard to, or responsibility for, decisions by the boards in relation to matters applicable to the day-to-day management of the new companies which will be their sole prerogative after the vesting day.</P>
    <P>Section 48 contains novel provisions. It deals with a situation in which the Minister considers that in the public interest and by virtue of the statutory responsibility of either company in relation to provision of postal and telecommunications services, certain services should be provided or maintained even though they are loss-making but the company's interpretation of its statutory obligations is that the service in question need not be provided or maintained.  In this situation the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance may direct the company to provide the service and the company must comply.  However, if the company demonstrates to the Minister that the services are loss-making over a period of at least 12 months and that provision for these losses was not allowed for in any previous increase in charges, the Minister must certify that the service was provided or maintained under a direction issued by him and this certificate would automatically entitle the company to increase its charges to make up for the losses involved.  While the section <Col N="1582" /> does not go as far as recommended by the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group, it does establish the principle that the company should not be required to carry loss-making services provided by direction of a Minister without compensation in the form of an increase in charges.</P>
    <P>Section 49 provides that the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972 and the monopoly provisions of the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978 will not apply to activities carried out by either company under the exclusive privileges granted to them under sections 60 and 83.  It also provides that the Prices Acts will not apply to the companies. Traditionally, statutory functions of State-sponsored bodies have been exempt from all the provisions of the Restrictive Practices and Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Acts.  For example, provision of transport services provided by CIE, supply of electricity and so on are exempt.  It was decided by the Government that, in the interests of consumer protection, a blanket exemption of this kind should not be granted to the State-sponsored postal and telecommunications bodies.  Instead, the exemptions will apply only to the exclusive privilege portion of their activities and they are not being given any exemption from the mergers and take-overs provisions of the 1978 Act.</P>
    <P>The Government also decided that the Prices Acts should not apply to the companies. This does not mean that increases in charges will not be controlled or will not have to be fully justified.  Sections 67 and 86 provide that increases in charges will be subject to the consent of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I have already referred to the fact that the users' councils will be empowered to consider proposals for increases in postal and telecommunications charges for services within the companies' exclusive privileges. The companies will be required to supply information on request to the councils about any plans they may have in this regard under section 46 and, as I said earlier, my intention is to seek the advice of the users' councils on any proposals by the companies for increases in <Col N="1583" /> charges under their schemes.</P>
    <P>Before leaving this question, I would like to explain why it was decided not to adopt the proposal in the White Paper that the companies would be subject to the Prices Acts.  During the initial development period of about five years, Bord Telecom Éireann will be involved in very heavy capital expenditure.  An Post may have difficulty in breaking even during that period.  Financial performance targets for both companies will be set by the Minister, in consultation with the companies and with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  In the case of Bord Telecom Éireann this will include from the outset the rate of dividends to be paid on the State shares in the company.  The criteria normally used by the National Prices Commission for determining whether or not to recommend an increase in prices would not necessarily be compatible with the special requirements applicable in the case of the two new companies.  Accordingly, the Government decided that the Prices Acts should not apply to them.  However, scrutiny of proposals for price increases will be no less rigorous as a result.  As I mentioned earlier, the proposal is that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will have the benefit of the advice of independent bodies&mdash;the users' councils&mdash;in the matter.</P>
    <P>Section 50 empowers the Commissioners of Public Works to undertake work at the request of either company.  Traditionally the commissioners have undertaken work primarily for the civil service.  They will inevitably have some building work on hands for both services on the vesting day.  The purpose of section 50 is to put beyond doubt their legal power to complete these works and to perform additional work for the two companies should they be requested to do so.  The section also ensures that when working for either company the commissioners will not be regarded as a State authority for the purpose of the Planning Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 51 provides that property vested in An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann will be subject to rates in the usual way and section 52 is a transitional provision which will enable the two companies <Col N="1584" /> to start off with their motor fleet taxed.  Section 53 provides that as from the vesting day claims in respect of loss or injury against or by the Minister which are pending on that day will be deemed to be claims against or by the two companies and section 54 provides that An Post or Bord Telecom Éireann as appropriate will be substituted for the Minister in any legal proceedings in which he is involved on the vesting day, in relation to the functions being assigned to the companies.  Under sections 55 and 56 notices, certificates, licences and so on, issued by the Minister which are extant on the vesting day and which relate to functions of the new companies will be deemed to have been issued by the appropriate company.  Section 57 contains similar provisions in regard to consultations with planning authorities under the Planning Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 58 provides the companies with relief from the full application of the Planning Acts in the case of development works commenced in the first two years after the vesting day.  The companies will not require planning permission in respect of such works but they will be obliged to consult the appropriate planning authorities who will have power to object to the proposed works or to attach conditions to their execution.  The Minister for the Environment will have power to settle any unresolved differences between the companies and the planning authorities and to attach other conditions to the execution of the works.</P>
    <P>The reason for this concession is that, in common with development works of Government Departments generally, development works for postal and telecommunications services have not been subject to normal planning requirements up to now.  It would be contrary to the spirit of the reorganisation, which is designed to provide a more favourable environment for rapid development of postal and telecommunications services, if An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann were to be subjected to the full rigours of the Planning Acts from the outset.  The Government decided that a more gradual approach would be appropriate.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill, comprising sections <Col N="1585" /> 59 to 81, contains provisions applicable to the postal company only.  Section 59 contains a definition.  Section 60 provides for assignment to An Post of the exclusive privilege in regard to postal services enjoyed at present by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs under the Postal Acts, no more and no less.  The parcels service will continue to be open to competition. The section also contains a statement justifying the grant of the exclusive privilege.  Inclusion of a statement of this kind in the legislation was recommended by the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group.  It is envisaged that both the company itself and the Minister will have regard to this statement if the question arises of using the enabling power in section 70 or section 105 to issue a licence to a third party to provide a service covered by the exclusive privilege.</P>
    <P>Section 61 provides for continuation after the vesting day of the existing immunity from liability applicable in the case of the postal service.  There is one modification however.  The section empowers the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, after consultation with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, to apply by order one of the provisions of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980 to postal services provided within the State.</P>
    <P>Section 62 empowers An Post not to deliver mail to a person's residence or place of business if acceptable alternative arrangements are made.  The purpose of this is to have statutory backing for experimentation in alternative methods of delivering mail should An Post wish to do so.  Section 63 provides for the inviolability of the mails, except where there is statutory provision to the contrary, and for immunity from prosecution of postal staff who, for example, in the course of their duties deliver mail which, unknown to them, contains prohibited matter.  This does not establish a new principle but there is no explicit provision accordingly in existing law.  Legal advice was that it was desirable to close the gap.</P>
    <P>Section 64 enables the Minister for Finance to authorise An Post to provide <Col N="1586" /> banking services including a giro service.</P>
    <P>Sections 65 and 66 ensure that money orders, postal orders and postage stamps issued before the vesting day will continue to be valid after the vesting day. They also contain other technical provisions arising from the reorganisation. Revenue from postage stamps and from the poundage on postal and money orders will no longer be revenue due to the State.  It will form part of the income of An Post.  As a result, the Revenue Commissioners will no longer have functions in relation to postage stamps, postal and money orders and it is necessary to ensure that certain sections of the Stamp Acts will continue to apply to postage stamps.</P>
    <P>Section 67 empowers the company to make schemes providing for the charges and terms and conditions applicable to the provision of postal services but the company may make special arrangements in some cases with customers. Schemes made under these sections must be published and any increases in charges under these schemes must be approved by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>Section 68 contains technical provisions about evidence as to sums due for services provided by the companies and section 69 provides that certain Statutory Regulations made under the Post Office Acts which deal with the charges and terms and conditions applicable to postal services will remain in force until the companies alter them by making new or amended schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 70 empowers the company to issue licences to others to provide services covered by its exclusive privilege. The issue of such licences and the terms and conditions applicable to them will be subject to the consent of the Minister. A person whose application for a licence is refused may appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 71 empowers An Post to regulate the operation of the free postage scheme applicable in connection with elections.  This power may be exercised only with Ministerial consent and section 72 entitles An Post to be compensated by the Exchequer for the cost of free postage in the case of elections, letters to Government <Col N="1587" /> Departments etc.</P>
    <P>Sections 73 to 76 deal with collection of television licence fees and other work connected with such licences.</P>
    <P>This work is at present done at post offices throughout the country and a sum equal to the gross proceeds after deduction of collection costs is paid over to RTE each year.  On a number of occasions in the past RTE asked that responsibility for collection of television licence fees be handed over to them.  RTE renewed their request recently but even if it were decided to accede to the RTE request it could take quite some time for RTE to make the necessary arrangements to assume responsibility for the work.  In the meantime, the obvious solution is to retain at least for a transitional period the existing system under which sale of licences and allied clerical work is performed in post offices throughout the country.  The system will be operated by An Post on an agency basis for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Sections 73 and 74 of the Bill contain enabling power for delegation of these functions to An Post.</P>
    <P>Under section 73, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may, by order, empower the company to issue television licences on his behalf, detect unlicensed sets, and exercise his statutory powers in regard to registration of television dealers and supply of information by such dealers.  Orders made under the section would have to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas under section 3.</P>
    <P>Section 74 empowers the company to prosecute persons found in possession of unlicensed sets and dealers who fail to comply with the provisions of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1972 while an appropriate Order is in force under section 73.  Section 75 requires the company to pay over promptly to the Minister proceeds from sale of television licences and section 76 requires the Minister to pay the company for work done in connection with these licences.</P>
    <P>Section 77 empowers An Post to determine the hours of duty of telegraph offices under its control but it must consult Bord Telecom Éireann which will <Col N="1588" /> have overall responsibility for the telegraph service.</P>
    <P>Section 78 requires the Minister to appoint as a director of An Post a postmaster elected in accordance with the provisions of the Bill when enacted.  Postmasters, who run the 2,000 or so sub-post offices on a contract basis, perform a crucial role for the postal service.  It is fitting that they should be represented on the board of An Post.  The provisions in the section are similar to those in section 32 which deals with appointment of employee directors.</P>
    <P>Section 79 preserves the existing rights of postal staff to enter harbours and Shannon Customs-Free Airport in the course of their duties.</P>
    <P>Section 80 contains detailed powers being assigned to An Post in relation to day-to-day management of the postal services.  The powers in question are conferred on the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs at present under the Postal Acts and Statutory Regulations made down through the years under these Acts.  In addition to conferring powers, the section also limits the exercise of certain powers by the company in the interests of consumers.  For example, it lays down the circumstances in which An Post may refuse, detain or open mail.</P>
    <P>Section 81 contains a number of transitional financial provisions which arise because it would be impossible with concerns of the size involved to make a clean break on the vesting day.  These are mainly of a technical nature.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill, comprising sections 82 to 95, contains special provisions applicable to the telecommunications company.</P>
    <P>Section 82 contains a definition.</P>
    <P>Section 83 assigns to the company the exclusive privilege in regard to telecommunications services enjoyed at present by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs under the Telegraph Acts, except for provision and maintenance of telecommunications facilities in subscribers' premises for connection to the public network.  The exclusive privilege in this area will remain with the Minister but section 105 provides enabling power for him to issue licences for provision of these services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" /> This modification of the exclusive telecommunications privilege is in accordance with a recommendation of the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group.  They dealt with this question at some length in their report.  They had regard to the existing practice whereby private concerns are freely permitted to supply and maintain private automatic branch exchanges &mdash; PABXs &mdash; for connection to the public network and modems for use on privately leased circuits, provided the equipment is type-approved.  The group's view was that the statutory monopoly, or exclusive privilege, as it is described in the Bill, should not at any time be more extensive than is demonstrably necessary to achieve the objectives of such a privilege, that conservation of the unity and integrity of the network must be a governing consideration and that regard must be had to the risk of &ldquo;cream-skimming&rdquo; which is inherent if there is selective competition against a State-sponsored company which is statutorily required to provide a national service which will almost inevitably involve carrying some loss-making services.  The House will understand that quite clearly in other areas as well.</P>
    <P>They finally came down in favour of excluding from the exclusive privilege in respect of telecommunications provision of facilities in subscribers' premises.  The Government announced its acceptance of this in the White Paper.  Bord Telecom Éireann will of course receive a licence to provide and maintain equipment in subscribers' premises.</P>
    <P>The section also contains a statement justifying the grant of the exclusive privilege to Bord Telecom Éireann on much the same lines as that in section 60 dealing with the exclusive privilege of An Post.</P>
    <P>Sections 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 92 and 95 are on broadly the same lines as the corresponding sections in Part IV which deal with the postal company.  Section 84 provides for continuation of existing immunities from liability; section 85 empowers the company to issue licences for provision of services covered by its monopoly; section 86 empowers the company to make schemes covering charges and conditions applicable to telecommunications <Col N="1590" /> services; section 87 is a technical provision dealing with evidence as to sums due; section 88 provides for continuation after the vesting day of existing regulations dealing with charges etc; section 92 contains the powers of Bord Telecom Éireann to regulate the services and section 95 contains transitional financial provisions of a technical kind.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections in this part of the Bill are Nos. 89, 90, 91, 93 and 94.</P>
    <P>Section 89 provides for transfer to the company of deposits for call charges collected by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as security for payment.  Section 90 ensures continuance of any arbitration proceedings under the Telegraph Acts that may be in progress on the vesting day.</P>
    <P>Section 91 provides enabling power for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs with the consent of the Minister for the Environment to make regulations requiring developers of housing and industrial estates to provide such facilities as would enable telecommunications services to be provided in them in the most expeditious and efficient manner.  What is involved here is pre-ducting and/or precabling of these estates.  The Posts and Telegraphs Review Group recommended that such a provision be considered because of severe difficulties experienced by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs over the years in providing telephone and telex facilities promptly in new housing and industrial estates.</P>
    <P>When the Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited Bill, 1982, was before this House, on 5 November 1981, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs stated that the Reorganisation Bill would provide for transfer of ownership of that company from the State to the State-sponsored telecommunications company. Section 93 provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 94 penalises the fraudulent or attempted fraudulent use of the telecommunications system.  This closes a gap in existing laws.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill, comprising sections 96 to 103, deals with the transfer to An Post of responsibility for day-to-day management and control of the Post Office Savings Bank and other savings services <Col N="1591" /> on behalf of the Minister for Finance on an agency basis.</P>
    <P>Section 96 contains definitions.</P>
    <P>Section 97 empowers An Post to make regulations for the control and operation of the Post Office Savings Bank but this power may be exercised only with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  It also provides for continuation of existing regulations until they are amended or revoked by the company, and it empowers the Minister for Finance to require An Post to revoke or amend regulations about the Bank.</P>
    <P>Section 98 prescribes the powers of An Post in relation to savings bank business such as deciding at which offices the business will be conducted and when.  It also provides for discharge of the liability of the company when they issue a warrant or transfer an account in accordance with the regulations.  Section 99 transfers to the company the existing immunity from liability conferred on the Minister under the Post Office Savings Bank Acts in respect of loss or damage arising out of the conduct of the business.</P>
    <P>Section 100 continues the existing exemption from stamp duty applicable to cheques, warrants, etc. issued on the business of the bank and the existing exemption of correspondence between the bank and customers from pre-payment of postage.</P>
    <P>Section 101 is a technical provision; it clarifies that supply of information for the purpose of proceedings in respect of an offence is not a breach of the prohibition on the disclosure of information about customers' deposits.  Section 102 provides for continuation of proceedings in regard to disputes related to the bank and savings certificates.  Finally, section 103 requires the company to pay over promptly to the Minister for Finance deposits and other moneys received for investment in Government savings schemes and confers an entitlement on the company to payment for the cost of managing these services.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill, comprising sections 104 and 105, deals with the general Ministerial powers in relation to the two services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1592" /> Section 104 empowers the Minister to issue directions in writing to either company requiring them to comply with Government decisions about policy in regard to development of postal or telecommunications services; to do or refrain from doing specified things which he considers necessary in the public interest or to enable the Government to comply with international obligations; or to perform work for a State authority.  It also empowers the Minister to formulate financial performance targets for both companies with the consent of the Minister for Finance and after consultation with the company in question.  Directions under the section, except those related to public order or security or to international obligations, will be issued by the Minister by way of statutory order if the company so requests.</P>
    <P>These are novel provisions &mdash; to which I call the attention of the House &mdash; in that they contain a statutory statement of Ministerial powers in relation to postal and telecommunications services <i>vis-á vis</i> the State-sponsored bodies.  Their purpose is to provide formally for the minimum statutory controls considered necessary in the public interest over policy aspects of these two vital parts of our infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The provision as regards financial performance targets for the companies is also an innovation.  As I stated earlier when dealing with sections 13 and 15, these targets will be settled in the context of rolling development programmes to be prepared by the companies.  The development programmes will normally cover a period of five years.  In fact, we are in the middle of the five-year programme and I suppose the four-year period is regarded as a suitable one.  The targets will be determined following consultation with the companies and with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann will be required under sections 13 and 15 to so conduct their affairs as to enable them to meet their targets.  I would expect the companies to include in their annual reports in due course particulars about their approved financial targets, the steps <Col N="1593" /> taken to achieve them and the effectiveness or otherwise of these steps.</P>
    <P>The setting of targets of this kind has a number of advantages.  It should enable An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann to plan their financial strategies and development programme in a systematic way and they and their staff should be in no doubt about what is expected of them in this area.  The targets will also enable the Government to ensure, for example, that the value of the substantial assets being transferred to each company will be maintained in real terms; that an adequate return will be obtained from them and that reasonable dividends will be paid on the State shares in the case of the telecommunications company from an early date and from the postal company later on.</P>
    <P>Section 105 is enabling.  It empowers the Minister to issue licences to third parties to provide services of the kind included in the exclusive privilege being assigned to An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann under sections 60 and 83.</P>
    <P>The rationale behind this enabling power is as follows.  The Posts and Telegraphs Review Group consider that the exclusive privilege of either company should not at any time be more extensive than is demonstrably necessary to achieve the objectives of such a privilege. The objective of the grant of the exclusive privilege to An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann is to facilitate provision of efficient, cost-effective, national postal and telecommunications services.  Should a situation arise in the future in which the exclusive privilege was not deemed necessary to achieve this objective, or the objective was not being achieved in the case of either service despite the existence of the exclusive privilege, under section 105 the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance could license another body to provide some of the services within the exclusive privilege, in competition with An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  I stress however that this is an enabling section only and that there is no intention at present of issuing such a licence.</P>
    <P>The section also empowers the Minister to issue licences for the provision and <Col N="1594" /> maintenance of telecommunications equipment in subscribers' premises which are not included in the exclusive privilege of Bord Telecom Éireann, but as I indicated earlier, a licence will be issued to the company to provide such services as from the vesting day.  The section safeguards the integrity of the network by providing that licences must be subject to technical conditions which will ensure that equipment installed will be compatible with the network.  These conditions will be drawn up by the Minister in consultation with Bord Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>That concludes the sections in the Bill. There are also four Schedules to the Bill. The First Schedule contains provisions about the election of employee directors to the two boards and of a postmaster director of An Post.  The Second Schedule contains provisions applicable to compulsory acquisition of land by either company.  These are on standard lines. The Third Schedule contains particulars of Acts and Statutory Regulations which are being repealed in whole or in part &mdash; in the Bill there is a total of 125 Acts and Regulations &mdash; and the Fourth Schedule contains particulars of amendments of existing Acts and Statutory Regulations.  I do not propose to comment on these at this stage.  They can be considered in any necessary detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I wish to mention. Deputies may have seen the recommendation made by the Public Service Advisory Council in its Annual Reports for 1979 and 1980 that there should be statutory provision for a review of the structures of the new bodies after a stated period.  While a statutory provision as recommended is not being included in the Bill, it is the Government's intention that the structure of the new bodies would be reviewed after a period of about five years.  This review will, of course, be quite separate from any examination of the bodies by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, whose remit it is proposed to extend for that purpose.</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate for me to finish without paying tribute to the staff, past and present, of the Department of <Col N="1595" /> Posts and Telegraphs who devoted their working lives to the postal and telecommunications services.  They have suffered, mainly in silence, much criticism from the public and the media over the years.  Inefficiencies for which they were criticised were often due not to failures by the staff but to inadequate structures and to the inability of government at various stages to devote sufficient of available scarce resources to development of the two services.</P>
    <P>Towards the beginning of this speech, I described the present state of the two services.  While there is room for considerable improvement in both, there are many areas where efficient services, as good as the best available elsewhere, are being provided.  On the telecommunications side, a solid basis for providing a fully automatic first-class service within two to three years at most, has been laid.</P>
    <P>The fact that two services with considerable strengths, which in my view far exceed their weaknesses, will be handed over to the new companies is due almost entirely to the staff of my Department at all levels.  I expect An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann to build on the strengths which they are inheriting and, with the more favourable environment and greater freedom they will have, they should be able to achieve far more rapid development of the two services than was practicable within the confines of the civil service.  I look forward to their achievements in this area.</P>
    <P>Finally, Deputies will probably wish to know when it is proposed to set up the new companies.  This will, of course, depend on when this legislation is enacted.  There is a consensus on both sides of the House &mdash; at least, I hope so &mdash; that the quicker the postal and telecommunication services are transferred to the State-sponsored sector the better. I would like to see An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann in operation in the autumn or within three months at most from the date on which this Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>There are many other points I could make but I may get an opportunity at a later stage.  I wish to pay tribute to distinguished <Col N="1596" /> Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs who held this position and to very distinguished secretaries of the Department, some of whom not merely attained eminence in the Department but in the literary world as well.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the development of the postal service, which is the older of the two, set in an historical context to which I would like to refer but I will leave it at that for the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said in his opening paragraphs, in the ritual Irish introduction, this is an important Bill.  It is important in the sense that it proposes very far-reaching changes in our postal and telecommunications services.  What we must do in the course of this debate is to examine &mdash; the Minister has examined the matter in some detail and this side of the House does not need to go into it in the same detail &mdash; the reasons the reorganisation as proposed by the Minister is necessary, to consider if it is the best form of reorganisation and to consider if this Bill is designed to achieve that form of optimum reorganisation.</P>
      <P>The first thing we must ask ourselves is whether reforms could have been achieved within the present structures and the short answer must be no.  That is not just my view but is the considered view of a high-powered review body that studied the problems of our postal and telecommunication service some three years ago.  They came to the conclusion it would not be possible to make reforms within the existing structures in order to achieve the efficient services we want.  It was their view that the best type of structure was the State company as proposed in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with that.  I do not think the civil service structure, with its emphasis on personal accountability and a hierarchical form and the procedures that have been there for a long time&mdash;which because they have a long history automatically assume a certain rigidity &mdash; could be reformed or altered without traumatic administrative consequences so as to produce efficient postal and telecommunication services, bearing in mind that they are essentially commercial and <Col N="1597" /> have to be commercial.  I do not think the existing civil service Department could be reformed: that option has to be ruled out.  I think it is common case that these services could not have been handed over <i>simpliciter</i> to private enterprise.  There are very valuable monopolies involved here, monopolies that have potential for great profit, and I think that profit when it is based on a monopoly should inure to the benefit of the Exchequer.  That is not to say that private enterprise should be totally excluded from participation, either in terms of its contribution by way of personnel and subsidiary activities or financial contribution, but provision should be made for private participation as the situation evolves.  The State companies proposed permit for private involvement later on as the scene develops.</P>
    <P>To put it briefly, I do not think there was any alternative when one considers the entire scene but to move away from departmental control in the running of the services to something else.  The something else proposed here, and which was proposed by the review group, is the proper one.  We have to consider if the State group as proposed to be set up will achieve the ends that we all want.  The ends that we want to achieve are to have a postal and telecommunications service that is efficient, and one that is efficient has to comply with certain requirements. It must be most efficient in terms of cost; it must be most efficient in terms of the levels of service which it gives&mdash;and there could be conflict between these two norms of efficiency, if I may put it that way and it must be efficient in terms of the job satisfaction and the morale of those working in the services.</P>
    <P>These services at the moment have been criticised on the basis of cost.  There have been recent increases, as the Minister knows, on both the postal side and the telephone side.  The public wonder whether these costs are the most efficient costs that could be charged to them, and they suspect that they are not.  They might very well be right.  Very often these costs are increased merely to procure added revenue in the context of the entire Exchequer position and the important <Col N="1598" /> position which a large Department like Posts and Telegraphs bears in that context. The public could be right to be suspicious about the efficiency element, about whether they are getting good value for these increased charges and costs and whether efficiency is related to the actual cost or whether it is now possible at all in the context of a departmental structure to cost accurately the charges that go into the end price which the consumer has to pay.  It is extremely difficult, if not impossible at this stage, to do that and we can only do that when we get into a commercial area.</P>
    <P>The level of service has disappointed many people both on the postal side and on the telecommunications side.  There are a myriad of reasons for this.  Poor staff morale is one.  The Minister paid tribute to the staff, and undoubtedly very many members of the staff of the Post Office are entitled to have that tribute paid to them.  They suffer the frustration of having to deal with a justifiably complaining public and that has damaging effects on their morale.  Also the level of management and the structure of line management has not been such as to procure the best return from staff, and the indolent amoung the staff have had perhaps a greater chance to express themselves because the energetic among the staff have not had the option to be rewarded and recognised, as would happen in a commercial company.  There have been difficulties in that area&mdash;we have seen it reflected in recurring industrial difficulties&mdash;and this has interfered with the level of service the public have been getting.</P>
    <P>On the postal side one consequence is that many actual and potential customers have been lost to the private couriers.  It will be one of the major tasks of the new postal board to recover from the private sector those customers that have been lost and who are getting efficiency both in terms of a high degree of efficient service and in terms of what they obviously consider to be good value, although we know from information available to us that they are paying considerably more than the charges that would be charged by the Post Office. <Col N="1599" /> Obviously there will be a great challenge to An Post and the staff of the Post Office in regard to whether they will be able to hold the business they have, expand it and possibly recover some of the business that has been lost in the recent past.  I am confident that they will be able to meet that challenge.</P>
    <P>While there have been in parts of the Post Office recurring industrial disputes and signs of a morale malaise, I am pretty confident that this is not widespread and that where we do see it it is not that deep. There are many people in the Post Office who are not too anxious to take on the challenge being posed to them by private sector competition.  They are aware that to take on that challenge they will have to be prepared to offer the same service and incur the same charges as the private sector and that may mean making themselves available above and beyond the level of services they provide at the moment.  I see no reason why the challenge should not be met successfully.  I have every confidence in the people in the Post Office to do that.  They are well aware that they are working in what is the oldest public utility of all with great traditions of service.  It is a matter of great pride to have the mail on time and to deliver it through difficult circumstances and provide the service that the public require.  I have no doubt that that tradition will be very important and will be continued in the new board.</P>
    <P>While there are some people who would be pessimistic about its commercial potential, I do not share that pessimism. Undoubtedly in its early years it will be in a loss-making situation, but I have no doubt that this can be turned around significantly.  Also it has potentially a huge asset in so far as it has retail outlets throughout the country, a great many of them in high street locations, in prime shopping locations.  The initiative and novel approach that is needed to make optimum use of these and to turn them into useful sources of revenue for An Post is there.  Undoubtedly, one problem that will arise is that when these outlets are availed of in retailing sense people in business already may feel that <Col N="1600" /> this is the State going into competition with them.  There will be pressure on the Minister to restrict the State company competing with private enterprise.  At this stage I would be inclined to say let the State compete.  But saying that I would have to offer the reservation that the competition must be fair.  If private enterprise is entitled to compete with the State in taking its business away through the couriers, the State in its operations is quite entitled to compete with private enterprise, provided the competition is fair.  If this is the case the end result will be to benefit the consumer and the net result will be more efficiency and that in turn will be for the national good as a whole.  There are difficulties but there is great potential.</P>
    <P>I do not have to spell out the potential on the telecommunications side.  It is self-evident.  The technological developments mean that an immense range of sophisticated services can be offered both to the business sector and the private sector.  Technological services available within the country and through worldwide international connections have to be provided and will be availed of and that will be profitable.  Up to now the service has been inadequate mainly because there has not been sufficient investment over the years.  The investment has been very heavy now for quite a number of years and it is only now that it is beginning to have an effect in so far as the individual using the telephone perceives. Of course the commercial potential is immense.</P>
    <P>But there is one little cloud on the horizon and that is the pretty high rate of refusals by people who have applied for telephones who when they see the charge for connection say &ldquo;No, I do not want a telephone&rdquo;.  The Minister might tell us what the present ratio of refusals is.  It would be interesting to see that.  I would perceive that as an indication of consumer resistance to too high a charge for the services.  People may decide it is not worth paying anything from £200 to £400 to have a telephone installed and will do without.  It is possible that in the future development of the telephone service the <Col N="1601" /> connection charge may be substantially reduced or removed altogether.  It does not make commercial sense to charge when you are trying to sell a service, because you get your return from the charges for the service rather than for installing it.  It is understandable, at this stage when capital is scarce and so much development is needed, that the State should make these installations charges to get back some part of their capital, but that is now producing a certain element of consumer resistance and that capital recoupment may not be available for the new board in the future.</P>
    <P>The charges to be asked by the new board and the level of service in terms of repairs and installations will be critical factors.  We want to ensure that the level of charges is reasonable and that the service is good.  What we have to consider is if these new boards are the best way to achieve these desirable objectives.  Of the various options considered &mdash; the reform of the Department, a private enterprise, a State corporation or a State company &mdash; what we have arrived at here, which is the recommendation of the review group, a State company, is the best, provided &mdash; and this is very important &mdash; its structure and financial base are adequate to allow it to operate commercially and efficeintly.  I have some worries about the financial provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The first area of reservation &mdash; and I will deal with them in the order in which the Minister dealt with them &mdash; is the question of pensions.  What is proposed here smacks of sleight of hand, and is typical of some of the budgetary proposals we have had from the other side of the House in the recent past.  The two new companies are being asked to pay and take over the State's present pension obligations.  At some future date these new companies will have the pension liabilities as and from the vesting date and must start providing money now to meet those future liabilities.  The State is asking the company to pay over the money they should be setting aside to meet future liabilities.  In the future they may not be able to meet their liabilities because the State is taking this money on a current basis and the State says it will <Col N="1602" /> set up a contingency fund to meet any shortfall.  The Exchequer tells the new companies they are no worse off if they pay the State now because they will still have to provide this money.  In my view they are worse off because if they were providing this money to meet their future liabilities, it would be invested in a pension fund and the produce of that fund would ultimately be in ease of a proportion of the current expenditure they would have to lay off on pensions.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that the State should ask these companies to take over what was the State's obligation.  The Minister argued that the State has been paying its obligations out of current revenue, but if the State wants to do it that way that is its business.  Obviously the national Exchequer can approach its pension liabilities from a different basis than a commercial organisation.  We are setting up two commercial organisations and they should be allowed to operate according to commercial criteria.</P>
    <P>The review group emphasised in their recommendations that there should be an actuarial assessment to determine the present liability for pension commitments so that the new statutory company should not inherit an unprovided for liability, but as I read it, that, in essence, is what is happening.  The new companies are being asked to provide for the State's current pension liabilities for existing pensions for pensioners up to the date of vesting and, of course, they will have to take on their new obligations as from the date of vesting.  That is a bad start for the two new companies and is a clog on their commercial viability from day one.</P>
    <P>With regard to the financial arrangement for An Post, I am glad to see their assets will be debt free.  That is commendable but we all know &mdash; and the Minister's speech is short on facts here &mdash; An Post are required to make substantial capital investment within the next few years.  We also know they will make current losses in their operations and they will not be able to provide their capital requirements because of their loss situation. The Minister says he is going to provide £50 million for capital investment, which he may or may not provide <Col N="1603" /> by way of equity.  He may decide to give it by way of loan capital.  I urge him to make a commitment to provide this capital by way of equity.  It would be good for morale and would be equal so far as the State is concerned.  If he provides this money by way of a loan and the company is not able to meet their repayments, they will become involved, as the review group said, in the vicious circle where interest costs lead to deficits and further borrowing and at the end of the day the State has to come in with a subsidy.  Then that State company, will, in the public mind, be categorised as an inefficient loss-making operation, like another State company which shall be nameless and which has got an unfair amount of blame because it is wrongly structured in terms of capital.  Again I urge the Minister to make this money available by way of equity.</P>
    <P>In his reply he should tell us firmly that it will be available and if it is not sufficient for the board's capital development programme that he will make sufficient capital equity available.  It is only by giving that assurance to the people on that board that he will lift the morale to encourage them to take on the competition they will have to face in the years to come.  They must have the financial confidence of the Government if they are to take on this competition successfully.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us there is an enabling power to provide £20 million &mdash; an enabling power is different from a commitment to provide £20 million &mdash; to meet current expenditure.  This figure means nothing until we are told what level of losses are projected, how far the £20 million will go to meet these losses, if there is a decision in principle that the losses for X number of years will be met and what will be the financial position on the basis of a projection in say five years' time.  The Minister says the companies have to prepare a five year plan.  I would be surprised if they are only starting at this stage to prepare such a plan.  I ask the Minister to be more specific when replying in regard to the future financing arrangements of the postal board.  The only consolation at this stage in the Minister's <Col N="1604" /> speech is that the assets will be as he says debt free as of now.  How long that will be the case depends on whether the £50 million capital will come by way of equity alone and on how much assistance the State will give in the critical early years towards meeting the deficit. I presume that is what the £20 million is provided for.  The Minister should give us figures so that we can see whether it will be adequate or not.</P>
    <P>There is the burden, a very big one on a loss making company, of having to provide for the pension liabilities of the State.  I regret to see that in the situation. It is significant that in the other parts of the Bill the Minister mentioned the views of the interim board and that in the entire financial section, both in the case of capital structure of the postal board and the capital structure of Bord Telecom there is not a word as far as I can recall in the Minister's speech about the attitude of the interim board to the financial structure. I consider that ominous and I interpret it as an indication that the board are opposed to and unhappy with what is being provided for them.</P>
    <P>As I said initially the whole success of this change depends on these companies having an independent commercial life and that cannot happen unless they are structured properly in terms of capital from day one.  If these boards are put into a position where they will be loss making for ever, efficiency will be hidden behind the interest subvention that will inevitably have to come from the Exchequer. Staff morale will be damaged and to get away from that situation they should be put on a proper basis from the beginning. Further, it is as broad as it is long as far as the Exchequer is concerned; it might be preferable to do it by way of equity at this stage rather than by loan capital that the companies are not able to remunerate. We are only causing them to accumulate losses and eventually the day will come when those losses have to be met by Exchequer subventions.  The Exchequer might as well realise that from day one they should put these companies on a proper structure.</P>
    <P>Much the same remarks apply to the financial arrangements for Bord Telecom. <Col N="1605" /> It will also be burdened from day one with this very big liability for pensions &mdash; over 15 per cent of its payroll. Bearing in mind that the payroll of Bord Telecom will be a very big sum we can see that this is a huge liability.  Again the Minister is a bit short on facts here.  Why did he not tell us what 15 per cent of the payroll in the first year of operations will be?  Would he give us that information when replying?  When we add that burden to the cost of paying for the loan capital which the company will have to take over we see there is a very big financial burden being imposed on this company.  It will have to take over loan capital of some £680 million.  On the basis that the loan charges on £355 million are calculated as £48 million &mdash; if I read the Minister's remarks correctly, that the Exchequer is taking over £355 million worth of the repayable advances and putting the rest of them on to the new company by way of loan capital &mdash; I calculate that £600-odd million will cost £70 or £80 million. That added to 16 per cent of the payroll will mean a huge sum for interest and financial charges that the company must find before putting aside one penny for its own development, for depreciation and all the other things that a properly structured balance sheet and profit and loss account should provide for.</P>
    <P>The £355 million will not be risk equity in the normal sense because the Minister says that the loan charges on it will be charged on the Exchequer but the company will be required to pay dividends in respect of State shares over a period of at most 10 years which will at least equal the loan charges.  I find a certain inconsistency between that and the requirements in the sections which impose the duties on these companies.  There is also inconsistency there as regards commercial freedom.  If it transpires that the company is going to leave its capital financing short, if it is to meet the Minister's directions to pay dividends at least equal to the loan charges, what happens?  Surely if the telecommunications sector is inherently profitable &mdash; and everybody says it is very profitable &mdash; and we have appointed people of proven commercial expertise to run and manage it we should <Col N="1606" /> let them decide on the level of remuneration the equity capital will attract over the years.</P>
    <P>Obviously the shareholders are entitled to look for the maximum they can get.  That is the privilege of shareholders; that is why they invest their money &mdash; to get the best possible return on it.  But if they ask for a return that will cripple the operation or inhibit the viability of the operation, that is not satisfactory.  In effect I think that is what the Minister is saying here.  It is a bad approach to this problem.</P>
    <P>I am not altogether happy with the capital structure for either company.  It may not allow them the commercial freedom they should have or give them the equity ratio that is desirable but we cannot really assess the position because the Minister is regrettably vague.  I hope that when replying he will flesh out with more financial information his exact proposals in regard to the two companies and how the companies see the first five years of their operation working out having regard to the Minister's proposals.  We can then make a real assessment of the proposals.</P>
    <P>One matter that the Minister does not mention is the position of both companies in relation to VAT.  I ask him to deal with that when replying and with what implications that liability or lack of it will have on the finances of the company.</P>
    <P>The only other matter I wish to mention is to reassure, as far as I can from this side of the House, the staff to be transferred to the new boards.  There has been already a considerable amount of consultation with staff associations and there are a lot of details to be ironed out. It is very important that the Minister continue to assure the unions and staff associations concerned that the provision in the statute means what it says, when it provides that the staff's personal positions are not to be prejudiced or rendered any less valuable than at present within the civil service.  The people going into these bodies must have confidence that their career prospects, their working environment and the demands on them <Col N="1607" /> will be such that the change will be attractive.</P>
    <P>Part of the rationale for making this change is to get a better return for the money we are paying to the people concerned. We do not want to frighten them into thinking that they are going into a harsh working regime.  There is no question of that.  They must be reassured that, far from its being harsh, a regime can be devised which will provide more job satisfaction arising from the greater public approval of what is being done. There can also be more financial satisfaction because the bodies are working on a commercial basis and, it is hoped, will be allowed and enabled to introduce systems of financial incentives, bonuses and so on, to ensure that the work is done quickly and efficiently.  Far from the change being to the detriment of the staff, nothing but good will come, from their point of view.  Nevertheless, it is important to assure the staff of the Post Office who are going to the two new companies that it is the intention of the Government and of the companies that their working environment will be as good in the new companies as it was in the civil service and that they will not be prejudiced financially, or in terms of conditions of employment.  They must, however, acknowledge that they will be moving into a different working environment which will inevitably bring some change. I believe that mainly they are prepared for this different environment and will fully co-operate with it.</P>
    <P>By and large, I welcome what is proposed in the Bill.  I concur with the view of the Minister and the review group that this type of structure is the best for solving the problems, provided the financial structures for the two new companies are adequate, bearing in mind what we are requiring them to do.  I am not satisfied, from the Minister's speech and the amount of information given to us at this stage, that the financial structures are so designed as to make these companies operate to the maximum possible.  I may be wrong in that and the Minister may be able to give the house more information when replying to the debate.  With that <Col N="1608" /> reservation, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question to be asked is why we have the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill before us today.  In effect, the answer to this question is provided at the beginning of the Minister's speech.  It is that the financial effect will be to remove from the central Government finances most of the expenditure on the two services.  It is, in effect, to rid the Exchequer of the cost of running this service.  Deputy Cooney in his contribution struck the right note regarding his reservations <i>vis-á-vis</i> the funding of the two bodies.  I differ from him, however, in his approach in the area of the important assets of both organisations. The greatest asset, in my view, is the people who down through the years provided a service which, up to 1979, was second to none.  Something happened in that year on which the people whose lifestyle will now be altered considerably had little influence.  I happened to be part of that organisation up to that time.  For a period of 57 years &mdash; something which has no precedence in labour relations in any country, certainly within any postal organisations throughout the world &mdash; there was not a major disruption of service.  For our pains and the pains of all the people employed in the postal services, we were left on the streets for 18 weeks.  Since then there has been a sense of grievance which will not be easy to eradicate from the service.  There is to be a transfer of the problems from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to the two semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>After waiting for five years we have a situation where a Bill was circulated last Thursday and Second Stage is now expected to be put through the House by 2.30 p.m. today.  The Minister has expressed his wish to see the Bill passed through the House by autumn.  This would be grossly unfair to the people who have worked this service down through the years and to the unions involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By a strange coincidence, three of the unions involved who cater for the needs of the staff in the Department are now about the business of their annual conference and as a result have not had an <Col N="1609" /> opportunity to study this documentation or to lobby their Members in this House. In the current issue of <i>The Postal Worker</i> there are approximately 230 claims outstanding which must be dealt with.  Will we transfer these claims also?  Is there any facility to deal with these problems when transferred?  I take it that the conciliation and arbitration machinery is no longer applicable.  What has been set up to replace this?  This machinery was introduced by an inter-Party Government in the late forties and has worked to fairly good effect up to now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney says that private enterprise should not be excluded.  My fear is that there is a danger that they will cream off &mdash; a term used in the Minister's speech &mdash; the profitable side of the business.  It is quite commonplace to see in this house members of private courier firms actually about business which postal personnel should be doing.  There is a danger &mdash; and it must also be mentioned in the telecommunications area &mdash; that the facsimile transmission, which is a new development, could prove very attractive to private operators and the Minister may, if he so desires, give a licence to such operators. This licence is also available to people who wish to carry out a courier type of service.  At the moment there is legislation governing monopolies, but to date this has not been implemented.  For one reason or another, there has been a noted reluctance on the part of the Minister and the Department to enforce these regulations which would prohibit the use of courier services, which are being used quite frequently.</P>
    <P>Regarding consultation with the staff, the Minister has said that there has been such consultation.  That is true, but there has been no agreement, and that is the important part.  As things stand at present, one union in particular has indicated its total opposition to the introduction of both boards, and bear in mind that this is the largest union within the postal service.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy the projected additional cost to the State of increasing IDA grants from 45 per cent to 60 per cent in the inner city as outlined on page 7 of the arrangement between Deputies Haughey and Gregory-Independent and announced in the Dáil on 9 March 1982.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy the estimated cost of providing the 3,746 new jobs outlined in the arrangement between Deputies Haughey and Gregory-Independent announced in the Dáil on 9 March 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that the additional cost of increasing IDA grant levels from 45 per cent to 60 per cent for projects in the inner city would &mdash; based on 1981 prices &mdash; amount to £2.8 million for the creation of 3,000 additional manufacturing jobs over the period 1982-1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> It is expected that the balance of the 3,740 jobs will arise in non-grant aided industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate when the first of these jobs will be provided and, secondly, state the criteria upon which the figure of £3 million, or the exact figure, was based in arriving at this reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated already in my reply, the £2.8 million is purely an estimate based on 1981 prices.  In regard to the second part of the question that these jobs will be provided I should say that this is a commitment already entered into.  The Deputy will appreciate that the IDA programme for job creation expires in 1982 and that these 3,740 jobs included will be provided in the period from 1982 to 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that these 3,000 jobs will be provided by the end of this programme?  Is that a firm and definite commitment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in the period 1982 to 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state further how many of these jobs will be private sector and how many in the public sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The IDA estimate that 740 of these jobs will come from the non-grant-aided sector.  As the Deputy will appreciate, in every manufacturing job created there is a relationship of something like 1 to 3 with the service industry.  The IDA's estimate from non-grant-aided industry is 740 and the remaining 3,000 will be provided in the IDA programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister be more specific because what we have had now is a degree of eloquent waffle?  Could he indicate the names of the firms, types of job and when these jobs might be provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Manning is well <Col N="1613" /> and truly aware that if I was in a position to name firms to be established either in Dublin inner city, or in any other part of Ireland over the next three years I would be really looking into a crystal ball.  This is part of an IDA programme for job creation and I am sure the Deputy is very familiar with the whole scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the accuracy of the IDA's figure &mdash; the figure he has just quoted &mdash; that 3,000 jobs can be created by additional expenditure of £2.8 million?  Is the Minister further aware that in their 1981 Annual Report the IDA valued manufacturing jobs in capital terms at just £20,000 per job?  Can the Minister explain to the House how 3,000 jobs could be created in Deputy Gregory's constituency for £2.8 million whilst it costs almost £20,000, in 1981 figures, to produce one manufacturing job by the IDA outside that constituency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has misinterpreted the reply.  What I was giving was the additional estimated cost resulting from a redesignation of Dublin inner city from a 45 per cent grant area to a 60 per cent grant area and the estimated additional cost, based on 1981 prices, by the IDA is £2.8 million; that is not the full cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>While welcoming any effort to create extra jobs is the Minister aware that by increasing the level of grant aid to 60 per cent he is exceeding the maximum ceiling allowed by the EEC and that, in so doing, he may be jeopardising the whole national grant-aid scheme <i>vis-á-vis</i> our other partners in the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware that I will be exceeding the limit.  But I should inform the Deputy that an application has already been made to the EEC for permission to redesignate this part of Dublin.  I have already visited Brussels, have spoken to Commissioner Andriessen on this subject, and have put the case for the inner city of Dublin.  I think every <Col N="1614" /> Deputy in the House will agree that the inner city of Dublin does warrant particular attention in this respect and I am confident that EEC approval will be forthcoming.</P>

Would the Minister let us know when the commitment which was contained in a document between Deputy Gregory and Deputy Haughey, as he reminded us, became Government policy?  When did the status of the document change from one which existed between the two Deputies to that which apparently is now, according to the Minister, Government policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that the problems of inner city Dublin are well known to every Deputy on every side of the House.  One of my first objectives in taking over the portfolio of Minister for Industry and Energy was to apply to the EEC and to follow that up with a visit to Brussels.  I am sure Deputy Keating will agree that incentives are needed to get industries into the inner city and that the jobs are really required there.  I cannot understand the attitude of the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will probably be aware, the format for making this application is that it was made in writing first.  It was followed up by a visit by me to Brussels and I spoke to Commissioner Andriessen.  I had a long discussion with him.  I can let the Deputy know that Commissioner Andriessen is coming to Dublin very shortly and he will look at the situation in inner city Dublin. I was able to assure him that, having seen it, he will have no problem whatever in agreeing to my application to have it redesignated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy if, in view of the <Col N="1616" /> most recent and alarming unemployment figures for Waterford city, he will designate that area for special treatment when considering the siting of new industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned at the serious employment problem in Waterford city and am assured that the Industrial Development Authority have been intensively promoting the Waterford area for new industry.</P>
      <P>In recent years the IDA have secured a number of new overseas industries for Waterford city and have also supported the expansion of existing enterprises. Between them these projects are expected to provide between 6,000 and 7,000 new jobs at full production.  Many of these jobs have yet to come on stream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the question I asked.  I asked specifically if the Minister would designate Waterford city and area for special treatment in view of the enormous unemployment rate, which is far greater than the inner city area of Dublin for which the Minister is designating grants of 60 per cent instead of the normal 45 per cent.  Why is Waterford not being given similar treatment or even preferential treatment in view of the enormous rate of unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already said, the IDA will make every possible effort to attract more industry to Waterford city.  I am concerned about the high level of unemployment there, but I would point out to the Deputy that 75 per cent of the jobs lost in the Waterford city area came from outside the manufacturing industry.  When we are talking about new projects in the manufacturing industry the Deputy should realise that 75 per cent of the losses did not come in the manufacturing area.  Every effort will be made for Waterford city and for the country as a whole.  We are all aware of the difficult economic situation around the country in relation to employment.  I assure the Deputy I will spare no effort in bringing as much investment as possible to the country.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> Would the <Col N="1617" /> Minister not accept that the IDA projections for the Waterford city area are far too low?  Would he not accept that, when he speaks about the efforts of the IDA to project employment not only at national level but even at regional level, there is practically nothing in the pipeline?  Will the Minister specify where the 6,000 to 7,000 jobs he speaks about will come from and over what time span is he speaking? Is he speaking about five, ten or 15 years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficult employment situation in Waterford city.  The projects that already exist there are expected to provide between 6,000 and 7,000 new jobs at full production. Intensive efforts are being made by the IDA in relation to Waterford city, recognising that there has been such a fall out in employment in the non-manufacturing sector.  That is the particular area that the attention of the IDA has been drawn to by me.  There are difficult areas around the country as well as Waterford, but every effort will be made by the IDA to attract more manufacturing industry and more service industry under the new service industries programme to try to alleviate unemployment.</P>

Does the Minister intend <Col N="1618" /> to increase the level of grant aid to centres such as Waterford, which are suffering more than any other part of the country from a high unemployment level in view of the fact that he has increased by 15 per cent the maximum level of grant aid to firms in inner city Dublin?

      <P>I suppose the IDA felt they had to give figures which would show them in a good light.  Is the Minister aware that the recent census showed that there has not been any rise in population in west Waterford?  In fact there has been a slight drop in the past four to five years while the unemployment figures have actually doubled during the same period. How can the Minister explain the fact that the population has not risen and unemployment has doubled while the IDA contrive to give figures to show that the jobs created have exceeded those lost by more than 400?</P>

      <P>I have told the Deputy that the figures I have here were supplied to me from the internal planning section of the IDA but the Deputy seems to think that those figures are totally inaccurate. If he wishes to provide me with his figures, figures which he says are more acurate than the ones available to me, I shall be only too glad to take up the matter, have the situation analysed personally and in turn to pass on the results of that analysis to him.</P>

      <P>I should be delighted if the Minister would do that because the figures are available in the Official Report as a result of a question that was tabled last week in relation to unemployment. We also have the national census as a source of information.

      <P>The furniture factory, which is now in production, was projected to employ 40 persons when fully operational.  It has not attained its full employment target and the IDA are in close touch with the firm about their future development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the IDA that in recent years they have secured a number of new large overseas industries for the Greater Cork area and have also assisted in the expansion of a number of existing industries.</P>
      <P>These projects, which include Apple Computers in Hollyhill, Bourns, Cado Systems, Measurex and Witte Van Moort in Mahon, Digital, Showerlux, Sifco Turbine Components, Cantrell and Cochrane and Tungsram in Little Island, Liebert Corporation and Perkin Elmer Ireland Ltd. in Wilton, Lois and Tiklas in Cork city, have the potential to employ almost 5,000 persons at full production. Many of the jobs in these firms have yet to come on stream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA also have more than 1,100 <Col N="1622" /> acres of land and a total of 175,000 square feet of factory space available in the area for industrial development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. B. Allen Mr. B. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Ghost factories are of no consolation to the unemployed of Cork. There is no point in having factory sites and factory units if employment is not being created.  I asked the Minister to let us have details of his plans for the provision of additional jobs in Cork city but instead of answering the question he gave us details of the records over a number of years.  However, the records do not correspond with the evidence in terms of the unemployment situation in Cork.  The figures in this respect have increased by 800 in the past four months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Deputy that many firms do not reach full production immediately on being set up nor in the first or second years or even perhaps in the third year.  Anybody who is familiar with industrial development will know this.  Apparently the Deputy is ignoring the fact that this economy is coming through one of the worst economic recessions ever experienced.  It is not very long ago since the people on the benches opposite were on this side of the House but there were no magic solutions produced at that time to solve the unemployment problem.  My first priority is to restore confidence in this economy so far as investment is concerned.  That approach was initiated by the Taoiseach during his visit to New York and it was followed up by me last week in Germany. I intend to pursue the matter again in the US.  First we must give confidence to potential investors, but we must realise that there is fierce competition for investment around the world.  It is most unrealistic for someone who has been in this House for only a short period to suggest that nothing is being done.  Much has been done already to undo the damage that had been done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that they are at an advanced stage of negotiation with an overseas company who are interested in locating in Enniscorthy.  In addition, six small industry projects for the area, with a potential to create 39 jobs, were approved for grant assistance by the IDA during 1981.</P>
      <P>The IDA also own two sites for industrial development, totalling 23 acres of land, in Enniscorthy.  It is proposed that the local Development Association will construct a 7,000 square feet advance factory on one of these sites.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, regarding the project he refers to in connection with overseas investment and which is located at Edermine in Enniscorthy, I was informed at top level in the IDA that the grant was sanctioned by the previous Government in November last and that it was expected to be signed, sealed and delivered in January? When that did not happen I was given an assurance that the company concerned, Searle, would go ahead in April.  Now, in the middle of May, we are still getting these bland assurances that something is coming.  Is the Minister aware of that situation?

      <P>In addition, the IDA approved 22 projects for south Tipperary in 1981 which are expected to provide a total of 865 jobs at full production.  Many of these jobs, and jobs in projects secured in earlier years have yet to come on stream.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that any negotiations for industrial projects are confidential.  In fact, projects have been lost because of a breach of confidence by one side or the other or by advance notification.  These negotiations are carried out in confidence.  Companies do not wish to have their business discussed in public or anywhere else.</P>
      <P>I will be only too glad when pursuing the attraction of industries to Cashel, Carrick-on-Suir and Cahir to announce them at the appropriate time.  It is a pleasure to be able to announce such projects but we must first get people interested, get the project together and approved.

The Deputy appreciates the confidentiality of any negotiations that take place in any area.  I am not at liberty to break that confidence, nor is the IDA, until everything is signed, sealed and delivered.  The Deputy can be assured that every effort is being made to follow up projects in the towns mentioned. The maximum amount of manufacturing industry that can be attracted to those towns will be followed up in our <Col N="1627" /> general drive for more manufacturing industry throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The Chair is investigating the matter and on a previous occasion the Chair indicated that when he had a matter under investigation he would retain the status quo.  I understand the status quo to be that the Minister asked the permission of the Chair to take these together.  In the interest of Members I ask the Chair to retain the power that he apparently has, and which the Minister believes the Chair has, given that he has asked for permission, and I ask that the Minister on this occasion answer the questions separately.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 to 17, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In their Industrial Plan 1978-1982, the Industrial Development Authority have divided North Tipperary into two town groupings.</P>
      <P>Insofar as the Templemore-Thurles town grouping is concerned, the authority, in conjunction with the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited, set a job creation target of 500 new jobs.  By the end of 1981 these agencies had approved grant assistance for industrial projects which plan to provide 450 jobs at full production, of which 270 had been created by the end of 1981.</P>
      <P>Both the IDA and SFADCo are promoting this area vigorously for industrial development, employing the full range of financial incentives.  In addition, the IDA have available two advance factories of 18,750 sq. ft. in Thurles, with a third of the same size due for completion shortly, together with 64 acres of land available for suitable industrial projects.  SFADCo have recently completed 2×2,500 sq. ft. small factory units which are being promoted as part of the company's small indigenous industry drive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conjunction with SFADCo, the IDA have set a target of 700 new industrial jobs for the town grouping which includes Borrisokane and Roscrea in their industrial plan.  By the end of 1981, grant aid had been approved for industrial projects which plan to create 1,980 jobs at full production of which 500 had actually been created.  In addition to the normal attractive range of incentives available from IDA and SFADCo, a <Col N="1632" /> 24,000 sq. ft. advance factory which is under construction at Roscrea is due for completion in September next and SFADCo hope to commence the building of two small factories in the town later this year.  Thirty-seven acres of land are also available for industrial development in the Roscrea area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the unemployment rate in the Thurles employment exchange area has increased by 81 per cent over the past three years, would the Minister agree that the targets and plans of the IDA are totally inadequate? Since during this period the IDA claim to have approved 450 jobs in the area,could the Minister explain how unemployment could have increased by 81 per cent, an increase one-third greater than the national average and four times the average rate in the remainder of the constituency?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will be glad to hear that negotiations are at an early stage for the attraction of an industry to the advance factory at Thurles.  This is an area of high unemployment and I am as deeply concerned about it as the Deputy.  There is no point in being hypocritical about this.  The Deputy was a Member of the other House for a short time and I would ask whether he made the same case when his party were in power.</P>

    <P>In their Industrial Plan 1978-1982 the Industrial Development Authority, in conjunction with the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, set a total job creation target of 4,100 for Limerick city and county.  Since 1978 these agencies <Col N="1635" /> have approved grant assistance for industrial projects in Limerick city and county which plan to provide 9,200 jobs in full production of which over 4,000 had been created by the end of 1981.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority are continuing vigorously to promote the Limerick area for large-scale industrial investment employing their full range of incentives, which include 160 acres of land available for industrial development.  In addition, the unique sheltered and deep water port facilities of the Shannon Estuary are highlighted to promoters of suitable industrial projects.

        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> Is the Minister aware that at peak construction over 5,000 men were employed at the Alcan site and that it is now winding down so that by early 1983 5,000 people will be looking for jobs?  Is he further aware that the 700 jobs to be provided when the plant is finished are basically of a skilled nature and the people actually working on sites will not have the skills to be employed in the permanent plant? Is the Minister further aware that unemployment in Limerick city alone is now over 5,000 and in certain communities it is between 25 and 30 per cent?  Can the Minister tell me of one project which either his Department or the IDA are processing at the moment which will provide even one extra job for the region?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the winding-down operation in relation to the work-force and I understand that it will diminish to about 2,000 in December of this year.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree that not all of the workforce are Limerick people.  They are attracted in from other parts of the country.  Nevertheless, Limerick itself has attracted many major industries in the electronics field and the area has been continually promoted by the IDA in that direction. A project for a further one is at a very advance stage of negotiation by the IDA in the Limerick city area.  As I have said, the Deputy will appreciate that confidentiality <Col N="1636" /> must be kept until the company are ready to announce their going ahead situation. Everything possible is being done in relation to Limerick.  Many of the jobs are to come on stream from the industries already existing there.  Everything possible will be done in relation to Limerick city which is attracting a high degree of electronics firms.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Is the Minister aware that the projected jobs in the electronics industry do not answer the needs to the people who are unemployed at the moment because they have not the skills required to work in these industries?  Is he also aware that the thousands of people on the site who are becoming redundant are unskilled and semi-skilled and that they will not be eligible for employment in the Limerick city electronics factories?  Are we to have a large building project somewhere in the estuary?  That is what is needed for our unemployment problems at the moment. Has the Minister any views on this?  What about the oil refinery, where the Minister's colleague, Deputy Colley, when Tánaiste, now reclining gracefully in the back benches by courtesy of the Minister and his friends, dug a sod in Ballylongford before the June election?</P>

In relation to the oil refinery that the Deputy referred to, it is not as live as it was some time ago and I will give the reasons for that.  As the Deputy and the House will be aware, oil production in Saudi Arabia has been scaled down very significantly and the crude oil was coming from Saudi Arabia to make this project possible.  The promoters have indicated to the IDA recently that they are not pulling out of the project but they are leaving it downstream for the moment.  When we assess the oil industry and the way it is going at the moment it is easy to understand the promoters' approach in this difficult situation.</P>

However, I would like to see a categorised breakdown of the people who are unemployed in the various areas so that we can know exactly what type of employment is needed in an area.  At the moment they are all lumped together, as the Deputy, I and everyone else knows. We need to have them categorised and to section them out so that we can see what industries are required in particular areas and to try to respond to the needs of the various areas.  I am also aware that training will play a more important part in the future and that the nature of the job in any worker's lifetime will have to change a couple of times and additional training facilities will have to be planned for in the future to try to alleviate some of the problems the Deputy has talked about.</P>

      <P>I understand that representatives of Albatros Fertilisers Ltd. have had separate discussions recently with officers of my Department and officials of the IDA and Fóir Teoranta, to see what assistance might be available in connection with the company's recently announced rationalisation and capital development proposals.  The present position is that the IDA and Fóir Teoranta are considering a detailed submission which has just been received from the company.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, aware of the impending redundancies recently announced by Albatros.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned this discussion I stated that there was complete dissatisfaction with the consultations between the Post Office Workers' Union and the Department.  Despite the assurances of the Minister the union are not happy with the situation and the workers have grave fears for their future. Questions were submitted to the Minister last Christmas but to date a reply has not been received and I should like the Minister to say when they will be answered. I am sure that the Minister and his officials will agree that proper consultations have not taken place to date.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister inform the House what will be the situation if the staff resist this transfer from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to the two new bodies proposed, as this seems the likely course they will pursue?</P>
      <P>On the occasion of the circulation of the Green Paper the previous Minister, Deputy Reynolds, circulated a document to each member of the staff in which it is stated:</P>
      <P>I want to assure you that there will be full consultation with your Union/Association about all aspects of the changes likely to affect you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1691" /> I regret to say that this has not taken place.  Another assurance in this document reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Chapter 6 describes the broad implications that the setting up of the State-sponsored bodies would have on the staff.  During the period of change which lies ahead, the safeguarding of your legitimate interests will be one of my primary concerns.</P>
    <P>There is a notable absence of this concern in the legislation which is presented to us and I will deal with that as we go through the various sections.</P>
    <P>I have a document from the present Minister, Deputy Wilson, circulated to the staff no later than last week.  I quote from it:</P>
    <P>&mdash;your pay at the changeover will be maintained if you are transferred to An Post or Bord Telecom Éireann, &mdash;your pension entitlements will be maintained also,</P>
    <P>Further on it is stated:</P>
    <P>As you probably know, since the reorganisation was originally announced, there have been consultations with staff organisations about those aspects of the reorganisation which are likely to affect the staff. These consultations will be continued during the coming months.</P>
    <P>We are now being asked to pass this Bill with, as yet, no satisfactory outcome to these consultations, and this is the great fear that members of the staff have regarding their future in either body.  The Minister further says in his document that it is his wish that both bodies should commence operations later this year.</P>
    <P>I will now, with the permission of the Chair, go through some sections of the Bill which I feel are worthy of further consideration and on which I wish to express some doubts.  Deputy Cooney spelled out earlier today the problem of funding to get both boards off to a good start.  The funds are totally inadequate and before very long the boards are likely to be in a loss-making situation because they would have to get fairly hefty loans <Col N="1692" /> since sufficient funds are not being provided from the Exchequer.  Section 10(3)(a) is as follows:</P>
    <P>Subject to paragraph (c) the authorised share capital of An Post shall be an amount not exceeding the total of the following&mdash; ...</P>
    <P>In the case of An Post this will be £50 million to meet capital expenditure.  This will in no way be sufficient in view of the extent of the capital programme which the Minister spelled out, which is fairly hefty and which arises from the fact that down through the years the Post Office did not have sufficient finance to maintain their structures properly.  In some cases the buildings are not fit for people to work in and are not conducive to good productivity.  They were not custom built for their purpose and are long outdated. Therefore £50 million is totally inadequate to meet the demand that is likely to be placed on it in the future if the new company is to be profitable.  Unless we can provide proper working conditions so that we will have a happy staff and greater productivity, it is not likely that this company will survive.</P>
    <P>Section 12(1)(a) of the Bill is as follows:</P>
    <P>to meet the industrial, commercial and social needs of the State for efficient postal services and, so far as the company considers reasonably practicable, to satisfy all reasonable demands for such services throughout the State,</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the lack of emphasis here on the social needs of the community. Despite the fact that we are now embarking on a commercial venture, there is a need for concern to be expressed regarding the social work which is to be carried out by both companies.</P>
    <P>Section 13(1)(a) provides:</P>
    <P>Charges for services are kept at the minimum rates consistent with meeting approved financial targets,</P>
    <P>If proper funding is not provided we will incur further trouble because if we increase our charges business will fall off. Everybody realises that the recent <Col N="1693" /> increases have led to a reduction in the volume of traffic and as a result both companies are likely to suffer.</P>
    <P>In section 14 the social need is again played down.  Subsection (1)(a) states:</P>
    <P>To provide a telecommunications service to meet the industrial, commercial and social needs of the State ...</P>
    <P>Section 25 is in relation to the power to borrow.  Again, I would emphasise that the provisions are in no way adequate to meet the demands likely to be placed on the new companies.</P>
    <P>Section 26 refers to guaranteeing by the Minister for Finance of borrowings. In the case of the postal company the amount is £8,500,000 and in the case of the telecommunications company the amount is £1,050,000,000.  In regard to the postal company, £8,500,000 is in no way sufficient to maintain services within that company.</P>
    <P>Section 27(2) states:</P>
    <P>.... the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister, may make available ....</P>
    <P>What does the Minister mean by &ldquo;may&rdquo;? Is the Minister going to make this available? The Minister has discretionary powers.  He may decide not to finance the capital works and as a result we are back to the old problem of plant which is outdated. In the postal section at the moment there is a van fleet which cannot provide an efficient service.  Last week there was nearly a major row about 17 motor vehicles which were transferred from the telecommunications side to the postal side.  Are we going to be faced with this again if the Minister is not prepared to use the discretionary powers which he insists on holding in this case under section 27(2), which is as follows:</P>
    <P>During the period of three years from the vesting day, the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister, may make available to the postal company grants of an amount not exceeding £20,000,000 for current expenditure.</P>
    <P>If one takes into account the current losses, we are talking about something in <Col N="1694" /> the region of £6.5 million per year, which is in no way sufficient to meet the demands which are likely to be placed on it in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Section 42(1) states:</P>
    <P>Subject to subsection (2), a member of the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who is transferred on the vesting day to either company shall not, while in the service of the company, receive a lesser scale of pay or be brought to less beneficial conditions of service than the scale of pay to which he was entitled and the conditions of service to which he was subject immediately before the vesting day.</P>
    <P>This is crucial to the whole approval of the Bill, because we have here in effect the movement of 28,000 people.  Their conditions, it is stated, are not going to be worsened.  I will not accept that, because they are being cut off from a valuable avenue of promotion.  They are going to be deprived of the promotional outlets they had in the past simply because they will no longer be civil servants. This needs to be looked at again. Does the Minister intend to compensate these people?  Would the Minister be prepared to allow staff members who enjoy civil service status to retain that status on vesting day?  Otherwise I can see quite a lot of unrest and a lot of industrial problems in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>It was traditional that civil servants were entitled to a non-contributory pension. Nevertheless, in every wage deal there was a 5 per cent hidden contribution. Will cognisance be given to this in the transfer from one service to the other?  Will the workers be compensated for increased PRSI contributions?  Would the Minister enlighten me?</P>
    <P>Section 44 deals with the provision of certain welfare funds &mdash; the Post Office Sanatoria Fund and the Rowland Hill Benevolent Fund.  What happens to the moneys already in these funds?  Will they be transferred to meet the social needs of the staff?  Granted the contributions were small, but these funds have been contributed to by many staff members for a number of years.</P>
    <P>Sections 45 and 46 deal with the establishment <Col N="1695" /> and functions of the Users' Councils.  Section 46 (5) says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b) recover from the appropriate company the cost incurred by its Council.</P>
    <P>The implications are quite serious.  Section 46 (3) says:</P>
    <P>A Council may, .... employ advisers to assist the Council in its work.</P>
    <P>This could prove to be quite costly.  If workers in the new company were asked to produce reports which were time consuming and costly, the implications could be very serious for a fledgling organisation which is trying to get off the ground. In my opinion the Minister should bear these costs rather than either of the companies.</P>
    <P>Section 47 deals with statutory interim boards.  While the Minister will appoint some people to the interim board, there is a need for the election of the worker directors to be carried out prior to the appointment of the interim board.  Otherwise there will be a time lag.</P>
    <P>Section 48 covers loss making services. Section 48 (1) (c) states:</P>
    <P>that company satisfies the Minister that, over a period of at least 12 months, it has sustained a loss in the provision or maintenance of such services,</P>
    <P>The Minister is prepared to cover these losses for 12 months.  I maintain he should be talking about a five year period at least.  I ask him to examine this section again.  The only people likely to be happy about sections 51 and 52 are the city and county managers who will collect the rates from both companies' premises.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with the postal company. The Department of Posts and Telegraphs enjoyed a monopoly situation in this area in the past, but we should sound a warning here.  If there is to be an erosion of services when it is siphoned off to the private sector, there will be a great danger. We have a monopoly situation at present; yet nobody has been charged <Col N="1696" /> under the Monopolies Act, even though there are people operating openly and providing services which could be termed proper to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  In this House we have the use of a courier service.  The danger is that there might be some people in the private sector who would be prepared to take on this very lucrative service but they would not be attracted to providing the service in sparsely populated areas. The Minister is empowered to issue the necessary licences.  This whole matter deserves further scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Section 64 deals with the provision of banking services, including a giro service. Had this area been properly worked in the past, we would not be in the situation where we would have to provide funds for the maintenance of a telecommunications system.  We cash giro cheques from practically every European country, yet we do not provide a giro system ourselves. This is something the postal authorities can be faulted for.  When Britain introduced this service, they made a loss for the first two years; they broke even on third year and made a profit the fourth.  This area will need immediate attention.  We are moving into the area of plastic card banking.  With proper capital investment there are appliances available which will make every sub-post office and every post office a branch of our banking system.  In this way we would win back the business we lost.  Before the vesting date the Minister should give a commitment that he will introduce the giro system.</P>
    <P>Section 65 deals with money orders and postal orders.  This was a lucrative operation at one time but because of increased costs it has become run down. It is no longer possible to send money orders to Great Britain because of the change in the monetary system.  Under the present money order system, it costs £1.50 to send a limited sum abroad.</P>
    <P>Section 70 empowers the company to issue licences to others to provide postal services.  There is a need to tighten up this area.  As yet we have not been successful in deterring people who want to cut into the monopoly situation enjoyed at present by the Post Office.  There is a <Col N="1697" /> need for further examination of this situation.</P>
    <P>Section 73 deals with the collection of television licence fees.  I do not want to get involved in a Post Office versus RTE argument about the collection of TV licence fees.  It has been the custom and practice of the Post Office to collect these fees and to issue licences and I do not think it would serve either system if we were to set up an independent collection system within RTE.  I do not think the demand exists to justify the setting up of a special collection system.  There may be a need for streamlining, but the Post Office personnel, with their knowledge, are the best people to operate this service.  The Minister is aware of this, as he indicated already today.</P>
    <P>I am aware that two former Ministers are present and also a Minister of State and I was taken by one piece of Post Office jargon in Section 80 (g) &mdash; to defer the despatch or delivery of a postal package where the company considers it to be necessary in the interest of the service. There is a subtle change here.  In the past, the exigency of the service was referred to.  The change is not in the best interest of the customer.  It may be one word, but it is a very important one.  I ask the Minister to examine this matter, because the customer is now put in a disadvantaged position.</P>
    <P>In Part V of the Bill referring to telecommunications, most of those involved in the telecommunications sector, namely the technicians, are reasonably satisfied, with some reservations, about the introduction of the Bill.  Nonetheless, they have expressed legitimate fears. Also in that section there are 5,000 members who would not be too happy about their future in the new company, largely due to advancing technology.  Some years back, when an assessment was made of the development of the telecommunications service, 15 automanual exchanges throughout the country were envisaged. This figure has now been reduced to five and consequently a number of jobs have been put in jeopardy.  These fears on the part of telephone operators need to be expressed.  A reduction in exchanges with <Col N="1698" /> the advancement of technology and the provision of digital exchanges, will inevitably lead to a reduction in manning levels and some provision must be made for those affected.  Can we provide alternative employment for them within the system?  In the past, outlets were available to such people, if they so wished, to contest a position in another part of the service.  This is no longer open to them under the present legislation.  Will provision be made for financial compensation? Many of these are in their late twenties and early thirties, married men and women who decided on the Post Office as a career and whose jobs are now threatened by advancing technology.</P>
    <P>It is quite heartening to hear the Minister say that in many parts of the country there are no waiting lists for a phone service and this is something which we should all welcome.  However, that sounds a warning signal for some members of the union.  While at the moment it is an expanding industry, the Minister did say that he would see the waiting list wiped out by 1984.  What do you then do with the highly skilled personnel who have been working for you?  Could they expand into the section which is now being taken over by the private sector, that is, beyond the point of connection of houses, the private automatic branch exchanges where the private sector have effectively out-paced the Post Office? They have provided a more advanced type of apparatus than the Post Office were prepared to do.  As a result, they have taken quite a share of the lucrative side of the market.</P>
    <P>This is an area in which the telecommunications company must get involved, if we are to maintain our staff levels. Quite a lot of money has been spent to date on the training of these personnel, who are of a very high standard, second to none.  Despite the shortage of capital &mdash; and all Governments must take their share of blame for not having provided sufficient capital down through the years &mdash; a reasonably good service has been provided against tremendous odds.  I hope the Minister will give me information regarding the threat of redundancy <Col N="1699" /> within the telecommunications sector, mainly to those involved as operators.</P>
    <P>On section 92, concerning control of telecommunications service, am I right in asking is there a facility for what is commonly referred to as phone tapping?  I am not advocating it for a moment, but is it catered for in the Bill?</P>
    <P>This is a potential growth area and there are likely to be problems of demarcation between the two services with developing technology.  In an article in <i>The Sunday Press</i> last Sunday, Mr. Byrne made a disturbing comment and I would like the lines of demarcation to be very clearly drawn regarding the future of technology.  There are several operations within the postal system which traditionally have been carried out by the postal side.  With the changeover to facsimile transmission and so forth, there is a danger that some people on the telecommunications side would feel that this was proper to their side of the operation.  This matter should be resolved before we have very serious industrial problems.</P>
    <P>On Section 105, similar to the granting of licences in the postal section in granting licences for the telecommunications services, we cannot afford to relax our efforts because the whole philosophy is based on this.  If this is not successful, it is unlikely that there will be any success at all.  Incidentally, I will be awaiting the Minister's reply before making a decision on whether to support the Bill.  Several questions will have to be answered before I can indicate the direction in which I will vote.  My first reaction to the Bill is that I am not satisfied with the consultation which has taken place to date between the Minister and, especially, the Post Office Workers' Union.  Until such time as all these questions have been answered satisfactorily, I doubt very much if much progress will be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation. I especially commend the Minister on his comprehensive speech.  The statement, particularly the introduction, might provide very useful reading for all whose business it is to comment on the activities of the Department, and indeed, <Col N="1700" /> for the public generally if they are to understand the reality of the almost insuperable problems which face a Department of State endeavouring to operate a gigantic business, and if they are to appreciate the success of the efforts made in this respect in recent times.  I appreciate also the Minister's references to me in the course of his remarks, but I might add that it is what I would have expected of him.</P>
      <P>I suppose it is understandable that I should wish to refer to the fact that the original proposal to remove posts and telecommunications from the civil service, to set up two separate companies, each under the control of its own board, which would take over the running of posts and telecommunications from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was first put to the Government by me as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. In our Election Manifesto of 1977 we had stressed that an efficient and dependable communications system formed an essential part of the strategy of national reconstruction.  We had undertaken to examine the question of giving autonomy to the telecommunications area and to modernising the postal system.  Having examined the situation in considerable detail, I felt we should go a step further and grant autonomy to the postal services as well as to telecommunications. When I put these proposals to the Government they were anxious to have the matter investigated in greater detail.  Therefore I set up a review group, as was mentioned by the Minister in the course of his remarks today, chaired by Dr. Michael Dargan, and here I might quote from their terms of reference:</P>
      <P>1.  To examine and report on the feasibility of giving to the telecommunications service such form of autonomous organisation as is likely to be most effective in meeting current public demand and providing for future development and expansion; and to make specific proposals regarding the nature, powers, and functions of the organisation recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  To examine and report on the organisational arrangements necessary <Col N="1701" /> to secure the modernisation of the postal system so as to promote an efficient delivery system nationwide.</P>
    <P>The latter part of the terms of reference, that is in relation to the postal services, was in conformity with our election promise though, as I mentioned, personally I would have preferred to have given to the postal services the same autonomy as was proposed for the telecommunications sector.  Indeed, in the final analysis this was recommended also by the review group.</P>
    <P>The Government, having studied the report of the review group, accepted most of their recommendations and so was begun the process of removing the telecommunications and postal services from the civil service.  This process will reach finality when the Bill at present before the House becomes law.</P>
    <P>I should like again to express appreciation not only of the exceptional work done by the review group but also of the speed with which this very highly complicated work was accomplished.  I know it is often felt that the setting up of review groups is simply an expedient for delay, but in this case the objective was to examine the whole system thoroughly and report with all speed.  Indeed, the fact that the review group reported as quickly as they did is now a matter of record in that, as far as I can remember, they reported within 12 months.  Invitations to provide information and evidence were issued at that time through press advertisements. Invitations were issued also to approximately 400 organisations having a particular interest.  Credit must go to those various organisations which submitted evidence, information and recommendations for the alacrity with which they dealt with the matter and the manner in which they responded to those invitations.  There were also quite a number of advisers to the review group, some individuals from other countries, to whom we owe a debt also and, finally, but by no means least, the officials in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who deserve very special credit for their activity in that period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1702" /> The decision to form the boards and to remove the telecommunications and postal services from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was not a reflection on the work of that Department or their officials.  We must award credit where it is due and sterling work was done in the Department, at both official and worker level, over the years in managing what might be termed an enormous industry, employing half of the personnel of the whole of the civil service, which at present I think stands at almost 30,000 people, comprised of people in literally hundreds of grades.  Those who may be critical of the Department's performance, or of the workers' performance in the Department, might take that aspect of the matter into account.  If such critics are employers themselves they might well ask themselves how many personnel they employ, what a success they have had in their business ventures, how good are their industrial relations and then endeavour to relate the problems confronting them to those which confronted what was an enormous business employing numerous people within a considerable number of grades.  One must remember also that, while endeavouring to run this enormous business, the Department were subjected to all of the restraints and restrictions applicable to the civil service generally. To put it mildly, those restrictions are far from being conducive to good business methodology.</P>
    <P>When I became Minister for Posts and Telegraphs I was amazed to discover, for example, that while other Departments with relatively small numbers of people operating within them, had a secretary, a number of deputy-secretaries and a considerable number of assistant secretaries, this huge complex which was the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, employing a very large number of people with enormous responsibilities relating to the whole economic life of the nation, had merely a secretary and three assistant secretaries.  At the time I tried to envisage how an industry as large as this one operating as a private company would have developed its management structures. I must say I was appalled at the difference between the management <Col N="1703" /> structures which were then the norm in such private companies and those pertaining to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I immediately set about rectifying that situation, with the full support of the Government, and we soon had a top management grouping with some reasonable opportunity of tackling the problems involved.  Finally and perhaps most important of all, because it was this particular aspect from which most of the problems arose, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has been run on a shoestring and has been starved of the finance necessary to develop the postal but more particularly the telecommunications system.</P>
    <P>I know I could advance many reasons why various Governments did not feel the need to make more money available to the Department, but that would be of very little help to the Department as such.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs received annual increases such as those received by other Departments with no particular concern being shown for the fact that they were not simply a Department of State but a business on which depended to a considerable extent the development of our whole economy. I shall not today go into all of the reasons I believe such a situation obtained except to say that while developing our industry, which we had done successfully, particularly in the late fifties and early sixties, the vital importance of a good telecommunications system was not recognised in time.  We have been endeavouring to fill that vacuum ever since, thankfully I would say, despite all the criticism, with some considerable success.  When I was in charge of the Department it was clear to me that to continue to endeavour to develop a system relying on relatively small percentage increases in the income of the Department was ludicrous.</P>
    <P>I recommended to the Government that £650 million should immediately be allocated for capital expansion in the telephone service over a five-year period to get going on the development of what I regarded as a vital cog in the wheel of our industrial expansion.  This was agreed to by the Government.  I feel this was a <Col N="1704" /> major step forward especially when one considers that the proposed sum of money for a five-year programme was greater than the total amount spent on the Department of Posts and Telegraphs from 1922.  Even allowing for changes in the value of money, the money represented an excellent and badly needed injection of finance into what until then had been the Cinderella Department.</P>
    <P>As a result of this more and more installers and technicians were trained, more and more advanced equipment was bought and installed, more and more exchanges were erected and put into operation.  I believe this was the first time the Department were really in a position to develop and expand and the foundation was laid for the rapid increase in the number of telephone installations which has since taken place.  I often wonder what different image the Department would have shown to the public had this opportunity been provided much earlier.</P>
    <P>I have gone into a little detail in explaining some of the reasons why the Department of Posts and Telegraphs had not got the success in developing their post and telecommunications systems which the efforts of many dedicated men and women entitled the Department to do.  It seems to have often been forgotten that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are not just that large grey building in O'Connell Street known as the GPO.  The Department are a body of people who have been struggling for years to run a very large business without business training and without the necessary finance, endeavouring to operate within the restraints and restrictions of the civil service code &mdash; in fact, attempting to achieve the well nigh impossible. After being granted greater finance a few years ago a change in development has come rapidly.  While we have still a long way to go to reach a satisfactory level of development and progress, it is only fair that a tribute should be paid to this much maligned Department.</P>
    <P>The Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill, 1982, is a very lengthy Bill. If I remember rightly, the Bill taking posts and telecommunications out of the civil service in Britain was the longest Bill <Col N="1705" /> ever to come before the United Kingdom Parliament.  The proposal in the Bill is to set up two boards, An Post and An Bord Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>The British Bill decided to set up one board only to run both services, but recently they have also come to accept that our idea of setting up two boards to run the services separately is a better system.  After the initial decision to remove the postal services and telecommunications services from the civil service was taken, it was clear that it would take quite a considerable time before it was possible to have a Bill dealing with the very complicated and involved matter before the Dáil and it was decided to set up two interim boards to take over by degrees the running of the services.  I feel this had the advantage of helping this vast organisation to get used to the new system and it also helped both at management and worker level to cater for a variety of problems which would become apparent in the course of the change-over.</P>
    <P>Two interim boards were set up.  My object was to endeavour to prevail on people who had successfully developed their own business to accept places on the boards and also to include workers who had a deep knowledge of the operation of the system and who could interpret their co-workers' hopes, aspirations and fears relating to this new departure.  I believed, since I regarded the postal services and the telecommunications services as businesses, as the restraints of the civil services rules and regulations were being removed and as we were about to make a new start, that it was of vital importance that we should have the best possible business expertise available to us at board level.  I felt that, where the board members had already shown they had got an ability which resulted in their own companies being successful, we could be all the more hopeful that they would have the capacity, energy and iniative to succeed in these new ventures.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that the work facing the new boards was stupendous and that the time and effort required from each member would be exceptional was clear to all concerned.  It is to the credit of all those who agreed to participate <Col N="1706" /> that they accepted the positions offered.  I would like to express my appreciation of that fact.  It is true to say that they each knew pretty accurately the problems and difficulties which faced them, the vital need for the success of their efforts and the dire consequences of failure at national level and at personal level.  One man said to me that he needed the job like he needed a hole in the head. Nevertheless they took on the job and initated something which was new and something which was unthinkable a few years ago.</P>
    <P>I was also anxious to have women on the boards but I was determined that I would not appoint them to the boards simply because they were women but that I would apply the same criteria to them as I applied in the case of men &mdash; that they had proved themselves to be a success in business and commerce.  It took me quite a considerable time to find suitable people in this respect.  I want to make it clear that this is not a criticism of the talent and capacity for business of women but rather a criticism of the lack of opportunity which women often experience which would permit them to develop the talents they have got in the business area.  It struck me at the time that very worth while talent was being wasted because of a lack of opportunity, to the very serious detriment of our economy.  I believe there is some improvement now in this respect but, if my experience is anything to go by, then much remains to be done.  I feel both private industry and semi-State bodies would benefit greatly if they saw to it that women, in line with their talents, were given the same opportunity for advancement as is accorded to men.</P>
    <P>An official telecommunications system is essential for the business and social purposes of the community.  For reasons I outlined earlier, the Irish telecommunications service was not efficient at the time of the review group's report and it has a long way to go to reach the level of efficiency that is of the utmost importance in today's business world.  I am convinced that our telecommunications service can reach that level.  One need only have regard to the French telecommunications <Col N="1707" /> system, which only a short few years ago was the poor relation of the telecommunications systems in western Europe but which today is one of the best, to recognise what an injection of capital, combined with the will to raise the standard of the system, can do.</P>
    <P>The telecommunications system is a business.  It has a rapidly-changing technology. The lateness of our effort to change turned out to be an advantage to some extent in that we were in a position to change to the newest type of technology, whereas if we had already installed an earlier type of technology that would have been better than what we had already got though less efficient than what has been available in recent years, the cost of the changover twice could very easily have been prohibitive.</P>
    <P>There was also an increasing need for marketing orientation.  In all the circumstances the Government and civil service structures were unsuitable for management of telecommunications by reason of their having to accommodate too many restrictions; and, while the officials of the Department, both administrative and technical, were able and dedicated, they did not have the organisational structure and the management freedom to enable them to perform their duties successfully. When the change was decided on and when the interim boards were set up it became clear that the absence for so long of a business structure to meet business needs had brought about a situation in which some considerable time had to be spent in setting up a business organisation, in developing management and to quite an extent in endeavouring to change attitudes.  Despite this need, the availability of extra money for capital expansion permitted a rapid increase in the provision of new buildings and of extensions to existing buildings.  It led also to an increase in the annual rate of telephone connections and to an improvement in the trunk portion of the system.  All of this will give a much better send-off to the statutory board than could have been anticipated only a few years ago.</P>
    <P>The two services &mdash; the telecommunications <Col N="1708" /> and the postal services &mdash; present different types of problems.  At the time of the review group report and prior to it the stage had not been reached where the Department were in a position to meet in full all the demands of the telephone service.  We have not reached that position yet, though I was pleased to hear the Minister say today that it is hoped to reach that situation by 1984.</P>
    <P>I would tend to agree with the Minister because it is obvious that with the amount of groundwork that has been done, especially since the £650 million for capital purposes was made available and having regard to the many improvements that have taken place since then, we can expect shortly to be in a position in which telephones will be available on demand. A number of other improvements needed to be made in this area.  I mentioned earlier the number of buildings that were essential &mdash; about 500.  Many of these were new exchanges some of which have been opened and others will I hope be opened in the near future, and so we should soon reach the situation in which we can provide phones on demand.</P>
    <P>At the time that consideration was being given to the setting-up of these new boards we realised that the level of telephone development was far below that of the other EEC countries.  Demands for new telephones has increased rapidly and we set about expanding our resources in buildings and manpower up to a level that would eventually enable the arrears to be undertaken and the current demand to be met promptly.  We needed a very much better quality of service.  Progress achieved by the new boards in the future will be very closely watched.</P>
    <P>Much has been achieved in the past number of years but much more is needed if we are to keep ourselves with an efficient and effective service and, consequently, to keep up with the rapid technological changes to be found in the more advanced countries.</P>
    <P>The postal service has been reasonably well developed and the amount of business handled by this service has been fairly constant.  However, increasing costs and other changes have begun to erode this business.  In this connection I <Col N="1709" /> am glad to note from a statement made by the Minister a few days ago that consideration is being given to reducing postal charges in an effort to attract further business to the Post Office.  This would be a step in the right direction, one that would have the double advantage of attracting more business while at the same time helping to reduce costs to industry generally.</P>
    <P>The targets on which the five-year development programme was based are still relevant and perhaps I might outline them.  They were: first to raise the quality of the telephone, telex and data services for subscribers to the level to be found in other EEC countries and to maintain it at that level; secondly, to provide a full automatic service, including STD internally and internationally for all subscribers; thirdly, to increase the rate of connections so that applications for telephone service could be met generally on demand; and, fourthly, to lay the groundwork to cater for continuing growth.  Much has been achieved in each of these areas but much remains to be done also.  At the time it was easy to list the improvements needed but it was much more difficult to achieve them.</P>
    <P>There was involved an attempt to achieve a rate of development within a five-year period which very few other telephone administrations had matched. In our case it included the acquisition of sites for and the erection of more than 500 buildings, the design and manufacture of a whole range of exchange equipment, a major extension of the trunk and junction network, the recruitment and training of extra staff, the provision of accommodation for them, the acquisition of stores, increasing the size of the transport fleet and so on.  It was indeed a herculian task and one has only to look at the number of new buildings throughout the country, the new exchanges which have been opened and the exchanges which will soon be opened, to realise that.  I include the Drogheda exchange in that but I was disappointed that I did not see the Dundalk exchange mentioned.  I do not know why it is not being opened this year also.  I had the pleasure of opening the Letterkenny <Col N="1710" /> exchange and I am sure Deputy Harte knows all about that.  I laid the foundation stone for a large exchange in Galway which when opened will revolutionise the telecommunications services in the Galway area.  They are but a few of the advances which have taken place.  The increase in the number of technicians and installers employed in the Department today also points to the progress that has been made.  We look to Bord Telecom Éireann to speed up this progress.</P>
    <P>On the postal side I was glad to note that An Post sees the possibility of expanding the service provided by post offices.  There is no doubt, as a number of speakers mentioned, that post offices could be used for many other purposes than at present.  They could make available to the public a range of services not readily available now, particularly in rural areas.  Much could be done in the area of social welfare.  Developing the facilities to assist people to save money is another area.  The Minister has stated that there are many bright ideas at board and administrative level which will improve the service.  I have no doubt that that is so and that the Minister will be glad to give whatever assistance is necessary to the board in their efforts to improve the postal and other services through post offices.  I have no doubt that postmasters and postmistresses throughout the country will be glad to co-operate with the board in every way possible.  The possible introduction of Giro is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out that up to now the interim boards and management had to work within the structural constraints of the Post Office statutory framework.  The interface between the board, the secretary of the Department and other officials was a delicate and difficult matter, calling for a flexible outlook on their part and their dedication and commitment to making the transition. It is to the credit of all concerned that things have gone as smoothly as they have to date.</P>
    <P>The decision to remove the postal service and telecommunications from the civil service was in no way expressing a criticism of the staff of the Department <Col N="1711" /> at management level.  I hasten to add that it was in no sense a criticism of the operating staff either.  The reason for the decision was to give greater freedom of action to provide services to the community in the most effective way.  As a matter of interest, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was one of the few Departments that remained unchanged since its inception.  The time had come to recognise that the work being dealt with by the Department had expanded beyond what could be efficiently managed within one unit.  In modern times postal and telecommunications services should be run as businesses and designed to meet the needs of the multitude of users.</P>
    <P>A full recognition that the wholehearted support of the staff is necessary if we are to achieve our objective of providing a first class telecommunications system and a top class postal service is obvious.  My recognition of this fact was the reason I gave an undertaking that full consultation with the staff organisations would take place about any proposals or changes affecting them.  The task of reorganisation which we were embarking upon is formidable and without precedent in that we were undertaking to remove from the civil service area two large blocks of work involving almost 30,000 people.  That is still a tremendous task particularly when one takes into consideration that we are dealing with a considerable number of unions and grades. It is understandable that groupings of workers and individuals would tend to examine proposals in the light of their interests and that agreement to their removal from civil service status would cause them concern.  Much consideration of proposals put forward was deemed to be a vital necessity so that the staff could clearly understand the nature of the change, its long term effect on their employment and the ultimate goal we had set ourselves and how we proposed to achieve it.</P>
    <P>On the other hand there were many groupings who realised the need for change.  They understood that we were basically concerned with giving them greater freedom of action to provide better <Col N="1712" /> services to the community in the most effective way.  The various unions in the Post Office because of their involvement in discussions for better conditions for their members understand more than most that because of the statutory responsibility of the Minister for the Public Service for many of these matters in respect of the civil service generally, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs lacked important freedoms which were necessary if they were to achieve the objective that had been set.  The Department was not free to determine many matters which the new company would be free to do.  As an example, when the ban was placed on the creation of new posts in the civil service in the mid-seventies it had detrimental effect on the Department because technicians and installers were civil servants and the need for more technicians if the service was to be improved should have been obvious. It is clear that there is a need for a different system of personnel management and industrial relations and that this could be achieved only after the telecommunications and postal systems were removed from the constraints which civil service membership imposed on them.</P>
    <P>Since the decision to bring these bodies outside the civil service was taken a lot of work has been done in developing a new system by the interim board in co-operation with the Department.  Efforts have been made to develop a progressive and comprehensive personnel policy and to provide an adequate management team, but much more remains to be done so as to convince staff that their wellbeing and working environment is receiving adequate and due attention.  The new boards must inspire confidence in the staff and if they succeed in doing this we will be well on our way to success in achieving the highly efficient telecommunications and postal services we need. I believe that the boards and the new structures are capable of inspiring the necessary confidence in the staff and that the new system will enable them to do this.</P>
    <P>To change simply for the sake of change was not and is not the objective. Change was decided upon because it was <Col N="1713" /> believed that such a change would promote the rapid development of the two systems and thereby help our economy to grow and prosper and create much needed new jobs.  If we do not succeed in this area we will have failed in our objective. I do not believe we will fail, but I repeat that the goodwill of the staff is crucial and that every effort must be made to ensure that goodwill.</P>
    <P>In respect of the composition of the boards, I note that section 32 requires that one-third of the directors of each company shall be employees elected in accordance with the provisions of that section.  This is broadly in line with the provisions of the Worker Participation Act, 1977.  I recall that when the interim boards were being set up representatives of the workers were nominated to each board.  It was not possible at that time for them to be elected because no machinery was available for that purpose.  However, it was intended that worker representatives would be elected to the statutory bodies and the nomination of worker representatives to the interim boards was an acknowledgement by me and by the Government of the vital importance of having worker representatives to voice the views, the fears and the expectations of the staff generally.  I welcome the decision to have employees elected to the boards and I am glad to note that it is proposed to have a postmaster elected to a position as a director on the board of An Post.  This, too, had been provided for at the time and, as far as I can remember, the secretary of the Postmasters' Union is the representative.  He also was nominated because at the time we had not the machinery by which a member could be elected.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister proposes to establish a users' council on a statutory basis in relation to each of these boards. We have had users' councils previously on a non-statutory basis and I think one such council exists at present.  I see the Minister proposes that the functions of the new council will be approximately the same as the functions of the non-statutory Post Office Users' Council, except in so far as the new council will have functions in relation to tariffs.  The Minister <Col N="1714" /> referred in his speech to this matter but he might give more detail when replying. I agree that this type of council can perform a useful function.  There are a number of areas where particular problems can be very frustrating for the public and where such a council can do much to ease that frustration.</P>
    <P>I should be interested to know from the Minister whether any considerable number of people have had recourse to the users' council in recent times.  My experience was that very few members of the public knew of its existence or availed of its services.  The vast majority of complaints reached the Department through public representatives or directly from individuals who felt themselves aggrieved.  A users' council can fulfil a worthwhile role in relation to these new companies, both of whose operations impinge on the daily lives of many individuals. Every effort should be made to inform the public that such an organisation exists and what its functions are.  This will not be easy, as I know from my own experience.  I tried by every possible means to inform the public that the users' council was available, but the public still tended to make their complaints through public representatives and very litle use was made of the users' council.  Obviously there is little use in setting up a council unless the public are aware of it and have sufficient confidence to utilise its services.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that very little change has been necessary in the general provisions of the Bill envisaged some years ago.  I fully support the Bill and should be glad to see the boards get the fullest co-operation from all concerned. Equally, the boards must be concerned about the wellbeing and conditions of work of the staff.  Only when the board get the co-operation of the staff and see that the staff are well looked after can this great venture succeed.  The setting up of the boards is not a magic formula; it is not a panacea in itself.  Every effort must be made to ensure a peaceful transition to ensure the success of the boards when they are established on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the honour not only of initiating and developing the <Col N="1715" /> plans to remove the postal and telecommunications services from the civil service and of appointing the interim boards but also of being responsible for the multi-million pound campaign to improve communications infrastructure. This enabled us to appoint more and more technicians and installers, to contract for and erect hundreds of new buildings and to provide new and up-to-date equipment.  This aspect was most important because without it and the resulting developments these new boards would be getting off to a very poor start.  The wheels set in motion by this campaign meant that the interim boards, assisted by the Department, were enabled to move forward more rapidly.</P>
    <P>The prospects for these two boards are bright and I wish them every success.</P>

      <P>One might consider that this was a very controversial Bill because of its extent, but most of the sections and provisions are merely of a technical character, transferring to the boards to be appointed the functions which now rest with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I have been wondering what effectively will be left for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs when these functions are transferred to the boards.  This gives us an opportunity for a heart-to-heart debate in relation to the entire telephone service, its past service to us, its present conditions, its future prospects and possibilities, and likewise regarding the postal service.  We must ask ourselves why this Bill is necessary. This Bill is necessary because the public now have a growing awareness of their entitlement to a full and highly efficient service.  Every Member of this House knows the volume of complaints that in recent years have come from the public to Members of the Dáil in relation to the telephone services and the lack thereof.  In the postal services also the long delays, inefficiency and lack of proper service have been astonishing.  I have often wondered why steps were not taken long ago to improve matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have gone much further than <Col N="1716" /> this Bill allows us to go.  Concerns such as the Bell Telephone Company of Canada and private companies operating in the US and elsewhere should be invited to come here with the invitation: &ldquo;Here is a country crying out for a proper telephone service &mdash; get to work on it.&rdquo;  Private enterprise could long since have given us a highly efficient telephone service which we have not had because of the structure in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. First and foremost, no matter how enthusiastic the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs might be, he is tied up in black knots, red knots and every other colour knots by the Minister for Finance and he has not the money necessary to achieve what should be done.  This Bill gives us the opportunity to say that I do not see anything wrong in encouraging these boards to borrow money, if necessary from abroad or anywhere they can get it, for the development of our telephone service and the bringing to a higher standard efficiency of our postal service.</P>
    <P>When we compare ourselves with other countries we talk only about the EEC countries.  Russia is not a member of the EEC, neither is the US, Norway, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, Turkey, Spain or Portugal.  Does anyone know anything about the services in these countries? Have we become so narrow-minded in this House that every comparison we make must be within the EEC? Undoubtedly there are standards of efficiency in the EEC, but there are also standards of very great inefficiency there. I venture to say that anyone in Madrid can make a call to practically any part of Spain with the least loss of time and with a great standard of efficiency.  We read about conditions in Turkey, but a telephone call can be made from Instanbul to Ankara in a matter of minutes and from Ankara to the southern province of Anatolia.  You can get a call from Lisbon to Oporto in a matter of minutes.  The same standard applies to the telephone service in Stockholm.</P>
    <P>Our trouble is that we are starting so late to tighten up here.  I have heard, I suppose 38 or 40 Estimates of the Department of Posts and Telegrpahs introduced to this House and there is very little difference <Col N="1717" /> between the latest and the first one I heard in 1943.  Standards may have improved and demands may be greater but charges and expenses are higher.  I refer to both postal and telephone services.  This is 1982 and we are living in a period of extraordinary scientific and technological advances.  How many people are aware that, as a result of the advance of science and technology in the US and Russia, the Russians can now land a rocket in any part of New York that they wish or on top of the White House in Washington and that the Americans likewise can land a rocket right at the back door of the Kremlin or the front door if they wish?</P>
    <P>This development has been frightening for both the Americans and the Russians, with the result that a few years ago Russian and American experts got together to find out how they could operate the rockets for the benefit of people and for peace-time purposes.  President Carter played a great part in this.  The rockets standing in the US and Russia were intended to destroy.  These experts got down to consider the possibility of having mail delivered by satellite and rocket. The result of all this is the prospect that by the year 2000 or 2010 mail posted in New York will land in Berlin in a matter of seconds and in London in a matter of minutes and that the same-day delivery will be possible between Moscow and the US.  Many of us in this House now will not be alive to enjoy such a highly efficient service; nevertheless future generations will have it.  I cannot explain to the House how this will work but people engaged in science and technology in the US and Russia are quite satisfied that mail posted in the US in the morning will be capable of being delivered to any part of Europe in the afternoon.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs must be aware of these advances in science and technology.</P>
    <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs in the past have been and at present are working on shoestring estimates. They have not been given the money. They have not been given the staff.  If complaints have been numerous they have also been justified.  The present and <Col N="1718" /> past secretaries of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are not at fault. They have rendered a very useful and valuable service.  On more than one occasion I have had to pay tribute to the outstanding efficiency of Mr. Ó Réagáin and his very limited staff in the Department. I can say the same about Mr. Scannell and his predecessors.  All through the years I have found in the Department the greatest of courtesy and a big effort to achieve a high standard of efficiency.  We can complain about many things, but recognition has been given to the fact that we have a very great standard of civil servants.  How many times do we hear the civil service criticised?  The position is that they are the people who do the work with a high standard of integrity and efficiency.  Never mind what the cranks or critics will say.</P>
    <P>No matter how highly efficient civil servants are they will always be open to criticism as we all are.  The postmasters, counterhands, telephone operators, linesmen, maintenance men on the telephones, technicians of every grade and the people connected with the sub-post offices &mdash; even though they are not directly civil servants &mdash; are all part of a huge organisation from whom the public demand loudly a more efficient service. You cannot give a better service without having the personnel.  Every section of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is understaffed, the postal section, the services in the country, the services over the counter; queues are forming in every post office throughout the country with the exception of the small country suboffice. I have often wondered why there have not been greater staffing facilities provided for night services in the GPO, particularly in the summer.  The one way we can improve the services is by spending more money.  We need more postmen, more linesmen, more technicians, more counterhands to raise the whole standard of services to give the public the service they expect at present.</P>
    <P>Another way we might be able to do that is for the new board to seriously consider reducing charges so that a greater number will avail of the services to be rendered.  At present charges are <Col N="1719" /> prohibitive for the type of service that we have.  Let us take, for example, the postal service.  In the thirties and forties one could go into a post office and buy a 2d. stamp, stick it on a letter, mail it and it would be delivered in London, Glasgow, Hull or Coventry the following morning. Now one can post a letter in any of our rural towns and in the majority of cases it takes a week to be delivered to any part of England outside of London.  But a letter posted in Burssels today will arrive in Dublin tomorrow; it will take two extra days to have it delivered to the country.  The same applies to a letter posted in Paris.  It will be in Dublin in two days and it will take two to three days to reach the person to whom it is addressed in any part of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>What is wrong in cases such as that? Twenty-five or 30 years ago we had a greater degree of efficiency in the postal services and at that time we had the very low paid but highly dedicated postman who had to walk or cycle through all parts of rural Ireland with his deliveries.  One would imagine that since the postman can now have the use of Post Office vans and his own car that this would speed up things. But this is not the case.  The postman will tell one that he is ready to deliver but he has not got the mail to deliver.  Where is the extraordinary holdup or what is happening that it is taking so long for mail to arrive in the sorting office to be sorted and then to be despatched by rail, van or otherwise to various parts of the country?  Instead of advancing with postal deliveries we have accelerated in reverse. Where 25 to 30 years ago we had an efficient daily postal service, nowadays nobody can hope to have a letter delivered on the day following the day it is posted; it takes from two to three days. If I write a letter in my own constituency to a neighbour of mine in County Offaly only a few miles away from where I live, it is three days before it is delivered.  Yet if a letter is posted in Brussels it can be in Dublin the following morning.</P>
    <P>I hope that this new board will examine every aspect of this because the public are now paying dearly for their stamps and the least they expect and that they <Col N="1720" /> are entitled to is a higher standard of speed and efficiency.  They are not getting these and it is through no fault of any postman because he does not get the mail to deliver.  It has not been clearly explained where this extraordinary delay exists that we did not experience 25 years ago.  If we are going to have changes I hope that we will ensure that letters posted will be promptly delivered and that there will be a full examination into where the great lack exists.  But when one asks questions of the responsible people, the postman, the postmaster, the post office head or the head civil servant they all say it is not their fault, that the post does not arrive in the central office for despatch.  I cannot put my finger on what is wrong.  But on the other hand, I am not paid to find out what is going on.  We are telling the people who are going to take responsibility on this new board that from now on it will be their job to find out what is wrong.  No longer will the Irish people pay dearly for a service they are not getting.  It is wrong that they should be obliged to pay for an unsatisfactory service.</P>
    <P>It takes three to four days for a letter posted in Dublin to get to the Midlands. If a letter is posted in Dublin on a Thursday it will not be delivered Friday; there is no delivery Saturday or Sunday, and it is a very lucky person who gets his letter on Monday.  In most cases that letter will not be delivered until Tuesday.  If he lives in an area like Wolfhill in County Laois or Clareen in County Offaly, it is likely that the letter posted in Dublin on Thursday will not be delivered until Tuesday. It took three days for correspondence to reach me from this House.  I cannot understand why there is this delay.</P>
    <P>Twenty or 25 years ago letters were delivered the following day.  Most of the letters posted in Dublin on Thursday arrive in the central post office in Portlaoise on Friday, but are not delivered on Saturday because there is no longer a Saturday delivery.  I cannot understand why a person cannot go to the post office to collect his post.  Everybody knows there is mail lying in every post office over the weekend.  I will make strong representations to the new board to <Col N="1721" /> change this situation.  Most post offices are open on Saturday and it should be possible for the public to collect their mail from the post office if they wish. That would provide an efficient service but for some reason that is not and cannot be done.</P>
    <P>To accelerate more business into the sub-post offices, the Department of Social Welfare should make more use of them.  Many thousands of people in receipt of social welfare unemployment assistance must present themselves to the local Garda station every week.  Why do they not present themselves to the post office?  No matter what anybody says it is degrading to compel people to line up outside a Garda station to get what they are entitled to.  I have been talking about this for a long time but I could never get any Minister for Social Welfare to pay any attention to it.  This is not a job for the Garda.  They have nothing to do with the Department of Social Welfare. Nobody should be humiliated by having to go to the Garda and have a form stamped saying they have been unemployed for so many days.</P>
    <P>I hope the new board will take over this job so that these unfortunate people will not be embarrassed any longer. Social welfare benefits are paid by post offices or sub-post offices.  Therefore the whole job should be done there.  That might be more efficient, but we are living at a time when inefficiency seems to be the order of the day.  Now is the time for the Post Office to take on new responsibility and new activities and to give the public the best service possible.  I make this appeal in the hope that before very long the Garda will not have anything to do with unemployment benefits.  As post offices pay widows, blind, old age and other pensions, they should do the whole job.</P>
    <P>I do not know the Minister's views on this subject but as long as he is a Member of this House he will find numerous people have to attend at the Garda barracks every week, otherwise they will not get their social welfare benefits.  If this business was taken over by the new postal service it would be a great help.  The mail delivery service is bad, but our telephone <Col N="1722" /> service has exhausted the patience of every subscriber.  What is going to be done about this unsatisfactory state of affairs?  At night time it is practically impossible to get an answer when dialling the exchange, but there must be somebody there because all these exchanges are staffed.  Is there a complete go-slow, or what is happening?  Why we cannot get a reply in a matter of seconds has always been a mystery to me.</P>
    <P>Look at the vast numbers on the waiting list for telephone installation.  I hope that the new board will get on with that job.  Under the new boards I trust that all future development will be such that the cables are underground, as they should be.  The boards, as soon as possible, should dismantle the present network of wires, which is an eyesore and deprives people of enjoyment of the scenery in its full graciousness and beauty.  All the streets of our main towns have this unsightly network of wires carrying electricity and telephone services.</P>
    <P>In relation to postal services, I hope that the new boards will undertake the re-establishment of the rural sub-post offices.  The loss of these offices ten or 15 years ago has brought about the present high degree of inefficiency.  This was an economy measure, but people were deprived of the service.  We can all exercise economy.  The easiest way is by not eating and by going around in rags.  However, that would be penny wise and pound foolish, just as the closure of these rural sub-post offices was penny wise and pound foolish.  They should all be reopened and restaffed in order to provide the service enjoyed 30 or 40 years ago and not enjoyed today.  Our consideration should always be for the public and the provision of first-class service for them, but in that connection we have not come out with flying colours.</P>
    <P>We are told of a shortage of equipment and other items which prevents the development of our telephone service.  Let us not continously tinker with this service, but provide one which meets the present needs of industry.  Those of us who have continental-based industries in our constituencies know that our telephone service is responsible for a considerable <Col N="1723" /> loss of export orders.  It is not long since the Confederation of Irish Industries submitted representations to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in this regard.  Practically every Deputy has had a similar experience to mine, of speaking to industralists who cannot understand why it is not possible to ring other parts of Europe, the United States of America, Canada and Japan.  These industralists run businesses with an extreme standard of efficiency and if they are not supplied with an efficient telephone and telex service, can lose orders amounting to tens of thousands of pounds by half an hour's delay.  The textile industry in my own constituency is one example.  There are other major Canadian and American industries operating in the midlands, where the management and administrative personnel have been driven into dementia by failure of the telephone services.  They will tell you that the rates they are paying for that inefficient service are very high and they are entitled to better.</P>
    <P>Regarding the telephone service, I hope that the new board will be able to put an end to the crossing of wires which causes the overhearing of private conversations. I am certainly not a listener to other people's business, but it is not very many months ago since, while I was holding on for a call, I overheard a conversation between a Dublin hospital and a doctor who was, I was sorry to hear, arranging for a bed for a cancer patient. That is a very serious matter.  On another occasion, while I was on the telephone, a voice cut in asking how many wagons would be wanted, or were available, for Mallow the next week.  I presume that the call was intended for the railway station at Portlaoise, or some place else. This crossing of wires must be avoided. People are becoming very cautious and we are told in many instances that telephone conversations are not confidential. It may be unintentional on the part of anybody charged with the administration of the telephone service, but there is something very wrong when one can overhear a private conversation between a doctor and somebody at a hospital.  I <Col N="1724" /> understand that private and confidential conversations can be overheard time and again.  Those of us in public life are much too busy to listen to other people's conversations. Nevertheless, the telephone system &mdash; even in cases where there may be enthusiastic subscribers wanting to use their spare time listening to other's conversations on the telephone &mdash; should not afford that opportunity.  I hope more attention will be paid by the technical staff of the Department to the avoidance of the crossing of lines, as in the case of the CIE call to which I have just referred requesting wagons for Mallow station.</P>
    <P>There is greater use of telephone kiosks in rural areas in countries abroad. The reason for their lesser use here is vandalism, vandals who have nothing else to do now but take the doors off telephone kiosks or, if possible, demolish the kiosk and pull out the telephone apparatus completely, even tearing into confetti any telephone directory to be found in such kiosks.  While such disgraceful conduct is not the responsibility of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs they are the victims of this type of behaviour.  I hope when we are discussing the Estimate for the Department of Justice to make a number of suggestions to the Minister and the Garda Commissioner as to how this type of vandalism can be tackled, because in almost every rural town now the telephone kiosks are out of order.</P>
    <P>The reason for this is that the gardaí are now moving about in squad cars.  The telephone kiosks were not out of order when there were garda foot patrols.  I do not know what it must cost the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to repair such damaged kiosks.  This is the worst type of vandalism because it deprives the public of the use of that service whether it be to call a vet, a doctor, a clergyman for a dying person or anybody else.  The vandal does not care, he will pull the apparatus to pieces while people are being deprived of this telephone facility in many areas.  Some other means will have to be devised for making the telephone available to the public and at the same time protecting it against vandalism, against damage perpetrated by <Col N="1725" /> people who have nothing else to do but create further costs for the taxpayer, create destruction and deprive their fellow citizens of the right to call a doctor, ambulance, fire brigade, vet or arrange perhaps for the admission to hospital of a person in danger of death.  There is no greater facility in an emergency than that of being able to use a telephone quickly. When will we Irish respect the telephone and the other facilities available?  That is something to be answered on another occasion.  But I maintain that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have an obligation to ensure that the service they provide for the public is safeguarded and will be available to them as and when required.</P>
    <P>I am sure the new boards being set up will have computers in operation in relation to accounts.  Computers have not long been in existence.  We were told that when they were operative fewer personnel would be required, that the computer would undertake the work of a number of people.  That is not so.  On the contrary it appears we need to employ more people because qualified experts must operate these computers.  Now we must engage people to replace those engaged in the computer business.  Therefore, rather than computers reducing the workload, as we were told, and giving a higher standard of efficiency, we discover that delays and inaccuracies occur and that a computer cannot tell the truth unless fed with the truth &mdash; unless the proper material is fed in, it will not reveal the accuracy expected of it.  There have been a great number of incorrect telephone accounts issued.  Also people awaiting money to be paid by means of the computer must now wait longer, because apparently the computer pays all together.  Indeed, we have read of grave errors in telephone accounts.  It would be interesting to know from the Minister if there have been as many errors in relation to telephone accounts reported in his Department since the arrival of computerisation. Certainly years ago none of my constituents ever approached me about mistakes in relation to their telephone accounts, but since computerisation I have had numerous complaints.  I <Col N="1726" /> hope the new boards will devise some means of devoting greater attention to accounts, that the slip sent to the public will be simplified in format, bearing less information than at present.  Such accounts should inform members of the public of their local calls, trunk calls and overseas calls, showing the total and then adding on rental or any other charges that may be relevant and leave it at that. The format should be simplified so that any man or woman can follow their accounts.  The account should carry a request at the bottom to pay immediately, and that will be that.  I have come across great confusion with regard to the present format of telephone accounts.  A public representative will be receiving constituents when one will arrive and say &ldquo;There is the telephone bill I received. Which of these amounts do I pay?&rdquo; You just have to mark on it what that person has to pay.  It is a pity the accounts are not simpler.  I hope the new board will simplify the accounts sent out to people.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the civil servants in the Department for their devotion to duty in relation to the postal and telephone services in the past.  They were not able to achieve their ambitions.  This was the fault of the system and the financial structure of the Department.  I want to pay a special tribute to the linesmen in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who have to repair the telephones in bad weather.  The weather last winter was possibly the worst for over 100 years but there was very little disruption of the telephone service despite this.  Even though the best efforts of the Government and the Government agencies to clear the roads failed it did not stop the Post Office linesmen from getting out into fields where there were very heavy drifts of snow, detecting the breaks in lines and carrying out repairs with the least possible delay.</P>
    <P>I do not believe any person stood up in the House and thanked those linesmen who worked so very hard during the heavy frost and snow of last winter to repair the hundreds of breakdowns which occurred.  I do not believe anybody said they did a good job in difficult circumstances. I hope the Minister will convey <Col N="1727" /> to the trade unions of the people involved in this work our very sincere thanks for the work they performed so efficiently last winter.  If the people responsible for clearing the roads were as efficient as the linesmen we would have had the roads cleared a week sooner than we had.  This would have enabled us to get in and out of Dublin and into the various towns throughout the country.  I would like to be one Deputy in the House to thank those linesmen for the good job they did.</P>
    <P>I hope, before the final Stages of the Bill are passed, that an effort will be made by the Minister to have consultations with the trade unions, the postmasters, the Post Office Workers Union and the trade union of every employee in relation to the changeover from the Department to those boards.  We all think we know everything until we meet other people and talk to them and then we realise how little we know.  Consultation is vital in order to have good industrial relations.  I hope we will never have another postal strike like the long one we had a few years ago.  That strike should never have happened, I hope the new boards will have very friendly relations with the trade unions of all the employees of those boards.  Almost half the staff of the civil service are connected in some way with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It is, therefore, a big job for those boards to undertake this great administrative task in relation to the postal and telephone services.  It is necessary to have a complete new approach in relation to those services.  I believe this will lead to a greater standard of efficiency.</P>
    <P>I hope when the Minister is replying that he will be able to tell us that he will invite representations from every branch of organised workers in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in relation to the changeover.  It would be a very bad thing if the two new boards got off on the wrong foot.  It is important that they should have the confidence of the employees.  The changeover will not succeed unless all the employees are in step. I am glad to see that on the board of directors there will be direct representation <Col N="1728" /> of the employees, that the postmasters will have a voice and that all sections involved in the administration of the telephone and postal services will havte a voice around the table.</P>
    <P>The Department should be very sympathetic to the views of the people who will be employed by the new boards so that there will be good industrial relations and the closest possible co-operation as well as devotion to work and pride in work.  There does not seem to be much pride in work today.  No matter what we do or how little we do it is important that it is done right and well and when our day's work is over we should be able to sit down and admire what we have done. There are too many people throughout the country watching the clock and there are too many people anxious to facilitate the rushed, quick job.  The painstaking job may be the dearest but in the long run it will be the cheapest.</P>
    <P>I trust that before Mr. Smurfit, Mr. Quinn and the Minister embark on the operation of the boards they will deliver an address to all their employees asking for co-operation and emphasising the importance of their having pride in their work as well as stressing the need for a continuance of a high degree of courtesy and understanding so far as the public are concerned.  The public must be made aware that the boards are being set up to provide a good, honest and efficient public service and the boards should indicate their willingness to accept advice from organised labour, from various community organisations and so on if such advice is considered to be right in terms of improving the services.</P>
    <P>When I hear people speak of Europe I take grave exception to their meaning the ten member states.  Europe is a much bigger continent than merely that part which makes up the ten member states. Therefore, when I speak of Europe, I refer to the entire continent.  We must take our place with all the nations of Europe but unless we pull up our socks we will be left standing.  There must be a higher degree of efficiency from all of us and this is particularly important in terms of the services we are discussing today.  I <Col N="1729" /> say this because of the extent to which we depend on other countries.  We must be in a position to communicate and to correspond if we are to remain in business but we cannot do that if we are inefficient and if there are delays in services.  It was inefficiency that left us standing while everybody else was moving.  That is why I hope that the advent of businessmen, men of experience and men whose patience has been exhausted because of inefficiency in our services, will result in big improvements in the postal and telecommunications services.  I trust, too, that we will be able to review in this House each year the progress of their activities.  Mr. Quinn and Mr. Smurfit and anybody else who may be in line in terms of the administration of these boards must not be afraid to develop the services.  Courage is vital in today's world.  We must be prepared to spend.  If we are to develop in a businesslike way we must expand.  I have never seen anything wrong in borrowing for development and expansion and if there is any area in which development and expansion are required it must be the area we are talking of.  But if our resources do not allow us to develop and expand these services it will be merely a question of cutting a stick with which to beat ourselves, in which case our businessmen will lose orders and our workers will be on short time.  We must be able to communicate speedily and efficiently with every part of the world, a world that has become small in the past 25 years in terms of communications. In order to expand we must borrow. I do not see anything wrong in letting the next generation and the generation after them help in paying back what we must borrow now if we are to expand our industrial base.  We must develop our international market but in order to do so all this development that I talk of is necessary.  Without such development we would be lost in terms of exports, agricultural and otherwise.  Business people must be able to communicate with boards of directors who may be sitting simultaneously in other parts of the world when decisions of vital importance must be made.</P>
    <P>It is no fault of the higher civil servants <Col N="1730" /> in the Department that the present system has failed although there has been some progress.  The reason for the failure was that we did not have the means nor the ability that was necessary.  No Minister for Posts and Telegraphs could advance and develop the services if he was being watched over all the time by the Minister for Finance or by the Taoiseach of the day especially in a period in which there were cutbacks.  In the past this Department have always been the Cinderella of Government Departments. Every Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, from the time in which the late Mr. Little was Minister did his best to get all the money he could for the services for which he was responsible and all of these Ministers and, in more recent times, Ministers of State, were backed up by a high standard of integrity and dedication on the part of the higher civil servants in the Department but they were not able to break the Cabinet ring for the allocation of money.  Perhaps the money was not available.  However, I hope that we will see results when the new boards come into operation and that any citizen who has money to invest will be prepared to invest in the boards.  I hope the law will permit private investment in the companies and that international investment will be permitted.</P>
    <P>Investors throughout the world are aware of what we have to offer.  Those of us who read OECD reports occasionally are aware of that.  Members who had the honour of meeting the general secretary of the OECD recently were amazed at his knowledge of the situation here.  So many people throughout the world are aware of our existence that we cannot be lagging behind in a state of inefficiency. We must aim to be as good as the best. I have great admiration for Japanese industrialists and I would like to see more of them coming here &mdash; I have admiration for industrialists from France, Germany, America, Canada and the UK &mdash; but I am always afraid of the bad impression they would get if the telephone service was inefficient when they called home. We all have a big part to play in planning our development into the nineties.  All we need is confidence in ourselves and <Col N="1731" /> the political will to carry out such development.</P>
    <P>We have made wonderful advances since the setting up of this State but a lot of things remain undone because we do not have the political will to do them.  We need the political will.  It takes courage to invest and invite investment from outside. I have no hesitation in saying that if money is required by the new boards on the international market it will be forthcoming.  The financial structure of the boards will have to be widened considerably when they examine the huge programme of work which will be before them.  I wish the boards every success and hope they will lead us to a higher standard of efficiency than we have enjoyed in the past.</P>
    <P>Under section 27 I hope the Minister will consider my suggestions in relation to the financing of the boards.  I do not think we are capable of financing them from our own resources.  If we make it known abroad that the activities of the boards are genuine and for the benefit of industrialists I have no doubt that the countries who have industrialists here will help.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that the Office of Public Works shall have power to undertake work at the request of either company and that when performing such work they will be deemed not to be a State authority for the purposes of the planning Acts.  That is clear enough but I hope that any work available will be undertaken on a competitive basis and that it will not be necessary for the companies to depend on the Office of Public Works.  The companies should be permitted to seek outside contracts.  It would be a pity if the Office of Public Works had to be consulted in all cases.  Outside contractors can undertake such work at greater speed.  I do not mean to be disrespectful to the officials of the Office of Public Works but that body is known to be cumbersome in proceeding with work. A lot of the work undertaken by the Office of Public Works could be done more efficiently by private enterprise.  I hope there will not be any strings in the legislation which will close the door on <Col N="1732" /> major works being undertaken by private enterprise.  If the companies must depend on the Office of Public Works only the Lord would be able to prophesy when it would be completed.  I have always been a believer in private enterprise and that the State should only interfere where private enterprise fails.  I am greatly disappointed at the slow progress made by the Office of Public Works in their undertakings. Their work is always satisfactorily finished and well designed but they lag behind private enterprise in speed and efficiency.  I urge that private enterprise be considered.</P>
    <P>Section 77 empowers one of these boards in consultation with An Bord Telecom to determine the hours of business of telegraph offices under their control. It is also provided that in the event of disagreement the question may be referred to the Minister, whose decision will be final.  This is a very useful section and I believe both boards will realise that their purpose is to serve the public and not to consider their own leisure requirements. The service provided must suit the people and it should not be any excuse to say that the volume of business will not be very great at certain hours. The offices should be open and ready for business and the public should be facilitated as much as possible.  There is grave discontent in rural areas regarding the opening hours of the Garda barracks and in many places they are closed at 6 p.m. I am glad that the Minister will be enabled to ensure a proper service for the public.</P>
    <P>I am very much impressed by section 91 which empowers the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, to make regulations requiring developers of housing and industrial estates to provide facilities for the speedy provision of telecommunications services.  These essential services must be provided, especially in the most remote areas which have the greatest need.</P>
    <P>Many sections of this Bill are non-controversial and are intended merely to legalise under the new boards the functions which the Minister now enjoys.  This is a courageous step and I hope that <Col N="1733" /> within five years there will be a vast improvement in both telephone and postal services.  We depend upon them to receive both good and bad news and also for business transactions.  Nothing is more important than people, and wealth and property pale into insignificance in comparison.  Telecommunications services are for the benefit of people and to assist in the creation of productive employment.  They also assist in bringing closer peoples of different nations and different colours, either by the written word or by the voice.  These are the great benefits which this generation can enjoy.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a courageous step in the right direction and we will be watching with great interest the advancement of these two boards.  I wish the Minister well and I wish Mr. Quinn and Mr. Smurfit every success in their undertakings, as well as those who will be appointed to the two boards.  I hope they will be men of dedication who will see far beyond the shores of this country and who will be interested in the welfare of those not yet born and the expansion of industries not yet thought of, all of which will depend on the extreme standard of efficiency in our postal and telephone services.  May all their efforts be crowned with success and the good luck which they so richly deserve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> I welcome this Bill because it is one of the most important Bills that has been introduced in this House for a considerable time.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing it after such a short time in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. What we are discussing here this evening will be of vital importance to the social and economic structures of our country. We must consider the decisions being taken and why they are being taken at this time.  The decision in principle was taken by Deputy Faulkner when he was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to set up a review board in 1978.  Previous to that, in 1977, we committed ourselves in our election manifesto to an examination of the whole telecommunications system to see if it could be operated as two semi-State bodies.  That is the background <Col N="1734" /> against which the decision was taken.</P>
      <P>It is important to consider all that is involved.  No Department have been more maligned than the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I am convinced from my experience in that Department that the finest personnel and finest officers that can be found are employed there.  Unfortunately, the structures under which they have had to operate have prohibited them from carrying out the duties necessary to ensure the expansion of the Department.  A consideration of the business they had to pursue convinces me that they are far more attuned to working in a semi-State body than in a Government Department where it was impossible for them to operate efficiently and effectively and to fulfil their duties as the public requested.</P>
      <P>Very few semi-State bodies have been established with a full complement of qualified staff.  We are talking here about something in the region of 30,000 employees, civil servants, who will be transferred to these two semi-State bodies. The boards will be taking trained personnel under their wing, and undoubtedly that is an advantage for them from the start.  The decision to separate these two bodies was wise because they will be pursuing two different operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Flanagan speaking about the postal service.  I cannot altogether agree with him about criticism, especially as regards the postal service, whatever I may have to say later about the telecommunications.  In my experience we have one of the most efficient postal services in Europe.  The standard of delivery in places like Italy or the US could bring about a rude awakening in us.  Our postal service operates on an efficient basis and I hope that with rationalisation and so on this standard can be maintained.  Modernisation and motorisation have improved the efficiency of the service and the standard of our deliveries is quite exceptional. Deputy Flanagan said that there were delays in posting from one country to another, but I do not believe that those delays were caused to any great extent by <Col N="1735" /> administration in our sorting offices and sub-post offices.  An Post will have a huge turnover when they come into operation and will encounter great competition in trying to hold the business which they have at the moment.  I am sure they will make every effort to increase business, and this will depend to a very large extent on how competitive their prices are.  Postage today is very expensive, and if we push the price of the commodity too high then people will not avail of that commodity. Commercial companies are doing everything in their power to cut down overheads.  They are using computers and all types of systems to ensure that expenses and overheads are pruned to the minimum.  We may rest assured that the postal service will come under scrutiny as regards their charges in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>This is a major part of the expenses incurred by large companies.  Many companies today have economised considerably in this sector.  Years ago companies had four or five deliveries in a month and an invoice every week following the delivery.  That does not happen anymore. There is just one letter arriving through the letterbox once a month.  That is how companies have economised because of the high cost of posting weekly invoices to firms.  That is the kind of challenge that this board will face in the years ahead.  They will have to go out and seek new business to keep the offices and personnel they have at this time.  Despite that, they have the broad framework to expand.  Throughout the country there are about 3,000 sub-post offices and also their own direct offices run by the Department.  I am sure the board will direct their attention to capturing new business in the future.</P>
    <P>On the question of expansion, the whole question of a banking system, such as the giro system, could be looked at.  If introduced it would, in the long run, pay its way.  When this was first established in the United Kingdom it was not very profitable but after three or four years there was a turnabout and it became profitable. There is room for this type of development.  The majority of people <Col N="1736" /> today are paid by cheque.  Many people are inhibited, although not so much today, about opening bank accounts.  I would question whether the facilities are available in the banking world for the average working person because banks are closed at a relatively early time in the evening.  I believe that we could succeed in establishing a giro banking system because any type of business can be run to suit the customer.  I am sure that if we could establish a banking system within this organisation many people would gravitate towards it.  It would be a good thing to accomplish.</P>
    <P>There are other ways of expanding in rural Ireland.  Sub-postmasters, as we know, are paid on a commission.  They have given excellent service over the years and could have been better remunerated for the work they put in.  Many of these sub-post offices throughout the country would not be open at all today if they were run directly by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs because they could not provide and pay staff.  Where sub-post offices had to be staffed by the Department every effort was made to appoint a sub-postmaster as soon as possible because it was realised very quickly that the cost of staffing these sub-post offices directly was astronomical compared to what it would take to pay a sub-postmaster.  They have made a major contribution to circulating business throughout the country and doing work not alone for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs but for the Department of Social Welfare.  I have often thought that the sub-post offices were not properly remunerated; if anything, their business is declining and has declined due to the PRSI deductions, so that stamps are no longer on sale through the sub-post offices.  There is a challenge in regard to expansion which is necessary.  The outlets are there and they should be utilised to the maximum.</P>
    <P>An Bord Telecom will not have the same challenge.  Apart from telephones, I know of no commodity in this country for which the demand is not fulfilled.  We have under-capitalised the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  We had a waiting list up to 20 years ago.  Unfortunately, <Col N="1737" /> Governments did not realise the significance of telecommunications to a developing country.  There is no easy shortcut to telecommunications.  It is not possible to solve telecommunications problems in one or two years.  It takes a long drawn out period from the time that plans are drawn up to build a new exchange, through the planning, the acquiring of the site, the building of the exchange and the installing of equipment.  This can take four, five or six years.  It is obvious that there is no short cut to this type of development. We have neglected it in the past. But this was rectified to some extent when a former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Faulkner, introduced a Bill in this House providing £650 million for capital development.  That was a major contribution to the whole capital programme.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs up to then were starved for capital development.  But at least a foundation has now been laid and I am convinced that there will be expansion in the whole telephone service.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in the past industrial development was impeded because of the lack of telephone communication. Nothing else is more important to a businessman than to be able to communicate swiftly with his counterparts in his company abroad, particularly if his business is sited in the west or south-west of Ireland.  In the past I have seen companies and manufacturers exasperated to the point that they thought of closing down because of the lack of telephone communication.  We just cannot afford to let this happen.  If that were to happen our image abroad as a suitable site for development would be tarnished.</P>
    <P>There have been considerable improvements and the number of telephones installed has increased in the past three or four years.  However, there are industrial sites throughout this city, and I am sure elsewhere, where there is a complete lack of efficient telecommunications. I hope the new board will keep in close contact with the IDA to ensure that top priority will be given to new industrial sites that are being developed. A manufacturer or businessman may <Col N="1738" /> have first-class personnel and may have available all other essential services but he cannot carry out his business without proper telephone communications. When he was Minister in the Department, Deputy Faulkner did an excellent job and I am sure the present Minister, Deputy Wilson, will also be successful in his post.  This Bill will ensure that necessary progress in the area of telecommunications is made.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister mentioned some areas where there is no waiting list for telephones.  They include Athlone, Ballyshannon, Carlow, Kilkenny, Lifford, Limerick, Listowel, Nenagh and Tipperary.  This is probably due to the opening of new exchanges but there are other areas where the waiting lists are quite considerable.  I know of people who are waiting for a telephone for three or four years.  In areas such as Tallaght new exchanges have been built and it is easier to lay cables in conjunction with other development works than to open up streets in the centre of the city.  In the canal area near South Circular Road there is little development in the installation of new telephones.  I accept it is a major job to open main routes such as this but the problem will have to be tackled. We are trying to develop the inner city and that does not just mean houses. Telecommunications are very important. When major development work is taking place in the inner city cabling for future telephone communications should be laid at the same time.  Small factories are being developed in the inner city.  It is one of the objectives of Dublin Corporation and the Government to establish light industries and thus give employment to people in the area.  I hope the new board will consider this aspect of the problem.  The same applies with regard to new housing.  All the necessary cabling and other works should be carried out in conjunction with the development of new housing so that at the appropriate time telephones may be installed more quickly and efficiently.</P>
    <P>Telecommunications are important in the context of tourism.  Many holiday resorts have a fourfold increase in population during the summer.  People on holiday <Col N="1739" /> may wish to communicate with their families and it is up to the authorities to ensure that the necessary facilities are available.  Telecommunications are important also to the average householder. More and more people want to have telephones in their homes and the younger generation consider a telephone an essential item.  When these young people leave their parents' house and move to the suburbs they expect to be able to have a telephone in their own homes.</P>
    <P>Staffing relations are a matter of vital importance.  Strange as it may seem, staff relations in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, except for a period during which there was a postal strike, have been excellent.  I think that one major strike was the only strike in the history of the postal section apart from disputes of a minor character.  However, we must ensure that there are guarantees with regard to the privileges and status enjoyed by the staff.  They must be convinced that their terms of employment will not be worsened in any way.  Unless we do this we will undermine the whole structure of the new boards and their future development.  We are dealing here with 30,000 employees and there are very few companies in this country with a workforce of that size.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying last night, we can all see the effects this Bill would have on the constitutional rights of the people, and were it to become law every section would be tediously dragged through the courts by various property owners.  If we look back at the recent Supreme Court decision on the Rent Act we can see there is unlimited scope for landlords and property owners to take this Bill through the courts section by section.  If this Bill became law I wonder what effect it would have on the financing of these proposals by local authorities.  I have grave doubts about the problems that would arise about the agreement on the figure reached for the purchase of land.  I could see continual court proceedings by people who would feel their constitutional right to private property was being seriously affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion that the local authortites should decide the boundaries would give the local authorities a power they do not want.  I do not think they would like <Col N="1741" /> to make the decision where a boundary fence should be drawn.  A farmer could find that his land on the outskirts of a town or city was being divided.  In that case who could decide what was adequate compensation?  Only the public market can decide the actual value of property. That has been demonstrated very clearly in the past few weeks when we saw what happened to property speculators.</P>
    <P>If this Bill were to become law it would be very detrimental to the environment of this city and every town, big or small. I can see Deputy Quinn's reason for bringing in this legislation, but he knows this type of legislation would not bring about the sort of movement with regard to planning and development that would be for the benefit of the ordinary citizen who wishes to acquire his own house.  I often wonder if the Kenny Report, which is now almost ten years old, would be sufficient to deal with the problems facing us at present.</P>
    <P>I can see problems arising because of class distinction in housing development. This is very sad.  A site in one part of the city can be ten times the value of a similar site in another part of the city.  I often wonder if a major housing development, having a mixture of working class, middle class and possibly corporation houses, would be successful.  This class distinction has led to certain problems for young people coming from various parts of the city when they were seeking employment, because it has been proved that it is much harder to get employment in some corporations or institutions if you have the wrong address.  That is why a long and hard look must be taken at all housing developments in the State, especially in Dublin and other major growth centres.</P>
    <P>Many Opposition speakers, especially in the Labour Party, tried to persuade us that Deputy Quinn's proposals would be for the betterment of the country, particularly when it comes to reasonably priced houses for young people.  If the Deputy looks at the land market he will see there is a reasonable amount of land available at reasonable prices.  Land prices have slipped back in real terms in comparison <Col N="1742" /> to what they were three of four years ago. Various properties adjacent to the city were bought because the owners hoped for huge profits when the land was needed for development.  Many of those properties are still lying undeveloped because at present it would not be financially beneficial for the owners to place the land on the market.</P>
    <P>If we should look at the prospects of redesignating certain areas which should be acquired under this Bill we will see major problems.  We will have to decide which land should be used for residential purposes or industrial development and see how best both can be blended.  The disorderly development which has occurred around the city throughout the years has led to tremendous problems especially for people trying to get in or out of the city.  The development allowed along our main link roads will pose great problems for road development in the future.  The lack of an orderly road development programme will have to be taken into account in any further development plans.  Deputy Quinn did not mention that in his proposals.</P>
    <P>It is worth quoting again from paragraph 101 of the report since the Labour Party have been so obdurate in this debate.  The Kenny majority advises:</P>
    <P>... that the jurisdiction to designate an area must be conferred on a court established under the Constitution if it is to be valid,</P>
    <P>and recommended that the jurisdiction should be conferred on the High Court. Many reservations about this advice have been made, based on considerations of the costs involved, the time involved and the potentially unwieldy nature of such a scheme.  Nevertheless, it is the basic precondition for constitutionality, even in the view of the Kenny Committee, whose work has been superseded by more recent constitutional interpretation.  The Labour Party speakers have not provided, perhaps because they could not, any satisfactory explanation of their reasoning on the question of area designation and I cannot understand how they envisage placing such an extraordinary <Col N="1743" /> burden on our local councils.  I say that for the second or third time.</P>
    <P>We have all heard enough about the rezoning of land in and around this city during the last six months to leave local authority members beginning to wonder if they are doing something that is totally wrong, even if they believe it must be done for the development of the area. The amount of land rezoned in and around the city especially in the past few months would lead one to believe that at the moment enough land has been earmarked for development to serve the needs of this city for the next ten to 15 years.  Every section of Deputy Quinn's Bill would be questioned when it came to the courts.  He mentions that the Minister for the Environment would have the decision on what land would be acquired and that the last appeal by people whose land was being taken under this Bill would be to him.  That would place an undue burden on the Minister.  I believe that the Minister was glad to be no longer the last person to be appealed to under An Bord Pleanála.  Our courts would not be in a position to decide where the boundary line should be drawn.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies have referred to local authorities calling for the implementation of the Kenny Report.  The people who called for that action are those who did not examine the consequent repercussions.  Many, especially on the Opposition benches here, see it only to be used where land is a must as far as the development of an area is concerned. The local authority of which I am a member could never see a need for implementation of the proposals in the Kenny Report.  That may be due to the fact that it is one of our least populated areas.  In rural areas and on the outskirts of our small towns there is on occasions need for compulsory purchase orders.  In using those powers we have always found that the opposition came, not alone from the owner of the property, but from the people living in the adjoining area, who felt that the compulsory acquisition might have an undue effect on their environment and on that of the surrounding area. With reference to the pricing structure, <Col N="1744" /> Deputy Quinn's Bill proposes to give 25 per cent on top of the market value for any property.  However it is hard to decide the market value of property when someone is being forced to sell and forced out of business.  It is hard to estimate the total loss with regard to future earnings especially in connection with farms which could be fully developed and might be a greater asset to the community if left to be worked by the farmer concerned.</P>
    <P>There are many other issues which Deputy Quinn's Bill fails to recognise. The Bill would result in very real difficulties for local authorities and their officials. I could forsee a major staffing problem, with local authorities having to put a large number of skilled senior officials on this type of work.  We all know that it takes a long time to train local authority senior officials.  We have seen the difficulty when new sections were established within the local authorities, needing a top official to spearhead the active work. How many people would the Deputy hope that it would take to run a section with responsibility for the implementation of the proposals of this Bill?  Even within the Dublin city area, with Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council, how many officials would it take to carry out a proper survey of the land available, or to become available, if this Bill were allowed through this House?</P>
    <P>There is a known, definite need for re-examination of the position with regard to property for development around the country.  Perhaps some of our banking institutions should be asked to provide some of the funds which they provide for speculative purposes to enable local authorities to build up a land bank for future development.  We talk about their excess profits, but if some of these were put into proposals such as this, the banks would be justified in holding their excess profits.</P>
    <P>We are all in agreement that there should be a restructuring of our policies for land development.  The long-term holding of land by local authorities is a burden which they are not at present in a position to carry.  They have a serious shortage of funds and, if we implemented Deputy Quinn's proposed Bill, we would <Col N="1745" /> only bring further hardship on them in the shape of the finance which would have to be found for this purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> When I spoke in this House on a similar Bill introduced by the Labour Party in 1980, I said that the Bill could be fairly summarised by saying that it proposed to solve the problem of exorbitant housing prices by controlling the price of building land.  That is the motive and the principle behind the Bill and, on the face of it, they are a principle and a proposal with which one could not disagree.  There is no doubt but that the present cost of housing has risen far beyond the financial capacity of young married couples and others.  In 1976, according to the Quarterly Bulletin of Housing Statistics issued by the Department of the Environment, the average price of a house amounted to approximately £12,000.  We find that, by the end of last year, that average price had increased very substantially to £33,000 &mdash; in other words, the price of a house almost trebled between 1976 and 1981 according to official figures.  One of the main reasons for the exorbitant cost of houses is the cost of building sites. There are other factors that must be taken into consideration also, such as the cost of money, the amount of profit to be made by professional people, the amount of profits made by builders but there is no doubt that the price of building land is one of the main causes of the prohibitive price of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the late sixties a commission was set up under Mr. Justice Kenny to report on the control of building land and to suggest ways of maintaining it at a reasonable level.  That commission reported, I think, in 1972 and the document known as the Kenny Report found its way into many Government Departments and many people's bookshelves.  But the recommendations of that Kenny Report have never been implemented.  One of their recommendations was that the maximum price of building land should be frozen at the market price of agricultural land &mdash; or whatever other purpose for which the land was being used; in other words, that it be frozen at its current use value &mdash;<Col N="1746" /> plus 25 per cent.  It must be said that the Fianna Fáil Government when in office before looked at that report with a view to implementing its provisions or doing something about it and that the National Coalition Government, when in office, also considered the position arising out of the Kenny Report.  I want to go on record as saying two things: first of all, even if the Kenny Report recommendations were accepted as constituting a solution to the problem, I do not think they could be implemented under the present Constitution.  I want to make a general comment before coming to that. I want to go on record as saying that neither myself nor my party stand for the exploitation of housebuilders or house purchasers by land owners.  I do not stand for windfall profit from the sale of land.  I do not stand for speculation in the sale of land.  I went on record before as so saying, and I repeat it.  At the same time I do not stand, nor does my party, for the confiscation of land or its compulsory acquisition at a fraction of its market value.  I believe that landowners should receive fair and reasonable compensation for their land.  I believe also that in recent years there has been scandalous speculation in building land in and around Dublin city and other large urban areas, scandalous speculation by people who acquired land in the knowledge that services would be provided and it could be used as building land.  Apart from such speculation there have been considerable windfalls occasioned by people selling land at many times its ordinary value, selling it as a scarce commodity.</P>
    <P>I believe that the proposal in the Labour Party's Bill is not, as Deputy Ellis said, to pay present use value plus 25 per cent, but to pay present use value.  That is not sufficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I do not think that is sufficient.  Neither do I think that the proposal in the Kenny Report to pay agricultural value plus 25 per cent is sufficient.  I do not believe that that constitutes adequate compensation for the owner whose land is being taken <Col N="1747" /> from him under compulsory powers and against his will.</P>
      <P>When I spoke here before I said I believed there should be a curb put on the amount that can be charged for building land, that there should be a ceiling placed on it, but that, on the other hand, fair compensation should be paid to owners. If the amount of fair compensation is still too high then the State should enter in in some way or other and subsidise it. When I spoke before on this subject I said I thought the proposal put forward by the Labour Party was unconstitutional and would not withstand the scrutiny of the Supreme Court.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> He was until quite recently.  I stated then that I believed that the Bill introduced by the Labour Party would not withstand the scrutiny of the Supreme Court but said that I would not labour that point.</P>
      <P>Since 1980 the constitutional rights of owners of property have been tested on three occasions in the Supreme Court in regard to the control of rents.  I want to go on record now as saying that, having regard to the decision of the Supreme Court in the Madigan and Blake cases and the referral of the last Rent Bill to that court, there is no chance of this Bill, as it stands, withstanding a Supreme Court action.  I would stake my general legal knowledge and experience on it and I would not mind having a good bet on it that there is no chance of this Bill standing up to a Supreme Court case.  If that is so we are taking the risk of delaying the control of rents further.  When the Fianna Fáil Party were in Government they set up the Kenny Commission and having had an opportunity of considering the Kenny Report they did nothing about it.  I must also admit that the Coalition Government were unable to deal with it either.  I believe the reason for that is that the Kenny Report is unworkable.</P>

    <P>The Government put down an amendment to the Bill introduced by the Labour Party.  I believe that amendment is really <Col N="1748" /> a bit of shadow-boxing.  It proposes to shelve the matter further by leaving the matter in abeyance on the promise of the Government to take whatever additional measures might be necessary to ensure that land is made available to local authorities for development free of any element of speculative gains.  They do not talk about windfalls.  There can be highly exorbitant prices charged for land.  The Government also say in their amendment: &ldquo;in line with the aims of the Kenny Report&rdquo;.  If the Kenny report is workable and is a solution why did they not solve the matter when they were in Government on two occasions since that report was published?</P>
    <P>The Government's amendment is put forward now to get the Fianna Fáil Party out of a difficulty.  When we were last in Government we investigated fully the possibility of introducing a Bill to deal with the matter on the lines of the Kenny Report.  I am absolutely certain, notwithstanding what Deputy Mervyn Taylor says about Judge Kenny being a member of the Supreme Court, that this Bill will be rejected by the Supreme Court.  Judge Kenny was a member of the Supreme Court who shot down the Rent Control Acts which operated here for the last 25 years.  He was a member of the Supreme Court who shot down the Rent Act introduced by Fianna Fáil the year before last. He was a member of the Supreme Court who rejected the Rent Control Act introduced by the Coalition Government last year.  All those Acts were rejected by the Supreme Court on the grounds that they interfered with the rights of private property. It was stated in one of those judgments that the just rent for a private house is the market rent.  That is the reason why I say that the Supreme Court are certain to reject this Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> It gives the full price for restricted usage.  It does not give open market price.  I am not in favour of open market price because that is the sky is the limit.  I do not want to be misrepresented.  I am <Col N="1749" /> against that because it is unfair and is an exploitation of people who want houses. I also want to go on record as being in favour of the owner getting a reasonable return for the land which is taken from him.  I will go further and say that if it is necessary for the State to make an input into the price the owner of the land has to get, then let the State do so.</P>
      <P>This matter is being made into a political football.  Each party are trying to solve it on their own but no party have succeeded in doing so.  Different Governments are at it for the last ten years but still the speculation goes on, the exorbitant prices are charged, the price of houses is soaring and the people are not in a position to finance those houses.</P>
      <P>When the Deputy Leader of this party, who is spokesman on the Environment, spoke earlier in this debate he appealed to all parties in the House to agree to the establishment of an all-party committee to report within a limited time on ways and means of controlling the price of building land.  He appealed to the Government to give the lead, to stand up and say they are prepared to set up an all-party committee to consider the problem of high land prices and to report to the House on how best they think the problem can be solved.  I want to repeat that invitation.  I ask the Minister for the Environment to agree to the setting-up of an all-party committee of Members of the Oireachtas to consider the evil of unlimited prices being charged for building land and to make suggestions to the House how that problem can be solved. I want the Government to give an undertaking that on receipt of that report it will be dealt with immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has many shortcomings and it has some defects which could be cured in Committee.  The major flaw in the Bill is that it will not get through the Supreme Court.  There is no use in putting on the Statute Book something that we know beforehand the Supreme Court will reject.  In doing that we are delaying the cure, delaying the day when the evil of exorbitant land prices can be dealt with. That is my view and it is the view of my party.  Until something is done about the situation people will continue to speculate <Col N="1750" /> in land because land is a necessary ingredient in house building.  The location of land is very important.  Land is not a movable property.  It attracts large profits when it is in and adjacent to urban areas.  There is an onus on a Government who set up a commission to deal with this problem, who received the Kenny Report and who now apparently concede that the recommendations will not work, to do something about the situation.</P>
    <P>What is the point, after nearly ten years of considering that report, of coming here and asking the House to accept a pious undertaking that something on the lines of the Kenny Report will be done about the problem?  That is what this amendment means.  I might add that the only people in this House who have ever done anything about trying to prevent people from making exorbitant profits out of land have been Fine Gael and Labour when in government.  We introduced capital gains tax in the 1973-74 period.  That was a tax to prevent people from being free of any liability to tax on huge profits and who, consequently, were making tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of pounds per year tax free. Admittedly, the capital gains tax did no good for the house builder but at least it resulted in getting some money out of the pockets of those who had reaped the gains on the sales of land for building.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil returned to power in 1977 they virtually revoked the capital gains tax legislation by tapering off the amount of tax that could be collected. But, again, the National Coalition attempted in the budget they brought forward this year to reintroduce the capital gains tax system with a substantial increase in respect of development land. We have clean hands so far as land speculation and windfall profits are concerned because we tackled the problem by way of taxation and in accordance with the Constitution.  Fianna Fáil pulled the teeth out of that tax system at the first opportunity.</P>
    <P>I appeal again to the Minister for the Environment to agree, even at this stage, to set up, without qualification, an all-party Oireachtas Committee to report within a specified time &mdash; and that should <Col N="1751" /> be a short time &mdash; on the problem of land prices and to recommend to the Government methods of solving the problem.  I have asked before, and I repeat the invitation, that the Government give an undertaking that, if they are still around, they will act promptly on the Kenny Report.</P>
    <P>The housing situation nationally is a scandal.  Young people are being forced either to buy or build houses which they are not in a position to finance.  This is because not enough local authority houses have been built down through the years.  We must build more rather than fewer local authority houses.  Because of the present situation young married couples must enter into commitments far beyond their capacity to meet, with the result that both husband and wife must work in order to finance such undertakings when in many cases these young married women would much prefer to be at home looking after their homes and families.  The idea and philosophy behind the Bill is sound &mdash; to make housing land available at a reasonable price, but the vital defect and flaw is that it will not do the job because it will not get through the Supreme Court.  I do not think we should play politics with this topic above all other topics.  The solution is to adopt Deputy Barry's suggestion and I hope the Minister gives that undertaking.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> In addition, I will be dealing with some of the points raised by Deputies and which my colleague, Deputy Connolly, did not have time to touch on last night.  Because of its fundamental importance I want to deal with the issue of constitutionality first.  It is an abdication of the responsibility <Col N="1754" /> of this House to attempt to discuss the constitutional issue in regard to the control of building land prices in a few glib and shallow sentences.  The Government are not waving the Constitution as an impediment to socially desirable legislation, and we would resent Deputy Higgins's imputation of cowardice and dishonour all the more if it was not so obvious that he was relying on rhetoric rather than research in his contribution to this debate.  It is a matter of plain common sense to acknowledge the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution in recent times and to examine legislative proposals which may have a significant impact on rights guaranteed by the Constitution in the light of that interpretation.  No Deputy &mdash; on this side of the House at least &mdash; would question the obligation of the House, to the best of its ability, to legislate within the framework of the Constitution, and the procedure of reference of Bills by the President to the Supreme Court has, in the past, been used sparingly and in special circumstances.  We have taken great pains to explain the constitutional basis upon which we object to this Bill.  The Labour Party, in the absence of any other arguments, have introduced the red herring of propriety in an attempt to frustrate any constitutional discussion.  This is an extraordinary example of irresponsibility, and an argument which is likely to bring the standards of this House into disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I leave the issue of constitutionality, it might be beneficial to examine, for a moment, the essential features of a decision on a reference to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution. The court, in its recent judgment on the reference of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981, gave an exposition of these features and of the ways in which such a decision is unique, in the manner in which it is reached and in its consequences, in order to dispel an apparent misapprehension as to the nature and extent of the court's jurisdiction in this regard.  It drew attention to the fact that its function under Article 26 is to ascertain and, if appropriate, to declare repugnancy to the Constitution <Col N="1755" /> in a referred Bill or in specified provisions of a referred Bill.  I now quote from the judgment on the Housing Bill reference:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It is not the function of the Court to impress any part of a referred Bill with a stamp of constitutionality.  If the Court finds that any provision of the referred Bill or of the referred provisions is repugnant, then the whole Bill fails, for the President is then debarred from signing it, thus preventing it from becoming an Act.  There thus may be areas of a referred Bill or of referred provisions of a Bill which may be left untouched by the Court's decision. The authors of the Bill may therefore find the Court's decision less illuminating than they would wish it to be.</P>
    <P>We should be quite clear, therefore, that reference to the Supreme Court is in no way a substitute for the vigilant attention of this House in examining closely every aspect of a Bill such as the one we have before us.  Equally, we should keep in mind the precise, and in a sense limited, context within which the Supreme Court makes its judgment.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court has also pointed out that under Article 26.2.1 its decision is reached after hearing arguments by or on behalf of the Attorney General and by counsel assigned by the court.  The article does not refer to hearing of evidence, and evidence has not been heard in any of the references made to the court.  Instead, the matters argued, in all references, have been dealt with as abstract problems.  In deciding a reference, therefore, the court, to use its own words, &ldquo;acts on abstract materials in order to cope with the social, economic, fiscal and other features that may be crucial to an understanding of the working and the consequences of the referred Bill&rdquo;.  This procedure is of crucial importance when the provisions of Article 34.3.3 of the Constitution are taken into account.  This Article provides that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>No Court whatever shall have jurisdiction to question the validity of a law, or any provision of a law, the Bill for which shall have been referred to the <Col N="1756" /> Supreme Court by the President under Article 26 of this Constitution, or to question the validity of a provision of a law where the corresponding provision in the Bill for such law shall have been referred to the Supreme Court by the President under the said Article 26.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court's awareness of the implications of taking a decision on the basis of abstract arguments which may never be questioned again in any court emerges very clearly in their judgment on the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981.  I would be most concerned that a Bill when enacted could have unforeseen consequences in practice when it would be immune from any challenge.  This House should accept that the Supreme Court have laid down the parameters of their jurisdiction and it is our responsibility to ensure the passage of legislation which will work effectively and efficiently.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us is undoubtedly flawed.  I cannot see the logic of suggesting, as Deputy Higgins did that if found to be unconstitutional &ldquo;it would be a perfect record of what representatives in this assembly had considered necessary to bring before their fellow elected Members&rdquo;. Our approach is far more positive and far less time wasting.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mervyn Taylor is a lawyer and one would have expected him to be reasonably careful in examining the remarks made by the Minister for the Environment on the question of constitutionality and in commenting on those remarks. Instead, however, the Deputy chose to criticise the Minister for using different expressions in regard to this aspect of the problem and for expressing a view on the constitutionality of the Bill.  He agreed that it was right to seek up-to-date advice from the Attorney General on the constitutionality of the Kenny scheme but seemed to say that it was wrong to express any view on this Bill, which departs in substantial ways from the Kenny scheme, until that advice is available.</P>
    <P>In his speech last week the Minister was at pains to point out in straightforward non-technical language why he felt <Col N="1757" /> that this Bill was clearly not consistent with the Constitution and why he felt that, in the light of developments in constitutional law since 1973, there were, at the very least, serious doubts about the constitutionality of the Kenny scheme itself.  It is difficult to argue and debate matters such as this in the House but I am confident that if Deputies study the Minister's remarks, when they are printed in the Official Report, they will appreciate the force of his arguments and will agree that Deputy Taylor was totally wrong.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor claimed that the Rent Restrictions Act judgment had no relevance to the present Bill because the Bill does not contain any element of expropriation of property rights and would allow all owneres to receive full current use value.  This, however, ignores a 1972 Supreme Court judgment in which it was held that the value for which compensation must be paid is the value to the owner, being the market value or full price of the lands, plus every element of value which the land has and all the advantages which that land possesses, present and future, including hope value.</P>
    <P>Several Attorney Generals have been asked for their views on this problem right back to the mid-sixties and all of them have said that, while there was no constitutional bar to the compulsory acquisition of land, in the interests of the common good it would be very difficult to acquire any such land at anything less than the full market value, plus adequate allowances for disturbance etc.</P>
    <P>In addressing the House last week the Minister spelled out the substantial changes which the Government have proposed in relation to the application of capital gains tax to gains from disposals of development land.  I find it very difficult to accept the attitude of some Labour Party Deputies in relation to these measures. Deputy Quinn, for example, suggested that such measures could well have an inflationary impact on land prices in areas adjoining urban centres and that the end cost of land would be dearer rather than cheaper in the short-term until the market readjusted itself.  This is, <Col N="1758" /> undoubtedly, an arguable point, but I should emphasise that the Minister's speech last week stressed that an approach based on taxation was not of itself a complete answer and that it was for that reason that other options were being considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>It is very strange to find a Labour Party Deputy finding fault with a severe new capital gains tax regime.  It is particularly odd to find such a Deputy finding fault with what has been described as the 30 per cent withholding tax which has been introduced as part of the package of capital gains tax measures.  Surely it is obvious to Deputy Quinn that the objective of this particular measure is to counter avoidance of tax and, while the details of the withholding arrangement are still being considered, and will be included in the Finance Bill when it comes before the House, it seems very odd to find criticism of an anti-avoidance measure of this kind coming from the Labour Party who have been calling for a crack-down on speculative gains for quite some time.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> It begins to look as if the Labour Party want to have their cake and eat it.  Can it be, I wonder, that they are finally beginning to realise that there really is a need to encourage enterprise and that the sort of penal rates of taxation for which they have been clamouring for years would, if applied throughout the economy, stifle enterprise, effort and achievement of all kinds and bring about stagnation in the economy?  The capital gains taxation package put forward by the Government seems to me to be a reasonable one which achieves a proper balance between, on the one hand, the need to tax income and gains of all forms in an equitable manner and, on the other hand, the need to avoid creating a situation in which nobody would be prepared to sell land voluntarily <Col N="1759" /> because of the small net return any such sale would bring to him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins in his contribution admitted that it was obviously better to tax gains made on disposals of land than to permit tax-free speculation, but he then went on to criticise this approach for the reason that it involved acceptance of the principle of speculation.  This, indeed, is a rather extraordinary argument. Does it mean, for example, that one should not tax cigarettes and tobacco because to do so would mean acceptance of the principle that people should be allowed to go on smoking, thereby damaging their health?  Does it mean that it is wrong to levy a tax on private motor cars because this involves acceptance of the idea that people are entitled to go on driving in private cars rather than use public transport?</P>
      <P>Many taxes levied on gains or on other forms of income or commodity are open to criticism for the reason that the person on whom the tax is initially levied will attempt to pass on the tax, or to recoup himself in some way.  But we cannot allow this to prevent us from levying taxes on gains where such taxes are clearly called for.  Such taxes, alone, are not the solution to the building land problem and the Government have not suggested this.  But to criticise the Government because they had the courage to tackle the problem of taxing capital gains, which in effect is what Deputy Higgins has done, is a nonsensical approach which does little to advance the basic thesis which the Deputy was attempting to put forward in his contribution to the debate.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> The Minister in his speech on this Bill last week set out a package of measures which in addition to the capital gains tax charges are being considered to deal with the building land question.  These are: (a) control of site costs through the CRV system, (b) increased emphasis on water and sewerage programmes, (c) forward land acquisition possibly involving financial institutions, (d) review of CPO law and possible introduction of pre-emption system, (e) review of planning laws, especially provisions regarding rezoning, (f) review of operation of section 4 in relation to planning decisions.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said last week that the question of building land prices was one of the most intractable problems faced by governments not only in this country but throughout the western world, and that there is no easy solution of the problem.  He stated that there was a real need for a more informed public debate on the whole issue.  However, before any proper debate can take place it is necessary that public representatives and others interested in the subject are aware of all the facts of the issues involved, not only the facts that were available to the Kenny Committee a decade ago but also information on all major developments that have taken place in the meantime.  It is only when such information is available that the issue of building land costs can be debated properly. The Minister intends to produce a factual discussion document on all aspects of land problems which then could be debated in this House together with the proposals for dealing with the problems. It should be perfectly clear to the House that the Minister and the Government do not intend to sweep the matter under the carpet.  It is our intention to deal with the problem using all the means at our disposal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I found an air of unreality about much of this debate during the last two weeks or so.  The use of land, particularly building land, is a matter of great urgency in our society at present, but this urgency has not been reflected in the debate in this House.  All too often in the past land has been treated in Irish society in isolation from people, especially in isolation from the rights of people to housing. Land has always been canonised in Irish life in the past, and given the reverence shown towards it, we have not shown the same reverence to our people in that we have sent a million of them out of the country to other countries.  For historical reasons land has always been given an exalted place.  This attitude must change because we have a young and fast-growing population who have two basic needs, a need of employment and a need of housing.  We must have housing for our people as a right, not as a privilege.  We must have housing at reasonable prices and reasonable rents, but this is not happening. We have gross exploitation of <Col N="1762" /> housing and housing land.  This exploitation is not done by faceless people; it is done by people in this House and their supporters who are wealthy and influential. The exploitation is having the effect of making house prices exorbitant and putting them beyond the reach of young people who seek accommodation, and this applies even to rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Kenny Report was an attempt, and an attempt only, to find a remedy for this matter.  It was only a very small step on the way.  We have been told by Deputy Brady, Minister of State, and by the Taoiseach that the market value of land is sacrosanct and takes pride of place above everything else and that you cannot tamper or interfere with that.  I reject that notion because the Constitution has been invoked in this matter and speculators are hiding behind the Constitution clause.  It seems that property is in some way superior to the rights of people to housing and to the common good.  That is not right.  The Constitution should be merely a framework and a guide to living. It should not be some sort of sacred document that cannot be tampered with. Speculators are taking advantage of this clause in our Constitution to make vast profits at the expense of our people.  It is totally unacceptable that people can make millions of pounds from the rezoning of agricultural land to building land while tens and hundreds of thousands of people have not housing and cannot afford it.  It is totally wrong that a small, privileged group of people can make vast profits, sometimes as high as £15 million, while other people cannot afford the price of a flat or a mortgage on a house.</P>
    <P>This motion before us is a small step forward in the matter of curbing the exploitation of building land.  If we are to have cheaper housing and cheaper accommodation in general we must have control of building land.  The rights of people must be respected.  The right to housing is above the right to make profits. I support the motion as a small step forward.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kemmy, I am afraid that your interpretation <Col N="1763" /> of three minutes does not coincide with mine.  You have got four.  I ask you to give way to Deputy Quinn now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to summarise as quickly as I can.  This is important legislation. Every Member in this House has claimed to agree with the objectives, and that something should be done, but that the Labour Party Bill contains flaws.  We all know from the changes in administration over the last four or five years that there is no other such Bill, even in draft, available to whoever happens to have the good fortune, or perhaps misfortune, to be Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>I have listened to the arguments from all sides of the House and I believe that there is a clear solution to this problem. We have that solution.  The technical arguments that have been put forward have not been sufficiently well detailed to indicate clearly why certain sections of this Bill could not work.  Perhaps that is the difficulty in a Second Stage debate. One of the problems in a Second Stage debate is that, while people range over the principles, they do not get down to the details.  The Minister in his amendment and in his contribution tonight through Deputy Brady, Minister of State for urban affairs, has gone a considerable way towards recognising the need for a comprehensive solution.  They have responded to the proposal originally put forward by Deputy Barry to have some kind of committee.  Our immediate answer is that if the Government give us Second Stage tonight we will automatically go into Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the unique problems with regard to constitutionality we should get the formal view of the Attorney General on the matter.  The proposal of the Minister is a unique advance on anything this House has witnessed since the Kenny Report.  He has suggested a select committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas to examine all aspects of building land.  It is suggested that that committee would have referred to it this Bill, the considerable documentation available to the <Col N="1764" /> Minister and the formal views of the Attorney General which are essential because of the repeated claims regarding constitutionality, views that have so far come from everyone but the Attorney General.  That proposal would see our Bill being advanced in the House.  The Labour Party could claim credit for having influenced not only the hearts of Members but their minds also in relation to the need for a technical solution.</P>
    <P>We are interested in a solution that will give justice to people.  We are not interested in scoring party political points and I want to make that clear.  As Deputy Kemmy has said, we are talking of something that is a matter of life and death to many people, the ability to have a home. Therefore, we want this Bill to be agreed in principle, which, I think, is the essence of what the House is saying tonight.  We want a select committee of the Oireachtas to be established, with access to the expertise in the Minister's Department, to the Attorney General and to individuals throughout the country and to draft legislation that will meet the constraints of our Constitution as they are perceived. That is the way we are interpreting the views of the various parties, of Deputy Gregory, Deputy Sherlock of The Workers' Party, and Deputy Kemmy.</P>

I suggest that we get together and draw up terms of reference for the select committee which is the <Col N="1765" /> more proper way for the House to proceed. However, I think we could discuss that outside the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to quote for the benefit of the House the Long Title of our Bill which sets out the terms of reference.  The title reads as follows:</P>
      <P>AN ACT TO PROVIDE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXIGENCIES OF THE COMMON GOOD AND FOR THE FURTHERANCE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF SOCIAL JUSTICE FOR THE BETTER CONTROL OF THE SUPPLY AND PRICE OF BUILDING LAND, AND FOR THAT PURPOSE TO MAKE BETTER PROVISION FOR THE ACQUISITION AND DISPOSAL OF LAND BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES; TO MAKE FURTHER PROVISION AS TO COMPENSATION IN RESPECT OF LAND ACQUIRED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES; TO PROVIDE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A LANDS TRIBUNAL AND FOR OTHER MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE MATTERS AFORESAID.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what we are proposing.  We believe that the grounds for a solution of the problem are set out in that title.  Of course the Bill can be improved.  We are taking in good faith the repeated assurances of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that they want to see a solution of this problem. The socialist Deputies know quite clearly what is the solution.  We are telling Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that in the select committee there will be an opportunity to put down in detail and without any time constraints all the proposals that would go towards eliminating land speculation and profiteering.  For the time <Col N="1766" /> being the Labout Party will go along with that proposal but I am clearly putting down a marker to Deputy Barry on behalf of Fine Gael and to the Minister for the Environment that this Bill is not withdrawn.  It stays on the Order Paper and if we cannot reach agreement the Labour Party will yet again come in and move a Bill that I hope will be stronger than this one.</P>
    <P>If that is the feeling of the House, we can say to people in housing queues and to those who are homeless that, at the instigation of the Labour Party and supported by socialist Deputies in this House, we have agreed to a proposal originating from Fine Gael and confirmed by the Minister in a generous response, to go into a select committee while this Bill stays on the Order Paper. Regard will be had to this Bill and to other matters with a view to seeing if we can produce a legislative solution to the problem of building land.  If that is the agreement of Fine Gael and the Government, perhaps in the time available this evening they will signal that they are agreeing to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated to the House, and this was done earlier by my Minister of State, that the Government intend to set up a select committee before the end of this session and that the Long Title of Deputy Quinn's Bill will form a substantial part of the terms of reference: I am not saying the base of the terms of reference or in detail but quite substantially.  We know what is the problem and we know what is the solution.  The work of the committee will be with regard to how we get to the solution.  The Government are determined to get a solution to this vexed problem.  I can assure the House of my good faith in this matter and I have shown that by indicating the setting up of a select committee.</P>

The Labour Party, with the support of the socialist Deputies, have got a concession from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil to put down in detail the kind of Bill they want.  I am saying very clearly that, if the Labour Party do not like it and it does not go along the lines that we believe in then we will be re-tabling this Bill and we will be calling a vote on this Bill.  A concession has been extracted from the Government and from Fine Gael which we appreciate and it will be up to them to perform.  If not, the socialist measures in this Bill will be voted upon in this House and I know that we will have the support of The Workers' Party.</P>

      <P>I think what I have to say can be said in 16 minutes.  But the ramifications of it may last a good deal longer than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank you for agreeing to allow me <Col N="1769" /> time this evening to examine this matter and to ask some questions to which we need answers following the arrangement that has been made in Brussels and the information that we have been given last evening and during today by the Government. I must say that the information circulated by the Government in this sheet here and in the press release today can only be said to put the best possible light on the agreement.  It is probably normal that that should be the case.  But in fact the figures which it contains do a great deal more than justice to the agreement that has been arrived at.  It is stated in the document, and was stated by the Minister in the House on 6 May, that the value of this package in a full year to Ireland is £235 million.  The Minister chose his words very carefully when he was saying that.  &mdash;&ldquo;the value of the package in a full year&rdquo;.  In a hypothetical full year it might indeed come to that. But in this particular year, and even in this full marketing year, the value of the package would be considerably less than that.  I would also recall that the Minister said on that occasion that the package being worked out was very attractive as far as Irish farmers were concerned.  He went on to say that he had discussed it with Irish farmers and farming organisations and that it was acceptable provided it could be implemented as soon as possible. That is not the kind of reaction I have heard or indeed that kind of reaction I would have myself.</P>
    <P>On a quick reading of the figures that have been circulated to us by the Government and on some checking with other sources I would estimate that the value of the package in this year of 1982 will amount to not more than about £120 million, that is, applying the likely effects of these price increases to roughly last year's level of output.  So, in effect, the package this year will be worth just about half the figure which the Minister has put forward.  Even if all of this £120 million or so worked itself into farm income &mdash; and we cannot obviously be sure of that because we are not sure yet what is going to happen to costs during this year &mdash; it would not be sufficient to maintain incomes at the already depresed levels of <Col N="1770" /> last year and it would not in any way contribute to an improvement of the farm income situation where we have seen over the last year a very serious reduction.</P>
    <P>It is wrong and it does a disservice to this House and to our farming community to try to present this package as being worth more than it is, as being worth about double the possible result that it could give this year.  Even if we looked at the effect of it in a full year, even if we looked at the effect of it in the 1982-83 marketing year, and taking the Minister's startling figure of £235 million, the value of the package could not possibly be more than £200 million for that full marketing year because we are not going to get the benefit of the calf subsidy, which is part of the package, until the end of that marketing year.  That must cause us some serious concern.  The Minister has said in the House, and has agreed in fact with the general opinion, that we need measures that will give a stimulus to expansion in our livestock sector.  This calf subsidy was going to be one of those measures to which we would look for an incentive to increase numbers and it was going to be one of the measures to which we would look for a direct injection of cash into the livestock sector.  We find that on the present plan the calf subsidy will apply only to calves born during the marketing year beginning on 20 May, tomorrow.  For all practical purposes all our calves for this year have already been born and therefore cannot qualify for the subsidy, so we are going to get no benefit from that calf subsidy this year.  That is about £32 million to £37 million which will not be available in the livestock sector this year and which was included, it appears, in the claimed value of this package.</P>
    <P>I might add that since the total value of the package during this year, if my calculation is correct, will not exceed about £120 million, the claimed benefit of this to our balance of payments, which on the Minister's figures is £170 million, must obviously be something that cannot be reached either.  I understand that in relation to the calf subsidy the implemented regulations to put it into have not yet been adopted and I would ask the <Col N="1771" /> Minister very seriously to go back and see if, even at this late stage, he could not, in the discussion on these implementing regulations, get some change which would mean at least that some of our crop of calves for this year could be brought into the scope of operations of this scheme.  Unless we do that we will not see any appreciable injection of funds from this source into our livestock sector this year.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that he has some very good arguments to use in doing this, as he had during the negotiations of the whole package because agricultural spending in the European Community this year is running below budgeted levels.  Whatever is going on in terms of the United Kingdom budget contributions, there will be some leeway in the farm spending already budgeted for, and the Minister should try to profit from that when it comes to talking about implementing regulations for the calf subsidy.  It will be very disappointing if, even at this stage, an attempt is not made to secure some benefits from this situation.</P>
    <P>I come now to the other aspect of our livestock expansion programme which causes me some worry.  It is stated in the document the Government circulated that under the calf heifer scheme grant aid amounting to £70 will be paid by the Irish Exchequer this year and for the two following years.  What is the real situation here?  I had reports this morning that the calf heifer scheme was not agreed as part of the package, that it is a scheme which could be agreed only with unanimity in the Council, not because of the United Kingdom budget problem but because it is a scheme which needs sanction under Article 93 of the Treaty and therefore must be agreed unanimously.  I heard that the matter was not raised in the Council until after the British Minister and his Minister of State left the meeting and therefore it was not possible to get unanimous agreement.  If that is the case I would be very worried because it means that instead of having the three-year programme from 6 May, which the Minister claims, we do not have any more than a <Col N="1772" /> one-year agreement.  The Minister knows as well as I how important it is that we have a longer term programme.  I have been negotiating for a four-year programme with EEC funding.  If it is true that the heifer scheme was not part of the agreement finally reached, because there had to be unanimous agreement, I want to know when the Minister is going back to get this agreed because we need the assurance that we will have a multiannual livestock development programme. I would like the Minister to tell us exactly what the position is in this respect.</P>
    <P>As far as milk is concerned, we all agree that the changes in the co-responsibility levy are welcome but we would all wish to see it go further.  We wish to see it disappear entirely.  Within the limits of the agreement &mdash; and those limits are fairly tight and unsatisfactory &mdash; I am glad to see there has been some relief, particularly for the smaller farmers and for farmers in disadvantaged areas.  This will provide some small encouragement to them because there will be a little extra for them in developing their productivity and increasing production.</P>
    <P>For the cereal sector, an increase of 8½ per cent falls way below what is required even to maintain margins.  This sector has taken a hammering over the last couple of years, both as a result of the price situation and the weather.  This sector needed an increase of more than that magnitude this year even to maintain margins which are under very severe pressure and which are resulting in a situation where the kind of progress we made in recent years in developing productivity by switching over to new varieties is very much at risk.</P>
    <P>I note in the agreement that progress has been made in relation to refunds for beef exports.  I am glad the Minister was able to follow through on the commitment I extracted from the Commission at the beginning of this year and that we now have a relative improvement in the refunds for boneless beef exports as against refunds for live cattle.  These rates are all increased, but there has been a relative extra improvement for boneless beef and I am glad to note that in relation <Col N="1773" /> to hindquarters we will now have the same total amount of refunds available on boneless hindquarters as there had been up to now on the bone-in article. That is a very substantial improvement and I hope our beef exporters will take full advantage of it because it is one of the areas which had been most the subject of complaint over the last couple of years.  I hope this progress will enable them to compete more effectively on the market and to make progress in market penetration for boneless beef in third countries, which is something we all want to see because we all want an improvement in employment in our meat factories where there have been very serious losses in recent years.</P>
    <P>Apparently there has been no change in the British MCAs.  What happened is that the rate of MCA remains the same but now that the prices have been increased by the margin agreed here, in money terms the MCA will increase somewhat, and will continue to be a distorting element in the market.  We had a number of difficulties in the beef and other sectors, but particularly in the beef sector, and we now find ourselves in a position where competition from Northern Ireland for that, and a number of other reasons, are creating problems for our exporters.  It is regrettable that we did not have a measure of progress in this area.  I do not see any reason why we should continue to agree that the United Kingdom can opt out of the same kind of procedures that apply to all other member states.  In a number of other cases we have had changes in their MCA rates to eliminate gradually this cause of distortion in the market.  That is an unsatisfactory aspect of this agreement which we must pursue energetically in the future.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that once the agreement has been made and that we have a range of increases, inadequate as they are, he takes the necessary measures to ensure that these increases are fully reflected in the prices farmers receive for their produce.  In that respect an increase of 0.64p per gallon for processing costs in the dairying sector is far below the level required to allow our <Col N="1774" /> dairy processors to pass on the full increase in milk prices to our milk producers. This is an area where squeezes have been in effect for the last few years and I am afraid that because of the meagre allowance for increased processing costs, the actual amount passed back to farmers in terms of the increase in the ex-farm prices for their products will not be up even to the level we have in this agreement.  I also ask the Minister to make sure that provision is made for an increase in the farm price of liquid milk straightaway.  There is no reason for delaying because this matter should be handled simultaneously with the increases in the creamery milk prices, and I ask the Minister to ensure that that is done.</P>
    <P>While I am glad agreement has been reached, this matter has dragged on for far too long and I am bound to point out that it is a good deal less than we started to negotiate for.  It is not going to bring our farming community back into a position of growth in real income.  There may not be an overall growth in real incomes in the economy this year, but there is no other sector of the economy which in 1981 was dealing with a real income level that was half what it was in 1978.  To that extent this is a most unsatisfactory arrangement.  I call upon the Minister and his colleagues in Government to ensure that the other side of the equation, which is what happens to our own domestic inflation, is brought under control rapidly so that from that quarter we may expect some relief for our hard-pressed farmers.</P>

      <P>First of all, the Deputy should be well aware that the farm price package about which we are talking and which will be implemented from tomorrow, would not have been possible were it not for the initiative taken by our Government and other Community Governments in deciding that the blocking mechanism being used to frustrate and prevent farm prices from coming into effect would have to be defeated.  The important aspect is that in recent weeks we were faced with the prospect of no farm package and no farm <Col N="1775" /> price increase for months ahead if the Community stood by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and let this blocking mechanism continue without challenge. It was eventually decided, by reluctant agreement amongst seven member countries of the Community, to invoke the basic legal protection of the regulations of the Treaty of Rome to implement Community policies &mdash; in this case the common agricultural policy price fixation &mdash; by way of a qualified majority vote. In the interests of Community solidarity and consensus, which has always been the Community approach, that decision was reached only after much agonising thought and persuasion.  At the end of the day, the total blocking abuse by the United Kingdom Government of the Luxembourg Formula and of the veto provision was seen to lead to a legal vacuum and a complete breakdown in the implementation of Community policies. For that reason, reluctantly, we decided, on the evening before last in Brussels, that yesterday we would have a qualified majority vote for the first time ever in the implementation of the farm prices.  I am glad that we played a part in making that decision.  It is an important decision with many implications, but the alternative was that Irish farmers would be without their increase, possibly for months ahead.  There was absolutely no sign that the blocking mechanism which involved the abuse of the Luxembourg Formula would be removed.</P>
      <P>I would much prefer, in Community decisions in relation to agriculture and other areas, that there should be unanimity and, indeed, the whole Community system is built on a unanimous and consensus approach, but in this case Ireland was fully justified, with six other Community partners, in achieving the requisite 45 votes which amounted to a qualified majority, to ensure that we implemented the farm package this year for the Community as a whole, which was and is of decided benefit to the Irish farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Make no mistake about it, I agree that <Col N="1776" /> there has been a diminution in the overall benefit by reason of the delay in implementation. I am pointing out, however, that if we did not go along with the decision to have this matter implemented in a qualified majority vote manner, the delay would have been far longer and the losses far greater.  The £235 million which we have estimated on an annualised basis would have been of benefit to the Irish agricultural sector, but that has to be diminished somewhat by reason of the six weeks' delay in seeking to achieve a consensus.  If we had followed the logic of the British and, indeed, the Danish and the Greek position, we would have spent the months ahead without any increase or any of the benefits of the package.  These are the facts of the matter. The seven countries involved, I must emphasise, constituted the minimum to pass this matter by way of a qualified majority vote.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom Government were engaged in a blocking mechanism by seeking to make a linkage between the agricultural price fixation and the budget refund which is a totally different matter. On that basis we, the French, the Italians and the Germans, who have made statements already to this effect, agree that the veto decision still remains but is not to be abused by bringing in extraneous matters which bear no relationship to the matter before the Council.  A separate matter from a separate Council was sought to be introduced by the United Kingdom to paralyse the decision-making of the Agricultural Council, which is required under the regulations of the Treaty of Rome to bring in its annual price fixation.  Our argument, and that of the other six Community countries which supported us, is absolutely impeccable. Had we not made the decision and had we followed the point of view of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is rather like the beef matter to which I would like briefly to refer, which is also outside the package but is of enormous benefit.  While one is out in Brussels in negotiations like this, as Deputy Dukes is aware, one does a lot of marginal negotiating which is helpful.

      <P>It is not part of the farm package, but the in-calf heifer grant has been agreed separately and the other matters also included in the document, which I gave for the benefit of the House, concerning the beef aspect which is of great importance.  We now have, for the first time, an equalisation in boned-out beef, as well as carcase beef.  There is complete equalisation of refunds in respect of each of these areas.  There is also a rise in the level, when compared with livestock exports.  There is a differential advantage in favour of carcase beef and boned-out beef both of which will be at the same level.  Like the in-calf heifer grant, they are separate matters not included in the package, but were negotiated at the same time.  I hope that that is understood.  They were included in the document which was presented.</P>

      <P>Composite forms for completion by applicants in the disadvantaged <Col N="1649" /> areas who are eligible for more than one headage scheme have been or are being introduced this year where possible.  In the case of sheep, application forms covering both the 1982 sheep headage and the EEC ewe premium schemes have already issued.  Likewise, forms combining both the beef cow and EEC suckler applications for 1982 in the less severely handicapped areas and both the cattle headage and EEC suckler cow applications in the more severely handicapped areas have been drafted for issue to farmers in these areas.  It is my hope that the use of these new forms will prevent a recurrence of any confusion which may have arisen last year.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's implication that the Land Commission are reluctant to make bog plots available.  The position is that any developed turbary which they have in their possession is usually let on a seasonal basis to meet local demand.  During the year 1981 some 4,900 such lettings were made.  In addition, the Land Commission are prepared to consider applications from individuals or groups for long-term leases of bog for commercial or domestic production.</P>

      <P>An appeals officer has decided that the person concerned was not entitled to any pension from 23 September 1981 when he submitted his claim, to 15 February 1982 because his means, derived from a holding and capital exceeded the statutory limit during that period.  The holding was however transferred by deed of transfer dated 15 February 1982 and the appeals officer awarded maximum rate of pension after that date.</P>

      <P>While flour imports into this country have increased in recent years, these imports still represent only a very small proportion of our overall flour consumption. Under EEC regulations it is not open to me to put any restrictions on such imports.  Naturally, I would like to see all our requirements of flour produced at home, with native wheat being used to the greatest degree possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending inquiries regarding the nature and origin of the incapacity he was paid disability benefit and pay-related benefit on an interim basis.  The delay in the initial payment of benefit was due mainly to the fact that the medical certificates dated the 6 and 10 April 1982 were received together on 14 April 1982 and payment thereon was made on 23 April 1982.  The certificates dated 17 and 24 <Col N="1676" /> April 1982 were received on 26 April 1982 and payment was issued on 27 April 1982.

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will give the approximate cost and details of the new pattern uniform issued to FCA personnel; if, in view of its design and unsuitability for field exercises, he intends to issue combat gear to FCA units; and, if so, the approximate cost.</P>

      <P>The cost of the new pattern tunic and trousers on issue to non-commisioned officers and privates of the FCA is £35.54.  Officers of the FCA receive initial and annual replenishment allowances in order to provide themselves with tailored tunics and trousers.  The uniform is similar to that issued to members of the Permanent Defence Force except that the FCA tunic has maroon epaulettes and FCA flashes. The provision of suitable uniform for FCA personnel for training purposes is under examination.  However, having regard to the incidence of duties for which such clothing is appropriate the substantial financial outlay involved in the provision of combat uniforms for the purpose is not regarded as warranted.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that in the <Col N="1685" /> first four years of their 1978-82 Industrial Plan they approved more than 230 projects for County Mayo, which have the potential to provide almost 2,500 jobs at full production.  Many of these jobs have yet to come on stream.  Manufacturing employment in County Mayo is now 3 per cent higher than in 1978.  The IDA also have over 150,000 square feet of advance factory space and 126 acres of land available throughout the county for further industrial development.  These facilities are being vigorously promoted for industrial projects, and will provide the basis for further growth in manufacturing industry in the county.  In addition the IDA are now in the process of preparing, in conjunction with local interests in the Mayo area, an action plan for the promotion of industrial development over the next two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following are replies to the various parts of the question:&mdash; (a) Ten men.  (b) Area (stocked) at 31/12/81 &mdash; 1,146 hectares.  Condition of standing timber: On the assumption that this relates to the stage of the crop as regards thinning and clearfelling, the position is that as yet no thinning has been programmed for 1982 and decisions as to clearfelling are dependent on market considerations.  (c) 546 man weeks.  (d) 520 man weeks originally programmed. However, the current work situation has necessitated the temporary redeployment of some workers to a neighbouring forest in the interests of avoiding redundancies. The 1982 programme does not envisage the extraction by forest workers of timber sold standing.  (e) Some standing timber has been sold to a major saw-miller <Col N="1689" /> who will make his own harvesting arrangements.  This is the general practice in most areas and the bulk of timber sales are made on that basis.  Further such sales may be made during the year depending on the market situation.  No redundancies are currently envisaged.</P>
