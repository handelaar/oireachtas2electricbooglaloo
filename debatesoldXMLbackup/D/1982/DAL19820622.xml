    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if consideration has been given to when the next Anglo-Irish summit meeting will take place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he considers that it is appropriate that an Anglo-Irish summit meeting should now take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>No arrangements have yet been made for the next Anglo-Irish summit meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the good health of Anglo-Irish relations requires frequent meetings between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister?  Would he further agree that the development of such initiatives as the inter-governmental council, the inter-parliamentary tier, also require frequent meetings?  Would the Taoiseach agree that, irrespective of the tenor of any communications he may have had recently from the British Government, we should make all possible haste to have another meeting as soon as possible?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that of course the ministerial meetings in the context of the Inter-Governmental Anglo-Irish Council are taking place regularly.  I would also like to mention that it is not the custom to say in advance when a summit meeting is likely to be held.  I agree with the Deputy about the value of these summit meetings. From my own knowledge all such meetings held in recent years have been advantageous and helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary:</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say whether he considers that at the forthcoming EEC summit meeting the opportunity would occur to finalise arrangements for a further meeting between himself and the British Prime Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>At the summit meetings in the past it has happened that impromptu informal arrangements could be made during the course of the summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach foresee that happening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that at the last summit meeting of Prime Ministers it was agreed informally that the next meeting would take place in about six months or so, in fact this spring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary:</NameTxt>
      <P>Early spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>The time in the spring was not defined but it was understood that a meeting would be held certainly by the month of May.  While recognising that the advent of new Government in power would involve some postponement of that, would the Taoiseach not agree that it is desirable that the continuity of meetings should not be broken by failing to have another such meeting this side of the summer, at least in the month of July?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that these meetings are useful and helpful and beneficial.  But, as I said, it is not customary <Col N="845" /> to say any length in advance when any particular meeting is going to be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not customary to give the date of the meeting for a variety of reasons.  But the fact that the meeting is contemplated in the foreseeable future has been known in advance on previous occasions and it is reasonable to ask the Taoiseach does he contemplate and is he taking steps to secure such a meeting this side of the summer, without being more specific than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that the British Prime Minister and British Ministers generally have been, to put it mildly, pre-occupied with the Falklands crisis in recent times and I did not deem it appropriate to raise the question of a meeting until now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>We can understand the Taoiseach's reticence about raising it at this particular period, but given that the problem has now been substantially resolved would it be the Taoiseach's intention to fix such a meeting this side of the summer break?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to comment on that at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the amount of flour imports for (a) 1980, (b) 1981 and (c) so far this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. B. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Imports of flour amounted to 4,144 tonnes in 1980, 7,305 tonnes in 1981 and 4,280 tonnes in the period January-April 1982.  April 1982 is the latest month for which data are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that approximately 1,200 workers are involved in the flour milling industry here and that for the month of April this year the level of imports has doubled over the previous one?  Would the Government consider raising at EEC level the possibility <Col N="846" /> of national security being threatened should our own production of flour be limited, so that we could invoke the clause to prevent this alleged dumping of flour on the Irish market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Aherne Mr. B. Aherne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Aherne:</NameTxt>
      <P>The points raised are not of a statistical nature.  Although there has been an increase in the April figure, home produced flour accounts for 97 per cent of the consumption of flour in the country.  However, I will certainly pass on the points made by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will give details of the works programme in the <i>Road Development Plan for the 1980's</i> where the original projected time scale for starts and completions will not now be met; and the new projections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the regular monitoring of progress on the road development plan which is carried out in my Department, I have initiated an examination which will take account of variations in the pace of implementation of the individual projects involved.  When this has been completed, I will be in a position to indicate the updated position of these schemes within the overall plan. In the meantime, Government support for the plan is shown in the substantial <Col N="847" /> level of roads grants which has been made available this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no change in the timespan.  When we get the up-to-date plan of what the progress is, if there have to be alterations in it the Minister will let the House know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. L. Lawlor Mr. L. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister take a particular interest in this problem to see if he could get the three local authorities together to improve this national primary?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have that matter looked into but as the Deputy will appreciate, it will depend on the acquisition of land which, I regret to say, is a slow process under the present law.  If there is anything I can do to help the three local <Col N="848" /> authorities I will be only too glad to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Are there any plans for the improvement of the Dublin-Navan road, especially between Blanchardstown and Clonee?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information here, but if the Deputy puts down a written or oral question I will be only too glad to give him the information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Would the Minister accept that this is one of the most unsatisfactory roads in the country and which does not seem to have been improved within living memory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that when the Coalition were in office the roads were very bad and when we came into office we allocated an extra £10 million to alleviate the position.  That shows the interest my Government and my Minister have in the road network. We are fully committed to this plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Arising out of the Minister's general remarks is he aware that the road I am talking about &mdash; from Clonee to Dublin via Blachardstown &mdash; has not been improved since 1932?  Would he accept that his party had responsibility for this situation for most of that time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have the matter looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that at this stage he should allow the local authorities more autonomy or flexibility in regard to the capital expenditure <Col N="849" /> made available for road works?  For example, once the capital allocation is made to a local authority it is specified where that money is to be spent, generally on national primary and national secondary roads, but we have a county road system where conditions are deteriorating. Would the Minister allow local authorities flexibility so far as the expenditure of capital is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point raised by the Deputy but, as he is aware, part of the money allocated comes from the EEC Regional Fund and is for roads which are specified.  I have no control over money provided for funds for special projects.  Maybe the Deputy is suggesting more flexibility should be given to the block grant.  I will have that matter looked at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>Preliminary proposals for this scheme have been approved, in principle, by my Department.  This approval was subject to agreement on the phasing of the scheme and to discussion of the proposed method of sewage disposal between the technical advisers of my Department and the county council. Following these discussions technical investigations have been carried out locally.  I understand that the results of the investigations will be submitted to my Department for approval.  If these prove satisfactory, the council may proceed to prepare contract documents for the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>While the building industry nationally is experiencing some difficulties through the effects of recession, the worst of these effects are cushioned by the continuing high level of public investment in the industry which was boosted by the additional provisions of the recent budget.  I have no information to suggest that the situation in Galway is different from the national situation.</P>
      <P>My Department issued approval to the acceptance of a tender for contract number 3 of the Galway city water supply scheme, to Galway Corporation on 27 January 1982.  A Local Loans Fund loan of £400,000 was sanctioned for this scheme on 31 March 1982.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Higgins, has a similar question &mdash; Question No. 13 &mdash; which relates to the availability of information from local authorities to the Department of the Environment.  I accept that in all probability the information is not available to the Minister.  In view of the inability of the Department to manage efficiently the housing stock, is the Minister prepared to set up a structure that would allow this information to become available?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that some local authorities have allowed units of their housing stock to be vacant for an undue length of time and have not communicated that information to their members, let alone to the Minister?  In view of the fact that all capital moneys for new housing have to come from his Department, does the Minister not consider it prudent and an exercise in good management to make local authorities give this information directly to him on a monthly basis so that he may see just how efficient they are in managing their own housing stock?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a member of a local authority for many years.  As far as I know, local authorities, and particularly the members of such authorities, know the number of houses unoccupied.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities submit to my Department annually detailed returns setting out the number of approved applications for local authority housing, giving details of family size and the reason for their approval such as overcrowding, living in unfit conditions, medical grounds and so on.  This information enables my Department to examine the comparative urgency of need as between the various housing authorities for capital allocation purposes.

Will the Minister agree that in those circumstances he has given the most utter undemocratic reply to a legitimate question from a public representative?  Will the Minister agree that his officials have just said, in effect, that he will get the information privately from local authorities, will look at it in private in the Custom House, will allocate priorities in private in his office and will then come before the Oireachtas and ask us in public to vote moneys for something which has been evaluated in private?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, and the Government, allocate moneys according to the need of each local authority.  It is a matter for each local authority to allocate that money to housing schemes that need the go ahead.  That is the situation. I am pleased with the way local authorities and corporations have allocated the money for housing and the schemes they have carried out.  The only problem I have come up against is that I do not have sufficient money to give to local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to get involved in a debate with the Minister of State about the merits or demerits of spending more money on housing.  That is not the point of the question.  If Department officials in private can get the information from local authorities upon which they assign a scheme of priorities for the allocation of capital can that information be made available to public representatives in the House?  The Minister must agree that in the course of his reply he has conceded that that information is available from local authorities to the Department and I am anxious to know why it cannot be made available at least once a year to Members.  This information was refused to Deputy Michael Higgins on the grounds that it was not available in the first instance.</P>

There has been a lot of abuse of such matters here and we are all aware of the comments in the media about the cost of replying to questions.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>,<i>Dublin South-East):</i> With your permission, Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>My Department and An Foras Forbartha have been following the progress of experiments in Britain and elsewhere and other modifications of the road surface designed to retard vehicle speeds.  There is no statutory authority for the provision of such ramps in this country.  Apart from the legal aspects, however, I am not satisfied at this stage that the results of research so far carried out would justify the general adoption of such measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exclusion or restriction of traffic <Col N="863" /> by means of bollards or other such measures is a matter for decision by the road authority, in consultation with the Garda authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the position that local authorities do not have a legal right to provide such grants if they wish to do so? Is the Minister aware that speeding causing injury and death is an increasing problem in our towns and on many rural roads and that this measure has been adopted with some success in other countries? Would he give serious consideration to providing these ramps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. Brady (Dublin South-East) Mr. Brady (Dublin South-East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I am sympathetic to the Deputy's question. The matter was discussed at great length in Dublin Corporation and the only conclusion that could be arrived at was that perhaps it could be tried out in a particular area on a pilot scheme basis to see if rumble strips or &ldquo;sleeping policemen&rdquo; would have some effect.  The best way of tackling it would be to try through a local authority to designate some area that would be suitable on an experimental basis.  It is an excellent suggestion, but to engage in an overall scheme of introducing rumble strips to slow down traffic might be counterproductive.  I said there might be legal aspects that might curtail building such strips, but from my recollection of discussions with Dublin Corporation the feeling was that there would not be any legal obstacles to introducing such rumble strips.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister put the legal question beyond doubt, because my recollection is that the view of Dublin Corporation was that such ramps would be helpful and that the the corporation felt they had not got legal powers to provide them?  If that doubt exists would the Minister now clarify the situation by introducing the necessary legislation or making the Ministerial order?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I am aware that there have been problems in this area, but I feel the computerisation of vehicle registration will go a very long way to alleviate this and will have a definite impact in decreasing the workload generally.  I am hopeful that a very dramatic improvement will take place in the registration and taxation office as a result.</P>
      <P>As regards items being lost in the post or otherwise, I think it would be more beneficial to be specific in cases like that which could actually be examined.  I do not say that you will have absolute perfection in the administration of any office.  There is a total of 125 people operating in the taxation office and I am of the opinion that they are doing their job as efficiently as possible.

I had a personal experience of 150 to 200 people being in the queue and I waited over two hours to have my car taxed.  Would the Minister not agree that there should be more flexible hours in order to alleviate the problem? Sometimes, as I am aware, people have to lose a half day from work to have a car taxed?

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange:</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, on last Wednesday when we were discussing the notorious Talbot agreement I asked the Taoiseach if he would indicate the cost to date and the cost implications for the future.  The Taoiseach replied, &ldquo;If the Deputy puts down a question about that I should answer that&rdquo;.  Today, Sir, I got a letter from you which states that the question was transferred to the Minister for Industry and Energy, which we suspected at the time.  Then I was told that it was a repeat of Question No. 749 of 3 June 1982 and the reply to that question. It is not a repeat of that question.  That question asked for the cost for the year 1983.  My question asked what everybody in Ireland is asking at present, for the cost implications for the future, because even if the cost remains as it is at present it could be upwards of £20 million if inflation continues as we have it and that agreement could cost £40 million to £50 million.  I submit that it is not a repeat.  I asked for the cost implications for the future, which is different altogether from the cost for 1983 which was asked in Deputy Barry Desmond's question.  I believe the Taoiseach gave us his word that he would answer it.  Is he man enough today to answer that question?</P>

      <P>I understand it is traditional when the First Reading of a Bill is moved that one can merely address oneself to the question of the timing of the Bill.  It would be appropriate to simply ask a question of the Minister to which he may be in a position to reply.

      <P>Before the Adjournment of this debate on the last occasion I had given some of the reasons why we in the Labour Party are totally opposed to this Bill.  I might summarise them as follows.  I submit that this Bill, as presented, is capable of taking away rights and status held by workers in the Post Office and telecommunications operations. I submit further that certain rights reserved for the Minister under this Bill can mean the hiving-off of certain sections, probably profitable sections of this service, to outside bodies.</P>

      <P>I pointed out on the last occasion the options given to the Minister to provide licences to certain people to do certain functions and works at present administered by the general Post Office service.  As I pointed out on the last occasion, this is a very dangerous thing, because since before the foundation of the State these services have been directly available from the Government to the people.  It is agreed that the new boards will have certain borrowing powers and that certain funds will be available. No indication has been given as to how much but yet we are expected to believe that the two new boards will be able to provide a better service.  I cannot see how that can be done because Deputies on the Government side have repeatedly said that the people in the post and telecommunications service up to now have given an excellent service.  We are now told the two new boards are necessary to give a better service but it is not explained how the better service will be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said on the last occasion on which we discussed this Bill that in my opinion it would be uneconomic to split this whole area into two boards.  It seems that the amalgamation engaged in by the two people who are to head those new boards was the criterion used in their appointment.  Now we have two separate boards being set up which will have two separate and large administrations.  I do not believe that can be profitable.  I believe there will be an overlap of duties between the two boards.  I believe the status of the people employed in the Post Office at present will disimprove.  I understand that the method of recruitment will be changed.  I believe the recruitment will be carried on by the Civil Service Commission for a year or two and I fear for the day when that it discontinued. The Civil Service Commission have been very fair in selecting people by open competition to do the work within the State service.  I fear for the kind of people <Col N="1112" /> who may be recruited under any other system.  I have a lot of experience of other systems.  Those are the reasons why the Labour Party are totally opposed to this Bill.  We will oppose the Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I feel it is necessary to go into some of the details of the Bill to show how what I have said is applicable under the Bill. Under this Bill, if a person decides to set up in business those two boards will have a monopoly.  If a person decides to break the law and do this work there is a penalty of £500 laid down.  A penalty of £500 or imprisonment is not a real deterrent when one considers the kind of profitable operations which might be undertaken under this Bill.  Section 9 states that the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, shall cause two limited companies conforming to the conditions laid down in this Act, to be formed and registered under the Companies Acts, 1963 and 1977.  Why do we have to set up two companies?  Why is it not possible to set up corporations?  I am not accepting for one moment that two bodies of any kind should be set up but, assuming they are set up, why would it not be advisable for the Minister to set up corporations? It has been found that corporations are more protective of staff interests and changes in relation to them must go through Parliament as distinct from companies where only the sanction of the Minister is required.  If changes have to be made in corporations a Bill has to be brought before this House.  I have regard to the protection I feel I would need if I was an employee of the Post Office.</P>
    <P>The Minister will appoint a vesting day for bringing into operation each of the companies as soon as practical after the companies have been registered. Appointment of the two companies will make privatisation of the service easier legally in the long run.  I am very suspicious of this.  There is another Bill before the Seanad which is hiving off another large area of the civil service.  The deliberate policy of the present administration is to take away the responsibility of Government.  The Bill before the Seanad will hive off large sections of the Office of Public Works.  It is a follow up to this Bill which is hiving off nearly half the <Col N="1113" /> civil service.  Is this the proper way for a Government to carry on?  This responsibility has been carried by the Government since before the State was founded. The present administration are now hiving off half the civil service and reneging on the responsibility they have for the postal and telecommunications service which they have accepted over the years.</P>
    <P>Our spokesman for Posts and Telegraphs referred to another company in this connection.  The people on these boards are not properly chosen for trade union negotiations.  They do not realise what they are dealing with.  The Minister has had discussions, but there is no agreement at present.  Deputy Fitzpatrick from the Government side asked 28,000 people to willingly and voluntarily agree with these changes.  There have been some discussions, a White Paper and so forth, but there has been no agreement by the workers.  I warn the Minister, who wants to hive off almost half the section that this legislation may have repercussions which he will never forget.  He will have to change it.  A Bill should not have been introduced until there was at least a broad form of agreement with the workers.  This is a wrong and foolish step for no apparent reason.</P>
    <P>I refer now to counter services and objectives.  Section 12 (1) includes among the principal objects of the postal company in its memorandum of association:</P>
    <P>(c) to provide counter services for the company's own and Government business and, subject to the consent of the Minister, for others as the company thinks fit,...</P>
    <P>This is very restrictive, unless I am unable to understand properly what I am reading.  Does that mean that they are to provide only services for the company's own and Government business?  If there is one area which could be expanded profitably it is the counter services.  There is scope, for example, for services in connection with tourism and even the sale of theatre tickets.  This could be done on a profitable basis, but the Bill appears to prohibit those services.  I agree that the Minister will have power to allow them to sell rashers if he so desires, but this <Col N="1114" /> section was meant to be restrictive; otherwise it would not be there.  Is the Minister serious about developing the service and making it economical?  I understand that the idea behind the Bill is to make the service a viable, economic unit but this section restricts the one area where many profitable activities could be introduced.</P>
    <P>I have not much confidence in the board, with all due respect to them.  Their real interest is not in the provision of services within the community in this great State venture.  Will this section restrict the Post Office savings business from expanding into the general banking system?  There has been a lot of talk, from my own party as well as elsewhere, about taking over and nationalising banks.  Here we have a readymade nationalised banking service capable of being highly profitable.  Must they get the permission of the Minister for every new venture?  The implications of this section were not sufficiently thought out.  Who was responsible for the drafting of the section?  Was it meant to lessen the activities of the Post Office?  This is a huge area offering an opportunity for the provision of investment and other services through a banking system which will be owned by the State.  This could be done under the present system, without this Bill or the creation of any new boards. The civil servants operating the Post Office system are well capable of running a proper banking system, which should include every type of banking, including investment and the granting of loans.</P>
    <P>At present under the regulations a Government social welfare or pay cheque cannot be cashed in a post office.  These people are being blamed for doing a job properly and they are prevented from doing something which every grocer and small shopkeeper can do.  This stupid attitude has continued down the years. Yet these people who are prohibited from cashing pay or social welfare cheques are told &ldquo;You are not doing your job.  We will have to replace you.&rdquo; Are we now putting the same obstacles before the people who are looked to as the saviours of the system, who are going to make the service profitable in the future? These obstacles have been placed in the <Col N="1115" /> way of the people who have carried out these services honourably since before the foundation of this State.</P>
    <P>There are several other sections to which I must refer.  The Bill has provision for worker representation on the boards. Apparently, in accordance with the Bill passed here a few years ago, there will be representatives of the trade union members employed in the services on the boards.  However, section 15 provides that the chairman and other directors shall be appointed and may be removed from office by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Does that mean that the workers' representatives on the boards can be removed by the Minister?  If that is not what is meant, why is it not made clear in the Bill?  Let us hope the Minister will explain what it means and that if it means what I have been saying that he will amend the section to make that clear.</P>
    <P>The boards will have power to borrow, and the aggregate at any one time shall not exceed £58.5 million.  How was this figure arrived at?  Was research done into the potential needs of the companies so that the operations would be viable?  We are entitled to be told why and how this sum for aggregate borrowing was arrived at.  Will that borrowing be from the private or the public sector?  I am sure the borrowings will be guaranteed by the Government, but why could the State itself not borrow and provide the finance for the companies to enable them to operate viably?  Will the companies be able to borrow privately?  Why is it necessary to appoint two boards?</P>
    <P>Recently Deputy Fitzpatrick, who was a junior Minister in that Department, said the Post Office services had been grossly under-capitalised.  In view of that, will this amount of money be enough?  If we are to pass this Bill we must be told if this figure for aggregate borrowing has been pulled from the sky or if there is some basis for it.  The Bill sets out that the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, may make available to the companies a sum not exceeding £50 million to finance capital works.  Has that figure been pulled from the sky?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> We all know there is an urgent need for modernisation of the Post Office services and therefore that there is a need for capital.  I am only an amateur and therefore I seek information about the reason for this figure in the Bill.  If this kind of money has become suddenly available now, why could it not be made available directly from the Government? If successive Governments since the foundation of the State had capitalised these services properly there would not be need for this Bill now because it has become necessary only to make up for lack of Government funds earlier.  We are now to set up two boards and say to them, &ldquo;Run these services on an economic basis.  We will give you borrowing powers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have my doubts, as I said earlier, if these sums will be sufficient to put these services into a viable state.  It is only lately that we have heard about limits to Government borrowing.  There is plenty of money available from borrowing for wild cat schemes and even for day to day administration but apparently the Government were not prepared to borrow to capitalise properly, to improve and to re-equip these services.</P>
    <P>Section 24 (2) refers to the transfer of staff from the Department to the companies. It states that a member of the staff of the Department transferred on the vesting day to the companies shall not receive a lesser scale of pay or be subject to less beneficial conditions of service than the scale of pay and the conditions of service to which he was subject immediately before the vesting.  I do not think that is fully satisfactory because no matter how it is to be operated, those people are being downgraded in the sense that a huge area of promotion opportunities is being denied to them.  People in the Post Office service, down to the most junior postman, are entitled to look forward to promotion within any part of the civil service.  I know people who started as postmen and now are HEOs in other Departments.  Such promotion opportunities will not be available to them.  The Bill states that their pay and conditions will not be less, but there is no provision for compensation, and I do not think <Col N="1117" /> those staffs to be transferred will agree to such conditions.  The Minister has no such agreement even though a Bill is being processed in this House.  The White paper has been out long enough and investigations have been carried out but no real effort has been made to get the support of the people in the service.  No real case has been made to them as to why all this is necessary.</P>
    <P>I read carefully through the Minister's speech, which was a very lengthy document and he has not convinced me that there is any real necessity for this transfer. The Minister has put the cart before the horse in introducing the Bill in this House.  He is pressing forward and wants it dealt with in the shortest possible time. He is saying time is scarce and that there was a hurry about this Bill, that it would be on today and tomorrow and that the Minister hopes to dispose of the Second Stage of this Bill tomorrow and then go on to Committee Stage.  But from what I hear from various interested parties no real effort has been made to negotiate with the people who number half the direct employees of this Government. We have a responsibility to these people. How can we expect proper labour relations between people outside when we will not give a proper example ourselves? I could go through each section but I have no wish to delay the House any further. We have now spent over an hour on this Bill.  I could spend three more hours and still find no justification for the Government being so anxious at this time to push this Bill through when they have not consulted with the people involved.  I could understand it if there were nine or ten people involved who could easily be consulted. But here we are dealing with 28,000 people, half the civil service, and no real negotiations have gone on and no effort has been made to find out how these people really feel about this Bill. The people in the postal service are very worried about what is happening in regard to their future.  They are worried because they do not know exactly what is happening.  We got white papers and there were submissions made.  Some accepted the idea.  I understand from what the Minister said that there was only <Col N="1118" /> one objection but that objection came from a union that represents a large proportion of the people the Minister is going to have to deal with.  These are the people whose rights are affected.</P>
    <P>I oppose this Bill on principle because I think it is wrong for a Government Department to shun their responsibilities. It has been the responsibility of a Government Department since the foundation of this State.  We failed to develop that service as it should have been developed. Here I want to pay tribute to the people who work within that service. With the financial restrictions and the red tape imposed on them by several administrations, they have provided a service of which they can be proud and of which I am certainly proud.  Before the Minister proceeds any further with this Bill he should go out and negotiate and get the feeling of the people up and down the country.  These people are worried to death about where they will stand as a result of this Bill, how they will be compensated, whether they will have the opportunity to which they are entitled to opt to stay within the civil service structure and move elsewhere in that structure, and about whether they will have any say in their future.  They are worried that they are just being hived off and will not have any guarantees as to how their future pay negotiations will be carried on, and about whether they will be comparable with the civil service or will have to go out into the open market to negotiate. These are very serious matters.</P>
    <P>If rights are taken away from people, rights of progress and rights of promotion which are peculiar to civil servants, then they must be compensated in some way for the loss of their privileges.  It is said that conditions will be better.  Trade unions will have to think of their future membership and how that will compare with their present membership in terms and so on.  I am warning the Minister that he has taken on a king-size job.  In the name of the people of Ireland he should consider, if he intends proceeding with this Bill, how he can ensure that the service is maintained even in remote rural areas.  Will some board decide that they will administer from a centre which may <Col N="1119" /> rule out many people who have served this country well, such as sub-post-mistresses and sub-postmasters?  Will daily deliveries of post be maintained in rural areas?  These are the things that people are worried about.  I have mentioned already the things that the staff are worried about.  I say to the Minister, in the name of God, walk warily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House is endeavouring to give effect to the proposals contained in the White Paper entitled &ldquo;Reorganisation of Postal Services and Telecommunications&rdquo; published by the Government in 1981.  The first thing we should ask ourselves is whether this dividing up of the functions of the old Department of Posts and Telegraphs is really necessary.  We have to ask ourselves will it improve the service which this Department gave this country in these two very vital areas which provided, in different ways, a social service and a business service.  We must ask ourselves is this the best way to go about matters at this time with the reognised need for the services which the old Department gave.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister's proposals are the correct ones, but there are certain reservations which I will come to soon. Good service was given by this Department over the years in relation to the postal service and in relation to the telephone and telecommunications service. It is true that it suffered from various financial constraints which meant that the service could not go forward at the necessary pace needed by the social and business community and fell further behind the services of neighbouring countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we start off on the right foot and that we recognise that the two services which were provided by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were too much to be carried out efficiently by one Department.  We are now setting up two State-sponsored bodies to provide these services &mdash; An Bord Poist and An Bord Telecom.  An Bord Poist will deal with the Post Office and interrelated matters and An Bord Telecom <Col N="1120" /> will provide a telecommunications service.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that these bodies give the service we want and a service which is comparable with that provided by our competitors.  If possible we might even provide a better service, but we must make a good start.  We are beginning a new chapter in the history of communications and we must provide the necessary postal and telecommunications services which many people are demanding. If businesses are to prosper we must have not only a proper economic climate but an up to date communications system which will encourage foreign investors to set up here.</P>
    <P>The object of this re-organisation is to give the public a better and more efficient service.  An Bord Poist will provide an efficient postal service at a reasonable price.  The present postal service is satisfactory, but there are exceptions.  Letters are delivered in Dublin two days after being posted in the country, while letters posted in Dublin can take up to one week to be delivered to the other side of the city.  Such a service must be improved because people are paying for a service and expect value for money.  People who have complaints must be able to make them to the board.</P>
    <P>As I said, An Bord Poist will be taking over the duties which up to now were performed by the Post Office &mdash; the delivery of mail and providing an adequate service and there are some elements of today's service which can be improved. They might consider Saturday deliveries, and even Sunday deliveries.  If one is providing a service, it should be provided for six days a week and possibly even seven days a week.</P>
    <P>I hope An Bord Telecom will have regard for all consumers, from the private individual to the businessman, whether large or small.  We all know from looking at the Dáil Order Paper that there is a very long list of people waiting for telephones, and that list is growing.  There are many people waiting for telephones who should have their phones installed at the earliest possible opportunity &mdash; the old, people living alone, doctors, small businesses and so on.  At the moment <Col N="1121" /> some small businesses are merely surviving because they do not have a telephone. We cannot expect to run a country and encourage people to set up businesses if we cannot provide a basic necessity &mdash; a telephone.  The scarcity of phones affects small businesses more than large businesses because a large firm will not take over a premises unless adequate telephone facilities are provided.  Even in the last days before An Bord Telecom take over, I hope the Minister will make every effort to ensure that these applications are given priority.</P>
    <P>One of the main problems at present is the high cost of a telephone installation, £200 or £300, and there is no intimation about when the telephone will be installed.  If one is providing a service one should not ask the consumer to pay such a large fee.  This is not the way to run a business.  We should encourage people to have telephones installed because we all hope this service will be able to pay its way.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem with regard to telephone kiosks and at times one wonders where to find one in working order. In Europe the kiosks are supplied with plenty of data to enable people to obtain numbers and other information.  I hope something on those lines can be done with regard to our telephone kiosks.  In conjunction with the Minister for Justice, the Minister might consider enforcing more severe penalties on people who vandalise telephone kiosks.  It gives a very bad impression to tourists and other visitors who may have to use the telephones in an emergency when they find the kiosks vandalised.  I hope the new board will put special emphasis on the provision of telephone kiosks and will fit them out with telephone books and adequate instructions on how to obtain numbers and other relevant data.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures in the Bill with some reservations.  As the previous speaker said, the Minister may have put the cart before the horse.  I hope he has not, but if he has I hope he gets the horse back between the shafts before the Bill becomes law.  I refer specifically to consultations with the employees of the Department.  On Second Stage the Minister <Col N="1122" /> spoke at considerable length but he skimmed over the consultations that had been or are being held.  I have spoken to people in my constituency who work in the Department at various levels.  They are concerned about the new proposals and they feel they have been left slightly in the dark.  They do not really know what is proposed or how they will be affected.  It is inevitable, having regard to this major changeover, that they will be affected to some degree.  It is important that we get the correct mixture from the start.  We should not rush this Bill through and say that problems can be ironed out later.  That would be a recipe for further industrial unrest.</P>
    <P>Employees in the Department are worried about possible job losses and also about aspects in the Bill in relation to the transfer of their personal files and to redundancies that may occur.  It is obvious that with the new services envisaged and with new technological advances several thousand jobs will be put in jeopardy &mdash; I refer in this instance to telephone operators.  The old coin boxes are being abolished and new automatic exchanges will be provided.  It is expected that fewer people will be needed to work the various types of apparatus.  It will not be quite as simple as transferring people from one part of the Department to another.</P>
    <P>Before the Bill goes through, I ask the Minister to give an assurance that the consultations will be finalised and to reassure the workers in relation to the various points they raised with him.  They are worried that in the light of new technological advances they will not be needed for certain functions they have been performing up to now.  I ask the Minister what he intends these people will do and to state where they will be put in the Department.  The Minister said the discussions were ongoing but from reports I have received and from my discussions with some of the workers it appears they have been kept in the dark. I hope before this Bill is passed the Minister will be able to tell us that the employees are satisfied with regard to the various issues raised.  Employees are concerned that their pension entitlements be <Col N="1123" /> maintained and that their pay and conditions should be as heretofore and probably improved.  I know one section of the Bill states that things will be the same as heretofore but it is not just a case of transferring exactly the same rights. Probably some of the workers have been at a disadvantage up to now and it is important that we improve their situation at this time.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister with regard to promotional opportunities that people in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs would have enjoyed heretofore.  I should like an assurance that such promotional opportunities will be maintained in the new bodies.  This is very important because it gives people an incentive to work and to provide a good service for the benefit of the country.  It is important that the services to be provided by the two companies should be welcomed by the people and that the workers should be pleased to provide such services which the country badly needs.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Users' Council has been maintained.  I accept that up to now if people had complaints regarding a parcel lost in delivery or a telephone in need of repair probably the Users' Council was the last organisation they got in touch with.  More likely they contacted the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in connection with the matter.  It is important that such complaints are monitored and that there is adequate access for people, the consumers, to make their complaints.  They should also be given proper replies.  That should be done even if the complaint relates to simple things such as the loss of a parcel, a telephone being out of order or a query in relation to a telephone bill.  It is important that a standard type of reply is not sent to those who make complaints or query certain matters.  The public, the consumers, should be given the service they are entitled to.  Like any other consumer service those genuine complaints should be properly attended to.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the new boards investigate the workings of the ESB, particularly in regard to the repairing of <Col N="1124" /> faulty lines.  The ESB act promptly when there is a power failure and the same speedy action should apply in regard to the telephone and postal services.  If consumers are satisfied they will avail of the services to a greater extent and, in that way, the boards will pay their way.  The new postal board should be in a position to compete favourably in regard to private couriers in the hope of regaining some of the business lost during the 1979 industrial dispute, a dispute which left a bad mark on the Department.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill with certain reservations. I am anxious that matters such as employees' rights are dealt with before the Bill passes through this House.  It would be disastrous if these companies commenced business with their workers uneasy.  The Minister, and his representatives, should listen to any proposals put forward by the workers.  They should assure the employees who will be transferred from the Department that their views will be taken into consideration.  It is important that these new boards mark a new chapter in the development of the postal and telecommunication services.</P>
    <P>Down the years sub-post offices have played an important part in urban and rural life and many of them have been run in conjunction with other businesses. It is important that those services are continued and that people do not have to travel miles to collect their pensions, obtain postal orders or stamps.  Those basic services should be maintained throughout the country.  I hope the Minister will indicate to the House in the course of his reply the progress that has been made in the discussions to date.  He should remember that many of the workers are concerned about many matters. I hope the Minister will give an undertaking that things will not be done in reverse order and that before these new bodies commence operations discussions will be held with the workers.  The Minister should ensure that the rights of the workers and the consumers are protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to discuss some aspects of the Bill which are deserving of <Col N="1125" /> comment.  I notice that the Minister in his complete speech introducing the Bill allowed himself to pat on the back that part of the administration over which he presides and which has been providing a postal and telephone service up to now. While admitting that the 1979 postal strike inflicted damage on the service &mdash; I suppose he means on the morale and the organisation of the service &mdash; the Minister claimed that the service was pretty well back to normal.  He admitted that it was not quite back to normal but felt it had made most of the distance back to its normal standard.  I believe he said that before the dispute there was regularity in the postal service, measured against the target which the Department recognised, of 90 per cent.  The Minister mentioned in that connection the target of having an overnight delivery in Dublin and I presume he means also in reasonably proximate parts of the country. The Minister said this had fallen back but with a great effort by the Department it got back to 84 per cent.  I do not wish to make little of the difficulties the Minister has had to face in answering to this House for the postal service and I am aware of the damage to morale, organisation and practices which a long stoppage such as that which occurred in 1979 can cause. However, I believe the Minister is living in dreamland if he imagines that the percentage proportion of efficiency and regularity borne by the existing postal service to the pre-dispute postal service is in the order of 84-90.  It is no such thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to get the proof of that the Minister need not go any further than this House.  Until that dispute the Order Paper of the House, and amendments proposed in the House &mdash; I can recall this during my time in the Seanad &mdash; up to 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. could be put in type by Cahills, put in the late post and be delivered to Deputies and Senators at their Dublin addresses by first delivery the following day.  That has gone by the board and there is no use in the Minister saying otherwise.  If it has not gone by the board how is it that Deputies and Senators living in the city, roughly one-third of the membership of both Houses, get their <Col N="1126" /> Order Papers in the pigeonhole in the House because it is no longer possible to guarantee with regularity their delivery the following morning?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed to hear that because, in that case, there is discrimination of a gross and abominable kind going on if it is possible that in <i>Ultima Thule</i>, whichever suburb the Minister has chosen to dignify with that description, post is received regularly overnight, whereas in the suburb I live in, 30 minutes from where I am now speaking, they can no longer trust themselves to deliver my Order Paper with the first post.  I have to wait until the morning to get it in here.  I believe that is the case with every Dublin Deputy and I am amazed to find there is this gross discrimination in favour of the Minister.  I meant to throw this in as a footnote to what I want to say and I do not want to make a large point about it. I am afraid the Minister has provoked me and egged me on with his references to the suburbs in which we live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to illustrate the absurdity of the claim that we are almost back to the 1979 level of efficiency.  I put a bundle of letters in the post here shortly after lunch yesterday as I do most days.  When I checked this morning, two of the recipients, one <Col N="1127" /> in Ballsbridge and the other in Dún Laoghaire, had not received their letters. It may be that Oireachtas post is treated as second class mail and I have strong reason to think that is so.  If so, it should not be treated in such a fashion and an Oireachtas letter addressed in handwriting rather than by addressograph or by some multi-process ought to get the same speed of delivery as an ordinary letter.  I assure the Minister that it does not get any such priority.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention another matter but not in a carping mood of personal complaint. The fact that I have to wait until I come here in the morning for an Order Paper instead of getting it at home is a very minor irritation in my life.  I would not waste the time of the House by making a fuss about it except that it demonstrates, in a silent but very eloquent way, how empty the claim is that the postal services are back to the 1979 level.</P>
    <P>Another demonstration of the relative slackness of the postal service and of their undependability can be seen in the sprouting on all sides of courier services. Why does the Minister think there is a thriving business called &ldquo;The Dublin Document Exchange&rdquo;?  Why are there similar little services all over the city?  If it was possible to get one's letter delivered at a 12-hour interval and that you could rely on it for a 26 pence stamp, why is it possible for people to start businesses &mdash; and more power to them &mdash; out of providing something which the Minister is supposed to have a statutory monopoly to supply but is unable to?  I do not say it is because of malice or incompetence at official, his own or political level. It may be the result of a complex of factors, of which industrial difficulty is only one.  We are entitled to be told the naked truth on these matters and I do not accept that postal regularity here is virtually back to the same level as it was before the dispute.  My experience in all fields is that whenever something is working all right but then is seriously disrupted it never gets back to the same level again.</P>
    <P>I know the telephone service is a whipping-boy for everybody.  I suppose one ought not to take up the time of the <Col N="1128" /> House by making complaints or telling funny stories about it and I am not going to do that.  But if the Minister is under the impression, as I have heard Fianna Fáil speakers say in the last few weeks, that there is any marked improvement &mdash; except in one area which I must admit, the supply of telephones and the extension of the automatic system which undoubtedly has been going on apace &mdash; in the multitudinous minor irritations of using Irish telephones, he is under a grave misapprehension.  There is not an improvement.</P>
    <P>I am speaking from memory but I think it was a Deputy Ahern &mdash; I am sorry I do not know his first name &mdash; who said that when Deputy Reynolds was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs we made terrific strides, that everything went forward with great alacrity and that there was improvement upon improvement.  He said that when the Coalition Government got in we dropped back again but now, with Fianna Fáil back in power, it is full steam ahead again for the telephone service.  That is the kind of primitive, brontosaurus kind of politics that I would like to kill in this House.  You should not be able to say this sort of thing without the House telling you to grow up, that in the course of eight months, merely because your political opponents are in power, the posts and telephone services show a deterioration.  The Minister is too civilised to say such a foolish thing except in moments of excitement, to which he is no more immune than I am but he would not be capable of saying it in cold blood. He knows it is not the case and he knows also that, as far as Deputy Reynolds is concerned &mdash; I will not fall into the same brontosaurus trap as Deputy Ahern &mdash; the message that the telephone service here was under-capitalised only percolated through to Government level in the term of the national Coalition Government of 1973 to 1977.  It had percolated through to a Fianna Fáil Minister a couple of years before that, I think Deputy Gerry Collins was Minister at the time.</P>
    <P>I remember Dr. Cruise-O'Brien, when he was Minister, playing a very dirty trick, as it was painted by the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1129" /> Deputies, of taking out of his bag a long plaintive letter written by Deputy Collins in 1971 to the Minister for Finance of the day, warning him that unless massive funds were made available for the telephone service, we were going to find ourselves back at Somerville and Ross levels compared to the rest of Europe.  He said it would be the king of the tinker's level of service here if we did not get a massive injection of funds, but nothing happened. If I may blow the trumpet of my own friends for a couple of minutes, I shall resume my ecumenical habit after that, it only happened when the Coalition Government came to power and put more in four years into the telephone service than had previously been put into it in the 55 years since the foundation of the State.  I can see Deputy Harte nodding, I would not expect him to contradict me.  He knows that is the case and I am sure he will be saying it with much more force and conviction, authority and detail when he rises to speak.  That is the reality. That heavy investment programme was continued by Fianna Fáil when they got in 1977 and I do not begrudge them the credit for it.  I would not be so childish as to pretend it got any worse.  It did not get any worse under the short period of the second Coalition Government either, but it is still far behind European levels.</P>
    <P>Many of us live and die without ever requiring to make an STD call to Moscow or Hong Kong but the ordinary dialling service in the city of Dublin is fit to drive a man out of his mind.  You lift the telephone and you diall 789911, the number of this House, and you could get no tone three times in a row, not the engaged signal, not the out of order signal, not the service suspended or they have not paid their bill signal, but no tone at all.  That just does not happen in other countries. I said I would not make a meal out of the telephone service but I suddenly find I have done so.  I want to tell the Minister, in case his Department have any illusions, that with the exceptions I have conceded of the continuing level of installations and the trunk dialling system, if he thinks that the level of service at the ordinary domestic level is getting any better or the level of frequency with which <Col N="1130" /> people complain about delay in repairs to the system is getting better, he is deceiving himself.</P>
    <P>There are other things I should like to see in the telephone system here which I think is a stick-in-the-mud system.  I say that with regret and I should like the Minister to hear this: over the years, in and out of office I have had a very happy relationship with the staff of the secretary's office who have provided me with the most courteous, careful friendly and speedy service.  I have very often been able to help constituents &mdash; as they say, of whatever political persuation.  In parentheses, may I say that it is a curious tribute to say of a politician that he never discriminated, that he was willing to help somebody on the other side of the fence. So well he might be; it is the best of his play; if he can get that man to vote for him it is as good as two of his own.  With regret I have to say that I think the attitude of the Minister's Department by and large has been somewhat stick-in-the-mud when it comes to devising means of making the service more popular or getting the people to like it and use it more.</P>
    <P>Last year when Deputy Killilea was Minister of State I asked whether he would consider introducing a system whereby subscriber trunk dialling to the Continent on Saturdays and Sundays and off peak hours could be at a cheaper rate. This country does not spend its life dialling Munich or Montparnasse and I think the volume of traffic to Europe would be modest from here but the people who need it are inclined to be business people and it is a very heavy item to them.  Many are business people who do not mind working and whose second nature it is to work Saturdays and Sundays if need be and it would be a considerable asset to them to be able to use the telephone at weekends at a reduced rate in the manner which is customary in a very large part of the European Community.</P>
    <P>There is a reciprocal system in operation between the German Federal Republic and all its neighbours which means that it operates between Germany and Denmark &mdash; it stretches into the Eastern Block, Czechoslovakia; I am not sure about Eastern Germany but there <Col N="1131" /> are subsidised rates for that in any case &mdash; Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, France, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg. All these countries have reciprocal arrangements with Germany, so that we are talking of the large bulk of telephone consumers in the European Community, whereby telephone calls out of peak hours are made at a privileged rate and on Sundays I think at something like half rate.</P>
    <P>The suggestion I made here was made little of by Deputy Killilea but I believe it would relieve pressure on the trunk lines at peak hours and the cost to the State, taking into account the reduced exasperation of people who cannot avoid using the phone on weekdays, would be extremely small.  It is a typical reflection of the way we do business that we are very willing to cut all kinds of corners in order to treat this country and Britain as one.  I never tire of complaining about that.  We look over our shoulder to England for everything.  We have the same postal rate for posting to England as inside the country; the same telephone regulations, cheap rates and so on but when it is a question of going as far as Ostend, the curtains come down and the niggers begin there just as completely as they do for the English.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that I have spent far too long on this matter.  I believe that the Minister &mdash; not himself personally but the person a which he has the honour to carry &mdash; is under an official illusion if he supposes that the public are satisfied or within an ass's roar of being satisfied with the level of postal and telecommunication services: most certainly they are not. I am sorry to give voice to such an unworthy suspicion but I think the real reason behind the creation of these two boards &mdash; except for the &ldquo;Paddy&rdquo; reason that the English have two such boards, which I suspect is the most basic reason, God help us &mdash; apart from the fact that we still have to copy the English whatever they do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When did we invent something here, let alone a major structural administrative reform in which the English had not preceded us?  Let the Minister name one.  It is shaming and I should expect the Minister to be foremost in being ashamed about it.  We were long enough learning about other countries. We hardly know where they are.  It is enough to have An Bord Poist and An Bord Telecom so that Pat can traipse after them.</P>
      <P>The real reason next to that and the real reason they said in the Post Office that it might not be a bad idea to have these two boards, is that they would take the political heat off whoever is Minister for the bad service which the public are getting.  It will now be possible for the Minister to say or, possibly, the Ceann Comhairle to say in an expession which I get in my daily communications from his office: &ldquo;The question is out of order because the Minister has no responsibility to the Dáil for this matter.&rdquo; Certainly, when the postal service is under an Bord Poist and when telephone, telex and so on are under An Bord Telecom the Minister will be able to decline all responsibility. He will not have to answer questions about it any more than as Minister for Transport he will have to answer questions about why it is that four No. 7 buses arrive at a bus stop within three minutes and that another 40 minutes can go by before another one is seen.  He will be able to dismiss questions in the House about the abominable working of these services in the same way as the Minister for Transport cannot be called on to answer here for the condition of CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the real reason, apart from the fact that we have to stay near the English &mdash; it could be dangerous to depart in any way from the pattern which the English have laid down, keen though we seem to have been for 800 years, if I understand my mythology correctly, to get clear of <Col N="1133" /> them and do things our own way.  That fine enthusiasm evaporated quickly; it lasted about ten years while William Cosgrave was in power and that was the end of it.  In fairness I must say, I think it extended into the first few years of Mr. de Valera's regime also, but for the last 25 or 30 years very little of it was seen. Any innovation in this State was done in the first 15 or 16 years or was not done at all, any independent innovation that was worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I hope we shall not find that the establishment of these two boards will make the cost of the service worse instead of better.  Perhaps the Minister is not aware of the degree to which the people have to carry this taxation on their backs.  Of course it is a form of taxation because one is as much dependent in the late 20th century on posts and telegraphs as one is on every public service.  One cannot do without it and so a telephone or postal charge is as much a form of taxation as income tax or VAT.  It is no use telling somebody not to use the postal service or telephone.  People must use them.  Only hermits or members of enclosed orders, of which there are fewer and fewer and they are becoming less and less enclosed, are in the situation of not being dependent on these services.  People are dependent on them and the charge for them is as much a form of taxation as VAT.</P>
    <P>The Minister may again be looking over his shoulder no further than England and I suspect &mdash; I do not mean Deputy Wilson, who I know is a man of individuality and character who is not so base as to be this in his own right, but the ministerial persona, a sort of man in the iron mask, the man being switched out through a kind of zip in the back with every change of Government.  Therefore the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may not be aware of the gross disparity which exists between the level of these charges here and those that obtain in most of Continental Europe.  When I was a student in Germany as long ago as 1954 the cost of a local telephone call was 20 pfennigs.  In those days, because the German mark was worth less than it is now, 20 pfennigs was worth about four old pence.  It was a somewhat dearer local <Col N="1134" /> call than the Irish one which in those days was 2d.  The cost of a local telephone call in Germany today, 27 or 28 years later, is still 20 pfennigs.  You can still ring up and talk your head off to somebody in the same city or postal district for the same 20 pfennigs, the same two coins which you could have put as a lucky charm in your wallet.  When I qualified in 1956 I could have put 20 pfennigs in my pocket, come back 28 years later and put them into the same telephone and I would have got the same service for them.</P>
    <P>What has happened here?  The 2d have gone by the board.  We now have new pence honoured with the dignity of designs personally approved by the present Taoiseach without competition or consultation with man, woman or child, let alone anyone who knew anything about it.  Those 2d amounted to less than 1p.  The cost of a local telephone call now is 10p, two shillings in old money or 24d. In other words the cost of a local telephone call here in the span of time which I am talking about 28 years, has risen 12 times, that is when you can find a public telephone that works, that has not been vandalised, or, having been vandalised because Ireland has no monopoly of vandalism, has been repaired.</P>
    <P>If I may use the same comparison, I would like to recall that when I first went to Germany as a student in 1954 I could write a letter to my mother at home for 40 pfennigs.  In other words, that was twice the cost of a local telephone call or about 8d. in those days.  The cost of a letter in the other direction, from Ireland to the Continent, was 5d.  What is the situation now?  In Germany the cost of a letter to elsewhere in Europe has advanced from 40 pfennigs in 1954 to about 70 pfennigs in 1982.  I am not absolutely certain of that and it could be 80 pfennigs, but I believe it is 70.  What has happened here?  If I write to someone in Germany from here I am not paying 5d any longer.  I am not even paying 5p.  I am paying 29p.  How about that for an increase?  That is damn nearly 6s in the old money.  It is not far off half of the week's pocket money that I got when I was a student, and that is the cost of <Col N="1135" /> posting one letter.  I could multiply these examples in other European countries, not with the same accuracy or recollection naturally, but I want the Minister to understand that it is not simply a question of people who do not do very much writing of letters, of some old lady or gentleman who neither gets nor sends very much post.  It affects people in business who are attempting to run their lives in dependence on a postal or telephone service.  It is extremely expensive and unless An Bord Telecom can provide a cheaper service they will avoid giving us a great deal of the benefit that they might give.</P>
    <P>I must apologise to the House for going on so long on these two topics, the quality and the cost of these two services.  I have dined out on them to some extent and I did not mean to do so.  I will do penance for that by being quick in the rest of the points I want to make.  The Minister proposes in section 61 to confer immunity from liability on An Post.  We can discuss this in greater detail on Committee Stage, but I ask the Minister if he has got the Attorney General's Office to consider if in this country immunity from suit can be conferred legally on anybody and whether it is possible to discriminate between citizens or between citizens and the Administration in such a way as to make one sort of person immune from being sued for an act which would be actionable if committed by somebody else.  The section relates to An Bord Poist and reads:</P>
    <P>(1) Subject to <i>subsection (3)</i>, the company shall be immune from all liability in respect of any loss, damage or injury suffered by any person by reason of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) failure, neglect or delay in providing, operating or maintaining a postal service,</P>
    <P>There may be a mistake, an accident and nobody is making any fuss about that, but suppose there is widespread neglect, carelessness, indolence, indifference in the postal service and people are damaged in their business as a result.  It is to <Col N="1136" /> avoid that very thing that we find the courier services, document exchange and so on springing up all around us.  Why should this board be exempt from a suit? Why should they be feather-bedded, cushioned against their own neglect by such a provision?</P>
    <P>My memory is nearly as bad as that of former Deputy Lynch.  I am never entirely sure when I am talking about something that happened a few months or some years ago that I am recollecting it accurately and very often I make serious mistakes in the way that he did although never about anything quite so serious, but I feel for him because I know what it is to have a bad memory.  I will not swear to this, but when we were in government six months ago I too had a <i>persona</i>, a kind of man in the iron mask outfit.  I climbed into it after Deputy O'Malley left it and I restored it to him in good shape when I left by decree of the sovereign people.  At any rate, the Department over which I presided felt &mdash; and I agreed with them &mdash; that there was no justification for exempting An Bord Poist from having actions taken against them for neglect and if my recollection is correct I do not quite know why this provision is back here again.  There were one or two other provisions on which I will not waste the House's time now of which the same could be said in which at my instance objectionable provisions were removed but I suppose the absence of a Fine Gael Minister allowed the people to feel that they could be safely reinstated in the Bill before it reached the Dáil.  Such an immunity may not be constitutional.  I recognise that the Constitution, in Article 40, permits discrimination to take place where people's social function differs.  Of course, there is a clear distinction between a State board with a public task to perform on the one hand and an individual on the other, but is the difference one in respect of which it can be said there is any material element justifying this discrimination? I cannot see that there is.  The Minister will do himself a service by asking the Attorney General to advise him about this and any other similar provision <Col N="1137" /> which there may be in regard to An Bord Telecom.</P>
    <P>Section 63 has a provision about the inviolability of mail.  I have nothing to say about that.  Naturally I agree that mail should be inviolable except under the familiar conditions relating to security, but could the Minister find out, even as a matter of reference or information for himself and his Department, whether there is a legal view as to who owns a letter or postal packet &mdash; a grand Victorian name for what you and I would call a letter &mdash; when it is in transit?  That is a serious legal question and I spent some hours vainly trying to get the answer during the limited postal dispute affecting the Blackrock delivery area when I was consulted by people who were desperate because their remittances, pension payments or some money they expected, a postal order perhaps, were, they knew, locked up in Blackrock Post Office and they could not get at them.  They had no money and were destitute until the expected money arrived.  Luckily the dispute ended before it came to a final point, but it was a serious question, leaving aside the sacredness of industrial disputes, as to whether it would be possible or advisable to sue the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in respect of withholding or the physical detention or possession of an item which did not belong to him. After all, the Minister is the carrier and the person in possession of the letter in transit.  If it happens to be in the bowels of the Blacrock post office at a time when the industrial curtains come down in the course of a dispute, the Minister is still the possessor.  I presume he does not own it.  Who owns it?  Is it the sender or the recipient?  If it is either of them, one or the other must be entitled to recapture the letter from him.  If not, why not?  That is a point my own legal expertise was not able to surmount in the time available to me.  But it would be well worth the Minister's while, and it would be in the public interest, if he was to inquire about that and find out what his legal situation is where he finds himself involuntarily in control of a postal packet which is inaccessible and incapable of delivery because of an industrial dispute.  It may <Col N="1138" /> well be that the High Court would pay no attention to an industrial dispute and would simply say: &ldquo;John Wilson, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, hand out that letter this minute and no more old talk out of you about industrial disputes&rdquo;. I hope there is enough freedom and law in the country that there would be that effect, particularly in the situation where an old widow or a remittance man is left destitute because a money order or draft which is destined for him cannot be got at as it is in the bowels of a strike-bound post office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave mentioned sub-post offices and paid tribute to the services they have provided.  I support him in that and praise the Minister for taking the trouble to say something to the same effect in his speech.  The State would suffer a great loss if it sacrificed the unique network of potential public facility which the sub-post offices represent. I am not putting in a plug for them or for the people who work in them or whose business is associated with them.  In this immense network of post offices the State has a means of communicating with the people and a means of providing facilities for them which is established and understood and used for a range of purposes which have nothing to do with the strict postal service.</P>
    <P>I can imagine many situations, even of national emergency, where it might be necessary to expand the range of services provided by the post offices.  In the seventies we had a series of incredible bank strikes.  The last one in 1976 or 1977 lasted for six months or more.  It was a mammoth strike and business was paralysed. People, as Deputy Colley used to say, wrote their own credit because they were not within reach of their bank manager and there were IOUs flying around.  Bank notes were such that one could almost see the cultures of vermin growing on them.  The country was in a situation of severe commercial handicap.  I repeatedly questioned Deputy Colley when the strike was over about what contingency plans he had for providing for a further bank strike.  The State, with all due respect to the sancity of industrial dispute, must have emergency plans up its <Col N="1139" /> sleeve for dealing with a protracted bank dispute.  What would Deputy Colley have done if the banks had never re-opened? Did he ever think about that?  Surely there must be contingency plans, whether in the Department of Defence in Parkgate Street or elsewhere, for an endless bank strike.  My suggestion is that if such plans were drawn up they could be based on the post office and sub-post office structure.  I am not suggesting that one can turn a country sweet shop, a Ballyscullion operation, into something which is capable of handling a large cash flow overnight.  However, some thought ought to be given to the possibility of saving the economy and commercial life of the country in the event of a prolonged bank strike by having a contingency system which will depend on and be operated by the sub-post office network.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the suspect nature of the State monopoly in the postal and telephone service which the Minister proposes to confer on these two bodies. These monopolies are constitutionally defensible only as long as they serve the public interests.  Once the time comes when, because one or other falls victim to industrial unrest or for some other reason, it fails to provide a reasonable service the constitutional basis for the monopoly drops away into the sea.  When that moment comes there will be a free for all situation just as free as in the selling of sweets or ice cream so far as the provision of telephone, telegraph, postal or broadcasting systems are concerned. The Minister or his predecessors have never taken that point of view as seriously as they ought, not because it is mine but because it is staring everybody in the face.  There is no reason why there should be a postal or a telephone monopoly unless it serves the public interests.  When it ceases to do that, the legal basis for having a monopoly disappears.  When that happens there must be a free for all. I do not think the Department or any Minister under any administration ever really faced up to that situation and asked themselves how they would deal with it <Col N="1140" /> or, less frequently asked, how the interest of the people require that it be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important debate.  It is perhaps one of the most important Bills which has come before the Dáil for a long time.  What the Bill seeks to do is create a major change in the administration of a very big sector of the public service.</P>
      <P>One of the major differences between the administration of a public service by a State body and by a public Department is answerability to this House.  It is on matters relating to the House and to the security of the telephone system that I wish to refer in this debate.  I intervene to raise a very serious matter affecting the security of telephone conversations where what are knows as PABX facilities exist, technically described as an overall capacity.  This overall capacity enables a person whose phone is so equipped to interrupt a conversation between other people on the PABX system.  It can be used for such things as telephone conference facilities.  However, this capacity can, in some systems, be put to another use.  It can be employed to overhear conversations on a PABX system without the persons engaged in the conversation being aware of such overhearing.  The existence of this overhearing capacity, which people using the PABX system are not aware of, is an alarming feature and one which, in the public interest, must be brought under legal control.  On behalf of my party, I am seeking an assurance from the Minister in this debate that he will introduce the necessary amendments to the Bill to achieve this control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just how alarming and dangerous is the present, uncontrolled, situation is evident from what happened here in the Houses of the Oireachtas in 1980 and 1981 when a system was installed which provided, in a number of offices, a capacity to overhear conversations on any Leinster House extension without even lifting a receiver.  First of all, I shall describe how the situation came to light in the closing weeks of our Government. Then I shall explain, to the extent the inquiries made up to the time the Government changed, enable me to do <Col N="1141" /> so, how the situation came about because this will demonstrate how important it is that legislation be introduced to control this potention abuse.</P>
    <P>In early January of this year, shortly before the budget, it was suggested to me, as Minister for Justice, by an informant that the Leinster House telephone system was insecure and that calls between any two extensions on that exchange, or between any extension of that exchange and any outside number, could be monitored by any of a small group of people who had particular facilities. My informant demonstrated to me how this was done and showed me that, by using what is known as an SL 1 console with this special facility, it was easy to listen to telephone conversations of a very confidential nature unknown to those carrying on the conversation and without even lifting a receiver.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, an SL1 console is a very modern electronic machine with a surveillance capacity inbuilt, known as an override facility.  My informant advised me that SL1 consoles had been especially provided in 1980 to a small group of people in the Taoiseach's office in Leinster House and in Government Buildings and subsequently in the offices of the Minister for Finance in Government Buildings, all on the Leinster House exchange.  In mid-January 1982 some days after this was brought to my attention, in the presence of the Taoiseach, the Secretaries of both the Departments of Justice and Posts and Telegraphs, the Deputy Secretary to the Government and my own Private Secretary, a similar test was conducted on the Taoiseach's own Leinster House extension, itself having the surveillance capacity. To the shock of all present, the Taoiseach's own telephone conversations could be listened to unobserved from other telephones fitted with the surveillance system.</P>
      <P>It became immediately clear to us all that every Leinster House extension was similarly exposed, including those of all Ministers, Deputies, Senators, journalists and Government employees having Leinster House extensions.  It was equally clear that all communication with the Leinster House system from any outside telephone was similarly vulnerable and had been for almost two years.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Justice I was alarmed to find that certain of my own conversations within Leinster House, or to Leinster House from outside, even with the Taoiseach, could have been listened to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was first informed of this the Taoiseach was not in Ireland.  I asked for secret consultation between the Secretary <Col N="1144" /> of my Department the Secretary of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and for an immediate report on how this insecure system had been installed in Leinster House, and what were the full ramifications.</P>
    <P>A preliminary report was ready for my presentation to the Taoiseach on his return.  The Taoiseach was alarmed by the information disclosed to him in the report.  He was especially concerned to learn that his own telephones both in Leinster House and Government Buildings had this overhearing or surveillance capacity.</P>
    <P>We had it confirmed that the problem was as big as we had thought; that 8 SL1 consoles &mdash; 7 with the surveillance facility &mdash; had been installed in early January 1980 at the request of the then Taoiseach in his offices.  This request was made orally by him to officials of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs on 16 December 1979 at a meeting in his office. We also learned that a further 8 SL1 consoles &mdash; all with the surveillance facility &mdash; were installed in the offices of the Minister for Finance at Government Buildings in March 1980.</P>
    <P>In both instances, it was found that the work had taken place and the system had been in operation months before the written orders for the equipment were made. Much documentation was either missing or appeared never to have existed.</P>
    <P>We also found that 2 SL1 consoles &mdash; both with the surveillance capacity &mdash; were installed immediately after the change of Government in July 1981 in the Leinster House offices of the Leader of Fianna Fáil at his request.  This installation was apparently approved by the new Taoiseach who was unaware of the significance of the equipment at that time. We found it difficult to get full and exact details of the separate installations in the time then available, because of gaps in the back-up documentation and because the engineer responsible for the installation of the consoles had left the employment of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, having received a report on this matter, reported to the Cabinet and, after informing the Ceann <Col N="1145" /> Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, had the surveillance capacity immediately removed from all extensions known to have it, and immediately informed the then Leader of the Opposition of the situation.  This process was completed by 26 January 1982.  As a general election unexpectedly arose the next day, followed by the Dublin-West by-election soon afterwards, there was no appropriate opportunity up to now to raise this matter in the House in a non-electoral context.  It must now be raised on this Bill so that the necessary safeguards can be incorporated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Other questions arising from this affair relating to the integrity of communications within and to and from the Houses of the Oireachtas I believe must be dealt with by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  These questions include:</P>
    <P>(1)  How such a capacity came to be installed in such a sensitive security area and how no notice of this feature of the system was given to the Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>
    <P>(2)  How such a system was extended during its time of operation from January 1980 to January 1982?</P>
    <P>(3)  How the administration of telephone ordering in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was so incomplete as to make full investigation difficult?</P>
    <P>(4)  How and why services can be provided up to six months before they are ordered in writing?</P>
    <P>I am sure there will be many more questions asked.  The timetable of events was as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  December 1979.  Verbal instructions from the then Taoiseach for special telephone facilities.</P>
    <P>(2)  Early January 1980.  Temporary system introduced.</P>
    <P>(3)  15 January 1980.  Eight SL1's, seven of which had activated surveillance capacity, installed in the Taoiseach's office.</P>
    <P>(4)  21 March 1980.  Order placed for <Col N="1146" /> temporary equipment installed in early January 1980.</P>
    <P>(5)  March 1980.  Eight SL1's, all with activated surveillance capacity, installed in the office of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>(6)  14 July 1980.  Order issued for 10 SL1's to cover Taoiseach's permanent installation in late January previous.</P>
    <P>Eight were installed as mentioned.</P>
    <P>(7)  30 October 1980.  Order issued for nine SL1's to cover the Minister for Finance's installation in March 1980.</P>
    <P>Eight were installed as mentioned before.</P>
    <P>(8)  July 1981.  Two SL1's, both with activated surveillance capacity, installed in Fianna Fáil Leader's room in Leinster House.</P>
    <P>(9)  January 1982.  Minister for Justice advised of security problem by informant.</P>
    <P>(10)  January 1982.  Government order investigation into, and subsequently termination of, this facility on all phones in Leinster House.</P>
    <P>(11)  5 March 1982.  Formal report submitted by investigating committee.</P>
    <P>The dangers of such a faulty telephone installation are almost endless.  In the terms of reference of the high level investigating committee set up by the Coalition Government we included a provision that all records and documentation should be kept intact for further investigation.</P>
    <P>I now formally suggest that the whole question of past, present and future telephonic arrangements for Leinster House be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges by a suitable motion of both Houses and with appropriate terms of reference and powers.  It is possible that the discovery in Leinster House would also have implications for PABX systems elsewhere.  That is why the statement I have made today is particularly relevant to the present Bill and especially to my comments at the outset. I ask the Minister, when replying to the Second Stage, to undertake to include in <Col N="1147" /> the Bill the necessary amendments to legislate against such facilities in PABX systems and to tell us if since 26 January 1982 any overhearing or surveillance capacity has been reactivated in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be directed at total opposition to this Bill. The Bill proposes to transfer from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to two semi-State bodies the very important services of posts, telegraphs, telecommunications and other services which have a bearing on every section of the population.  The major contributions up to this in relation to this Bill pinpoint the defects of our existing system which are many and varied.  Our people have at all times aspired to substantially better telephone, telex and postal services.  The criticisms levelled by the public and private sectors have been considerable in relation to the Ministers responsible for the Department and the employees in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party's opinion is that while those criticisms are justified, because of the defective system, they have been directed at the wrong Department because the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are entirely governed by the limited finance provided by the Department of Finance for capital and ongoing expenditure in the Department.  The main point in our opposition is that a completely inadequate financial provision was made to meet the requirements of the public and private sectors in the postal and telecommunications services.  Very substantial progress has been made and it has been contended that telephones will shortly be available on demand.  It is an inopportune time to attempt this denationalisation to a semi-State body of such important services.  As well as being important to the community those services are also very important to about 27,000 employees, who have been recruited and trained within a system which they have accepted and grown very used to.  These employees feel deep concern and frustration about their future.  They have given in the past, are giving and in the future would give <Col N="1148" /> absolute loyalty and dedication of service.  Unfortunately, the present legislation and the discussion between their union representatives and officials of the Department leave them in great doubt. This factor will have to be weighed heavily by the Minister before these people are transferred from their long-standing traditional area of employment.</P>
    <P>There is particular concern among postmasters and postmistresses, especially in the rural areas.  With the operation of a semi-State body removed from the political responsibility of the Minister and the Department they fear that that body could, for economic or other reasons, severely curtail or possibly discontinue services in some or many areas. They have in view the decisions of that other semi-State body, CIE, bringing about the closing of railway stations and the disuse of great lengths of railway line.</P>
    <P>Very many part-time postmen who have served us well in the west and in other areas are also very concerned and worried.  The aim and ambition of everybody has been, is and will be the improvement of the services; but this restructuring under two semi-State bodies may not achieve the desired results.  At present there are 200 or 300 unresolved matters at issue between the union concerned and the Department.  Anyone with any knowledge of industrial relations will realise that the resolution of these matters before the introduction of a new negotiating machine is of the utmost importance if we are to avoid industrial strife. Matters under review or concerning the current structural decision must be resolved now, because they will not be satisfactorily resolved in the boardrooms of the new semi-State bodies.  Before a final attempt is made to pass this legislation, I strongly urge the Minister to see that all outstanding issues regarding conditions of employment partly negotiated and left unresolved are attended to before other legislative proposals are put forward.</P>
    <P>Another major issue is that of telephonists. It is frequently and strongly contended that this restructuring will result in very substantial redundancies. There is also the question of the opportunities <Col N="1149" /> for promotion which have for so long existed, which enabled the employees within the Department of Posts and Telegraphs with the necessary abilities and the aspirations to seek higher and more remunerative posts in other Departments.  Will this new legislation bring those opportunities to an end?  That would be a serious setback which would require further and continuing negotiations.</P>
    <P>Many of the sections of the Bill are still in the air in so far as the employees and the trade union are concerned.  There is the decision that the elected representatives of the board will not meet for a full 12 months after the enactment of the legislation.</P>

      <P>Here again, there is a deep worry that decisions of the most vital importance to the interests, not only of the services but of the employees, could be taken prior to the sitting of the elected representatives of the employees on the board.</P>
      <P>The service requires improvements and criticisms were made.  We have heard criticism during the debate in this House. We have heard that many telephone kiosks are in an unworkable condition. The people blamed are the Minister and the officials and staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, but this is caused by vandalism and the Minister and the Department officials should not come under attack.  I would advise the Minister to hasten slowly with this legislation. Everyone suffered immensely during the industrial troubles of 1979 in the Department.  With such a nervous situation for employees going in under new management, facing new directives and new conditions of employment, we could be facing further industrial problems, which nobody wants and which the country certainly does not.  All outstanding matters must be negotiated, teased out and satisfactorily resolved, otherwise trouble will ensure, not only for the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs but for the new boards if this legislation is passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> Represending a party which advocates modernisation and, indeed, expansion in the public sector, I would like to be able to say quite frankly that our party welcome this Bill as a recognition by the Government of the type of economic and management strategy which Ireland needs in the eighties.  Unfortunately, the Bill as proposed by the Minister and the Government is, as always when it comes to semi-State bodies, the usual hamfisted and half-hearted effort to cope with the problems which the revolution in electronic technology has brought to our communications system.</P>
      <P>Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the sections of the new Bill dealing with the allocation of finance to the proposed two new companies.  The total amount of working capital provided under section 29 of the Bill is a mere £8.5 million for the postal company and £130 million for the telecommunications body. Yet the State tacitly admits how woefully inadequate these amounts are in section 26 of the Bill, where it is stated clearly that the Minister will be authorised to guarantee loans totalling another £8.5 million for An Bord Poist and a staggering £1,050 million for An Bord Telecom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Out of the money already allocated to the Telecom sector, plus the proposed amount, nowhere is there any mention of setting money aside for the retraining of the telephone operators where jobs will be at risk by the ongoing telephone development plan.  The magnitude of this problem can be seen in a report published by the National Board of Science and Technology &mdash;&ldquo;Micro-Electronics; the implications for Ireland&rdquo;.  This showed that the present five-year telephone development plan is expected to reduce the jobs of telephone operators from 5,600 to about 1,000.  We cannot stop technology: none of us should put a brake in the way of technology, and indeed in the society we are living in, anyone who stands in the way of technology will be rolled over.  However, 4,500 jobs will disappear, and the loss of 4,500 jobs is three times the number of staff employed in the Ferenka plant.  These operators have given loyal and dedicated service down <Col N="1151" /> through the years and worn out equipment in antiquated buildings.  On more than one occasion they had cause to take industrial action to highlight the fact that they were unable to give a proper service to the public owing to the state of the equipment.  The Workers' Party believe that a scheme of early retirement for those who wish to avail of it, plus retraining for operators in areas at the moment dominated by private enterprise, such as DAD Directory Services and other agency type services, should be a priority for the new Telecom Board.</P>
    <P>Even this understates the full disparity between the State's aspiration for the new bodies and its unwillingness to give them the financial resources to meet those aspiration, because section 25 of the Bill grants the new companies the right to raise a total of £8.5 million in loans with regard to An Bord Poist and £1,400 million in the case of An Bord Telecom.</P>
    <P>In other words, the State is admitting that it foresees these vital new State bodies having to borrow more than ten times as much finance on the private money market as the State itself is prepared to put up.  This is an invitation to insolvency on a colossal scale.  It will leave both new companies in permanent hock to the banks.  Because of the financial proposals in the Bill, it is certain these companies will be strangled at birth.  No one denies the serious state of public finances, but a little more imagination could have been applied to allow these bodies to generate their own sources of finance through the creation of a national giro system.</P>
    <P>Such a service is badly needed in the many isolated communities throughout Ireland where the commercial banks find it is not profitable to open branch offices. Indeed there are many urban areas, particularly in the more deprived regions, where banking services are not readily available because the commercial banks do not find them commercially viable.</P>
    <P>What is more, a network of post offices on which such a giro system could be based is already available.  No doubt, conservative minded politicians in the Dáil of the main parties will condemn my <Col N="1152" /> proposal as a threat to the private banking sector which controls all the important sources of investment in our economy.  They are right, but if Irish banking is efficient and is serving a real need, it has nothing to fear.  In that showpiece of modern capitalism, Japan, there is also a highly successful national giro run by the post office.  Today it is the biggest bank in the world with deposits totalling over £60 billion.</P>
    <P>Surely it makes more sense to allow the Irish people to invest in developing a modern State communications system directly than to allow it to fall into hock with the private banks.  At the end of the day the general public will have to foot the bill either through increased service charges or taxpayer subsidies &mdash; and they will also have to pay for the bankers' profit margins.</P>
    <P>My party intend to propose an amendment on Committee Stage to expand the functions allowed for in the Bill under section 12, to allow for the creation of a giro service and a full range of banking services, with no restrictions to be placed on the new service as to its expansion in either rural or urban areas.</P>
    <P>I have alluded already to the impact that the new organisation will have on staffing levels within the new bodies. Indeed the threat of job losses is only the most dramatic in a whole range of changes proposed in the new Bill unless it is amended.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is hard to understand why the Minister has made provision in the Bill under section 32 that elections for worker-directors shall not take place for 12 months after the vesting day for the new bodies.  By that time crucial decisions affecting all sorts of matters could have been taken.  The Bill is unclear as to whether Government nominees will be appointed to the boards prior to worker-directors being elected.  Worker-directors should be able to take part in the decision making process from the beginning, and my party would also argue that there should be greater trade union representation on the working committee at present in operation.</P>
    <P>Another unsatisfactory section from the staff point of view is section 42 which <Col N="1153" /> states that staff pay and conditions shall not be less beneficial than on vesting day of the new bodies.  There is understandable fear among postal workers concerning their security of tenure.  The latest circular from the Minister to the staff in relation to staff transferred to either company states that previous service in the civil service shall be reckonable for the purpose, but subject to any other exceptions or exclusions in the Holiday (Employees) Act, 1973 and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be aware that any reference to the Unfair Dismissals Act, and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, would be a worsening of conditions.  At the moment, PO employees do not come under these Acts and any attempt to force them into a situation where their unions would be forced to negotiate under these Acts would be a worsening of conditions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that there is nothing new in the Bill, in so far as what it contains was in the original Green Paper.  The Minister will be aware that the largest union in the Post Office, the POWU, gave a detailed submission on that Green Paper.  Yet, despite this, these objectionable paragraphs now appear in the Bill.  The Minister will agree that the amount of co-operation forthcoming from the largest union has been exceptional, yet, the union's reward for co-operation is an attempt by the Minister to railroad legislation through the Dáil, many aspects of which are totally unacceptable to the union concerned.  I intend to propose an amendment to the effect that the pay and conditions of staff in the new boards shall be no less favourable than they would have been if they had remained in the civil service.</P>
    <P>From section 43 of the Bill it appears as if the Government are trying to weaken workers' rights within the new body with regard to pensions.  While there is nothing wrong with subsections (1), (2) and (3) of the pensions section, why on earth did the Minister then include subsection (4), which effectively gives the management, in conjunction with the Minister the right unilaterally to <Col N="1154" /> alter staffs' pension rights?</P>
    <P>I believe that this clause would make much more sense if it was brought forward and taken as subsection (3).  Subsection (3) would then be taken afterwards. This would give an assurance to former Post and Telegraphs employees, as well as new employees, that their pension rates would keep pace with those of the civil service on the vesting day.  Will the Minister consider this proposal?  I would also like to know if he will replace the vesting day reference with a commitment, as in the pay and conditions section, to ensure ongoing comparability with civil service pay and conditions of employment to ensure that these constitute a floor below which conditions of employment in the new bodies will not fall.</P>
    <P>On the question of pensions there is one further point I would like to make, that is, that the burden of providing pensions to retired employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should not be a burden on the new boards.  Given the tremendous financial handicaps already imposed on them in this Bill it would be fatal to their future viability if they were also burdened with servicing this area.  The Minister should make it clear whether he expects the pension entitlements of existing retired employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to be serviced by the new semi-State boards, An Bord Poist and An Bord Telecom Éireann.  The Bill does not make this clear.</P>
    <P>Our party is also dissatisfied with section 47 which refers to the setting up of the interim board.  The largest union in the Post Office has no direct representation on An Bord Telecom Éireann and the general secretary of the POWU is on the postal board only in his capacity as staff panel representative.  We intended putting down amendments to this section to provide for direct representation by the POWU on both boards.  This can be done by increasing the figures set out in section 47 (3) from 10 to 13.  This is all the more urgent when one considers that the chief executive of the Telecom board, Mr. Tom Byrne, and the Chairman, Mr. Michael Smurfit, are anything but friends <Col N="1155" /> of the trade union movement.  If the Minister is really serious about appointing worker directors, why does he not start now and give proper representation, not through a staff representative or panel but through the unions involved in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, on the interim board?</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would also like to reflect on his present position in relation to section 46.  At the moment he is suggesting that the users committee should be paid for from the funds of the new bodies.  It hardly seems fair that the new organisation should pay for its own watchdog, and this is what the Minister is proposing in this section.  The new boards may have their own ideas as to whether or not they should have a watchdog. But it seems that only the staff are to be put under public scrutiny while the activities of senior management are to be protected from censure.  While it may be argued that a watchdog committee is or is not in the public interest, no one can deny that the present Department runs many services that are in the public interest. In the new Bill the Minister is authorised to direct the relevant body to continue carrying out those services.</P>
    <P>Surely the Bill should also provide some means by which the losses incurred can be recouped from the Government, particularly if the new organisations are not to be allowed to exploit potentially profitable areas like the national giro scheme.  Loss-making services should be financed by the Government regardless of how successful the companies are.  In that regard I must ask the Minister to reconsider his attitude to section 60 (3) (d) which allows for the establishment of private courier services.  Also under section 105 it seems that private firms are to be allowed to cash in on the undoubtedly attractive market that will develop for electronic mail.  Under section 60 (3) (d) the Minister intends to licence private couriers.  The present monopoly supposedly enjoyed by Post Office for the carrying of letters has been broken in recent years.</P>
    <P>It is a fact of life &mdash; and Deputy Kelly referred to it &mdash; that in recent years the <Col N="1156" /> present private courier companies operate in a black economy situation with cheap labour.  A number of these companies was investigated by the Revenue Commissioners recently and found guilty of tax evasion.  Their method of payment to their employees is absolutely scandalous. Young people of 16 to 18 years of age are paid a miserable basic wage, the balance of which is made up from the amount of collection and deliveries they perform.  Is it any wonder that these exploited youngsters can be seen daily weaving in and out of the traffic, travelling at dangerous speeds?  Likewise the parcel service is being creamed off by courier firms of a larger kind.  Needless to say, these companies are only interested in the lucrative markets.  All of this has happened while postal workers wait for the Government to fulfil the promise made by Deputy Albert Reynolds, the previous Fianna Fáil Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, that the Post Office would soon start up its own courier services.  That promise was made in 1980. To date, nothing has happened other than more empty promises.</P>
    <P>Nobody in the House can deny the need for a high speed delivery service throughout Ireland.  The priority of the Workers' Party is that these services will be operated by postal workers and not by exploited youngsters and multinationals. The Workers' Party will therefore look for the deletion of section 60 (3) (d) and a strengthening of the monoply for carrying mails with realistic fines and imprisonment for those who break it.  When one takes section 70 of the Act in conjunction with section 60 of the Act one can see the hyprocisy of the Government concerning the setting up of the new semi-State companies.  What company, public or private, is going to grant a licence to an individual to perform work which would be proper to the company? This is exactly what the Government are proposing.  Furthermore, if the company refuses to grant a licence to an individual to provide a postal service, the individual may appeal to the Minister and the Minister's decision on appeal under the section will be final.  Needless to say, one of the unwritten qualifications for a licence <Col N="1157" /> will be membership of Fianna Fáil.  Our party intends treating section 70 with the contempt it deserves and will seek to have it taken out altogether.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why postmen and drivers employed by the Department should not be involved in the security services, the delivering of money to banks and factories which is presently being done by private security firms who are afforded the use of the Army and the Garda at the taxpayers' expense.</P>
    <P>Another section of the Act which is causing great concern and which is topical in the newspapers is the present format for collecting television licence fees. Under section 73 (5) it is provided that the Minister may revoke an order under the provisions of this section.  The Workers' Party will be seeking the deletion of this subsection.  Postal workers do not need threats hanging over their heads to encourage them to catch evaders. What is needed is a proper and permanent inspectorate grade of Post Office clerk.  This would be a new grade with inspectors paid on a full-time basis to investigate the registration of television dealers under the 1972 Act.  Also, in view of the growing video market, their work could be extended to checking films on sale in video shops.  The chaos and shortage of finance which exists at present regarding the collection of licence fees is having a detrimental effect on RTE.  If the station had the revenue it is owed it would not be in the financial difficulties it is in at present.  There is an attitude among some of the unions in RTE that they are having financial difficulties because of the unwillingness or lack of interest of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in going out and chasing these licence fee evaders.  That is not true.  If there was a properly staffed section in the Post Office working on this on a full-time basis licence fee evasion could be reduced bringing in the revenue needed by RTE to transmit the type of programme being cut back at present.</P>
    <P>Too often in the past successive Governments have set up semi-State companies to carry out important and vital functions and then denied to them the opportunity to pay their way by <Col N="1158" /> engaging in the most profitable areas open to them.  They have had to share those profitable areas with private companies which can avail of the supplementary services provided at subsidised rates by their semi-State rivals in order to cream off the profits in the market place. By restricting the new bodies in their commercial activities, by leaving them under-financed and offering facilities to potential business rivals, the Government are leaving the new Bord Poist and An Bord Telecom Éireann in the same position as previous bodies such as CIE.</P>
    <P>As far as my party are concerned, I would like to put the Government on notice that, if they are not prepared to review the proposed legislation and give the new bodies a realistic chance of viability, we will fight them tooth and nail. We will be putting down various amendments to tighten up this legislation because the future viability of Ireland's publicly-owned telecommunications system is at stake.  We await with interest the Minister's response to our contribution and to the points raised by other Members about their fears not only about the employees but about the future of these new proposed bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning:</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin my contribution feeling somewhat shattered because I had no idea Deputy Mitchell was going to make such allegations.  I do not intend commenting on these but I hope they will be answered fully in this House.  The atmosphere they created leads one to feel that the tenth anniversary of Watergate may well have been very appropriately honoured here.  It is with this cloud hanging over us this evening that we consider this Bill which will fundamentally alter one of the most seemingly unchangeable institutions in our State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we gained our independence there were some changes &mdash; many of us feel there were not enough changes.  The new Post Office changed very little from what existed in the days prior to our independence.  The same people did the same kind of work in the same way as before independence &mdash; same methods, same people and usually the same offices. Even the GPO, the nerve centre of our <Col N="1159" /> postal service which had been destroyed in the 1916 Rising, was rebuilt and designed to reflect continuity rather than to reflect any radical change with what had gone before.</P>
    <P>Within the post service all the changes had been on the surface.  The most striking indication that there was a new regime was that the pillar boxes once royal red now became Free State green. We did not do anything so dramatic as to scrap these fine Victorian and Edwardian pillar boxes; in pragmatic style we simply repainted them.  It was a wise and prudent thing to do because most of them still survive today.  The new pillar boxes do not show up so well by comparison with these working monuments to the origins of our postal service which are still in efficient use today.  Down the years the fact that the name &ldquo;Victoria&rdquo;, &ldquo;Victoria Regina&rdquo; or &ldquo;Edward Rex&rdquo; were simply painted over in green on the pillar boxes did not deter even the most rabid Republicans from using a postal service which was firmly established in the affections and trust of the people as being efficient and above reproach.</P>
    <P>The painting of the pillar boxes was in one sense symbolic of how little had changed, but in 1922 there was very little reason for us to think of fundamental changes in our postal service.  We inherited from Britain a highly efficient and honest postal service which at that time was adequate for the needs of all individuals and those in commerce.  Reading accounts of that time one can only be nostalgic about the type of service which allowed same day delivery of a letter posted before noon in the same town or city, where overnight delivery was the norm rather than the exception.  We all share the frustrations so eloquently, if waspishly, articulated by Deputy Kelly earlier this evening about the growing deficiency especially in the letter service because the two day, if not four day, delivery has now become the norm for letters posted in Dublin to Dublin.</P>
    <P>The postal service we inherited has served us very well over the decades.  At all levels we had become accustomed to high levels of honesty and until recently <Col N="1160" /> we were accustomed to very high levels of public service from the Post Office, and that is what we got.  Unfortunately, the Post Office service has been let down by succesive Governments.  This was never more true than in the sixties.  In recent years it has become increasingly clear to anyone who watches the patterns of economic development here that the two biggest stumbling blocks to foreign investment apart from the violence in Northern Ireland and the damaging propaganda consequences that can have on potential investors have been the state of the postal service and our very bad road network.  These have been found completely inadequate and utterly incapable of dealing with the demands of a rapidly urbanising industrialised country.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy could tell from his own constituency horror stories of investment lost because the infrastructural services were not adequate.  We are used to talking about infrastucture, but in basic terms we mean roads, telephones, railways, drainage and so on.  These are the areas in which we did not invest during the days of heavy optimistic growth, the sixties. Many mistakes were made against the environment &mdash; understandably, trying to catch up on years of neglect.  We were going headlong, sometimes concentrating more on showy enterprises and not paying sufficient attention to environmental consequences, sometimes taking short cuts, cutting corners and neglecting the more fundamental parts of the infrastructure which were essential to later development.  In many cases we have been found wanting for that lack of investment.</P>
    <P>Deputies have cited their own horror stories about the state of our telephone system.  Dublin is bad enough, but I have great sympathy for Deputies from some of the more remote areas where making a phone call can involve 15 minutes or 30 minutes and results in frustration.  I often wonder at the patience of many Deputies who have to constantly phone their constituencies. I marvel at their forbearance and their ability to grapple with a system which makes effective communication and the transaction of business impossible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> Ironically this type of inefficiency can often be found side by side with a very commendable and admirable degree of sophistication.  I remember on one occasion being in a newsroom in this city where two journalists were trying to make telephone calls, one to Kampala and the other to Cork.  This was at a time when Idi Amin was unfortunately President of Uganda.  The journalist got through to Kampala to be told the President was in Entebbe.  He then got through to Entebbe to be told politely that President Amin was not interested in talking to a journalist from that newspaper. The point I am making is that twice he had been through to Uganda while the other journalist was still trying to get a reply from Ballyvourney, County Cork.</P>
    <P>In recent years this sophistication has been very marked and the degree of investment has been obvious under successive Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs. Looking back I would rate Conor Cruise-O'Brien as one of the first of our modernising Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs.  I was not a Member of this House at the time but I observed that many people opposite could not take him seriously as a Minister with responsibility in this area.  Many attempts were made to distract him from the high-minded issues with which he liked to become involved by putting down numerous questions about faults in the telephone service but he was the first Minister to grapple seriously with the problem of under-investment.</P>
    <P>In the past few years we have been fortunate in our Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs.  Deputy Reynolds, with the showbiz qualities for which he is known, dramatised to a certain extent the amount of investment needed and what was being done in the past few years to bring the telephone service up to the required standard.  With a great deal less razzamatazz but perhaps with greater solidity, Deputy Cooney continued that same programme and intensified it.  I have no doubt that the present Minister and the Minister of State are aware of the extent of the problem and are committed to achieving what has to be done.  However, <Col N="1162" /> they arrived late on the scene.  They arrived at five minutes to 12 o'clock to tackle the problem.  In a sense they have had to catch up with the failure to invest. To some extent the blame must lie with the community.  It was not pointed out that the investment was needed and had to be paid for, but perhaps people were not particularly interested in paying for what had to be done.  Nevertheless great progress has been made and I do not think any Deputy would find fault with the commitment or the general approach of any of the more recent Ministers in this Department.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill itself, the Minister is absolutely right to go for a radical reorganisation of the entire service.  He would have been wrong to try to modify the existing structure, and here I disagree strongly with Deputy Moynihan who spoke earlier.  The Minister would have been wrong to try to modify the existing structure or to adapt it.  For all its virtues and its good qualities, the present structure is much too big to take any tinkering around with at the present time.  The enormity of the task demands radical root and branch measures if we are to make the progress needed.</P>
    <P>In addition, the present structure was never intended or designed to operate within commercial criteria.  It was never seen as something that should strive as far as possible to pay its own way.  With regard to the postal service, up to now the dominant criteria have been the need to emphasise public accountability, the traditional and the highly important civil service values, but this has had to be accommodated at the expense of the commercial flexibility and sometimes at the expense of a greater degree of service and efficiency.  What is needed now is a much greater degree of flexibility.  In the new structure this flexibility should be possible without in any sense lessening the standards of public service, honesty and commitment to which we have become accustomed in our postal service during the years.</P>
    <P>I would disagree with Deputy Gallagher on the principle, although on the case he outlined I would have a certain sympathy with him on the question of <Col N="1163" /> couriers.  I could see myself in some agreement with the details, but the principle in the Bill of allowing a certain degree of private enterprise is one that should be welcomed, perhaps slowly and with care at first.  That is not to say that at the present time there is any case for privatisation.  It is a horrible word that has crept into use in the past few years. If the Minister should consider there was a need to privatise certain sections of the new service, I hope he will find some other word to use rather than this Americanisation which does not reflect on the richness of the English language, although I cannot find a word that would suit in this instance.</P>
    <P>It is in the interest of everyone to have the possibility of private sector involvement in the new boards.  I can think of the number of instances where the private sector could move in, not to compete with the public sector or these new boards but to augment them.  For example, there could be a situation where the delivery of mail to the islands could be a loss-making operation, something that was more of a nuisance to the new board, and where a private agency could find it could deliver the mail more efficiently and perhaps cheaper.  I can imagine there will be some areas like this where some degree of private sector involvement will be possible, where the work will be done more efficiently and where it will not do any damage to those working in the boards.  We need to study this matter carefully, certainly not in a sense of ideology, not in a Thatcherite sense designed to bring into head-on conflict the various groups.  We should see if this can be done without any great cost and perhaps more efficiently.</P>
    <P>As has been stressed by a number of speakers &mdash; Deputy Gallagher made some important points here &mdash; one of the most important tasks and challenges facing the service will be the question of staff morale.  There is no doubt that in the past few years there has been a serious decline in the morale of staff working in the various sections of the postal service.  The reasons are quite clear.  One does not need to be an expert in industrial relations to recognise the reasons &mdash; the <Col N="1164" /> rapid growth and the increase in demand while at the same time the facilities have remained Victorian in design, scope and so on.  This has placed enormous strains on staff.  Deputy Gallagher mentioned the conditions under which many telephonists have been forced to work during the years and, quite correctly, he said they may well be the most vulnerable to any changes that take place.  Their situation will have to be considered with great compassion to ensure they do not suffer any loss.  Having looked at the conditions under which they have worked for a number of years, it is surprising there has been so little industrial unrest.</P>
    <P>Many of the staff procedures themselves are antiquated, Victorian, outdated and irksome and do little to aid good industrial relations.  All of these are factors that have led to a drop in morale in the postal service.  There is no real opportunity for promotion for many people.  There is no real outlet for those who are prepared to work harder and to apply their talents to the job.  This has had a stultifying effect on the staff in the postal service and has led to the drop in morale that has been mentioned by many speakers.  Partly as a result of this and partly because most people are suspicious and somewhat fearful and resistant in the face of enormous changes, there is no doubt about this.  We are not in a position to lecture anybody on the need to face change openly, bravely and courageously given the reluctance we all seem to have to change even the most basic procedures in this House and the slowness with which we face up to bringing our House of Parliament somewhere into the sixties, not to mention the eighties.  We are not in the strongest position possible to lecture the workers on their need to face up to changes.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann rejects any agreement on a common fisheries policy <Col N="1165" /> which allows non-national boats to fish up to six miles from the Irish coast, within waters that should be available exclusively to the Irish fishing fleet.</P>
    <P>As a party we find it necessary to move this motion in view of the proposals now being considered by the EEC Fishery Ministers.  If these proposals are accepted they will have a long-term serious effect on our fishing industry.  Fishing is one of our basic natural resources and there is great potential for expansion of it not only at sea but in processing the product. We must preserve at all costs any natural resources we have.  If the proposals of the Fishery Ministers are accepted they will halt any expansion in the industry and, in the long-term, will seriously damage the livelihood of those engaged in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>It is only right that we should recall the background that led to this situation.</P>
    <P>The announcement by the then Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on 22 February 1978, that he was abandoning the country's claim for a coastal zone for our fishermen marked the culmination of what must rank as the most inept performance by any political negotiator in the 56 years of national independence.  In the Hague Agreement of October 1976, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, won the following four concessions: that Ireland would be treated as a special case as far as fisheries were concerned, requiring privileged treatment by comparison with other countries, including Britain; we were to be allowed double our catch between 1976 and 1979 and to continue to increase it rapidly thereafter; we were given the right to take unilateral conservation measures in the interest of perserving stock until such time as a common fisheries policy was agreed and we were to get massive aid for our fishery protection fleet and for back-up services such as aircraft and any equipment needed.  The latter was the only part of the agreement that was carried out to the full.  We did get finance for protection vessels and the one aircraft we have in operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" /> Deputy FitzGerald was negotiating for a coastal band up to 50 miles in all the discussions he had.  He never deviated from this principle of a coastal band of up to 50 miles.  By last June the need for such a band, at first rejected outright, was beginning to be recognised and accepted and then we had a change of Government.  By February 1978, within six months, Deputy Lenihan had reversed our favourable negotiating position <i>vis-à-vis</i> Britain while that country actually continued to hold out for a coastal band.  He threw away our most powerful bargaining card, the right of veto over agreements between the Community and third countries for fishing rights which other member states badly needed and for which they would have been prepared to make concessions to us. Finally, he sold out on the coastal band abandoning our claim and accepting a fishing plan based on the kind of quotas which Fianna Fáil had unremittingly denounced while in Opposition as being ineffective.  They proved to be so in the course of time.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, during the course of a debate on the Maritime Jurisdiction (Amendment) Bill, 1976 on 14 December 1976, as reported at column 630 of the Official Report said:</P>
    <P>This Bill should be seen as a second attempt on our part to protect the Irish fishing industry and to secure its future. On Wednesday, 8 December 1976, this House authorised the Government to make an order extending Irish fishing limits to 200 miles.  On that occasion we sought to persuade the Government at the same time as they were making that order to make another order reserving the first 50 miles of the 200 miles exclusively for Irish fishermen. That seemed to us to be necessary.</P>
    <P>We were very much aware that the making of an order extending our fishing limits to 200 miles as and from 1 January 1977, was a very important step from the point of view of our fishing industry.  It was something that in normal circumstances everyone in <Col N="1167" /> this House would welcome.  Fishermen, all those engaged in the fishing industry and members of the general public interested in the subject, would give a warm welcome to the decision of the Government to extend our fishing limits to 200 miles.  However, because the Government refused to make the order we asked them to make concurrently with the principal order, this extension of our fishing limits to 200 miles is illusory and is not guaranteed to confer any benefits whatever on Irish fishermen or on the fishing industry.  Indeed, it is likely to be detrimental to the Irish fishing industry as things are developing.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on record what other members of Fianna Fáil said about the same Bill.  The late Deputy Joe Brennan, then Deputy Leader of Fianna Fáil, said that we have the right to declare a 50 mile limit without reference to anybody. Deputy Bobby Molloy said that Fianna Fáil, if given the opportunity before too much damage was done, would take that stand, would protect our fishing industry and our fishing community and ensure the creation of an exclusive 50 mile limit. The spokesman on Fisheries for Fianna Fáil at the time, Deputy Denis Gallagher, said Fianna Fáil would continue to fight for a 50 mile coastal band, adding that they could not move one inch from that position.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Accession provides, in Articles 100 to 103, that there would be a ten year derogation which expires at the end of 1982.  It provides that before the expiry date the Commission will carry out a survey to determine (1) the condition of stocks and (2) to determine the social and economic circumstances of any decisions taken as a result of any changes made.  As far as the stocks are concerned it is my belief that a limited survey was carried out and the second survey was carried out but was completely inadequate. The Minister should have sufficient argument to persuade the Commission not to interfere with the limits that exist.  That argument must be used not <Col N="1168" /> only in the interest of our fishermen but in the interest of our economy.  The Minister must use The Hague Agreement which was negotiated by Deputy FitzGerald.  Unfortunately, Deputy Lenihan, the previous Fianna Fáil Minister responsible for Fisheries, permitted a weakening and watering down of our position as far as such arguments are concerned.</P>
    <P>Some of our colleagues in the EEC are waiting patiently for our coastal zones to be opened up.  With regard to herring fishing in the Celtic Sea and the 12-mile limit, the French have spent approximately £290 million to modernise their fleet, and 40 of their 45 trawlers are to be built for Brittany in the north-west of France.  A large percentage of these trawlers will work on our white fish and prawn stocks around our coasts.  Although most of these trawlers are replacing older ones, no doubt there will be an increase in the number of boats, because a number of French skippers are already having trawlers built to fish prawns off the Porcupine Bank which has only been worked for the past two years.  Not one boat of the Irish fleet has worked in this area.  It is being worked exclusively by French trawlers.  There is a freezer fleet, ships with freezer equipment, operating there for the past two years and I have evidence that four more of these ships are on order and will be in operation by 1983.  These ships are 78 metres long, have 4,000 horse power engines and can freeze 150 tonnes of fish per day.  On our west coast these ships were taking 1,200 tonnes in eight days during last year's mackerel fishing season.  They also fished for mackerel off the south coast during the summer and 15 to 20 ships of the older freezer type worked on that coast for mackerel and herring.  This is an indication of how well prepared the French fleet will be in 1983 and the Minister must take this into consideration when making any decision on our behalf.</P>
    <P>It is pointless for the Minister to produce figures that prove good catches because the bulk of these catches, especially in the last few years, were mackerel caught off the north-west coast.  This catch is limited to a couple of dozen trawlers <Col N="1169" /> and is of very little benefit to 90 per cent of our fishermen.  These figures may distort the overall picture.  If the Minister wants evidence of what the economic situation is he need look no further than the boatyards around the country.  I have clear evidence that approximately 28 of these boatyards closed down in the last three or four years.  Those that remain are in a very serious financial position. They have had redundancies and that is a clear indication that the fishermen are not maintaining their boats and that the money and margins of profit are not being made by fishermen generally.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention fish that comes from Iceland, Norway and the third countries. There have been unlimited quantities of imports, particularly of herring, into Germany.  This is depressing the market considerably and conditions are being abused left, right and centre.  This abuse is known to the Commission and nothing has been done about it for the past two years.  The Minister should bring this to the attention of the Commission and make it clear to them what our attitude is.</P>
    <P>Our trawlermen are on their knees at present as a result of wholesale importation into EEC countries for the past couple of years.  The entire price structure has collapsed and when we look at prices in other countries, especially in France and Germany, there is no comparison whatsoever.  I should like to point out differences in prices.  In Ireland, haddock is £297 per tonne; in Belgium, it is £458 per tonne &mdash; a difference of £167. In Ireland, whiting is £167 per tonne; in France, it is £411 per tonne &mdash; a difference of £244.  In Ireland, mackerel is £83 per tonne; in France, it is £200 per tonne &mdash; a difference of £117.  In Ireland other white fish is £297 per tonne; in Holland, it is £542 per tonne &mdash; a difference of £245.  If we accept this agreement these are the kind of prices we will have to compete against when our waters are opened to foreign trawlers.  In the case of cod, Denmark and Germany had lower prices than ours, but France were £333 per tonne higher and the situation was more or less similar as far as the price of herrings was concerned.  These figures <Col N="1170" /> clearly show that the Irish fleet are losing out on earning capacity, a position which is further distorted by the extensive State aid to foreign fleets.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, our import costs are the highest in the EEC, and this must be changed.  Our fishermen will be expected to have the equipment to compete with these people in 1983 if this agreement goes through.  The Minister must take this into consideration when making any decisions on our behalf.</P>
    <P>Something will have to be done to help the boat building industry.  A good modern boat building industry is very important for the fishing fleet.  Other countries provide subsidies in this area, but our boat building industry does not get any subsidies.  I know of an Irish boat owner who wanted to buy a 65-foot boat, the Irish price was £650,000 and the French price was £350,000.  That gives some indication of the differential as far as costs are concerned.  There is no doubt in my mind that the difference is being made up by subsidies.  Our boatyards are falling very far behind in regard to modernisation and their equipment is obsolete.  We cannot compete, not only with regard to fishing but in repairing or building new boats.  Another fisherman complained to me that while it took two years to build a boat here the same boat could be built in France in approximately 11 months. The Minister cannot look at any one area of fishing in isolation; he must take the overall picture into consideration.</P>
    <P>In the final agreement it is essential that the marketing regulations must provide for minimum prices and for protection from third countries.  This has damaged our marketing of fish for the past three to four years.  We must not be allowed to go below a certain price level and if necessary we must have intervention prices for our fish.  I think the Minister would agree that there must be an end to the dumping of fish back into the sea.  It is an awful sight as we so often see it on television while at the same time half the world is starving.  Surely we must have some fishery policy under which these fish can be supplied to other countries. It is peculiar that we are dumping fish while at the same time we have regulations <Col N="1171" /> which allow importation of fish from third countries into the EEC and the EEC are paying for the dumped fish. Surely this is not logical policy and must be examined closely.</P>
    <P>There will be pressure from the Germans in particular for the importation of fish from third countries, but it is essential that we stay steadfast on the price structure regulations before any agreement is concluded.  Whether that price structure be a quota price for the amount of fish caught or marketing regulations, we must get a minimum price to ensure that our fishermen can get some margin of profit in order to carry on business.</P>
    <P>Like agriculture, the fishing industry has got very little assistance in the past ten or 15 years.  One could describe it as minimal.  At the same time our EEC partners have poured money into fishing.  I think they have poured hidden money into that industry, money of which we know nothing.  There is a glaring example when France &mdash; quite an expensive country &mdash; can build a ship for half the price of building it in Ireland.  That is a clear indication to the Minister of what is happening. The French are very clever in their moves and they will be our greatest enemy in this situation.</P>
    <P>Fishing is important to the nation, just like agriculture.  Margins of profit are important to the fishermen.  They cannot continue in business unless they have a reasonable profit.  The Minister must take this into consideration.  Whatever is agreed in the final package must include price structures for Irish fishermen.  The differential between one country and another must be made up.  I am sure the Minister will agree that this is important. I appeal to him that no agreement be signed until the prices are also fixed.  This is as vital in fisheries as in agriculture.</P>
    <P>As we now move to the conclusion of the common fishery policy, which is being pushed upon us by this ten year agreement which must end in 1982, it is a very important matter for Ireland.  As the debate moves closer to a conclusion we must consider what is in the whole package and be very careful of our country's interests.  There will be many arguments <Col N="1172" /> in the EEC and one of those will involve the total allowable catch.  I understand that scientific research on our seas would estimate what the total allowable catch may be.  Quotas may be arranged in accordance with the total allowable catch.  I believe we must be very careful in this area because we were given an undertaking that from 1975 to 1979 we would be allowed to double our catch and, more, important, allowed to expand thereafter.  We must bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>The Hague agreement gave a clear commitment to recognising that we were a disadvantaged region in the Community and that is the basis of matters as regards our fisheries.  We must keep these things in mind at this time.  Other countries will try to persuade our Minister that they are doing a great job for us.  The Minister will try to persuade the House that he is doing a great job.  I do not say he is not, but it is our duty in Opposition to bring to his notice the areas where he can put forward arguments on behalf of the fishing industry.  I claim that the terms of The Hague agreement drawn up by Deputy Dr. FitzGerald must be adhered to.  I would be very much aware of the condition of the Community before we joined, because once we join it is stated that all Community waters belong to the Community and that every country shall be allowed to fish right up to the other country's coastline.  We must remember that this does not apply to ourselves.  We have the traditional rights situation and this is the basis on which countries are bringing forward arguments to be allowed to fish in our waters.  We must look at the condition in the agreement itself in regard to traditional rights.  If these are adhered to they are dangerous for us.</P>
    <P>I looked at the agreements which are now before the Minister in regard to these traditional rights.  No doubt the Minister has closely studied this particular document.  It is rather extraordinary that the only traditional rights the Irish fisherman seems to have are very small rights on the British coast, but practically every country in the EEC has traditional rights right around our coastline.  I have reason to believe that in preparation for <Col N="1173" /> the ending of the ten year period certain countries encouraged and subsidised their fishing fleets to create these traditional fishing rights over the ten year period.  This could be very serious for us because we have neither the fleets nor the money to encourage our fishermen to establish any traditional fishing rights outside our own country with the exception of a couple of areas in Britain.</P>
    <P>When we examine the coastal waters of Ireland and the traditional rights established by France in particular, we find they have a very widely established right to fish in our waters.  One could almost say they have a right to fish in all waters of this nation.  That is very serious.  From Cork South, to Carnsore Point South in my own county they have unlimited rights to fish all species of fish.  If the Minister agrees with them they will be first in there &mdash; they have it written here in the conditions &mdash; for prawns, shellfish, mackerel, and white fish.  For practically anything you look at, they can go right up the west coast to fish in our waters.  They have established that; they will stick to it.  They have the Minister across a barrel on that. The Minister is up against it and must hold out very strongly.  There can be no weakening in that regard.  Even the British do not have anything like the same rights as the French.  They have an amount of rights in regard to fishing in our waters.  They have unlimited fishing for three species from Mizen Head South to Stags South.  That is a very large area. From Carnsore Point South to Haulbowline South East, with the exception of shellfish they have unlimited rights for fishing for all fish.  The same applies to most other countries in the EEC.  They have established their rights.  Germany and the Netherlands have the same coastal rights.</P>
    <P>In the document itself we find that the coastal rights in the UK form a completely different picture.  The UK coastline is fixed at 12 miles.  While some other countries have herring fishing rights there, the UK have protected their coastline far better than we have protected ours.  As far as these rights are concerned we are over a barrel in these negotiations. Once it is on a quota basis it cannot be <Col N="1174" /> policed.  It has been the policy of the Governments of other countries for the past ten years to build up in this area and they have done so, but it seems that we have done the direct opposite and our fishermen have been under very severe pressure, particularly for the past two years.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara were compelled to defer payments over a two-year period.  In France they received grants to help them make their payments; we did not get grants.  The fishermen were told that OK, they were granted deferment on their payments and I understand there was no extra interest charged and the fishermen should be thankful for that.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless as far as this agreement is concerned we must look at the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> other countries.  We must be able to weigh up our competitive position and how we are to compete against them if agreement is reached on the suggestion in this document.  I feel very strongly about the establishment of these traditional rights and that has been the policy of these countries for the last ten years. It was not our policy, and that is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>The effect of any serious cutback on fishermen can be very detrimental for many fishing villages all over the country. We are a coastal country and as we look at the map we realise that fishing provides a great supplement to the normal income of many families.  We have approximately 6,000 full-time fishermen, about 6,000 part-time fishermen, 3,000 on-shore fishermen, all directly involved in fishing at the moment.  I have stated that, like agriculture, this is an area with tremendous potential.  If this agreement which is now before the Council of Fishery Ministers in the EEC comes about it will mean that our fishermen will be competing in very serious conditions against the fishermen of the other countries.  Unless any Government here, either the present or an incoming Government, are prepared to take drastic action in the matter of an investment of large sums of money in our fishing fleet on the one hand and into the processing area on the other hand, we cannot compete against the fishermen of the other EEC countries.  In the agreement with Germany in particular we must <Col N="1175" /> insist on certain conditions for our own fishermen before we allow those countries to impose their conditions, particularly for herring.</P>
    <P>For the past two or three years we have preserved the fish in the Celtic Sea, especially herrings.  We must ask ourselves now for whom we preserved the herrings. Was it for our own fishermen or those of the EEC countries?  If this agreement is reached as laid down in the conditions here, we have preserved our herrings in the Celtic Sea for the other EEC countries, not for our own fishermen.  These other countries have the equipment, the boats and the facilities to fish these seas and our fishermen have not got the equipment. The Minister must accept that, and I appeal to him that, whatever conclusions he may reach, he will bear in mind on the one hand the potential the fishing industry has for our country, not just in the sea but on the land, for processing. As with agriculture, very little, if any, effort and money have been put into fish processing.  The processing of fish should be carried out near to the port where the fish is landed.  This would reduce overheads considerably.  As with agriculture, the potential for exporting the processed product is tremendous and it could help to reduce our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>We have put forward this motion not just to come in here to talk about fishermen and make a nuisance of ourselves. Like the Minister, I come from a maritime county where people are very interested in fish and fishing.  Many villages in my county, as in the Minister's county, make their livelihood from fishing.  In the past seven or eight years the people there have made very serious commitments, yet today they are receiving the same price for their fish as they got five years ago while their overheads have gone up five times.  I understand that the greatest problem they have is that the largest percentage of their overheads is concerned with oil, the price of which has trebled in the last five years.  That is a clear indication of the need for a reasonable agreement on behalf of our fishermen.</P>
    <P>Fishing is a source of wealth with great <Col N="1176" /> potential for expansion and fish is one of our few natural assets.  Raw material is important to any country and is the basis of job creation.  Any material that can be provided at home should be harnessed and the best possible use made of it.  It should be processed and translated into jobs and where possible it should be exported.  Our greatest problem as a nation is limited national resources, and our coastal waters provide all that is needed to give a good living to those directly engaged in fishing and working at the processing end.  Above all, there is great potential for expansion.  We call on the Minister to take this natural resource and fight our case at EEC level.  My opinion is that the minimum the Minister brings back to our fishermen must be a 12 mile limit.  This should be obtainable in view of the arguments he has at his disposal to fight our case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I wish Deputy D'Arcy well in his new position as spokesman on Fisheries. I would have allowed for his lack of experience in the fisheries area in the putting down of this motion but for the fact that it is signed by every member of the Fine Gael Party.  It seems to me that we could not have a more inopportune time for a discussion on this issue, which Members of the House, particularly members of Fine Gael, know is being discussed at present in Brussels by a high-level working party set up as a result of the meeting which I attended recently. They are going into great detail.  These are very difficult and protracted negotiations. If there is anything which would damage our prospects in reaching settlement <Col N="1177" /> there, it is an irresponsible motion such as this one.  I condemn in the strongest possible way the irresponsibility of Fine Gael in putting down this motion at this time at the height of these negotiations which are being conducted at Council level.  They will commence again in a week's time.</P>
    <P>We are engaged in negotiations in difficult circumstances.  The Fine Gael motion is unnecessary, damaging and puts us in a very difficult situation.  It is likely to prejudice the discussions taking place.  I condemn Fine Gael's behaviour in putting down this motion at this juncture. What they are attempting to do is not help fishermen but make a political football out of the issue and fool the fishermen.  I assure them they will not fool the fishermen as they are fully aware of our position and have been fully involved in the discussions taking place in Brussels.  They have acted in an advisory capacity with me.  They have been most helpful to me since I took up office and have given advice and assistance.  At this critical stage in the negotiations the Fine Gael motion is damaging.  It puts me in an awkward position.  They want me to disclose my negotiating position but I will not do that.  The movers of the motion realise this and that is why I believe the motion was moved.  It was an effort to gain cheap political capital.  That is why we reject the motion.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy spoke at length about the contribution made by the leader of Fine Gael and by the Coalition.  If he studied what the Coalition attempted to do in 1977 he would have seen that they pressed at Council level for a 50-mile limit.  They introduced a unilateral conservation measure in the face of strong EEC opposition.  They proposed to exclude all vessels over 33 metres in length from a large box around Ireland, almost 50 miles.  As Deputy D'Arcy knows, this was challenged by the Dutch fishermen.  The Government were taken to the European Court by the Commission. Their ruling came late in 1977.  It was that the measure concerned was illegal and could not be continued.  It is strange that Fine Gael are now becoming <Col N="1178" /> concerned about the negotiations for a common fisheries policy and that they should be so active not knowing the history of their own involvement in bringing about such a policy.  It is strange that Deputy Fitzpatrick, who is familiar with the discussions taking place as he was involved in them when Minister in the last Government, left here a few minutes ago.  He recognises the difficult situation we are in at present and I am not sure whether he is fully a party to the motion before us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is sufficient to point out that Deputy Fitzpatrick was not required to insist on a 12-mile exclusive limit by his own Government.  I put that on the record in case there are any doubts in anyone's mind.  This was not required of him in the negotiations which he was conducting in his time as Minister just before I came to office.  That should be realised by people outside the House who might be fooled by Fine Gael's attitude at present.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should give a brief background to fishery limits.  Until the adoption of the London Fisheries Convention in 1964 the maritime nations operated a three-mile exclusive fishery limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got a script.  I have notes, some of which are written and some of which are typed.  It is not a prepared script.  The convention I was speaking about was the London Fisheries Convention of 1964.  It authorised participants to increase these limits to 12 miles subject to the condition that historical or traditional rights of other countries would continue to be enjoyed by them in the six-to 12-mile limit.  As a result, countries such as France and Britain, Belgium, Netherlands and Spain continue to enjoy fishery rights for various species in specified areas of our exclusive fishery limits betwen the six- and 12-mile belt. This was the position when we joined the EEC ten years ago and those historic rights became enshrined in EEC law as a result of the Treaty of Accession.  That is understood by Deputies opposite. They will recall that prior to our entry to the Community the existing member states adopted a common fisheries policy. That policy became known as the right of equal access to fishing waters of other member states.  In effect, it meant that fishing vessels of all member states could fish up to each other's beaches.  However, the Treaty of Accession provided for a ten-year derogation from the right of equal access.  This derogation expires at the end of 1982.  It permitted all member states to operate a six-mile exclusive zone for their fishermen but also provided for limited access by other member states in the six- to 12-mile zone.  The overall effect as far as we are concerned is that the historic rights guaranteed under the London Convention continue to apply and some additional rights have been conceded along the south and east coasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the derogation period expires at the end of this year, the policy of equal access will automatically apply unless <Col N="1180" /> agreement is reached on a revised policy in the interim period.  This, of course, makes it vitally important that we have an agreement, because, if we do not have an agreement by the end of 1982, member states will be able to fish right up to our shores without any control.  That would be an intolerable situation for us. Therefore it is important that a satisfactory agreement be reached and we are fighting to the limits of our capacities to ensure that that will happen.  But, if agreement is not reached, at the end of this year the legal position will be that boats of the Community can fish right up to our shores.  This is something not generally understood by many people and it is important that they should.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made to me that, if a situation such as that arises, we should exercise our right of veto in an effort to secure our maximum demands. At this stage the exercise of a veto would have the opposite result to what we seek in as much as it would merely block agreement on a revised fisheries policy, permitting fishing vessels to fish right up to our shores.  Therefore to adopt such suggestions that we exercise our veto or utilise every power at our disposal would mean that an alarming situation would develop ensuring that the fishing boats of member states could fish right up to our shores by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Countries that might favour equal access have the law on their side; it is in their interests that there be no agreement reached on a revised policy.  Most member states now realise that fishing right up to beaches is not a practical proposition and, for that reason, they are prepared to make some concessions to coastal fishermen. However, the problem is that the concessions they are prepared to make fall far short of what we would find acceptable and indeed of what the United Kingdom Government would find acceptable.  That is why the negotiations have been so protracted.  Most Deputies know that these discussions have been protracted mainly because of lack of agreement among member states on a common fisheries policy.</P>
    <P>There is now a certain movement within the Community, which in my opinion <Col N="1181" /> was brought about by the recognition of many member states and others that at the end of this year there will be a free-for-all and that that must be avoided.  In the short time I have been in office there seems to have been a genuine will on the part of many Ministers to reach an agreement that will come into effect before the present derogation expires at the end of this year.  As is probably known, intensive bilateral negotiations have been taking place in recent months involving the member states mainly concerned and the Commission itself.  As a result of these discussions the Commission have tabled a revised proposal for consideration by the Council of Ministers which provides for a further derogation of 10 years, with the possibility thereafter of a further ten years.  Therefore in the current discussions it is expected that if agreement can be reached there will be a ten-year derogation commencing at the end of this year with the possibility of a further derogation of ten years thereafter, giving 20 years in all.  It is vital that the industry know exactly where they stand in relation to this issue in the long-term.  From the point of view of our fishing industry it is important that we restore their confidence so shaken and undermined by the state of the industry in the past couple of years.  A main confidence restorer would be the possibility of saying to the industry: this is where we stand for the next ten or 20 years in relation to fisheries policy; this is a common policy of all member states of the European Community, with the full backing of the Community. We would be in a position then to say to our fishermen: plan your future development and expansion in the knowledge that you will know precisely where you stand in relation to all these issues for the next 20 years.  From that point of view it would be worth while that we have a long-term agreement for the next ten or 20 years.</P>
    <P>The revised proposals which have emerged from the discussions which have taken place in the Commission should be examined because they allow for the freezing and non-use of certain rights in areas where traditional rights exist <Col N="1182" /> already.  It is important that that be examined because there are at present certain traditional rights that stand up in law, and will in the future.  While we have succeeded, through bilateral discussions with some of our partners in the Community in reaching agreement with them, in some cases, to cease fishing and, in other cases, to freeze their rights, in the revised proposals submitted by the Commission, we would have an exclusive 12-mile zone in the area between Lough Foyle in Donegal and Erris Head in County Mayo.  In the revised proposals now the subject of discussion of the working party set up &mdash; and which will come up for discussion and finalisation at the Council meeting next week &mdash; we shall have an exclusive 12-mile zone between Lough Foyle and Erris Head and, similarly, between Sybil Head in County Kerry and Mizen Head in County Cork. The French have now had their rights frozen around the Erris Head area and their rights extinguished in the Donegal Bay area, giving us an exclusive 12-mile zone in this very important fishing region on the north-east coast, the area immediately off Killybegs.  We have had major success in eliminating the French from this area and indeed getting the British and others with rights out of that area also, which was very important in that north-west region.  We have also an exclusive zone in the south-west area, which is important to the fishermen of that region, especially in the area around Castletownbere, one of our major fisheries harbours.  These proposals also entail the reduction of the rights to be enjoyed in the future by the United Kingdom on our west and south coasts, by Belgium on the west, south and east coasts and by Germany and the Netherlands on the south and east coasts.</P>
    <P>However, I stress that these are proposals only.  There remain a lot of difficult negotiations at present under way which must be finalised.  Some member states have continued to support the concept of equal access and some Ministers voiced strong opposition to the freezing of their rights during the recent Council meeting. I make those points to illustrate the advantages of the Commission's proposicanisatio <Col N="1183" /> als for us.  However, I should say that they will not be agreed without a struggle on the part of some member states.  It is by no means certain that we will be given these exclusive areas.  But I can assure our fishermen and everybody involved in the industry that I shall be fighting not only to retain the benefits obtaining under the Commission's proposals &mdash; constituting an improvement on the situation when I assumed office &mdash; but to secure other benefits in other areas.</P>
    <P>I have said already that we have had fairly detailed and at times tough discussions with the member states.  The situation is very much improved under the Commission proposals.  We will endeavour to get further developments from the final discussions, but it will not be easy.  It will be difficult to maintain what we have got already even in the Commission proposals.  We are not completely happy that we cannot have an exclusive 12-mile limit, which is what our fishermen have recently campaigned for.  I made no secret of my displeasure at the Council meeting that we did not have an exclusive 12-mile band.  The fishermen and the Government aimed at it.  The previous Government also aimed at it, even though they are on record as being prepared to accept a lot less than that and a lot less that we have on the table at the moment.</P>
    <P>In addition to the question of the limits and the excess proposals on the TACs, the total allowable catches, the quotas, the FEOGA advances for fishing boats and mariculture are also under discussion and arrangements in relation to them will form part of the overall common fishery package.  These proposals are also of considerable interest to us because exclusive zones alone cannot fully meet our requirements and they cannot be fully exploited unless adequate quotas are also secured.  I made it quite clear at the Council meeting that the Government and I as Minister, were not satisfied with the quotas that had been prepared for us and that we would be campaigning and endeavouring to secure better quota <Col N="1184" /> arrangements than those which at present apply.</P>
    <P>The result of the forthcoming negotiations will be of very great importance for the future development of the Irish fishing industry.  I assure the House that as far as I am concerned no effort will be spared to press the case to the fullest and to get the best possible overall agreement, bearing in mind as well that unless we can get agreement now and the derogation runs out at the end of this year we will find ourselves in a situation where the whole future of our fishing industry is put in jeopardy by the end of this year. We have got to press ahead with the greatest urgency to ensure that we get the best possible agreement.  Only the best possible agreement will satisfy us.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised about other important issues which I have spoken about on other occasions.  The question of the dumping of fish at sea was raised. Nobody can be happy when fish, a very valuable food commodity rich in protein, and very useful from food and protein value is dumped at sea.  I said during the debate on the Sea Fisheries Bill that the amount of fish dumped at sea is very limited in relation to the overall complex of the value of fish landings over the last few years and that it is very difficult to deal with the situation where you have oversupply on one particular day and shortages on the next.  The traditional and historical way which fishermen have disposed of their surplus catches was by dumping them at sea.  At the same time it is an unsatisfactory situation when any fish has to be dumped.  I made it quite clear on the Fisheries Bill that I feel it is within the capabilities of the people involved in the industry and others involved in social and other activities to find a mechanism whereby we can ensure that in the future no further dumping of fish at sea takes place and that this traditional and historical practice is stopped.</P>
    <P>The Hague Agreement was referred to as well as the doubling of the catches between 1975 and 1979.  The amount of fish landed in 1975 was 75,000 tonnes and in 1980 it was 180,000 tonnes well over a doubling of the catches in that period. The quotas proposed by the EEC for <Col N="1185" /> 1982 meet The Hague target on a stock by stock basis in most cases.  Despite this, we have made it clear that we are not satisfied with the quotas and we will ensure as far as possible that we get a larger quota.  I would like to have more time to go into the whole area of the fisheries development here and where I see the usefulness of a clear and decisive fisheries common policy for the Community and the benefit that would have but time does not permit me to do that. I am sure we will get another opportunity to discuss this.</P>
    <P>I condemn the attitude of Fine Gael in raising this issue at this particular time when our negotiations are taking place and when I am engaged in daily and hourly negotiations and communications between our partners and our officials, some of whom are in Brussels at the moment.  I do not believe there is anything more damaging to the fishery industry than this irresponsible political gimmickery by Fine Gael at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party are supporting the motion.  While I fully appreciate the Minister's very serious responsibilities in the discussions which have been going on for some considerable time, I fail to see why he should have reacted to the motion in the way he did. The motion is actually re-echoing the acknowledged well-defined and stated minimum requirements which he as Minister, his Government or any Government should demand from any international conference in regard to our fishermen's interests and our fishery protection laws.  I support the motion because I feel that discussion in this Parliament will substantially strengthen the Minister and his negotiators in Brussels in ensuring that they will bring back something which the fishermen will find acceptable.  I believe the fishermen's organisations, as well as fishermen in general, will never be satisfied with less than a coastal band zone of 12 miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very good reason why this should be so.  The fishermen, because of their tradition and because of their disadvantaged position in relation to capitalisation, expertise, the size and mechanism <Col N="1186" /> of the boats, are at a very serious disadvantage to be put in open competition with the fishermen of Holland, Germany or England.  This is why the Minister should have welcomed the re-echoing tonight and tomorrow night of the modification of the demand for a 50-mile limit, which was so much talked about some years ago, as necessary for the livelihood and preservation of an Irish fishing fleet.</P>
    <P>I assure the Minister of our wholehearted support and good wishes in the continuation of these discussions and the protecting and safeguarding of the interests of our fishermen along the traditional lines.  Any diversion from them would have very serious repercussions, not only for our fishermen but for our economy as a whole.  We are all aware of the dismal outlook of this sector of our community. The high loan charges on boats, very high fuel costs, uncertainty of fish catches and, above all, uncertainty of a reasonable market price have left many fishermen disillusioned.  A number of boats are at present tied up because of the pressures for payment from banks and so forth.  A reaffirmation, for a period of ten years &mdash; or, as the Minister has said, 20 years &mdash; of a proper fishery zone around the Irish coast would greatly improve investment prospects and bring badly needed confidence and enthusiasm into this industry.</P>
    <P>The fishery industry has had a haphazard history and a number of factors have contributed to this.  There was gross under-capitalisation.  The level of grants provided for the modernisation of boats left too large an amount of capital repayment, with subsequent interest rates causing havoc in many cases and the discontinuation of some expert fishermen in this industry.  I am particularly concerned about the dumping of fish.  A few weeks ago, I asked the Minister if he would consider setting up a fish processing plant at Cahirciveen or Dingle.  These are very extensive fishing areas.  His reply was that this was a matter for private enterprise. The State must become involved in this major industry and ensure that when the fishermen purchase boats, man them and catch fish from them, they should at least <Col N="1187" /> have a market every time and that when the market is not good, there should be a State processing plant to ensure a guaranteed price for the full fish landings.  I am sure that the Minister is aware that many of the catches landed on our coast are purchased, taken overseas for processing, and then returned to be sold to Irish consumers.  This is a very undesirable development which the Minister should ensure will not occur.</P>
    <P>There is a need for reassessment of our harbour facilities.  In many cases they are a serious deterrent to all fishermen.  Many harbours are not deep enough for unloading of fish at certain times of the tide. Over the next few years, many areas will be demanding intensive investment in the interests of our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy, in opening, pinpointed a variety of differences between prices paid to Irish fishermen and those paid to their competitors from other countries.  There is a very wide gap which is augmented by the disadvantaged position of the Irish fisherman, given the handicaps under which they compete. The Labour Party fully support this motion, in the best interests of the Minister and clearly re-echoing what we feel our fishermen deserve within the concept of a European agreement, an agreement under the Treaty of Rome which aims at helping the most disadvantaged, amongst whom stand our fishermen in relation to under-capitalisation, lack of equipment and so forth.  There is a strong case to be made, which I have no doubt the Minister is making.  Any agreement obtained for our fishermen which does not include a major improvement in the 12-mile zone will be disappointing and disadvantageous to this section of our industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the sentiments of this motion.  It is grossly unfair for the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to accuse the Fine Gael Party of attempting to undermine and weaken his hand in the negotiations in Brussels next week.  In actual fact, the Minister should be thankful that he is getting some ideas as to how to deal with our EEC partners. Over the years, Fianna Fáil Ministers <Col N="1188" /> involved in these fisheries negotiations have shown themselves bereft of ideas and worse, bereft of any willpower in dealing with the European Community where Irish fishery limits are concerned. One would think that they were absolutely sterile and did not have a viewpoint of any kind.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in the lameness of his series of excuses, blamed the Treaty of Accession back in the early seventies for all our troubles with regard to the nonexistent fishery limits by the end of 1982. What he forgot to mention was that it was a Fianna Fáil Government and a Fianna Fáil Foreign Minister, who is now President, of this country who negotiated that Treaty of Accession which gives EEC fellow members the right to fish up to our shores at the end of 1982, if no common fisheries policy has been agreed upon by that date, a Fianna Fáil Minister and a Fianna Fáil Government who did not give a damn about the future of the Irish fishing industry.  It ill behoves a Fianna Fáil Minister for Fisheries to moan and groan about lack of support from the Fine Gael benches, when they themselves are the authors of the present situation.  They wrote it in black and white; they agreed when there should have been no such agreement.  As evidence of their weakness on that occasion, the Norwegian Minister of the day complained bitterly about the lack of support when he tried to negotiate a fisheries limit with the then six members of the EEC. The result of that lack of support led to Norway's pulling out of the negotiations and refusing to be a member of the EEC at that or an intervening juncture.  How dare any Fianna Fáil politician blame this side of the House for pointing out the realities of the situation?  Next week, unless the negotiations are finalised, there will be a similar sell-out by a Fianna Fáil Government resulting in a six-mile limit around the country for all EEC fishermen. That is worse than what we have had for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a 12-mile limit for many species of fish for most EEC countries, but as Deputy D'Arcy pointed out, in 1976 we had the greatest sham of all times.  A motion on maritime jurisdiction was <Col N="1189" /> brought in and one Fianna Fáil Deputy after another got up and wanted a 50-mile limit and not an inch less.  It is there in the Official Report for all Deputies to read.  It became one of the platform issues for Fianna Fáil in the 1977 general election. They blamed Deputy FitzGerald and the Coalition for not having secured a 50-mile limit.  Between 1973 and 1977, Deputy FitzGerald, as our Foreign Minister, negotiated what has been accepted by everybody &mdash; including Fianna Fáil at all levels, including the leader of the IFO and other fishery organisations, including senior civil servants and high officials in the EEC Commission &mdash; as a tremendously strong position for Ireland at The Hague.  We were given preferential treatment in fishery matters.  We were to be allowed to double our catches between 1976 and 1979 and we were allowed considerable development of our fishery resources and our fleet after 1979.  We were also given the right to make a unilateral declaration of conservation to preserve our fishery stocks.</P>
    <P>Those conditions were never invoked by Fianna Fáil from 1977 to 1981 or since they took office recently.  All we have seen in the meantime has been a Fianna Fáil climb down, although we heard them, from the present Taoiseach and from the then deputy leader of Fianna Fáil, the late Joe Brennan, crying for a 200-mile limit.  The senior members of Fianna Fáil would have been satisfied with a 50-mile limit, but the junior members wanted the 200 miles.</P>
    <P>What have we got today?  The Minister came in to accuse us of undermining his stand in Brussels next week where he will be looking for a six-mile limit.  God help him.  I would expect a little more from him than gripes and excuses.  The Minister said that we were damaging his position by raising the point about the 1976 agreement, the unilateral declaration of conservation.  In 1976, the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Donegan, made that declaration to keep the Dutch out. Ask any Irish trawlerman and he will tell you that while that declaration existed Irish fishermen prospered as never before.  They did not then see the Dutch <Col N="1190" /> coming into Dunmore or elsewhere, as far as they could come without getting stranded, and sweeping the bottom.  They were unable to come in to trap the herring shoals, whether the herring were spawning or not.  For six or eight months we had peace in the Irish fishery scene.  The foreigners were eliminated from our grounds and Irish fishermen were enabled to make a decent living.</P>
    <P>In 1977 Fianna Fáil instituted a villainous and vicious campaign against the Government for not having got a 50-mile limit, but the minute they got back to power the Minister for Foreign Affairs made one of his frequent sallies into Europe, injurious to the Irish nation and to Irish fishermen, and in Deputy Lenihan's inimitable style declared that the measures brought in by the National Coalition were illegal.  I forget his exact words, but he said it was an illusion to think that we could have a unilateral declaration of conservation &mdash; he said it was illegal.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder the European Court threw out our case after Dutch protests? Our own Minister for Foreign Affairs said our action was illegal.  Of course we did not have a foot to stand on, and ever since we have been on the run.  What can one expect if our own Minister in Europe undermines our case by that type of treachery &mdash; perhaps that is too strong a word &mdash; that type of statement?  So we went on the defensive.  We could not sustain a case for a 50-mile limit, and the next thing we heard was that England were fighting for 50 miles: the English took over our position and we were relegated to silence because our own Minister has taken the bottom from our case. We have had a sad history since that infamous occasion.  Here we are, with our officials and our Minister going over to Europe.  Today the Minister told us he could not prepare a statement because the documents and the officials had gone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment I had been talking about the postal services situation where this new legislation was required.  I had been talking in particular about the genuine fear felt by very many workers in the postal services about the impending changes.  I was finishing on a point which took me very close to all of this, that if we in this House cannot see the reasons for this resistance to change, then we are not opening our own eyes very much.  I was making the point that we have given a very bad example to others outside when we advocate that people should be ready to rationalise, to change, to up-date their structures, to prepare to fit into the new demands of a different type of environment and society. So I hope that when the handling of staff relations and the redeployment of people is taking place with the new boards that there will be a great degree of sensitivity on the part of the new management, that the new management will not think that it can indulge in whiz-kid, ruthless type managerial styles which many of the workers already suspect will be the case.  I hope this will not be so and that there will be a sensitivity which has not always been present in the past on these types of operations, because if the management of the new companies decide that they are going to move in, that they are going to sweep clean with a new broom and brush away all of the existing attitudes and practices, they will be making a great mistake.  Within the <Col N="1192" /> existing postal services there is a great residue of experience and talent and commitment by people who are genuinely committed to operating and making the service work, and it is very important that the new management, whoever it is, will respect this and move with sensitivity and with open mindedness and will understand the fears of very many people in face of the biggest change they will ever encounter in their working lives.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the first task for the new management in the new companies will undoubtedly be to create a sense of confidence, a sense that they are there to work with those working there in a co-operative joint way in the interests of all rather than coming in to &ldquo;take the sorry state of things entire, and shattering it mould it nearer the heart's desire&rdquo;.  But by the same token a very heavy responsibility lies with the unions and management, and I am not here tonight to preach because that is not my function here.  But if management shows itself capable of understanding the fears and capable of being imaginative in the way in which it accommodates itself to those genuine fears and possible misunderstandings, then too there is also a greater responsibility on the unions in the new companies, and I know that many unions are unhappy about the whole principle of what is being done.  But I believe that the companies will be set up and that that is the majority view in this House.  I do not want to pre-judge the votes and there may be changes before the legislation goes through, but if and when the boards are set up I hope that the unions will keep their minds open and come into the discussions on redeployment and staff structures and so on with open, uncluttered and unprejudiced minds.  There is no doubt that the management will find there a great well of expertise and experience upon which to build, and I hope that on both sides there will be give and take.  This is the greatest task facing management.  If it cannot create the ambience, the conditions in which there is a sense of trust, then the bad start could very well mean that the enterprises will never really get off the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But to the workers in the new boards <Col N="1193" /> there is no way in which there will not be disruption, or inconvenience, perhaps a certain sense in which people will feel dislocated.  Given the nature of the changes, this will have to be the case.  If there is not a certain amount of disruption, if there is not a certain amount of dislocation, then we may well find the entire venture has been in vain; it will simply be a case of painting the pillar boxes green all over again.</P>
    <P>One of the things which those who are the strongest advocates of public enterprise involvement here must prove in these new ventures is that public enterprise of this sort has the imagination and the ability to innovate and to move into new business areas, new money making areas.  This is something which the new companies will have to prove.  There is no doubt whatsoever that in this country in recent years there has been a very strong swing away from the whole concept of State industry.  In the past many people were prepared to accept State industry on the grounds that it was necessary and that nobody else would do it or that the losses were very great.  But in recent years the enormous losses incurred by many of our State bodies for reasons which it is not appropriate to go into here tonight &mdash; and there is no single reason &mdash; coupled with a declined standard of service in many of them has led many people, not just doctrinaire Thatcherites but ordinary business people and ordinary people in the country, to the belief that it is better at this stage that private enterprise be given a chance, that there are many areas which could best be turned over to private enterprise rather than have the enormous losses which the State, and ultimately the taxpayers, have to carry.  So it is in this context that the boards are being set up, where those new boards must be able to prove they have the skills, the expertise and the ability to find new areas of work, new areas of activity, to go out and find new markets, to exploit the existing services to the full.  There is no doubt that the Post Office, with its enormous number of main street or prime outlets should be in a position to find new ways, new enterprises by which it could at least <Col N="1194" /> lower losses or ensure a much greater flow of money into the service.  It must show that it is willing to learn, to fight for the justification of the principle of State involvement in its particular area.</P>
    <P>Here again I am back to the important and delicate point of the role the unions will play in all of this.  The unions have been utterly responsible to date.  They have behaved impeccably in all of the negotiations up to this point and I am sure they will do so afterwards.  But if over the next couple of years, the formative years of these new boards, certain unions are going to use every innovation, every deviation from accepted practice as a means of making a new wage claim, if a Luddite mentality is going to block new technology, we may well find that the new service instead of prospering will begin almost with self-inflicted wounds, will begin with a built-in certainty of suicide.  If it is to survive and prosper, then losses must be kept within manageable proportions.  This country will not tolerate another NET.  It will not tolerate another loss-making operation on the scale of CIE.  That is something which at this stage public attitudes have turned themselves against.  Nobody in this House wants to begin the life of these new boards on these grounds.  So while obviously we support the principle that there must be this degree of flexibility at the early stages, and especially in the two or three formative years then the new service is beginning, I hope that flexibility will be the keyword, that unions will control their extremists, those who are trying to use every possible change as a means of putting in an extra claim.  I am not saying for one moment that people should not be paid more for doing more work or for greater productivity, especially if their efforts have contributed to that productivity.  But to expect more simply because working conditions are different &mdash; one is working two miles or five miles down the road or because enhanced technology has meant that for less effort there is greater productivity &mdash; could cripple the new board at the very beginning.  The early years will be the formative ones.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal now with the public <Col N="1195" /> image of the two boards.  The telephone service has a particularly bad image.  This is in part due to a misunderstanding of the problems and conditions under which those people work and in part about the problems people had in getting telephones, and that situation is being improved almost by the month thanks to the efforts of the last two Ministers. Nevertheless, a major rehabilitation public relations job is necessary for the new boards.</P>
    <P>There is one small area which is causing increasing concern, that is, the absence of any form of verification of telephone bills.  I know many people, myself included, are shocked when they see the amount of their telephone bills.  People who have kept detailed accounts find the amount they think they should be paying is far less than the amount of the bill, and unless the amount is outrageous because of a computer error &mdash; thousands of pounds &mdash; it is almost impossible to get proper verification.  When a complaint is made, the Department say they have checked their records and a certain amount is owed.  There is a need for some sort of appeal against what seem to be unreasonable telephone demands.  I am sure other Deputies have this type of problem and it is undermining confidence, to a small extent, in the operation of the telephone service.  I do not know how this problem could be resolved, but like many others I have a lack of confidence in the veracity of computer-based systems. They can make mistakes.  The principle seems to be that the computer cannot be wrong.  I doubt if the Minister has an answer to this, but I ask him to look at this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly and Deputy Gallagher referred to the private couriers.  I find myself disagreeing in principle with Deputy Gallagher, but agreeing with him in practice.  I would like to see provision made for private couriers because they provide a very important service and I would like to see the new board competing with them.  If this happens there will have to be some sort of statutory supervision of the conditions under which the <Col N="1196" /> courier service is carried out.  The same applies to the fast delivery service.</P>
    <P>If I may summarise.  We all agree there is need for drastic action in this area.  I am not in agreement with my colleague, Deputy Kelly &mdash; and not for the first time &mdash; when he said the legislation seemed to be based almost exclusively on British legislation.  I do not believe this is the case.  The review body did a very thorough job.  They examined similar services around the world, looking especially at countries where there was some basis for comparison.  I believe the Minister is right to base legislation largely on the findings of the review body, and in this legislation there are elements borrowed from other countries.  It is right that we should be open-minded in this way and I gently reprimand Deputy Kelly &mdash; I am sure he does not care one way or the other &mdash; for harping almost exclusively on the aspect of legislation derived from the British experience.  I believe the review body looked further.  I am not going to look at the faults in the service because others have done that.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill will work.  If there can be a sufficient degree of flexibility, if the financial structure, about which Deputy Cooney spoke so much, can be resolved satisfactorily, and if proper commercial criteria can be established between management and unions, then I believe these new boards will work.  I hope they will be brought under the purview of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  The principle of accountability to Parliament over this wide area is one we would be very loathe to give up.  If these bodies are made accountable to that joint committee there will be some element &mdash; a growing element, I hope &mdash; of Oireachtas surveillance.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which, with a few small changes, will meet the needs of this country at a time of great change and I wish the Minister every success with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>As my fellow members of the Labour Party have already outlined our objections and position regarding this legislation, I would like to lend my voice in support of them.  For many reasons we <Col N="1197" /> are opposed to the changes outlined in this Bill.  What we are seeing is the result of an inquiry which has not been sufficiently gone into.  The present postal and telecommunications services can be criticised, and nobody can deny that.</P>
      <P>A lot of time, hard work, and sweat have gone into the developing of these services, and they are coming to fruition on the telecommunications side.  For many years there was a lack of finance and adequate infrastructure in the provision of these services but we have come to the stage where we can say we will soon have a service to meet the demands of what we would like to consider a growing economy.  This is a very important time in relation to the provision of these services, particularly for the people who have provided them through the years, because we are now taking these services from them.  What I particularly dislike is that we appear to be shedding responsibility for providing these two very essential services which affect every aspect of our community &mdash; the man in the street, the small businessman, multinationals, foreign developers and so on.  The initial questions to be asked in regard to the infrastructure for industry will always be the efficiency of our postal and communications services.  It is obvious that we must have certain criteria by which to judge the services provided.  We have to have efficiency at reasonable cost and we must ensure we are serving the whole community.  It is equally important that we have unity of service throughout the country.  We must ask the question if these objectives are being achieved under the present structure or if they will be achieved under the proposed structure as outlined in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The timing of the division of the services is unfortunate.  There will be more need in the future to ensure that both of the services will be provided through a unified body.  Because of scientific and technological advancement, postal and telecommunications services will have greater reasons to be linked in the future.  With regard to the provision of postal services, my objections to the proposed legislation might not be as strong if I were representing an <Col N="1198" /> urban constituency.  I see no difficulty for the future in relation to the provision of a very efficient postal and delivery service in urban areas.  However, there have been some dangerous precedents in relation to the provision of services in rural Ireland where there has to be a social content.  After building up and providing an infrastructure for transport services throughout the country, today we have a mere shadow of the services when one considers the limited amount of railway lines now functioning.</P>
    <P>History can be its own judge with regard to this Bill.  I am not convinced that in the years to come we will maintain a high level of postal service to rural Ireland.  There will be no difficulty whatever in farming out contracts and courier services to areas having a high density of population, but I cannot see too many people knocking on the door of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or on the door of An Bord Poist to cater for services to people in rural Ireland who enjoy today a good service on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>People living in remote parts of the country are entitled to the same kind of service as those living in urban areas. History will be its own judge, but no Government can consider themselves to be a caring and responsive Government to the needs of the people in rural Ireland if they impose a service that will not maintain the same standards we have today.  While it may not become apparent in the immediate future, I believe it is the beginning of the end for the postal service in the remote parts of the country and in areas not so remote.  Politicians, and particularly those of us representing people from outside the urban communities, must consider it our priority to maintain and, if possible, to improve the service enjoyed by people today.  I am open to be convinced that this service will exist in five, ten or 15 years time.  The Minister may have a lot to answer for in regard to this legislation.</P>
    <P>We can accept the principle of modernisation. We have to make advances and go along with changing times, but I question the necessity for this legislation. Do we need to change the service so <Col N="1199" /> completely under the guise of modernisation? In the past we failed to finance both the telecommunications and postal sections and we allowed them to become run down.  Now we are proposing a massive injection but we are not happy to do so within the present framework.  I do not see any reason why we could not improve the services &mdash; I accept that there are areas where improvements can be made &mdash; within the existing structures.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable we did not see fit to expand the services provided within the functional area of posts and telegraphs. It is an area where we could learn from the example of other countries.  There are many ideas we could use in the provision of our services.  We have tended to allow the Post Office generally to adopt a stereotype role in the provision of facilities and services.  As part of the effort to have an efficient service and one that can deal with the pressures of modern competitiveness and business attitudes, I do not know why we do not give a far greater role to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. In this connection I mention the provision of banking services, which would be ideal for this Department.  It would be a healthy aspect of competition in relation to banking if Post Office savings were given a stronger footing and a higher profile in current banking services. While this legislation appears for the moment to allow many of the counter services provided by the Post Office to be continued, there are no guarantees for the future.  This is just one of the grey areas in this legislation.  I would be far happier if we were told in detail if those services will continue or if they will be discontinued either at an early or a later date.</P>
    <P>In the Green Paper and the White Paper leading to the proposed legislation there was much patronising and loosely-worded phrases and sentences in relation to the good relations that should be maintained with the present staff and workers in both sections of the Department. Unfortunately, I do not share the Minister's conviction that this changeover can take place smoothly in the present circumstances. <Col N="1200" /> We should iron out all problems in relation to the service conditions existing staff enjoy.  Until that is done we should not take this legislation one step further.  Too often legislation is passed here and then the problems crop up. These matters should be sorted out now rather than after the attempted implementation of the legislation.  We will have problems.</P>
    <P>I suggest that insufficient negotiations have taken place and have not reached satisfactory conclusion.  Too many questions need to be answered and there is a great deal of dissatisfaction with negotiations and the fact that conclusions have not been reached.  We have not heard about the number of redundancies expected or the proposals for maintaining existing numbers.  Yet, in dividing the services are we not creating another bureaucracy to carry out duties which are being carried out in a proper manner by one Department?  All Members should be aware of the surveys that have been carried out in regard to efficiency, manning of services and the bureaucracy involved in carrying out various functions. It is my belief that in spite of all the evidence that has been produced we are top heavy in management, that for every three or four workers we have one person to supervise them.  We are now setting up a whole new complex of bureaucracy.  This division will not improve the service directly and we should be putting the existing management structure to greater use than we are doing at present.  My concern is in regard to the lack of proposals in regard to the proper and efficient usage of existing management in the Department.  It is only realistic that we should accept that the existing staff have acquired an expertise and knowledge of the workings of both sections of the Department and these must be utilised in the new proposals.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise some questions about the appointment of worker directors. I am aware that earlier today the Minister disagreed with Deputy Moynihan in regard to this matter.  My reading of the legislation leads me to agree with Deputy Moynihan.  To allow 12 months <Col N="1201" /> to expire before appointing worker directors is too open-ended.  It is of great importance that such directors are appointed prior to the introduction of the new services.  Many growing pains will be avoided if worker directors are involved in day-to-day policy making from the start.  Any delay in the appointment of such directors may prove detrimental, especially in regard to getting the support and co-operation of workers.  I urge the Minister to seek the appointment of worker directors as soon as possible. Such a move would be in the interest of the new board.</P>
    <P>One area of staffing that causes me concern is in regard to night telephonists. I should like to know what the future has in store for such people.  I am sure the Minister, and the Minister of State, are aware of the grave fears that have been expressed by those people.  The statistics and surveys issued to date do not hold out any great hope for them.  Any politician concerned about keeping unemployment figures down must be concerned at the proposal to reduce the number of night telephonists by thousands.  It is only right that we should express concern when we do not know what is in store for those people.  The Minister should tell the House the plans, if any, the whiz kid bosses of the boards have for the staff that inevitably will not be kept on following the modernisation of these services.</P>
    <P>I am not objecting to modernisation or progress which must be made in regard to those services but there is a genuine need to allay the fears and hard-fastened convictions of the night telephonists that within a short time they will be made redundant.  The research that has been carried out by them and others indicates that there will be savage cuts in job numbers. Those people would welcome any indication from the Minister as to what the future holds for them.  At their annual conference recently those people spoke of a conspiracy of silence by the administrators of the new board.  There is room for a public relations exercise in regard to this matter.  In fact, it should go a stage further and representatives of these people should have the proposed changes explained to them.  I hope job losses are <Col N="1202" /> kept to a minimum and, if possible, avoided.  There is little justification at a time of recession for failing to maintain a balance between progress or development and employment.</P>
    <P>The proposed legislation, in allowing a general policy in regard to the provision of licences to persons considered suitable by the new boards, is an undesirable direction for the Government to be taking. The powers should be retained by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs because he is responsible to the Members of this House and there is a very important part of democracy at risk in relation to these changes.  I would be far happier in the knowledge that we, as public representatives, could still maintain the role of watchdog in relation to the provision of its services which are so vital and important in the every day lives of laymen and business people.</P>
    <P>I am not happy that this policy of distribution of licences and allowing the companies to regulate their distribution bodes well in terms of democracy.  We are shedding another important aspect of answerability and accountability from this institution and I do not welcome that move.</P>
    <P>In relation to the setting up of companies rather than corporations, despite the suggestion in the White Paper that both would be considered, I feel that there is far more responsibility and accountability and I would be far happier if we were to give a direction that the new bodies would be corporations rather than companies as such.  I do not think there has been sufficient public discussion or consultation with the bodies concerned with the changes and, until such discussions and consultations have taken place, this legislation is premature.  I am convinced, at a time when we need to cultivate our image as a country with solid industrial relations, with a progressive work force and a suitable infrastructure for development as an industrial nation, that we are precipitating possible industrial chaos, especially in the areas of telecommunications and postal enterprises.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to tread with caution in relation to the implementation of this legislation.  I agree with the suggestions <Col N="1203" /> in the proposed legislation that a watchdog and consumer protection body has to be provided for but I wonder at the wisdom of providing for this body to be paid from financial provisions made by the Minister.  This will, no doubt, reflect itself in the cost and charges to be levied by the provision of the services. We have reason to be concerned about the consultative process outlined in the Bill in relation to pay and conditions of service for the existing work force in both areas of the Department.  There are no guarantees and, for the many people who have served this Department so well, guarantees should be outlined.  They are entitled to guarantees in black and white. There is too much uncertainty and it must be removed prior to the implementation of this legislation.  We are all aware of the feelings that have been vented and the discussions that have taken place recently at annual conferences and in private discussions with members of the union.  We are all aware that they are not 100 per cent in agreement with the proposals. Until we have the 100 per cent agreement of these people, who are so vital in the provision of these services, we are on very dangerous ground.  The last thing we want at this point in the development of these services is industrial strife.  The Minister is a man of vision and he must be aware of the dangers that are in this proposed legislation.  I urge him to hold further consultations and to go to any lengths to provide for the smooth change over which is inevitable at this stage.  It must be a smooth change over if we are to maintain progress and to have the efficient service which the legislation sets out to provide.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the reservations which I and the Labour Party steadfastly hold in relation to these changes.  There is very little attraction for the kind of company which I feel will be interested in providing the services to small communities in towns and villages.  There certainly will not be a profit margin for them.  The attraction will be manifold in urban areas with large communities and there will be a large profitability in relation to the provision of services there.  Who is going to <Col N="1204" /> be responsible for the provision of the non-profit making services, which are enjoyed throughout the country at present? The Minister and the Minister of State representing rural constituencies, as I do, may have to answer for this proposed legislation.  No doubt by that time the Minister of State will have plenty of telephones installed in Roscommon but I feel that people will be looking for more.  They will want the maintenance of the services which they have rightly come to expect.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister and his Minister of State to look at this legislation themselves and let us have some personal input from the Minister to this legislation.  We in the Labour Party will show cause why it should not pass in its present form: I refer to amendments we intend putting down. At this point in the development of our telecommunication and postal enterprises I feel the time is not right for this change.  Particularly in regard to telecommunications, why at this point of development should we propose to hand over these services to a State-sponsored body? Why bring in people from private enterprise at a stage when provision of telecommunication services seems to be going well?  Like every other Deputy, I have frequently sought to expedite the installation of a telephone service. Throughout the country everybody is familiar with that problem.  But since 1979 we have made great progress in the undating of the service and it has almost arrived at the point where we can be satisfied that service can be provided on demand.  That is the target I assume we are striving for.  Is that situation now being changed from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to the State-sponsored body?  I should be happier if at this stage, when much work has been put into it and many hours devoted to updating our service and bringing it to a modern acceptable standard, to allow the people who have brought it to this stage to continue to supervise its development.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister, in his wisdom, to take a long, slow, deliberate look at the proposed legislation.  On another Stage we shall outline in detail our objections, section by section, in the form of amendments. <Col N="1205" /> When the specific arguments are highlighted it will seem that there are many areas of weakness and uncertainty and areas where the Bill will not be an improvement on the existing structure.  I feel these should be rejected, and I believe that time will bear us out.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the debate on the Bill this afternoon Deputy J. Mitchell referred to the facility on some telephones connected to the PABX serving this House of listening in to other telephone calls made on the PABX.  In case there should be any misunderstanding arising from what Deputy Mitchell said, I wish to give this explanation and clarify the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leinster House exchange is a very modern computer-controlled private automatic branch exchange.  Most of the telephones connected to it are of the ordinary type but also connected to it are 20 push button console sets or SL1s.  The exchange computer can be programmed to give these SL1 sets an override facility which enables the user to interrupt a call to or from extensions connected to the Leinster House exchange.  A warning tone is sounded when such interruption <Col N="1206" /> takes place.  Seventeen of the SL1s have been given the override facility &mdash; seven in the Taoiseach's offices in Government Buildings and Leinster House; eight in the Minister for Finance's office in Government Buildings and two in the office of the then Leader of the Opposition in Leinster House.  The two former installations dated from 1980 and the latter from July 1981.</P>
    <P>This override facility is a feature of most electronic branch exchanges.  As the Taoiseach was mentioned as having asked for the SL1 consoles, I have consulted with him in the matter and he asked me to state categorically that (i) he never asked for the override facility which enables other calls to be listened in to and that this is confirmed by the departmental official who attended the meeting at which the Taoiseach stated his requirement; (ii) that he never knew such a facility was available on the SL1 set and that he never used it.  The SL1 sets, exactly as they were, were left for Deputy Dr. Garret FitzGerald when he took over as Taoiseach.  I find it very consoling for us lesser beings that two Taoisigh could have facilities on their desks which they did not know anything about &mdash; good for us.  The Taoiseach first became aware of this facility when it was mentioned to him earlier this year by Deputy Garrett FitzGerald.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Mitchell said, the matter was brought to the notice of the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  The override facility was removed from all SL1 sets and all extensions connected to the Leinster House PABX were made immune from intrusion by an override facility.  The present position is that any changes in the Leinster House PABX can be made in future only with the prior agreement of the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell raised the question of referring to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges the circumstances in which these facilities came to be provided.  I am going to insist that this shall be done without delay.  I want all the documentation and all the reports to be made available to the committee for a thorough <Col N="1207" /> full, exhaustive investigation and report free from all innuendo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill, which implements the White Paper on the reorganisation of postals and telecommunications services and provides for the establishment of two State-sponsored companies, An Poist and Bord Telecom Éireann.  Most people will welcome the Bill.  My only worry is that there will be greater expectation of results from it than are likely to come about quickly.  I believe that one of the biggest issues under the Bill has been mentioned by the two previous speakers. I have not heard the debate so far today on the Second Stage but I agree with my party colleague, Deputy Manning, in his views about the need to consult with, understand and recognise the viewpoint of employees involved.  I have no doubt but that the Minister, keeping in mind the last speaker's comments, will be in consultation and will understand the very real fears that workers and Post Office officials in this area feel at this time.  It is very important when a radical change such as this comes about that the workers are reassured.  In these days when unemployment is high and sky-rocketing every day they are entitled to an assurance that their jobs, job structures and opportunities for the future will not change drastically with the introduction of this legislation and the coming into being of these two companies.  This has been an important feature of the debate so far and of the concern felt by the workers which they have conveyed to all of us Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot agree with the last speaker who talked about dramatic changes being imminent and things looking good for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  We all know the situation regarding telephones. The Order Paper every day is full of questions about the service and during the last two elections when we went out to seek votes we found that all over the country the telephones posed probably the greatest problem and issue we faced.  In my constituency one candidate &mdash; not of my party, let me say &mdash; was the target of a telephone which somebody <Col N="1208" /> threw because the phone has been installed in a house and had not been connected although the fee had been paid.  We cannot cover up any longer for the dreadful infrastructure we have.  Public representatives are receiving letters from the Department similar to the following in reply to an application for service for a constituent: &ldquo;The need for service is appreciated.  Installation of telephones in the Dublin area is being greatly speeded up.  It is planned to provide over 40,000 telephones in the area this year and practically all outstanding applications will be met before the end of 1983.&rdquo; It goes on to say that this will involve underground cabling, and the mind conjures up all kinds of routing in the ground, digging and so on.  That is one of the standard letters to which I referred previously.  It tells a fairy tale. There will not be 40,000 telephones in the area, at least I do not believe so because I have had no basis on which I can feel optimism in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on Deputy Spring's reference to his fears for the postal service in the country areas after this legislation is enacted.  Perhaps he does not know that recently I asked about a small parcel which was posted in a Dublin post office and I was told that it would take three days to reach Galway. Inevitably this is forcing people to use the express postal service, which is very expensive and which, if the system was working, would not be necessary.  Two weeks ago a letter I posted in Ballsbridge post office took five days to get to Herbert Park.  Public relations, promises and so on are no good.  This action is necessary and welcomed and it is bound to effect changes which unfortunately, will not be quick changes.</P>
    <P>Turning to more mundane matters, I would like to talk about my hopes in regard to the new companies and their appliances, facilities and services.  Has the Minister responsible observed the system of automatic public telephones which have appeared recently in Dublin? I am not sure whether this system has extended beyond Dublin.  They are called pay-phones, and I am still looking in Dublin for free phones.  These new appliances <Col N="1209" /> are absolutely appalling.  Many people who are not stupid cannot operate them and one can lose quite an amount of money trying to operate them.  I wonder why this system was adopted here when in so many other European countries such as France, Spain and the UK a system has been introduced which is very easy to work and apparently efficient, and also vandal-proof because the phones are in public places and stations where they are bound to be subject to vandalism.  Where in the name of goodness did the Minister responsible go to buy the phones we have now?  I suspect that they will be found to function so badly that they will have to be replaced at enormous public cost.</P>
    <P>Our telephone system is desperately retarded, but people will become used to anything and eventually will not realise the awful conditions under which we are working here.  Our telephone boxes outside Dublin are museum pieces.  One that I went into recently had a notice which said that only Irish 3d pieces were to be used in this box.  That will indicate how long the notice has been there or how long it was since the box was serviced.  I hope that soon the facilities will reflect the eighties rather than some early postwar period.  Those of us who travel abroad see the facilities available there in the homes, shopping centres, big stores and the streets, where efficient, clean, functioning telephones are taken for granted.  In the smallest village in France, in the Canaries, anywhere I have been in the developed and sometimes in the not too developed world can be found telephone systems that work very well and are far superior to ours.  I question why our system is so retarded when ten years ago EEC membership was very much on the cards.  Why did we not have the vision and planning that other countries had in regard to telephone systems?  Investors come in here look at our telephone system and run away again.</P>
    <P>In this context I must mention the facilities available at the GPO in Dublin. I have not been there recently, but the last time I went in it was an utter disgrace. Has the Minister ever tried to make a phone call at the GPO?  It is certain that <Col N="1210" /> visitors to the country will go there to make phone calls and Dublin people also probably must go there, because very few phones in the telephone boxes anywhere else are working.  The facilities in the GPO are appalling.  They are dirty, in several of the boxes the phones are broken and it can be taken for granted that the telephone directories are out of date or torn.  The system for international phone calls as compared with those in any other comparable city are very bad.</P>
    <P>We have let the postal service lag dreadfully.  Sub-post offices here were set up to cater for people who wanted to buy stamps or collect their old age pensions. Now they deal with services comparable with those provided by banks, but they have not the facilities to do so.  On, say, children's allowance day queues of people stretch out to the street.  The Post Office services have been expanded to take in the payment of telephone bills, children's allowances, deserted wife's allowance, old age pensions, other social welfare payments, savings certificates, social welfare forms and TV licences.  I am not suggesting that the people operating these sub-post offices or suburban post offices are inefficient are not doing their job, but they are working under impossible odds.  Consumers in this country are passive.  Sometimes I go in for some service and I have not the time to wait.  I do not have time to wait and cannot stand for an hour to get service nor should I have to.  People pay enough for stamps and the other services they get at post offices and should have an efficient service.</P>
    <P>I am glad that we will have a users council.  This will be an important feature of the Bill.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that it is a meaningful council. There is no point in setting up more bureaucracy and having a situation where TDs will have to write or make representations to this council on behalf of consumers to see that they get a fair deal. I hope it will be accessible to consumers and that they will be able to bring their complaints and problems to it themselves. There is no point in having a white elephant or a window-dressing operation. I am all in favour of people being <Col N="1211" /> able to go to a Department and make a complaint themselves.  I hope we are not encouraging a greater dependency on TDs.  People should have access to the council and be able to use it themselves.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  Like previous speakers, I ask that the needs and expectations of the officials concerned be taken into account and that they be fully consulted in good time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my party spokesman in opposing this Bill at Second Stage.  I agree there are many welcome aspects in the Bill but it is premature and ill-advised because due recognition of the rights and needs of the workers involved have not been given and a final and happy conclusion to the consultations has not been achieved.  It is my contention that this is the first stage in the hiving off of profitable sections of the public sector and dismantling all non-viable areas assessed purely on an economic basis rather than on their social content.</P>
      <P>Prior to being elected to this House, I was a member of the public sector and served in a State body for over 20 years. For many years, irrespective of what Government were in power, there was a complete lack of interest and lack of policy at Government level and because of that there was a lack of investment to ensure that a service to which the public were entitled was forthcoming.  Arising from the lack of interest of successive Governments, there has been criticism of the staff rather than of the service over the years.  The blame was laid on the wrong shoulders.  Staff have always given of their best.  The lack of interest should be shouldered by people in the higher places in the many Governments we had during the last 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 28,000 people employed in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and many of these have served for 35 and 40 years in conditions which I should not like to describe in 1982.  As regards working conditions, pensions, recognition of service and so on, there has been serious discontent and disquiet expressed by the unions representing these people over <Col N="1212" /> the years.  The staff involved are entitled to full and co-operative consultation.  As regards this Bill the unions concerned have expressed their dismay and alarm at the fact that consultations have not been resolved and conclusions have not been reached.  There are up to 300 cases unresolved in the Department.</P>
    <P>As a rural Deputy, I am concerned that prime consideration has not been given to the social aspect of the service involved.  One might describe it as an extension of the urban development Bill because if one examines the Bill one will see that a first-class service is provided in Dublin city and in the east of Ireland but I can see, in many areas in my constituency, where in the future people will be fortunate to receive a postal delivery once every three weeks.  The thinking behind the Bill and the input from some private enterprise people is based solely on the profitable aspect of the workings of the Department.  One can only relate the implications of this Bill to what has happened in another State body, CIE, where over the years there has been an erosion of service due to lack of interest and lack of investment by successive Governments.  As the result of this indifference, many people in various parts of the country do not enjoy the benefits of a service which are first class in other areas.  They are first class because the number of people utilising the service makes for a greater profit margin.</P>
    <P>I am concerned for the staff involved. They have given a tremendous service over the years.  The prospect facing 3,000 to 4,000 people is one of job loss.  I am all for development and progress but not at a time when we have nearly 150,000 people unemployed.  I cannot condone a situation where 4,000 people could lose their job.  We have had many outcries when major enterprises closed down in the last few months.  In this situation there is the prospect of substantial job losses.  That is why I contend that the right to consultation should be uppermost in the minds of all concerned.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the Bill with particular reference to the worker about which I would also be concerned.  For example, there is the question of promotion. <Col N="1213" /> Prior to the introduction of this Bill an officer in this Department had the right, with proven ability, to move into other sectors on promotion.  But the provisions of this Bill will impose restrictions on a man or woman's ability to improve his or her lot in life, which means that staff will no longer be able to avail of opportunities arising outside their specific area of employment.  Also in my opinion under the provisions of the Bill worker participation will amount to a very belated effort.  The Bill says that 12 months later workers may participate in policy decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>For the sake of industrial peace in the public sector and a successful implementation of the provisions of the Bill there is urgent need for further discussion with the unions concerned.  These unions have indicated publicly that they are not happy with the type of consultation that has taken place with particular reference to this Bill.  It would indeed be a sad day for any Government in power if such a revolutionary development was introduced without the goodwill of the staff concerned.  We have learned from experience in regard to many incidents over the years that, without the goodwill of the workers involved in any new development or introduction of new technology, one will not be successful in reaching one's goal.  There is need for further consultation. Therefore at this stage I appeal to the Minister to accept the offer of the unions concerned, before proceeding to Committee Stage, to ensure that there be <Col N="1214" /> constructive consultation with the unions concerned.  Apart from this development there are some 300 cases for arbitration in regard to status within that area of the public sector that remain unresolved, many for a considerable length of time. If we are to embark with the goodwill and co-operation of the unions and staff concerned there is need for further discussion. It must be said that any man or woman in fear of losing a job cannot be happy about new developments &mdash; apart from their being for the good of the country and its people in his or her area of employment.  We must be able to say to such people that their service of perhaps 30 years has been appreciated and now we are saying: &ldquo;This new development will be of help to you in your job and will create a new era of industrial peace; let us go along the road of further development in the postal and telecommunications service.&rdquo; That is what we should be doing rather than saying: &ldquo;We have had sufficient consultation, let us get on with the job and have this Bill passed in the House.&rdquo; For the sake of industrial peace in this sector I appeal to the Minister to listen to the unions' plea for further consultation and negotiation so that the Bill may be passed with the co-operation of the staff of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill indicate clearly that its social aspect takes third or fourth place only in the order of priorities. That to me foretells a dismantling of those services in rural Ireland over the next four or five years.  Representing a rural constituency I would be most concerned in this respect.  I contend that better service can be provided only with the greater usage of the facilities available within the Department, and that in the major centres of population.  Here profit is the motive rather than any social one.  I protest, on behalf of rural Ireland, that this development will augur the end of many of the services in poorly populated areas.  We have been giving lip service here and elsewhere for many years to rural renewal.  What has happened over the years?  Services have been withdrawn in different Departments. Small schools, Garda barracks, railway stations and so on have been closed and <Col N="1215" /> now we are confronted with a situation in which even small post offices may be closed.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of this Bill to be borne in mind is that it will have considerable influence on the development of the services in the future because of insufficient capital being made available to the new boards, particularly that in relation to the postal services.  Anybody travelling around the country cannot but observe the condition of many of our post offices.  Many of them are derelict buildings in which people are asked to work, many of which should have been condemned long ago.  Surely if this new revolutionary idea is to get off the ground modern buildings must be provided for the people who will be providing the service.  It must be remembered that many such buildings date back to the middle of the last century.  There is also a substantial amount of money required for plant renewal.  Therefore, I am not satisfied that there has been a sufficient allocation of capital to ensure that in the five or ten years ahead moneys will be readily available for the provision of proper, modern facilities for the staff who will be providing these services, backed up by modern plant.</P>
    <P>Indeed we have suffered from the lack of Government policy in such areas as the postal service for many years.  Now when, in the last ten years, some moneys have been provided for one section of the Department for postal services, that is now going to be handed over to private enterprise.  Having invested taxpayers' money for the provision of better telecommunications services &mdash; and here credit must be given to the various office holders over the last ten years for their concern in this respect &mdash; we are now prepared to hand over the running of that section to private enterprise.  In that area only will private enterprise participate because that is where there is money to be made.</P>

      <P>Deputy Enright has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of empty office blocks in Dublin city for which the taxpayers' money is been paid and for which Ministers may be responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Ceann Comhairle for granting me permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I have been requested by Deputy Barrett <i>(Dún Laoghaire)</i> and Deputy D. Andrews to allow them some of my time. With your permission I propose to allocate them three minutes each.</P>
      <P>I am raising this matter of urgent public concern because this year more than £3 million of the taxpayers' money will be wasted on leasing office accommodation which is being allowed to lie idle.  This sum of money is being paid out leasing this office space for civil servants and some of the staff of semi-State bodies, and they are allowed to remain vacant. This is gross waste of public funds.</P>
      <P>Some of these buildings which have been rented are allowed to remain vacant in some instances for up to 12 months and more than that in others.  I am concerned that this is being allowed to happen. I call on the Minister to ensure that this excessive waste of money will be stopped and that it will not be allowed to recur.  Any system which allows this type of wastage of funds to occur must be radically altered so that it will not be allowed to occur in the future.  The cost of this office accommodation, based on the figure I have given, works out at £8 per square foot to rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of premises involved.  The new Garda headquarters in the Irish Life premises in Harcourt Street cover 120,000 square feet.  The premises at 4/5 Harcourt Road, has more than 30,000 square feet.  This lay idle for a long period but has recently been occupied. There is Ardilaun House on St. Stephen's Green, which has 110,000 square feet, which will be used by the <Col N="1217" /> Department of Posts and Telegraphs. There is a premises in Dame Street, which is approximately 100,000 square feet, and there is a premises in Mount Street, of approximately 45,000 square feet.  Some of those premises have recently been occupied and others are coming on stream.  The cost of leasing those premises works out at between £2½ million and £3 million.  I am very concerned about this matter.  The figure of £8 per square foot is the normal market rate.</P>
    <P>This property is rented and it is only then that negotiations take place with the trade unions in relation to occupation of the premises and there will be disturbance money involved.  Arrangements have to be made about furniture for the premises and office equipment.  Then the movement from the old to the new premises occurs.  This is far too late to discuss those matters.</P>
    <P>A normal private concern would not tolerate wastage like this.  Immediately a private concern see that office space is to be provided in Grafton Street or some other place they check with the estate agents, they get the plans from the architect or the estate agents and they find out the layout of the premises.  They see if the premises are suitable for them.  They discuss the matter with their staff.  They discuss the arrangement of personnel. That is the normal procedure in the movement of a business from one building to another.  The same procedure should be used in relation to the movement of any Government Department. The Minister should ensure that that is the way things are done in the future.</P>
    <P>Hard-headed decisions must be taken in relation to this matter because we are dealing with public funds, and the public should be given an assurance that their money will be spent efficiently.  We, like other countries in Western Europe, are in the middle of a recession.  Tremendous efforts have been made to try to cut back on different services to save public funds. The same efforts should be made in the case of those premises.</P>
    <P>We have seen cutbacks in the health services, roads, sanitary services, house <Col N="1218" /> construction as well as money paid to farmers.  If some of this £3 million was channelled to the farming community it would be a great help to them; if it was put into house construction it would be a help; or if it was put into alleviating people on PAYE it would be a help. Many taxpayers' are not as annoyed at having to pay tax as they are that hard-earned money which is paid in taxes is not efficiently spent.  There will be much criticism of this wastage of public money. It is a serious matter about which I am very concerned.</P>
    <P>I gather that it is the Office of Public Works who obtain the rented accommodation to be used by other Government Departments.  There appears to be a greater need for co-operation between that office and the different Government Departments involved in the form of discussions between them before any accommodation is obtained.  Then, if the arrangements are suitable for all concerned, negotiations could take place between the unions concerned and the Government Departments.  At present there is not a business like approach to the situation.  Instead we have a haphazard, unhappy situation with large amounts of money being paid out for accommodation which is allowed to lie idle.  I have no ulterior motives, having no knowledge of anything underhand, but I am simply saying that this system of prematurely renting accommodation must be seriously looked at.  I hope that the Minister will tell the House the number of office blocks at present lying idle and the number which the Government are considering renting at present.  I am not being contentious or partisan in this, but I feel that the matter needs to be investigated. If something is not done to rectify the position, large pressure groups, such as trade unions and different taxpayers and farmers groups will point the finger at this waste of money and the present system must be blamed.  Ultimately, the responsibility rests on the Minister to have this matter rectified and to ensure a change in the system.</P>

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> In supporting the argument put forward by my colleague, I question the whole idea of locating Government Departments and, indeed, local authorities in the centre of the city at a time when that city is being choked and we are trying to develop new towns on the outskirts.  This whole question should be looked at, particularly from the point of view of loss to the citizens in relation to the development of these new towns.  In my time allowance of three minutes, I would like to refer to what one would call an established town &mdash; Dún Laoghaire, County Dublin.  I wish to raise the question of the empty offices there which were meant to House An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> I raise a general question regarding office developments which are lying idle and with which semi-State bodies are involved.  I wish to make one or two points on that issue.  On 19 October 1981, I wrote to the then Minister for the Environment pointing out that it was contrary to the wishes of the staff of An Foras Forbartha that they should be relocated in Cork.  I understand that 98 per cent of the staff do not wish to be relocated there.  I suggested at that time that, in view of the <Col N="1220" /> fact that it had come to my attention that the office development at Dún Laoghaire supposedly for the use of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara was now not being taken up by them, the Minister should consider relocating An Foras Forbartha in that building, as they already have a section housed on Pottery Road, which is merely two miles from the office development referred to.  Up to today, that office development has lain idle.</P>
      <P>It has now come to my attention that the present Minister has again opened negotiations to have An Foras Forbartha relocated in Cork, despite the fact that a review of this body carried out by the NBST advised that An Foras Forbartha would not be suitable for location in any other situation but Dublin, because of its various activities.  A well documented argument has been put forward to that effect.  I notified the Department and drew attention to the fact that this development has lain idle for eight months because An Bord Iascaigh Mhara do not intend to use it, which highlights the point made by Deputy Enright that something must be wrong to allow this to happen.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister may not have the information now at his disposal but I am using this occasion to bring the matter to his attention.  An investigation should be carried out to see that these things do not happen and something must be immediately done to have that office development occupied.  After all, the Government are spending a considerable amount of money on electrifying the Howth-Bray railway line which would make it an extremely&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> I have just one more point to make.  I am sure that the Minister will agree that Dún Laoghaire is a very attractive place to have office development, particularly for a Government Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity to make a few remarks on this very important topic, and I am glad <Col N="1221" /> that the Deputy raised this matter.  I tried to raise the subject with the Ceann Comhairle at 3.30 p.m. today, specifically mentioning the nameless unoccupied building in Dún Laoghaire.  Unfortunately, I was ruled out of order.  Deputy Enright's proposition, however, was accepted.</P>
      <P>There is an arguable economic theory that civil service office and semi-State office accommodation should be leased. I was a member, quite a number of years ago, of the Committee of Public Accounts and when this question of leasing office accommodation arose I took the view, which I still hold, that these office blocks should be brought by the various organisations on behalf of the civil service and the semi-State bodies.  I had hoped the view I expressed ten years ago in this regard would have been acted on so that State and semi-State bodies would now be sitting on quite valuable properties.  That has not happened.  I reiterate my views that these office blocks should be bought by the occupiers.</P>
      <P>There is an office block on the sea front in picturesque Dún Laoghaire which is vacant and which should be occupied as a matter of urgency.  The decision not to continue with the lease was taken by the last Coalition Government.  Though I agree with Deputy Enright and Deputy Barrett, it is still important to get the record correct.  We want to continue the economic well-being of the community in Dún Laoghaire: we do not want to see valuable office blocks being left vacant, as they were during the lifetime of successive Governments.  The BIM operation is fragmented and spread: they occupy a number of buildings, and we should like to see BIM centralised in Dún Laoghaire.  Therefore, I am asking the Minister to give us some idea of what will be done with this white elephant, standing in stark nakedness on the sea front in Dún Laoghaire.  I hope the Minister will examine it.  I again thank Deputy Enright for having given me time to speak.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett, Clare) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett, Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>,<i>Clare):</i> The Office of Public Works are responsible for the provision of accommodation for the civil <Col N="1222" /> service as a whole, with a few minor exceptions.  The Office has a continuous demand from Departments for office accommodation much of which must be met by renting premises in the open market. When premises become available on the market and are generally suitable to meet a particular need the Office of Public Works must move in immediately to open negotiations.</P>
      <P>Such office blocks come on the market in an incomplete state internally.  They are essentially shells completed on the outside but with minimum finishes internally. This is the practice to enable prospective lessees to adapt the space available to their own requirements.  As is the norm in the property market, to secure premises on lease, liability for rent must be accepted from the date of agreement of terms.  This is the position the Office of Public Works find themselves in when they must lease an office block to solve a particular problem.</P>
      <P>A number of steps must then be taken to transform the shell to finished office accommodation.  The first step is to get a full and detailed brief on the requirements of the Department in question. Depending on the location of the building and many other considerations, the Department must decide on which sections of staff are to be moved and how they are to be grouped in the new building to give the best results from an organisational point of view.  The Department must then document the specific facilities they require for those units of staff.  This process of necessity takes time, involving as it usually does consultation with unions and staff associations.  While the Office of Public Works are at all times available in an advisory capacity, it cannot proceed with planning until a full brief is established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once the brief has been received, the Office of Public Works must convert it into a detailed floor plan for the approval of the Department.  This is to ensure that the working space available will be used to best advantage to enable the Department to satisfy themselves that all their requirements will be met.  At this juncture, oftimes alterations have to be made <Col N="1223" /> involving preparations of revised plans.</P>
    <P>Once agreement has been reached on layout plans, the Office of Public Works must proceed with the preparation of contract documents covering architectural and engineering works, invite tenders and place contracts in accordance with Government contract procedures. These contracts can be substantial, and in the case of a large office block a fitting out contract can be in the range of several hundred thousand pounds.  Works of this scale and variety could take a year or more to complete.</P>
    <P>The provision of telephones, floor covering and furniture must follow.  The Department then have the problem of movement of staff and papers to the building with minimum disruption to their operations.  Such movement of staff may have to be scheduled to avoid critical dates for certain services.  All of this process is necessary to ensure that the building will serve to maximum efficiency for the duration of the lease, usually 35 years, and to comply with Government contract procedures.</P>
    <P>This is undoubtedly a complicated process but it is difficult to see how any of it can be dispensed with.  Nevertheless, it seems to me that the time taken to establish briefs fully constitutes too large a part of the overall process.</P>
    <P>In the case 4-5 Harcourt Road, which was occupied by three separate Departments, receipt of briefs varied from November 1980 to November 1981, although each Department's requirements were requested at the same time. <Col N="1224" /> Preparation and agreement of plans and contract documents and placing of contract took five months.  Completion of work took seven months.  The briefing period is indicative of the difficulty which Departments have in determining their precise requirements.  We must appreciate that this is not in the normal course of these Departments' activities and therefore can pose particular problems. Perhaps in this area there may be room for improvements and I propose to have this aspect of the matter examined.</P>
    <P>The BIM development in Dún Laoghaire was referred to by Deputy Andrews.  The Office of Public Works were not involved in that.  Perhaps the Department of Posts and Telegraphs could give an answer in regard to it.  I was asked what our demands for accommodation are.  As of now, we are not involved in any negotiations in regard to office space but that does not mean the Office of Public Works will not get requests from Departments in the future. We are not involved at the moment.</P>

For private bodies the figure is £25.872 million which relates to an associated banks facility for agricultural purposes.  These guarantees have been issued at various dates from 1972 onwards.  The currencies from which the loans were raised included sterling, deutschemarks, Dutch guilders, Belgian francs, Swiss francs, US dollars, Australian dollars, Japanese yen with some small amount of Luxembourg <Col N="875" /> francs, Indian rupees, Saudia Arabian riyals, Kuwaiti dinars and United Arab Emirates dhirans.</P>

The information so far furnished to the inspector of taxes does not indicate how the payment of substantial loan interest and repayment of capital have been funded.

Following the execution of certain works in the harbour by CIE, the natural supply of sand diminished and difficulty arose in supplementing the supply.

      <P>I presume the dispute to which the Deputy refers is that between the management of the North Western Cattle Breeding Society Limited and its AI operators.  I understand that an agreed arbitrator has been examining the matter and has met both parties on a number of occasions recently.  It is hoped that the arbitrator's findings will be made available in the near future and that the dispute will then be resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Lenihan):</NameTxt>
      <P>A part-time farmer is eligible for the national 5 per cent interest subsidy <Col N="900" /> scheme provided that his income from an occupation outside farming is less than the national comparable income and provided that the family farm income is not in excess of that figure.  The EEC 5 per cent interest subsidy scheme and the reduced interest scheme for farmers in severe financial difficulty are confined to farmers who derive at least 50 per cent of their income from farming and spend more than 50 per cent of their working time on farming activities.  Accordingly, farmers with part-time jobs who meet these criteria are not excluded from the benefits of these schemes.</P>

      <P>Section 98 (1) of the Companies Act, 1963, applies to a receivership the provisions of section 285 of that Act in relation to preferential payments in a winding up.  The ESB are not listed among the preferential creditors and they are, therefore, in the same position as other unsecured creditors.</P>
      <P>I do not see any reason to alter this position particularly since, as I indicated recently during the debate on the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1981, any lengthening of the list of preferential creditors would damage the interests of employees where a company is being wound up or is in receivership.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> The price data available to me on comparative European prices is extremely tentative and does not provide a reliable basis for me to furnish accurate information in reply to the Deputy's question.</P>
    <P>From calculations which my Department have made, based on the latest oil company prices available from the EEC and our own estimates of the incidence of taxation on these products in the member states, it appears that the Irish consumer price is higher than the other member states prices with the exception of Denmark.  Unfortunately, because of the unreliability of the data and because I understand there is no consistency of approach by member states as to the prices reported, I am not in a position to give a price comparison as requested by the Deputy.  At best, all I can say is that our calculations show Irish prices to be about 5 pence per gallon above those in the UK, but also 5 pence per gallon below those pertaining in Denmark.</P>

      <P>In the joint North-South progress report on this area, which was issued by the two Governments in June 1980 and a copy of which is in the Dáil Library, a detailed account was given up to that stage of progress being made in the implementation of the Derry-Donegal Communications Study which was completed in November 1977.  On 18 November 1981, in a written answer to a question from Deputy Mervyn Taylor, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs gave an updating of the 1980 progress report so far as Donegal was concerned.  The following is an updating of the progress outlined in the 1980 joint progress report and in the former Minister's written answer of 18 November 1981.</P>
      <P>(A)  Roads (County Donegal)</P>
      <P>The first stage of the road programme for North Donegal as recommended by the consultants is being implemented in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Road grants allocated for work in the Donegal section of the study in 1982, including supplementary grants allocated from the Government's additional capital investment of £470,000 on the Letterkenny/Derry road (National Primary N13); £175,000 for the Stranorlar/Letterkenny route; £55,000 for strengthening works at various locations on the N15 and N56; £10,000 for road signs on the National Primary routes, and £100,000 for improvement works on proposed regional roads.  In addition to these grants totalling £810,000, a general block grant of <Col N="910" /> £1,212,100 has been allocated to Donegal County Council for 1982 for work, at the discretion of the council, on roads other than national roads.</P>
    <P>The detailed position regarding the road improvements in Donegal is as follows:</P>
    <P>Inter-Urban Roads</P>
    <P>(i)  Letterkenny-Pluck Cross, National Primary Route N13.</P>
    <P>Outline design has been completed, a detailed ground survey has been carried out and detailed road design is almost complete.  Subject to the availability of finance it is planned to commence construction in 1984.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Bridgend-Pluck Cross, National Primary Route N13.</P>
    <P>Two of the remaining sections of this route are included in current improvement programmes: (a) Newtowncunningham By-Pass; (b) Bridgend By-Pass.</P>
    <P>Scheme (a).  Land acquisition proceedings in progress.</P>
    <P>Scheme (b).  Final design being completed. Land acquisition proceedings in progress.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Letterkenny/Stranorlar, National Secondary route N56.  Work will continue on the improvement of this route near Bullock Park this year.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Urban through routes</P>
    <P>Letterkenny</P>
    <P>A scheme linking the Letterkenny/Pluck Cross and Letterkenny/ Kilmacrenna roads has been in progress since 1977 and was opened to traffic early in 1979.  Designs have been prepared and land acquisition negotiations are well advanced for the improvement of the Portbridge/Kilmacrennan road at its junction with the Railway road and the bus station.  Work will commence on this section this year and it is hoped to complete the relief road scheme from Portbridge to the Kilmacrennan road by the end of 1983.</P>
    <P>(B)  Telecommunications</P>
    <P>To date 14 exchanges in North Donegal have been converted to automatic working.  It is expected that another eight exchanges will be converted this year.  60 per cent of all subscribers in North Donegal will then have automatic <Col N="911" /> service.  Work towards converting the remaining exchanges is proceeding and all exchanges will be converted by 1984.</P>
    <P>The Sligo-Letterkenny radio link will be in service by mid 1982.</P>
    <P>Direct dialling between most automatic exchanges in the Republic and all Northern Ireland exchanges will be provided this year.</P>
    <P>(C)  Public Passenger Transport</P>
    <P>Assistance is being provided to the Lough Swilly Bus Company through the agency of CIE in consideration of the continued provision by the company of road passenger services in the North Donegal area.  Thirty seven secondhand buses, which have been acquired at a cost of £200,000, have been leased by CIE to the company.  The cost of these buses is recouped to CIE by the Exchequer, half the cost coming from the Non-Quota Section of the European Regional Development Fund.  In addition, CIE are making payments to the Swilly Company to assist with cash flow requirements arising out of losses being incurred on road passenger operations.</P>
    <P>The question of continued assistance to the Swilly Company is now being reviewed with a view to submission to Government.</P>

      <P>The views of the Government on sporting contacts with South Africa with specific reference to rugby football were made very clear during the controversy surrounding the IRFU tour in South Africa last year.  It remains the Government's view that sporting contacts of this kind serve only to support the apartheid system; a system that denies fundamental human rights to the vast majority of South Africans on the basis of their skin colour.  The Olympic Principle of NonDiscrimination in Sport cannot be satisfactorily observed in a situation in which the organisation of many sports in South Africa, including rugby football, continues to be largely determined by the organisation of society on the racially segregated lines of the apartheid system.</P>
      <P>The Government do not believe that participation by Irish players in the reported tour would be in the interests of justice in South Africa, of Ireland's international reputation, or of Irish sport.</P>
      <P>They hope that Irish players will not participate in the tour and that any players invited to take part will consider carefully their decision in the light of the Government's policy on sporting contacts with South Africa and in the light of the clear public concern expressed on the issue last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Collins):</NameTxt>
      <P>The British authorities have stated in reply to our request for an explanation of the delay that the captain of the submarine in question had been unaware that his vessel had been involved.  They have further explained that it was only as the investigation by our authorities continued that there were indications that a British vessel might have been involved, and it was necessary to have a full investigation before they could inform us with certainty that one of their submarines had caused the sinking. According to the British authorities these circumstances also accounted for the fact <Col N="915" /> that no effort had been made at the time to ensure the safety of the crew of the <i>Sharelga.</i></P>

    <P>(1)  These cases all relate to claims under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  Cases under other Acts dealt with by the tribunal do not normally last beyond one day's hearing but are sometimes linked with unfair dismissals claims which may be prolonged.</P>
    <P>(2)  The figures do not include cases which are re-entered because of the failure for good reasons of a party to attend.</P>
    <P>(3)  The 1980 figures include a number of bulk appeals against the same employers.</P>

    <P>The 1975 and 1977 EEC Labour Force Surveys provide some information on the extent of short-term absences in member states &mdash; short-term absences being mainly absences of one and two days' duration.  The rate of such absences in this country was 2.9 per cent in 1975 and <Col N="925" /> 3.7 per cent in 1977 compared to a community average of 4.3 per cent 1975 and 4.2 per cent in 1977.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald):</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Government announced the decentralisation programme in October 1980, Dundalk was the designated centre for a section of the <Col N="927" /> Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The number of staff to be transferred was approximately 300.  After the 1981 general election the incoming Government placed the programme under review and there it remained throughout their term of office.</P>
      <P>With our return to office the programme has been reactivated and arrangements are in hand for its early implementation.  Already tenders have been invited for the provision of the necessary office accomodation in five of the designated centres.  In the case of Dundalk planning has been delayed due to the difficulty of finding a suitable site.  A site is now in prospect and the planning stage will commence as soon as the site is secured.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the publication mentioned.  I strongly support the efforts which are being constantly made to ensure that all official forms are easily dealt with.  This involves both simplifying their content and improving their presentation.</P>
      <P>A great deal has already been done in this field by Government Departments. I consider that more remains to be done and so I have recently taken steps to have a special review made of forms and documents to try and make them as effective as possible.  Any improvements suggested by any Member of this House, or by anyone else will be warmly welcomed and will receive serious and sympathetic consideration.</P>

It is expected that, because of increased numbers of candidates and a reduction in the number of appointments, the figure for 1982 will be somewhat higher.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service what the provision in the budget estimates for 1982 in respect of the public service pension scheme would be if the scheme were funded on an actuarial basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald) Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald):</NameTxt>
      <P>As public service pension schemes are currently financed on a pay-as-you-go basis rather than from a fund the actuarial information that would <Col N="929" /> be needed in order to provide the answer to the Deputy's question is not available. I can, however, say that the information available to me in respect of the pension terms of established civil servants indicates that the actuarial cost of those terms is about 18 per cent of payroll.  On this basis, the cost of funding the year of service in question would be about £87,000,000.  Since the pay bill for established civil servants represents some 27 per cent of the public service pay bill, the cost of public service pensions on a corresponding basis would be considerably in excess of £87,000,000 but it is not possible to give an accurate estimate of that cost because of differences between the pension terms, age structures, etc. of the various groups involved.</P>

The final notices issued to subscribers who have not paid their accounts within the stipulated time provide that failing receipt of payment within a further seven days, service will have to be withdrawn. In addition, subscribers outside the &ldquo;01&rdquo; area from whom service is withdrawn are individually notified when this is being done, and in the &ldquo;01&rdquo; area only outgoing service is barred initially.</P>

      <P>The average speed of answer at the Central Telephone Exchange, Dublin, over the period was 21 seconds. Improvement in the standard of answering will come gradually through higher output and better management of the staff, by relief of congestion in the trunk network according as new trunk exchanges and more trunk circuits are brought into use, and by a reduction in the volume of calls to be answered through the spread of automatic working.</P>

The building to house the automatic exchange has been completed and the installation of the automatic equipment has been contracted for. The contractor's plans envisage that installation of equipment will commence early in 1983.  Allowing for the time taken by the contractor to install the equipment and for testing by Departmental staff, conversion to automatic working could be expected in the autumn of 1983.  However, the contractor has been requested to examine the possibility of bringing forward the installation of the equipment so that automatic service would be provided earlier.  I will advise the Deputy of the outcome of the consultation with the contractor as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>With regard to the extension of the convent primary school in Mallow, County Cork, it is understood from the Commissioners of Public Works that they expect to be in a position to report to my Department on costs etc. at an early date.  When the report has been considered in my Department, the question of authorising the invitation of tenders will be considered.</P>
      <P>With regard to Scoil Íosagáin, revised sketch plans for the proposed extension are being examined in the Office of Public Works prior to being submitted for consideration by my Department.  It was necessary to revise the plans because of an increase in the schedule of accommodation. The invitation of tenders does not arise at this stage of planning.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A development control plan for the General Hospital, Wexford, was approved in 1980.  In December 1981 the health board sought approval for the <Col N="987" /> erection of a new theatre suite at the rear of the existing hospital.  This proposal is not in accordance with what is envisaged in the development control plan and the board is being asked to examine the feasibility of constructing improved surgical facilities in accordance with the development control plan.</P>
    <P>In relation to paediatric accommodation at the hospital the health board have proposed the provision of temporary accommodation.</P>
    <P>I should say that I accept the need for the facilities mentioned.  However, the capital and revenue costs involved in the proposals are very substantial.  The previous Government made no provision for this scheme in the capital programme this year.  However, I will be keeping this matter under constant review to ensure that this scheme can proceed when circumstances permit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Dental services for medical card holders are provided by the health boards in two ways as follows: (1) At dental surgeries run by the dental staff of the health boards.  Those catered for are mainly the aged, the handicapped, nursing and expectant mothers and eligible adolescents, i.e. those who are between the ages of 12 and 16 years and are dependants of medical card holders; (2) By dentists in private practice under the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement whereby they provide dental services for medical card holders on behalf of the health boards.  Those who receive treatment from the dentists in private practice are generally adults other than those treated by the health boards' own dental staff.</P>
      <P>Due to the limited financial resources available to them this year some health boards found they were not in a position to provide as much money as they would wish for the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme.  In some cases a priority basis for the issue of authorisation for treatment was introduced. Where a priority system is in operation persons who are not in the priority groups may experience delays in obtaining treatment. However, services for the relief of pain are an absolute priority for all eligible persons.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with the level of the dental service available to medical card holders having regard to the present shortage of finance for the health services generally.</P>

He is not entitled to pay-related benefit from 5 April 1982 as he is precluded by Regulations from receiving more by way of disability benefit and pay-related benefit than the amount of his average weekly earnings in the relevant income-tax year 1979-80.

As she had less than 156 paid contributions to her credit since entry into insurance, she was not entitled to payment after 22 January 1982.  She <Col N="1004" /> cannot requalify for further payment of disability benefit until she resumes employment and has not less than 13 paid contributions in respect of insurable employment which is reckonable for disability benefit purposes.</P>

      <P>The position regarding pay-related benefit is that the weekly total of flat rate disability benefit and pay-related benefit may not exceed the claimant's average weekly reckonable earnings in the income tax year governing the claim.  As the claimant's weekly flat rate disability benefit in this case exceeds his average weekly reckonable earnings in the income tax year 1980-81, which governs his claim, he was not entitled to pay-related benefit.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was assessed with notional weekly means of £21.17 with effect from 27 January 1982 in respect of his land having a PLV of £18.35.  As the rate of unemployment assistance appropriate in his case, £20.70, was less than his means, viz £21.17, the person concerned did not qualify for unemployment assistance from 27 January 1982 when he ceased to claim. However, the rates of unemployment assistance were subsequently increased from 31 March 1982 and the person concerned would now qualify for £4.70 a week on the basis of his existing means being the new maximum rate in his case £25.90 less his means taken as £21.20 He appealed recently against the weekly means of £21.17 assessed in his case and further inquiries are being made before sending his case for consideration by an appeals officer.

      <P>All officers of my Department are required as part of their normal duties to be on the alert for possible abuses of the social welfare system and to refer for investigation any case in which suspected irregularities come to their notice.  This applies in particular in the case of outdoor staff of whom there are 60 social welfare supervisors, 249 social welfare officers and eight inspectors of agents.  These officers are mainly concerned with the investigation of means in the case of means tested benefits and ensuring that the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts in relation to social insurance are complied with.  Twenty eight officers are, however, specifically engaged on the investigation of abuses of the various schemes.  Of the 28 officers, ten are based in Dublin and 18 cover the rest of the country.  Although most of the officers do not have the official title of inspector their duties consist essentially of inspection work.</P>

In addition to this I have introduced a Bill in the Dáil to increase the authorised share capital of the company from £25 million to £50 million, and to increase the amount of borrowings which I may guarantee from £60 million to £75 million.</P>
      <P>The Government are fully aware that these measures will not ensure the long-term future of Irish Steel, but they are necessary to enable the company to operate while consultants study its prospects. These consultants will be appointed in the near future, and following their report, the Government will decide on the long-term future of the company.</P>

My Department's letter dated the 9 March 1981 advised the county council that the preparation of contract documents should be deferred until there is a major demand for group water supply scheme development in the area in view of the long term nature of the proposals to augment the water supply to Athenry. It is considered that the town of Athenry can be served in the short term by bore-hole sources and a scheme to replace a borehole pump is being carried out by the county council within its small water and sewerage schemes programme for 1982.</P>

      <P>In 1980-1981, local <Col N="1048" /> authorities carried out assessments of total housing requirements.  These assessments did not distinguish between private and local authority housing.  An analysis of the assessments is now practically completed. On 30 March 1982 I indicated in Dáil Éireann that I intend to press ahead with the publication of a White Paper on Housing around the end of this year, columns 907 and 908 of Official Report. The White Paper will set out the analysis of national housing requirements and the Government's programme to meet those requirements in terms of finance, housing production and the quality of housing and its environment.  The White Paper will also distinguish between housing provided by local authorities and by the private sector.</P>
      <P>The Government have set a production target of 6,000 local authority houses per annum.  Sufficient funds to achieve this target will be made available through the public capital programme and will be allocated to individual housing authorities on the basis of comparative urgency of need for funds to finance their local authority housing programmes.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the essential repairs grants scheme has, since its introduction in 1963, been confined by statute to houses located in county health <Col N="1049" /> districts.  This followed from the basic objective of the scheme which was to enable local authorities to give assistance for the carrying out of minimal repairs to prolong the lives of houses occupied by elderly persons where there would be no continuing need for a house after their death.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals at present to amend the regulations in order to extend the essential repairs scheme to urban areas nor, indeed, am I convinced that this would necessarily be the best way of dealing with the problem of unsatisfactory housing conditions of some elderly persons in urban areas.</P>
      <P>The Governments concern in this regard is however evidenced by the fact that a special provision of £1 million was made in this year's budget to finance an emergency programme to be undertaken by a task force to improve the living conditions of elderly persons living in insanitary or unfit accommodation.  I am satisfied that this approach is more flexible and sympathetic than a formally regulated grants scheme and that it will result in speedy action being taken where necessary on behalf of those living in unacceptable conditions.</P>

      <P>Prisoners or persons in detention serving sentences of one month or more may earn remission of up to one quarter of sentence by industry and good conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960 prisoners or persons in detention may be given what is called temporary release.

    <P>I accept responsibility for the release of all persons under the section quoted above.

There has been attempted intimidation of officers in my Department by criminals and their associates and I am not prepared to put officers at risk by giving details which would tend to identify officers working in this area.</P>

I can say, however, that as a result of the working of the special ground rents purchase scheme provided by the 1978 (No. 2) Act, some suggestions have been made for changes that might in some cases make for improvement in the scheme and I am prepared to consider them but there is no question of any legislation that would have the effect of confiscating existing ground rents or that would make the taxpayer liable for the cost of buying out the landlords' interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Doherty):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that 65 cases of personation were reported to the Garda in respect of the 1982 general election.  Prosecutions have already been taken in some of these cases and others are under investigation.  There were 51 reported cases in respect of the 1981 general election, resulting in 15 prosecutions and 14 convictions, and 20 <Col N="1076" /> reported cases in respect of the 1977 general election, resulting in 13 prosecutions and 12 convictions.  I should make it clear that the Minister for Justice has no function in relation to the taking of prosecutions.</P>
      <P>Quite clearly any increase in breaches of the law is a matter of concern to me and to the Government.  The question of what can be done about this type of offence is another matter.  The Garda authorities say that personation is difficult to detect especially in urban areas where personation agents and other officials, including gardaí, cannot identify all the voters on the list of electors.  They are further of the opinion that more use of personation agents by candidates would assist in the elimination of this offence. The recently enacted prevention of Electoral Abuses Act has clarified the provisions of the electoral law in relation to the offence of personation.</P>

The authorities are not in a position to extend the present local patrolling arrangements for the Malahide area but they say that there are of course arrangements for providing a police service for the area from the district headquarters at Coolock when the station at Malahide is closed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Doherty):</NameTxt>
      <P>While the law contains restrictions on the sale or possession of firearms, it does not apply itself directly to the sale or possession of many other items that could in certain circumstances be misused, through negligence or otherwise, such as catapults, sling-shots, cross-bows or even knives, though of course the carrying of an offensive weapon by a person intending to commit a felony is an offence.</P>
      <P>As regards sling-shots, I understand that more types than one are available in other countries but I am informed by the Garda that they have no reports that would suggest that the particular type of sling-shot that has appeared on the market here poses a serious problem.  They are, however, keeping the matter under review.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate the difficulties of legislating against specific weapons or articles which could be used offensively or dangerously but which also have legitimate or innocent uses, all the more so as new items tend to come on the market from time to time, but, when an opportunity presents itself, I propose to consider whether there should be some strengthening of the law about offensive weapons generally.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 969 and 970 together.</P>
      <P>The detailed deployment of members of the force is a matter to be decided primarily by the Garda authorities and the strength assigned to the various stations is reviewed from time to time to take account of changing needs and circumstances. The strength at Coolock and Raheny stations on 21 June 1982 was 80 and 50, respectively.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that in the period from 16 April 1982, when a number of newly-trained recruits took up duty, to 21 June 1982 an additional ban-garda was assigned to Whitehall station, the strength at Coolock station was increased by one sergeant and three gardaí and the strength at Raheny station by two ban-ghardaí.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are not in a position at present to provide for any further increases in strength at any of the five stations mentioned in the questions but the needs of the areas will be reviewed according as additional manpower currently in training becomes available for assignment.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Question Nos. 973, 974 and 975 together.</P>
      <P>The area of Donaghmede, the Donaghies, Grange Abbey and Millbrook Estate, Raheny, is one of a number of areas in and around Dublin where there is a local demand for a new Garda station. The difficulty about providing extra Garda stations, apart from difficulties associated with getting suitable sites and the high building costs involved, is that manning them absorbs Garda manpower which might possibly be used more effectively on patrol duty in the area.</P>
      <P>The area referred to is at present serviced by Coolock and Raheny Garda stations and it is intended to allocate a number of additional gardaí to these stations at the earliest possible date.  This will provide a better Garda presence over the whole area covered by these stations and may obviate the need for a separate station in the Donaghmede vicinity.  The situation, however, will be kept under review to see whether the measure which I have outlined will adequately meet the police needs of the areas in question.</P>

    <P>In redeploying members of the force, it is inevitable that Garda strength will be reduced in some areas in which, in the professional judgment of the Garda authorities, the need for current levels of strength is not as great as in other areas.

I am informed by them that no reduction in Garda strength in Cork is proposed.

    <P>As regards the specific stations mentioned by the Deputy, the juvenile liaison officer attached to Rathfarnham station covers the Rathfarnham and Tallaght areas and the officer based at Blackrock station covers the Blackrock and Dundrum areas.</P>
    <P>In addition to the members who act as juvenile liaison officers, there is an administrative unit at Garda Headquarters which deals full-time with the Juvenile Liaison Scheme and Garda Community Relations.  The unit comprises 2 inspectors, 2 sergeants and 1 garda.</P>
    <P>Members are selected by the Garda authorities as juvenile liaison officers on the basis of previous youth involvement and general suitability and are required to undergo a special residential training course of a month's duration covering a range of subjects relevant to the work and duties of a juvenile liaison officer. These courses are held in the Garda Training Centre, Templeogue.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that a television set was removed by a detective garda sergeant from the home of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 12 over a year ago and that following representations by Deputy Gay Mitchell the Garda Commissioner indicated by letter dated 19 May 1982 that the set had been returned by the garda concerned; if, in view of the serious infringement of the rights of the person concerned, the treatment meted out to her when she called to the local Garda Station and the fact that the set has not yet been returned, he will take special action to ensure that the set is returned; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Doherty):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the televison set was returned to the person in question on 11 June 1982.  The set was seized for identification purposes <Col N="1091" /> by the Garda on 30 January 1981 during a search of the person's house, conducted pursuant to a search warrant.  The Garda had received information alleging that there was a stolen television in the house. The occupant claimed to have purchased the set from an unknown man in a public house for £100.  Having regard to what they regarded as the suspicious circumstances surrounding the purchase of the set, the Garda were anxious to trace its origin and the identity of the seller. Numerous inquiries were made for that purpose but without success.</P>
      <P>Following an approach by the Deputy to the Commissioner's Office in May 1982, the detective sergeant concerned signified his intention to return the set on 14 May 1982 and the Commissioner's letter of 19 May 1982 issued on the mistaken assumption that the member had in fact carried out his stated intention.  The Commissioner has expressed his regret that the Deputy should have been misinformed in the matter.  The member has explained that he called to the house on 14 May 1982 but got no reply and overlooked informing his authorities of the non-return of the set.  The member has further explained that, because of other more pressing duties, he did not get an opportunity until recent days to return the set.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities state that the Garda at Tallaght station have no precise recollection of the person having called to the station but the authorities have no reason to believe that she was shown any discourtesy.</P>
