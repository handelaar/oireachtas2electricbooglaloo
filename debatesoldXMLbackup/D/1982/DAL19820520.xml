      <NameTxt>Mr. Bellew</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I was directing the Minister's attention to the problem facing the Army, the Department and the Minister in relation to the housing of Army personnel. This is a problem that falls into three distinct categories.  The first would be the housing of troops who live in military barracks.  A great improvement has been made over the past ten years in this connection but particularly in the areas <Col N="1785" /> that have been reactivated as military posts since the early seventies.  I recognise, as do all who are interested in defence matters, the contributions made by successive Governments in this field especially as regards &mdash; and I speak for the areas with which I am familiar &mdash; Dundalk, Gormanston, Castleblaney and Monaghan.  Very fine new living accommodation has been provided at these locations and it is only proper that those who serve in the Defence Forces should have first class billets provided for them.  In the areas mentioned the new accommodation is greatly appreciated. So are the new dining hall facilities at these centres.  It is only right that the military barracks we inherited from the British administration should be brought up to date.  Investment in them is well worthwhile and is greatly appreciated by the troops who are serving there.  I hope this programme will be extended and continued in the country generally in the future.</P>
      <P>The second category is that of married quarters, the area which probably gives rise to most contention and friction within and without the Army when Ministers or Deputies are dealing withe problems relating to soldiers housed in this type of accommodation.  The Minister might profitably direct his attention and energy to this area.  With one or two rare exceptions there is no doubt that the housing accommodation provided in married quarters is substandard.</P>
      <P>The Army housing situation in Dublin is relevant and I have no doubt the Minister will try to ensure that the position throughout the country will be eased. The 24 families in Griffith Square have been moved to Tallaght.  The Arbour Hill quarters were inspected by Dublin Corporation and of the 81 units 70 were found to be substandard.  A similar situation exists at Cathal Brugha Barracks. I did service there and I know that years ago the accommodation was substandard. I appreciate that the Minister only recently took up responsibility in the Department and I feel sure he will take action to remedy these difficulties which we have inherited over a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1786" /> The situation in Dublin exists also in other barracks and it contributes to low morale among the men, who are obliged to live in such terrible accommodation. I submit that the Department profitably might relinquish their role in the provision of married quarters and hand over their responsibility to the local authorities in towns and cities in which garrisons are stationed &mdash; that the local authorities would take over, in their general housing programmes, the responsibility to house Army personnel.</P>
    <P>In Dundalk we have had a satisfactory experience in this regard.  The local authority took over completely the responsibility to provide Army housing and we have not found that their housing list has contained any more soldiers than other categories.  In Dundalk, the married quarters were demolished 10 years ago and replaced by a local authority housing scheme.  Not all of those houses were allocated to Army personnel and we do not seem to have any trouble about providing accommodation for soldiers, whose names appear on the housing list side by side with those of ordinary applicants. Per head of the Army population in the area we have had less difficulty than exists elsewhere, according to what Deputies have told me.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that the Department should relinquish their role in this matter. They could transfer some of their land holdings on a sort of <i>quid pro quo</i> basis to the local authorities who would then have suitable land available for house construction.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware of the problem of overholding of married quarters. Serving soldiers faced with retirement find difficulty in getting alternative accommodation outside the Army.  It is understandable that we are not all as good as we might be in making provision for the future, and soldiers are not any different from others in this respect. When they leave the Army they may not have made arrangements to provide themselves with alternative accommodation, and consequently there is the problem of overholding.  This in turn causes the Department to withhold pensions with resulting general friction and <Col N="1787" /> hardship.  Unfortunately, this gives a bad impression of Army life.  I am sure many Deputies sympathise with the situation in which men who have given long service to the Army, and their families, find themselves when they leave the Army but have not made any arrangements for alternative accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Army Equitation School and rightly spoke of the achievements of our riders in 1981.  I suggest there is a need for revision in this establishment.  Heretofore all Army riders have been commissioned officers. Surely, the horses are capable of jumping successfully for NCOs?  I am sure the horses would not be able to distinguish the quality of the cloth or the insignia on the shoulders of the riders.  The figures are about ten to one in favour of non-commissioned officers and men and surely, if we have proficient riders from the rank of private, they could be promoted to non-commissioned ranks and compete as efficiently as commissioned officers.  I am sure we would find privates and non-commissioned officers featuring in the winners lists.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to courses for men in the ranks which would enable them to graduate to the commissioned grades.  I hope further courses have been planned and that there will not be any limitation of the grades to which such soldiers subsequently could graduate.  I hope that implementation of my suggestion would not limit the places for commissioned officers.</P>
    <P>We should have no scarcity of educational courses for all ranks in the Army. I suggest that pre-retirement courses should be arranged for Army personnel who have spent quite a considerable time in the service, to prepare them for adjustment to civilian life and to train them for opportunities that might exist in civilian life when they have finished their commitment to the Army.  The absence of these courses leads to a high wastage among junior NCOs and other ranks who should comprise the frame on which the Army of the future will be built.  Without the continuity of supply of trained NCOs, the system will break down.  Facilities <Col N="1788" /> should be provided in order to ensure that these people, who have been trained at great expense to the State, will be retained by the Army for its future.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the FCA and the Civil Defence Force who appear to be the Cinderellas of the Defence Forces. At times they are unjustly criticised and perhaps not as well treated by the Department or their services acknowledged as they should be.  The FCA are as fine a body of men as you will find anywhere who, since their inception, have given dedicated service to the State.  I am delighted to note in the Minister's speech that he has taken a decision to retain FCA personnel who are serving at present in a full-time capacity with the Permanent Defence Force.  Many of them gave up their civilian jobs to do so and served, if needed, when the Permanent Defence Force was not up to its full strength.  I am glad the Minister has reversed the decision which the former Minister contemplated making.  The Minister's decision is very much appreciated by FCA personnel.</P>
    <P>I should like to acknowledge a debt to these people, many of whom serve in my own constituency.  In the early seventies they were required to man the barracks which were being re-activated at that stage and they gave up their time, freely and voluntarily, to do this.  Some of them gave up their jobs to serve in a full-time capacity.  This force is a vital adjunct to the Permanent Defence Force.  In the seventies it was used very extensively to carry out security duties on vital installations and in assisting the Garda Síochána in manning road checks, especially in Border areas.  Regrettably, for some reason the use of this force seems to have declined in latter times and there is a feeling among many of the personnel involved that they are being rejected.  I understand FCA officers and NCOs are not allowed to serve together or to go on duty together in any permanent capacity. If there is a reason for this, in order to foster good public relations the Minister should explain the position to them.  Perhaps there is a military reason for it.  They are trained personnel who are disciplined and dedicated and quite willing to accept <Col N="1789" /> orders which are transmitted to them, but they would appreciate an explanation.</P>
    <P>The other area of grievance is the question of taxation on the bounty or gratuity which they receive each year and which is only given to them provided they have completed a specified number of hours in the force during the course of the year. I do not think anybody would object to provision being made for this gratuity to be paid to them on a tax-free basis.  After all, they have sacrificed many hours of their spare time at weekends to participate in field days and at mid-week in parades to bring their efficiency up to 100 per cent.  They serve in all types of weather and accept any duties allotted to them.  When they go to their summer camp they find that the Revenue Commissioners want to take a sizeable portion of the gratuity paid to them.  They feel this is unjust and perhaps the Minister would examine this area and see if anything can be done.</P>
    <P>Uniforms seem to be in short supply and is leading to a restriction on the numbers of recruits that can be accepted into the various units of the FCA.  They would also like the question of the lack of transport to be examined.  They often have to hire vehicles from private contractors.  It has been pointed out to me that the Department of Defence auction what are described as surplus vehicles which in many instances are of good quality and could be easily brought up to a standard suitable for use by the FCA if they were allotted to the various companies and groups in different locations throughout the country.  Much of this equipment is in good condition and it has been suggested to me that it is sold at knock-down prices to outside bidders when it could be profitably used by this force.  Many of the people who serve in the FCA are competent drivers in civilian life and I do not think there should be any fear on the part of the Department of Defence to consider this aspect, rather than having these vehicles sold to outside people.  If members of the FCA have to go to a rifle range there should be a military vehicle at their disposal.</P>
    <P>While Civil Defence should be the responsibility of the Department of <Col N="1790" /> Defence, it is more particularly the responsibility of the Minister of State at that Department.  This is an organisation of dedicated and disciplined people who give their service on a part-time basis in a voluntary capacity for the betterment of society generally.  They are also to be commended for the sacrifices they make in this field.  We are all aware in our local communities of the very great amount of work that they do in other fields outside civil defence.  In my area they are noted for their great involvement with the mentally handicapped.  One might say that has nothing to do with defence, but it is an indication of the commitment of these people that, when they have not got duties directly related to the Civil Defence organisation, they are prepared to put their time and energies at the disposal of the less advantaged members of society.  I commend them for their work in these fields.</P>
    <P>However they feel they are ignored. Indeed, the whole of the Civil Defence system requires re-examination in regard to its role and chain of command.  I understand that the various county managers are the co-ordinators of this force. That is not a suitable arrangement because it is dependent on the interest of a particular individual whether any resources are made available or any interest shown in the force.  Their equipment in all instances is decrepit and incapable of being used on most occasions.  They possess a number of fire engines.  I know that in Dundalk one of these engines is incapable of being used because of the absence of vital spare parts.  There is little hope for the morale of an organisation which finds that the work for which they have been trained cannot be carried out because of their equipment being unusable. Some of their rescue trucks are of the fifties vintage and might also be examined in relation to the matter I have mentioned already in respect of the disposal of surplus Army vehicles.  Perhaps the Civil Defence force could be provided with more up-to-date vehicles from that source rather than having such vehicles auctioned.  The ambulances they use are also of ancient vintage.  This type of <Col N="1791" /> equipment does not act as an encouragement to this force and certainly has been a contributory factor to the decline of their morale.  Many of us are aware from our local communities the worthwhile efforts of this force, particularly in the blizzards and floods of the past winter when, unfortunately, their efforts were not co-ordinated.  In many instances they were not called on to carry out the functions for which they have been trained and in other areas they were ignored totally.  They are a corps of dedicated and responsible people, willing to offer their services to the nation and its people without cost to the Exchequer and should be accepted and acknowledged as such.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will urge a review of the entire Civil Defence system so that these volunteers will be given renewed hope that their training can be put to worthwhile use.  I might express the hope that they would themselves that, while they are being trained for events we all hope will never happen, at least they be afforded the facilities to prepare themselves and the nation for any eventuality, that, apart altogether from their primary function, they be available in the event of any natural disaster, when again their training could be put to good use.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  Coming, as he does, from the county of Kildare and the fact that that county has been synonymous with the Army over a long period of time, I have no doubt but that he will devote his undoubted energies to the problems confronting the Army.  I know the Minister will continue the work of his Department in a proper and humane fashion and that his consideration at all times will be for the welfare and interests of those who serve the country in our Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him long-lived success in all that he undertakes for the welfare and advancement of our Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Estimate before the House, I sincerely hope that the moneys provided will prove to be adequate to meet the needs of the Department for the <Col N="1792" /> ensuing year, that we shall not be presented with a situation such as occurred last year during the term of office of the Minister's predecessor when, long before the end of the financial year, moneys ran out to the tune of some £10 million and there was none left to pay the wages of our soldiers and other personnel involved.  The then Minister, James Tully, took over responsibility for that Department and was obliged to introduce a Supplementary Estimate last November to make good that shortfall in the amount of £28 million.  Underestimation of this kind when dealing with matters appertaining to the defence of our country and its people is reckless, irresponsible and undermines our front line of defence.  I am sure that must also have had a most demoralising effect on the men and women of our Defence Forces. Therefore, let us ensure that in respect of this Estimate we have an honest appraisal of the present situation, that we shall not witness again the situation that obtained when the Coalition Government took over in the summer of last year and found a financial crisis in the Department of Defence &mdash; a crisis, in fact, which ranged over all Departments of State at that time.  With regard to the shortfall, I might say that I observe no provision in this Estimate for wage and salary increases for all the personnel involved in the Army, Naval Service and the Air Corps. I feel sure that omission will be rectified as all of us would be much happier, especially the men and women of the Defence Forces, if such provision was made in this Estimate today.  Surely the amount of money involved is known, or can be estimated, and it is rather surprising it was not included in this Estimate today.</P>
    <P>The basis of this State's foreign policy is neutrality and that policy was scrupulously upheld during the Second World War.  It is demonstrated still in our continued refusal to join NATO.  But, if we commit ourseleves to neutrality, then we have the consequential responsibility of taking steps to defend that commitment and that is the primary role of our Defence Forces.  In that respect, while we can express some satisfaction at the strength of our Army, one must be concerned <Col N="1793" /> at the pitiful size of our Air Corps and Navy.  This should be rectified.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence has a special role to play.  He should be the Minister who embodies the State policy of refusing to take sides on issues of international controversy.  That is why the Minister's recent outburst at Edenderry was so unacceptable and so damaging.  It was not his function to comment one way or the other on where the blame lay in the Falklands crisis.  By doing so in such an intemperate fashion he compromised our neutrality and caused confusion in international circles about our policy stance in this sensitive area.  The Minister owed it to the House to give an explanation for his outburst.  He would have restored his credibility and that of the Government by coming into the House and withdrawing those remarks.  His failure to do so has put a question mark over his suitability to hold the high office with which he has been entrusted.  I am glad to note that the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, has dissociated himself from the Edenderry outburst.  I congratulate him for his courage and his honesty.  The Minister will have an opportunity of clarifying his position when he replies to this debate.  If he fails to do so he should take the only honourable course open to him. The House and the country know what that course should be.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with the Minister and the other Deputies in paying tribute to our Defence Forces who provide an invaluable service of varying types for our people such as a peacekeeping force abroad and at home as an aid to the civil power.  They play a magnificent role for which the House is very grateful.  Wherever there is an emergency the Army, the Naval Service, the Air Corps, the FCA and Civil Defence can be relied on to give of their best.  The services we value most highly are the security duties they perform, the wonderful work of the air rescue teams, the helicopter service, the ambulance mission service which brings gravely ill patients to places of special treatment.  The evacuation of civilians from hazards like snow, and ice, the delivery of foodstuffs and medicines to <Col N="1794" /> isolated homes and communities and the provision of animal foodstuffs in snowbound areas, the delivery of essential commodities to hospitals and clearing snow by our Defence Forces are highly valued.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that some of the services the Defence Forces are called on to perform could be done effectively by others for themselves.  I have in mind particularly that the time, effort and cost involved in bringing money to and from our banks could be saved by the banks doing this work themselves or else paying for it.  It seems wrong that in difficult times so many of our gardai and Army personnel are tied up in work of this kind when there is so much violence and vandalism throughout the country.  It is difficult to understand why our banks do not provide this service for themselves, or if they need it they should be asked to pay for it.</P>
    <P>The real work of the Defence Forces was brought home to everybody in the early part of the year when whole communities were cut off for days and large numbers of animals were dying of starvation in the appalling weather conditions. There were harrowing scenes in Wicklow and other parts of the country, as well as my own constituency of South Tipperary and West Waterford.  I witnessed the speed and the effectiveness with which the Army and Air Corps acted on that occasion and the expertise, courage and daring of all the men concerned. In the first few days of the heavy snowfall last January I received an appeal for a helicopter service to provide fodder for a large number of animals, especially sheep, in the Nire Valley, Ballymacarbery area of Clonmel.  The situation was critical.  Many sheep were already dead and thousands more were threatened with death by starvation.  When I received that message I immediately phoned the office of the Minister for Defence, the former Deputy Tully, and I informed him of the need for a helicopter service as quickly as possible to relieve the situation.  The Minister's response was magnificent.  Within an hour he communicated with me and told me to contact the local garda sergeant at Ballymacarbery, <Col N="1795" /> direct him to secure a landing base and to light a fire for any helicopter crew to observe.  He told me also to communicate with the farmers concerned and advise them to bring to the landing base as many bales of hay as they considered necessary to feed the sheep involved.  He told me that he would secure the largest helicopter possible and that it would arrive at the landing base at Ballymacarbery at 9 a.m. the following norming.</P>
    <P>I conveyed the news to all concerned and the following morning I was present when the helicopter landed.  It was manned by two officers and immediately the great work of loading the hay began. A local farmer who knew where the sheep were located was taken on board. The work continued for the greater part of the day.  The helicopter ranged around the Comeragh mountains and the crew did not leave until they were satisfied that all the sheep had been catered for.  I wish to put on record my appreciation of the two gallant officers concerned for the magnificent job they performed.  They won the acclaim of all of us.  Prior to that operation the officer commanding and the men of Kickham Barracks, Clonmel, had gone out through ice and snow and made their way up the Comeragh mountains to ensure that the people of that area were provided with food and fuel.  I wish to express my heartfelt gratitude to all concerned in these operations &mdash; the then Minister for Defence, the officer commanding the men, the Garda at Ballymacarbery and everyone who was involved in any way in the outstanding work done on that occasion, work that was way beyond the call of duty.</P>
    <P>These people braved the elements and endured great hardship in going to the aid of the civilian population.  We can be very proud of them, but we must follow this up by showing our respect for them. We must ensure, for instance, that all those in the Defence Forces are provided with the best accommodation possible and also with the best conditions of work in terms of wage and salary scales.  It is heartening to know that we have men of such calibre to call on in emergency situations. It is a great source of consolation <Col N="1796" /> to us to know also that in our Defence Forces there are people who are equipped, trained and ready to go to the aid of the civilian population in times of need.  That is why we owe to the men and women of our Defence Forces &mdash; the Army, the Naval Service, the Air Corps, the FCA and the ancillary services &mdash; the best that this House can provide for them.  It is as a result of the role played by our soldiers abroad that this country, though small in terms of world powers, has played a major role in maintaining world peace, especially in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>Because our forces have the opportunity of serving in so many parts of the world there is a great incentive to young men and women to join the Defence Forces and to make Army life a career. Life in the Army can be productive, exciting and adventurous and is an attractive career for young men and women especially in times of such high unemployment. In these circumstances I urge the Minister to accelerate the recruiting drive and to find places in our Defence Forces for many more men and women.</P>
    <P>In that context, too, I urge the Minister to make more places available in the Army apprentice training schools so that many more young men and, perhaps women also, may secure a trade which they can then pursue either in the Defence Forces or in civilian life.  The places provided are only few.  There are 60 vacancies in the Army sector and only 50 in the Air Corps section.  Because of the high numbers of young men and women who cannot find employment the Minister should increase out of all proportion the intake into the apprentice training schools.</P>
    <P>The repair and renovation of Army barracks has been referred to.  It is a matter that is usually raised during the debate on the estimate.  The conditions in which men and women of the Army and of the other Defence Forces services are obliged to live and work are in many instances deplorable.  In many cases, the housing accommodation is disgraceful.  I am aware of some that would be deemed by any local authority as being unfit for human habitation.  There is a problem <Col N="1797" /> also in relation to members of the Defence Forces securing alternative accommodation on retirement.  It is disgraceful for any Minister for Finance to harass and intimidate any tenant of an Army house, who gave a lifetime of service to the Army, to get out, and back up these threats by allegedly withdrawing appropriate gratuities at times.  This is not right or proper.  I ask the Minister to take steps to ensure that there is consultation between his Department and local authorities with a view to ensuring alternative housing for retiring Army personnel and all Army personnel who are in need of housing.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has a large military complex in his constituency, and I see from the Estimate that he is taking good care of it.  That is rightly so.  The improvement works and new buildings being provided at the Curragh, Naas and Portlaoise are badly required and perhaps long overdue.  The Minister, however, should not be too parochial in these matters, especially when we are dealing with very limited financial resources.  He must not forget the needs of the troops elsewhere. He must not fail to carry out improvement to other Army barracks. He must not fail to provide houses for troops in other centres.</P>
    <P>Many of the old Army barracks were built during the British regime.  They were invariably burned out during the War of Independence.  They are drab, dreary and dilapidated buildings.  They need to be replaced and brought up to modern standards.  The Minister should undertake a scheme to provide new military baracks.  I may become a little parochial in this regard when I say to the Minister the Kickham Barracks, Clonmel, is in the category I referred to &mdash; an old British barracks gutted by fire in the early twenties.  Instead of trying to shore up these old barracks, new structures should be provided at centres such as Clonmel in keeping with the needs of a modern Army.  We have an obligation to do all we can to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, naval personnel, Air Corps, and so on.</P>
    <P>We receive reports about appalling working conditions and bad housing in <Col N="1798" /> respect of the Defence Force personnel at second hand in this House.  We have a right to know what precisely is happening, especially so those who are spokesmen for their parties in matters appertaining to defence.  I ask the Minister to consider sympathetically the establishment of an all-party committee of the House which would have a right to inspect these situations and report at first hand on what they see.  I put it to the Minister that such an inspection team could do nothing but good and would improve the morale of all the people involved.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to be generous in respect of the payment of wages, salaries and pensions to members of the Defence Forces.  Pensions should relate to the high cost of living and the fall in value of money.  Those who have to retire should be able to do so in the knowledge that their pension is such that they can live in decent comfort, whether they retire in the normal course or are obliged to do so through injury or illness.  They should be able to retire in reasonable comfort without the fear of privation or want.  I am not satisfied that the present pension schemes are adequate.  They need to be reviewed.  The Minister can afford to be more generous to the old IRA veterans from the War of Independence.  The pension paid to many of these is paltry indeed.  It is an insult to those who achieved for us the independence we enjoy today.  There are 4,600 veterans left on pension.  Regretfully they are pasing away at the rate of 600 a year.  I urge the Minister to act quickly in this area. Let us respect them and help them now. We owe them a deep debt of gratitude. Let it be in a tangible form before they all pass away.  Let it be a decent emolument. The cost of living bears very heavily on these old warriors and they have no one to fight for them.  That is why I advert to their plight today.</P>
    <P>In respect of special duties assigned to members of the Defence Forces, especially soldiers, particularly in the Border area, I was appalled to learn that the additional pay in respect of an officer amounts to £15.40 weekly and in respect of the men an increase over the normal <Col N="1799" /> rate of £13.30.  That is absolutely scandalous. When one considers the hazards and dangers involved, the fact that these men are away from home and the disruption of family life involved, it is a miserable pittance.  It needs to be looked at immediately and I ask the Minister to do so in equity and justice.</P>
    <P>The last speaker refered to the lack of suitable uniforms especially for members of the FCA.  I communicated with the Minister's Department to alert him about the problem &mdash; it applies to recruits also &mdash; of such personnel not being properly attired, part civilian and part military garb.  It is demoralising and a reflection on the Force and something the public will not condone.  The Minister should tell the House what is happening in respect of the provison of new uniforms. He should tell us if there is an adequate supply and what is being done to carry out effective distribution of the uniforms required, particularly in respect of FCA personnel.</P>
    <P>It was a source of great pleasure to those of us who have an interest in Army life to learn that for the first time a course for potential officers from the ranks of NCOs was being embarked upon.  It is the first time that NCOs are being afforded an opportunity to attain officer status.  The move has been welcomed by Army personnel.  Some 25 non-commissioned officers were selected last October to undergo a 12-month course with a view to becoming officers in the Army.  That was a fine democratic decision and I applaud it.  It is only right and proper that corporals and sergeants, men of high calibre, training, expertise and knowledge, should be afforded an opportunity to wear the Sam Browne belt.  I regret that the figure was kept as low as 25 and I urge the Minister to increase it gradually to give men and women from the lesser ranks an opportunity of becoming officers in an army which they serve so well.</P>
    <P>However, I am concerned about one aspect of this great scheme.  I am satisfied from the information made available to me that proper notice was not given to our soldiers in respect of this proposal. The personnel who were likely to be <Col N="1800" /> called for this course were not properly informed.  I am aware that in one instance a person was called by telephone.  There was no communication with Army personnel or any information given.  That has caused an element of suspicion and mistrust.  It is a pity it happened in respect of the launching of this worthwhile project. I ask the Minister to ensure that when this course for potential officers from the ranks is embarked upon again proper notice is given.  All ranks should be made aware of the course, especially the men and women directly concerned with the promotion opportunity from the ranks.  Selection should be done in a fair and impartial manner.</P>
    <P>It has also been represented to me, in respect of our troops serving abroad with the UN, that the rates of pay for officers and men as laid down by the United Nations are not paid to them.  Is it true that the UN rates applicable to serving officers and men abroad is not being paid by the Department to our personnel?  If that is so the Minister should tell the House why.  Why should we pay our personnel less than the amount they are entitled to particularly when personnel from other countries serving with the UN abroad are paid the proper amount? There should not be any differentiation. Serving abroad with the UN is not the holiday many people believe it is.  It is a very arduous, severe and dangerous task. There have been casualties.  The Minister should look into the question of pay for service abroad and see to it that our personnel are paid the salary and wages laid down by the United Nations for foreign service with a peace-keeping force.  Let us not be niggardly in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedBrennan" hpid="Mr. N. Brennan Mr. N. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not often that an ex-NCO has an opportunity of addressing the House on an Estimate for the Department of Defence.  I listened with interest to the contribution of other Deputies and I appreciate their views about the Army. Having served as a private and NCO I am aware of the conditions that exist in the Army and the changes that are necessary in the various barracks.  I should like to congratulate Deputy Power on his appointment as Minister for Defence.  He <Col N="1801" /> represents Kildare, a county where I was stationed on many occasions during my Army service.  From my contact with officers and men I learned that 15,000 is the minimum needed in the Army.  The last Government introduced an embargo on further recruitment but that should be lifted.  At a time of high unemployment it is unrealistic to say that we should only recruit up to 300 people.  I can recall the glossy brochures that were issued in an effort to attract young people into the Army and this is the first time I can remember supply exceeding the demand.</P>
      <P>This is an indication that the embargo in this area should be lifted.  If there are 500 applications for admission to the Defence Forces the Minister should do everything possible to recruit those people.  In a large organisation such as the Army there is bound to be a lot of normal wastage.  There must be an adequate number of NCOs to train the troops, and this process takes about 18 months.  I speak as someone who has served both as a private and as an NCO.</P>
      <P>I welcome the recruitment of women to the Defence Forces and I was very impressed by the smartness and neatness of some of these ladies at Arbour Hill recently.</P>
      <P>The question of married quarters has been mentioned, and I am well aware that some soldiers when retiring overhold their quarters.  When I left the Army I was not occupying married quarters but I know many former soldiers whose gratuities and pensions were delayed because they were overholding.  The system should be reviewed, because it is not acceptable that men who have served their country and may be finding is difficult to obtain work should be penalised because they are unable to vacate married quarters due to the difficulty of finding alternative accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of Dublin City Council, and I visited the married quarters at Arbour Hill in the company of corporation officials and Army officers.  Of the dwellings inspected on 25 February last year 88 were found to be substandard, and I found this very disheartening. I would have recommended that the place be bulldozed and rebuilt, because we <Col N="1802" /> should not expect people to live in such conditions.</P>
    <P>Married quarters are a legacy of colonial days when the troops stationed here were not our own people.  The soldiers now occupying those barracks are our own flesh and blood.  This matter might best be dealt with by the local authority. Some Army personnel have been housed in Tallaght and the corporation tried to keep them close together.  Of 89 flats inspected in Cathal Brugha Barracks 75 were found to be substandard, and the Army authorities and the Minister must examine this matter.</P>
    <P>I also recommend consideration of the possibility of handing over all these sites to the corporation.  There would be mutual advantages in such a move. Arbour Hill, Griffith Square and Cathal Brugha Barracks are prime sites.  The amount provided in the Estimate for improvements at these places might not be well spent, and I would rather see the erection of new buildings.</P>
    <P>Soldiers are entitled to apply for local authority houses in the same way as other citizens, and many of them now occupy such houses.  This Government have allocated £91 million to Dublin Corporation for housing purposes, and if some sort of swap of land could be arranged between the Army and the corporation, a high percentage of the new houses could be allocated to soldiers.  This would be good for their morale.</P>
    <P>A deputy who spoke earlier mentioned promotion opportunities within the Defence Forces.  When I was in the Army the only opportunity for NCOs was to become quarter-masters or administrative officers, and the number of such courses was very limited.  I welcome the extension of opportunities for NCOs to become commissioned officers, because I am satisfied that there are many men and women in the Defence Forces who are capable of doing the job.  This is a welcome departure from the position which obtained in the old days.  I served under fine officers, and many of them are now my friends, but there should be opportunities for NCOs and men with the capacity to do the job.</P>
    <P>I would hope that upon leaving the <Col N="1803" /> Army soldiers would be given special preference in regard to jobs in State Departments.  If we are to pay more than lip service, if our contributions here are to mean anything, special marks should be given to people who are prepared to serve in the Defence Forces.  That was the case after the last emergency and going into the fifties.  If you had served in the Defence Forces you got extra marks in various examinations and when applying for various jobs Army service was a bonus.  I do not recollect getting any such bonus when I left the Army, and at that time one had to look around for a job, but at that time it seemed that that mechanism to cater for people leaving the Army did not exist.  Many people who have served in the Army are in Government Departments and they are very good workers.  Some machinery should be set up whereby people serving in the Army, some of them only 39 or 40 years of age or even less if they joined at 16 or 17, who are quite capable of filling jobs outside the services would get preference for such jobs.</P>
    <P>Many people say that the age of retirement from the Army is too low.  An officer can retire after 12 years' service with a modified pension, but an NCO cannot retire under the same conditions.  I believe that an NCO has to serve for a minimum of 21 years before he is entitled to a pension.  What applies to officers should apply also to the NCOs and men. If an officer can retire after 12 years' service and get a pension I do not object, but the same yardstick should apply to NCOs and men in the forces.  From another aspect also the retirement age for officers is too low.  Commandants, Lieutenant-Colonels, and Captains must retire at 54 years of age.  It is very difficult to take up an outside job after about 25 years in the Army and to pick up the threads of ordinary living.  Nobody likes to think that he is a case for the scrap heap.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on the retiring age.  I have met many men who have retired from the Army whom I would say are good for another ten years anyway, If they are medically <Col N="1804" /> fit, healthy and active they should be allowed carry on for another while before retirement.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to our Army for their peace keeping missions with the United Nations.  Some of our men have laid down their lives in the cause of peace and we should be very proud of that. They have been good ambassadors for this country.</P>
    <P>This Estimate for the Department of Defence is one of the most important to go through this House and I would regard the Minister for Defence as one of the key Ministers in this Government.</P>
    <P>The Army Equitation School has been referred to.  I was stationed in that barracks for a good number of years and I have a good knowledge of that school.  I have never seen an NCO or ordinary soldier representing the equitation school.  It is hard to believe that in an army of 12,000 or 15,000 ranks not one of them is on a team representing the country at horse-shows and so on throughout the world.  Perhaps we lack the opportunities and expertise.  However, I saw jumping courses set up around McKee Barracks and in the surrounding fields and it seemed that officers were training other officers in horsemanship and so on.  I do not see why these courses should not be open to NCOs and men. Show-jumping is big business and it is not the prerogative of any group.  I hope that in the not too distant future NCOs and men who have a love of horsemanship will be given the opportunity of taking such courses and availing of the training given so readily by the officers of the equitation school.  I will ask the Minister to say something about that in his reply.</P>
    <P>The FCA are doing a good job, but there is a great deal of &ldquo;aggro&rdquo; in that force at the moment regarding the taxing of their gratuity.  Many members of this force give their weekends free and unless they have sufficient weekends totted up they will not get a full gratuity.  I know what I am talking about because I worked in this field when I was in the Defence Forces.  I was told that I was lucky, I had a dug-in job.  I was in an office for a while and I know something about this matter. They are giving their time and their weekends <Col N="1805" /> free of charge, perhaps going off on a Saturday morning and coming back on Sunday night, doing courses, training in barracks and so on.  If we want to encourage people to join the Defence Forces &mdash; and the FCA are a very important wing of the Defence Forces &mdash; we should not be penny-pinching by taking the few bob out of the gratuity they receive once a year at their annual camp.  A little generosity in this regard would not break the State or the Department.  On a canvass the other evening I had a rough reception from a man who probably was an FCA officer.  He told me that he was paying £95 for his uniform.  I understood that the uniforms were issued free.  A person who offers his services should at least get his uniform free.  This man asked why he should give his service and so on, and what he said had certain merit.  Perhaps the wages in the Army have gone up a good deal since I served because they were not being taxed at that time.  I ask the Minister to have a hard look at this.</P>
    <P>Civil Defence do not seem to get the same high profile as the rest of the Defence Forces.  They should, because they play a very important part in our society.  They are not as prominent on the ground as the other forces but that does not mean that they are not doing a good job.  This should be recognised.</P>
    <P>About 25 or 30 years ago the Army had a corps known as the Construction Corps.  Has the time now arrived to revitalise it, with all the youth unemployment we have?  The Minister may know something about this corps.  I know from my experience of them that they served a useful purpose at the time and made better citizens of a number of people.  People rushed to join them.  A few years in the Army does not harm anybody.  Hopping around the square at 6 o'clock in the morning can be a very wakening experience.  Army life knocks the corners off people.  It is healthy and I would recommend it to anybody.  However, in order to encourage young people to join the Army today; we will have to get rid of much of the red tape that was involved.</P>
    <P>When the Minister visits some of the barracks that I used to know I would like to accompany him to see if any improvements <Col N="1806" /> have been made since I was there, when 20 or 21 people were sleeping in one small room.  At that time the living conditions were anything but satisfactory. After 25 years I should like to see if there have been any improvements made, and I hope I will be given the opportunity of at least visiting the barracks in Dublin to see what has been done.</P>
    <P>I realise that a considerable amount of money is involved in this Estimate.  However, we must remember that there is no such thing as cheap security.  The Army play a prominent part in the maintenance of law and order.  As previous speakers pointed out, they give protection to the banks and so on.  There can be no cheese-paring in relation to what we pay our Defence Forces.  During the blizzard last winter the Army did excellent work, and I shudder to think what we would have done without them.  Sufficient tribute cannot be paid to them: some of the roads in Dublin were impassable and we had to depend on the Army and the Air Corps for assistance.  The nation owes them a debt of gratitude for what they did.  I accept that some of the local authorities did not come out of that period with full marks, and it must be accepted that without the assistance of the Army at that time things would have been much worse.</P>
    <P>The Minister represents an area in which there are seven or eight barracks and he is well aware of the problems of Army life.  I hope he will accept my criticism as constructive.  The housing situation for Army people in this city is a national scandal.  Soldiers are marrying at a younger age than was the practice up to now.  I do not know if it is necessary for them now to apply for permission to marry; I hope that regulation has gone. However, there was a time when it was necessary for a soldier to apply to his commanding officer for permission to marry.  One-third of the population of the country live in Dublin and probably one-third of Army personnel are stationed here.  I ask the Minister to study closely the housing position, and particularly the married quarters in the barracks in Dublin.  Some of them are more <Col N="1807" /> than 200 years old; I think Collins' Barracks was built in the 1700s.  Some of those premises should be knocked down because the condition of the buildings is deplorable.  Where housing is bad morale is at a low ebb and there is much discontent.</P>
    <P>The question of overholding has been raised.  The Department should not be allowed to stop the payment of pensions when people are overholding through no fault of their own.  In this city there are 6,000 families on the housing waiting list. A person cannot just walk into the office of Dublin Corporation and ask them for a house immediately because he is leaving the Army.  That person will have to satisfy all the conditions of the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>I must pay tribute to the housing allocation officers in Dublin Corporation. They have been very sensitive to the demands of the Defence Forces and have been sympathetic in their attitude.  Many local authority houses are tenanted by ex-soldiers and their families.  I hope a survey will be carried out of all the spare land at Collins' Barracks, Arbour Hill, Cathal Brugha Barracks and Griffith Barracks. I know the city officials are anxious to co-operate with the Army authorities to arrive at a mutually satisfactory arrangement.  I am satisfied that much can be done with regard to this matter, and I hope that when we come to discuss the Estimates in 1983 there will be a considerable improvement.  All Deputies who have spoken have been concerned about this matter.  Housing is a basic human need.  I know what I am talking about.  I was stationed in several barracks in this city and I know what the married quarters are like.  I visited some of them recently with city officials who classified them as substandard, and that means they are unfit for habitation.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I do not agree with Deputy Treacy who questioned his suitability for the job.  I think he is adequately suitable for the job and I am not prepared to listen to that kind of waffle from the Deputy.  The Minister is filling the job with distinction.  I hope the points I raised <Col N="1808" /> will be taken as constructive criticism and that something will be done about them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in congratulating the Minister on his appointment as Minister for Defence but I must temper my congratulations by repeating the criticism of his speech in Edenderry.  It was intemperate and unfortunate.  As Deputy Treacy said, it could be taken to prejudice the neutrality we want to be seen to hold so dear, but in addition I am afraid it has had a very deleterious effect on our relations with the other island.  This will have direct consequences for the tourist trade this year and I think those consequences have been felt already if we can believe reports from Bord Fáilte.  I am sure it was a once-off speech by the Minister, and some of the consequences have been undone by the Taoiseach disowning the speech and by Deputy O'Malley's rejection of it yesterday.  I am afraid that has to be said.  Ministerial office brings with it responsibilities of care and discretion, and they were breached on that occasion. It would be unfortunate if the civilian head of our Defence Forces gave the impression that our Defence Forces are susceptible to the disease of Brit-bashing which occasionally breaks out here, particularly on the other side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear from the contributions that have been made that in administering this Estimate the Minister should not have any problems about the adequacy of the funds available to him.  The Estimate is designed to provide funds for the Minister which, with the normal careful management that is expected in regard to these funds, would enable him comfortably to discharge his obligations and enable his Department to fulfil its role.  I do not have to remind the House that the Estimate which the Minister is introducing is the Estimate that was decided upon by the last Coalition Government.  The Minister finds himself in a much happier position in relation to that part of his duty, in relation to administering the funds that will be available to his Department, than his predecessor Deputy Barrett found himself in this time last year <Col N="1809" /> when he had to deal with an Estimate which seriously under-provided for the needs of his Department.  As Deputy Treacy has reminded us, Deputy Tully had to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for a very considerable sum, over £20 million, to make up the shortfall in the original provision.  But Deputy Tully's experience and Deputy Barrett's predicament were not unique to the Department of Defence last year.  It is an unfortunate fact &mdash; and it is on record &mdash; that the Estimate for most if not all Government Departments were seriously under-provided for to the extent that the whole estimating procedure and budgeting procedures were less than real, and that is probably the most charitable way in which I can put it.  But it is clear from the debate so far that those problems of underestimation do not face the Minister this year.</P>
    <P>The debate has been concerned generally with conditions of service in the Army &mdash; housing, pay and promotion prospects.  I would like to spend a few moments on some of those matters.  First I would like to echo the compliments that have been paid to the personnel of the Defence Forces.  Like most of the Deputies who have spoken I also represent a constituency which has within it a considerable number of Army personnel with garrisons in Athlone, Mullingar and Longford.  I can say from my personal knowledge of the way those personnel have integrated into the communities that they are very highly regarded in their communities and have never been found wanting when the communities have asked for assistance which it was within the capacity of the military to give.  It has been given generously and, invariably, it has been given efficiently.  I would like to pay tribute to the personnel concerned and to the Army generally for the services they provide to the nation both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have had to make extra demands on Army personnel for security duties arising out of the terrorist activities of the IRA.  In addition the Army has had extra foreign service to fulfil the requirements of the United Nations operation in different parts of <Col N="1810" /> the Middle East.  It is common case that these rather unusual duties at home and abroad have been discharged competently and successfully and it is only right that in the Parliament of the nation we should acknowledge that and pay tribute to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons the Army has been successful is that there has been a high standard of morale.  Morale is a thing that one cannot define, but one always knows when it is present and equally when it is absent.  There are differing factors contributing to morale.  The actual physical conditions of service, the accommodation to which Deputy Brennan has referred, both for the serving personnel and their families, are factors that can contribute to morale.  The level of pay is obviously a factor that must contribute to morale and general satisfaction. Also the standard of clothing and equipment contribute.  We have to examine all these things to make sure that they are kept at a level which will be adequate to ensure in turn that the morale is kept at the desired pitch.</P>
    <P>There is one other very important factor and that is that service in the Army will have proper career prospects.  Army pay is good and there is general satisfaction with the rates.  Every one of us would like to have a greater income but by and large the rates of pay in the Army are satisfactory.  But there is one exception &mdash; and I would echo Deputy Brennan on this &mdash; and that is the extra pay that is made available to members who are serving on security duties.  Many of these security duties involve long, invariably, unsocial hours, winter and summer. Some of them involve unpleasant prison duties.  Some of them involve unpleasant duties along the Border.  I suspect and feel that the level of acknowledgement, in so far as it is given through extra allowances, is not as high as it should be.  I would ask the Minister to arrange for an examination of the rates of special allowances for security duties at present being paid to Army personnel.  Within that examination it might be possible to recognise that there are some duties that are more unpleasant and more demanding than others and it might be possible to <Col N="1811" /> have grades rather than a flat rate.  Indeed it is a great tribute to the selflessness of the Army personnel and their loyalty to the service and to their country that we have not had much criticism in that area, particularly when they have to endure the provocation of knowing that members of another uniformed force doing precisely the same duties are rewarded in a much more generous manner.  The Army are conscious of this discrepancy but nevertheless their loyalty enables them to accept their slightly prejudiced position <i>vis-à-vis</i> their uniformed colleagues from another service.  So I would ask the Minister to consider the allowances for special duties.</P>
    <P>On the question of housing, obviously to provide houses for military personnel would be beyond the capacity of the Defence Estimate as framed.  I would question whether soldiers should be housed specially by their Department rather than treated as citizens in the normal way to be provided with houses through the normal State agencies whether they be building societies, local authorities, banks and so on.  I would be inclined to think that we should pay soldiers the normal wages, arrange for a normal salary structure in the Army so that soldiers can be housed in the same way and with no distinction from the rest of the citizens of the country.  But where there are Army quarters &mdash; and historically there are some attached to some of the older barracks &mdash; every effort should be made to see that Army married quarters, where provided, are up to standard.  It would appear from what Dublin Deputies say that this is far from being the case in Dublin.  In Athlone there are two small Army schemes with modern houses and the accommodation is up to the standard required.</P>
    <P>There is one difficulty about Army personnel living in Army houses, and that is the difficulty that arises when a person's Army service terminates and the question of finding alternative accommodation arises.  Very often the member concerned has to look to the local authority and take his place in the queue.  If that queue is long, and it invariably is in urban <Col N="1812" /> areas, there can be delay before he can vacate the Army house.  In the meantime he is prejudiced by virtue of the fact that his pension and gratuity are being withheld for something over which he has no control.  He does not have the resources to house himself privately and he finds himself and his family financially prejudiced. This is even worse when service is terminated due to an unexpected death. The trauma of that event is compounded by the understandable but very harsh rule of the Department to withhold pension and gratuity until the house is vacated. The answer would be if there was an ample supply of housing stock in the hands of the local authorities, but that is the optimum position and we are not going to achieve it.  When a retirement date is known it should be possible, through close liaison between the local authority and the Army authorities, to arrange accommodation within a reasonable time for those who have to leave Army quarters.</P>
    <P>Athlone UDC have been anxious about this problem and have raised it on a number of occasions with the Department of Defence and the Army authorities. On a national scale there must be close liaison between the Department and the local authorities to ensure that this hardship is alleviated as much as possible, and hopefully removed altogether.</P>
    <P>With regard to clothing and equipment and other factors which contribute to the morale and well-being of an army, there have been considerable improvements in the last seven or eight years.  Our Army is well equipped and well clothed and the physical conditions of service are generally good.  Care is taken about catering and there is positive satisfaction about the standards applicable in that area.</P>
    <P>There is still some work to be done with regard to clothing and equipment for the FCA.  I must compliment the Department on the design of the new tunic for FCA members and I hope to see it on general issue as soon as possible. Wherever it has made its appearance on the streets, it has been very favourably commented on.  It is one of the mysteries of the supply system in the public service <Col N="1813" /> that new issues seem to become available on a bitty basis.  It was a pity this tunic could not have been made available by way of a general issue to all members because it would give a tremendous boost to that service.</P>
    <P>There is a further very important area that affects morale, and that is career prospects.  Deputy Treacy and Deputy Brennan mentioned that there are officer courses for NCOs to obtain commissioned ranks.  I think I am right in correcting Deputy Treacy when I say that these courses have been available for some time but there may not have been as many men on them as we would like to have seen.  I endorse the views that more NCOs should be offered places on these courses, because very high quality NCOs are available in our Army and they should have the prospect of attaining commissioned rank.</P>
    <P>For those in commissioned rank there should be satisfaction and confidence in the promotion structures and careers opportunities.  I have to say categorically that there is serious &mdash; I emphasise the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo;&mdash; dissatisfaction among senior ranks about the promotion policy operating at present.  This matter was raised last week by way of question by Deputy Loughnane.  He asked the Minister if he was aware of the considerable dismay and concern about the system of promotion, and the Minister indicated that he was not so aware.  I want to assure the Minister that what Deputy Loughnane said is fact.  There is considerable concern about promotion prospects for senior officers.</P>
    <P>Promotions are governed by defence force regulation A 15, section 7, amended in 1979, and sets out the criteria for promotion in commissioned ranks.  There is automatic promotion to the rank of Captain, it is a condition of enlistment, and there is promotion to the rank of commandant when the officer has successfully completed the standard course for his service corps, or a course certified as acceptable in lieu thereof, or when he has generally reached the standard acceptable to the Chief of Staff.  The previous regulations required in the case of promotion to the rank of commandant that <Col N="1814" /> the officer would have successfully completed the commandant staff course. That has been dropped and a person can become a commandant after successfully completing a standard course of his service corps or a course certified by the Chief of Staff.</P>
    <P>The commandant staff course could be described as the post-graduate course for commissioned officers.  It is a residential and intensive course.  On completion of the course candidates are tested in a very exact fashion.  Officers who successfully complete this course can be taken to be fully qualified professional Army officers. All officers have the opportunity to go on this course, and they know that if they fail to take this course and complete it successfully their career prospects will not go beyond the rank of commandant. Previously they would not even make commandant without taking this course, but under the changed regulations of 1979, it is now provided that for promotion to the rank of lieutenant-colonel or higher, the officer must have satisfactorily completed commandant staff course or a course certified by the Chief of Staff as acceptable in lieu.  Traditionally these alternative courses are generally taken in military establishments abroad.  Selected officers may be sent to undergo comparable courses abroad so that the equivalent would be of the same high standard as the commandant staff course run here.</P>
    <P>At that stage of an officer's career, all officers have completed this highly professional post-graduate course.  We should bear in mind that the initial selection procedures were very exact, because only the best were picked from a very high number of applications.  The initial training in the cadet college and the initial courses in the service corps were all of a very high standard, with the result that when officers had passed the commandant staff course there was a pretty uniformly high level of professional expertise. Obviously, there would be differences of personality and of capacity, as there would be in any group of people serving in a specialised avocation, but by and large, the level of professional competence would be pretty well uniform. Some men would be more energetic <Col N="1815" /> than others, some more easy-going than others, all the different qualities of the human personality, to distinguish people from each other, but the level of professional competence and professional expertise would, generally, be on a par.  Consequently, when choices had to be made for promotion there was a difficulty for those in charge of promotions&mdash;how to distinguish between these people who were generally, comparable with each other.</P>
    <P>The regulations say that, in recommending an officer for promotion, the Chief of Staff should certify that the officer is considered fitted to fill the appointment to the higher ranks &mdash; obviously this is a truism &mdash; has given evidence of reliability, devotion to duty, zeal, industry, ability, initiative and, where applicable, the faculty of leadership &mdash; these are desirable qualities and one would assume that senior officers having served up to 30 years in the Army would have displayed all those qualities &mdash; and has been recommended in his annual confidential report.  That is fair enough.  An unsatisfactory confidential report would rule out an officer if he had blotted his copybook in some way.  The Chief of Staff had to certify all those things.  As I have mentioned he must have regard to the fact that the officer has successfully completed the commandant staff course, or an equivalent course.  The next factor to which the Chief of Staff must have regard is whether in addition to fulfilling the requirements mentioned above as appropriate &mdash; and I quote fromt he regulations:</P>
    <P>the officer has successfully completed a course of instruction or passed any examinations or test for which he has been detailed;</P>
    <P>That is a new requirement since 1979, and I shall deal with its implications shortly.</P>
    <P>The next thing he must have regard to in the case of promotion other than promotion under paragraph 8 which deals with specialised matters and need not be mentioned here, is the officer's place in the seniority list, both in regard to service <Col N="1816" /> course seniority and seniority in the permanent Defence Forces.  That requirement in regard to seniority has been heavily weighted in promotions in the Army up to now.  It has been accepted in the Army as being a critical factor in promotions. Seniority is important in the Army, so much so that there is a special Defence Force Regulation A. 17 &mdash; these are statutory instruments &mdash; which provides that the Adjutant-General must prepare a Defence Force list which determines the seniority of officers.  That is a public, official document in which the seniority of all officers is listed.  Officers know where they are in terms of seniority <i>vis-à-vis</i> their colleagues.  One can see, therefore, how important seniority is when dealing with an organisation where the levels of professional efficiency are by and large comparable.</P>
    <P>Seniority has always been recognised traditionally in the Army as being a very important factor in promotion to senior ranks &mdash; not the exclusive or deciding factor but, other things being equal, then the deciding factor.  This is very important for the career prospects of officers. When an officer reaches the rank of commandant he is generally in his early to mid-thirties.  At that stage he knows the seniority list and, traditionally in the Army, officers at that stage of their careers have been able to look at this list and make a very good assessment that if their career proceeds according to normal lines and if they successfully and competently carry out all the duties, tests and courses which they undertake, and know, looking at the seniority list, pretty certainly what their prospects are of becoming Lieutenant-Colonels, pretty certainly &mdash; though less certainly &mdash; what their prospects are of becoming full Colonels and the prospect then of going to higher ranks.</P>
    <P>At that critical stage of his career, the officer can decide to make a career in the Army.  That is a critical decision for a man in his mid thirties to make &mdash; would he continue in the Army or are his career prospects such as to make a continuing Army career attractive?  He can do that because seniority has been a factor and has been honoured in the promotion system <Col N="1817" /> heretofore.  If that were not the case and a person in his mid-thirties was unsure of his position, he would look around for alternative civilian employment. Very often, for Army officers at that stage of energy and training there are civilian career opportunities.  It is a difficult decision for a person to make, whether to take the civilian opportunity and leave the avocation in which he originally wanted to spend his life.  To enable him to make that choice he must know if he has a career in the Army.  Up to now, he knew that by looking at the seniority list.  Unfortunately, in the last couple of years the system of regard to the seniority list has been breached on a number of occasions, giving cause for considerable unrest and, as Deputy McMahon has said, dismay and concern about the promotion system.  No longer is it possible for an officer to look at the seniority list and know how his career prospects will work out, provided the other matters referred to are in order, provided he had completed his courses and displayed all the necessary qualities of an Army officer.</P>
    <P>The level of professional skill is generally comparable at those ranks in the Army.  At that stage, we have to look for some effective criterion, and the seniority criterion as an objective criterion has worked well, generally, in the Army.  It is not infallible; no human system is infallible. It has had the great strength of being objective.  The great strength there is that Army officers knew that their career prospects did not depend on party-political influences or on any element of an &ldquo;old boy&rdquo; network within the Army.  Now we are no longer sure.  I would hate to see an attitude coming into our Army which prevails in another uniformed force which shall be nameless, where there is a common belief that promotions, preferment and postings depend, if not on party-political influence certainly on an internal &ldquo;old boy&rdquo; network. That is why I say to the Minister that this is a serious problem which he must consider.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which I said I would come back to, one of the matters to which the Chief of Staff had to have <Col N="1818" /> regard when recommending for promotion, that is, whether the officer has successfully completed any course of instruction or passed any examination for which he has been detailed.  Recently there has been introduced into the Army what has been called a senior officer course.  This is unlike the command and staff course, which is an intensive post-graduate training available for all officers.  On completion there is a test to find out whether or not the officer has completed it successfully.</P>
    <P>This senior officers' course is quite informal.  It is not open to all senior officers. There appears to be no objective means by which the officers who go on this course are picked.  It is not tested on completion to see if it has made any difference to the professional expertise of the officer concerned.  Some officers have gone on this course &mdash; I do not say improperly or unjustly in any way &mdash; and having gone on it, having regard to the way the regulations are now framed, they then have an advantage over their colleagues who are not lucky enough to be asked to go on this course.  Bearing in mind that this course is not tested and, so far as I know, it is not residental, it is called a senior officers' course.</P>
    <P>When an officer has undertaken this course, the Chief of Saff has to have regard to that fact, and an officer with that course under his belt is at an advantage over a colleague who may be senior to him and, in terms of professional competence, may well be senior and superior as well.  Because he was not lucky enough to go on the course a senior and possibly more competent or equally competent colleague is passed over because the man who has been on the course has the extra so-called qualification under the regulations. That provision is also causing considerable unrest.</P>
    <P>There is one further matter to which I want to refer in the context of the question of morale among senior officers.  It is very important that the officer corps should have a high morale and that they are satisfied with their conditions of service.  My point deals with the rather sensitive area of the annual confidential reports.  Defence Force regulation A.15 <Col N="1819" /> provides that there shall be annual confidential reports on officers.  These are what they say they are, confidential reports on officers made by a superior officer and they go on the officers' records. They are available to the superior officers when it comes to the question of promotions.</P>
    <P>According to the regulation, the annual confidential report awards an officer a rating of either satisfactory or unsatisfactory, and that is it.  If there is disagreement between the reporting officers, the Adjutant General can award a final rating.  If an officer is rated unsatisfactory, he has to sign this confidential report document which is called an AF 451 acknowledging the fact that he has been found unsatisfactory.  If he wishes he can submit representations.  The Adjutant General could subsequently award a final rating of satisfactory and the report would be amended accordingly. If the Adjutant General so agrees the officer can be shown the reasons why he was found to be unsatisfactory.  That is the system which has been working and has been accepted.  Officers knew exactly where they stood.</P>
    <P>Last year this reporting procedure was changed.  I have grave doubts about the legality of the change because it does not appear to be sustained by a similar change in the Defence Force Regulations. The validity of the annual confidential reports depends on the Defence Force Regulations.  That regulation provides for two ratings, satisfactory or unsatisfactory.  With the change we have a document which provides for all sorts of ratings of the officers being reported upon from outstanding, above average, average &mdash; how does one distinguish between above average and average? &mdash; up to the minimum standard required, to the old one, unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>In making those assessments the reporting officer has to consider integrity, leadership and management, decisiveness, judgment, initiative, acceptance of responsibility, planning and organising ability, efficiency in performance of duty, powers of comprehension, co-operation, dependability and administrative ability. <Col N="1820" /> All that reads very well, and obviously these are all desirable things to be taken into account when an officer is making an assessment of a junior colleague.</P>
    <P>To have to go on and rate all those varied qualities under the various gradings from outstanding down to unsatisfactory imposes an impossible task on the reporting officer.  Obviously it was feared that reporting officers might be worried about the duty being imposed on them, because on the front of this document in the instructions to the reporting officer it is set out that there should be no ambiguities and that where comments are made which imply that corrective action should be taken, suitable action should be taken.</P>
    <P>It says that lack of clarity will be referred back to the reporting officer. Then underlined is the rather dubious statement that the compilation of the report will be used as a source of information about the reporting officer.  I do not have to spell out to the Minister and the House the consequences of that type of direction, or the atmosphere it must bring into this whole system of reporting.</P>
    <P>Obviously reporting on fellow officers is a sensitive area.  This sensitivity was recognised in the earlier regulations under which the rating was satisfactory or unsatisfactory.  That has been accepted in the Army up to now.  We now have this change in the annual confidential report which goes into the greatest of detail of subjective assessments of all sorts of metaphysical qualities which then have to be rated under five different headings.  If the reporting officer does not do his job, somebody could use that as a reflection on him.  What position does that put the reporting officer in?  What is the position of the officers being reported upon?  How will they comport themselves <i>vis-à-vis</i> their colleagues whom they have to meet socially and professionally in barracks up and down the country?  How will they comport themselves in relation to the reporting officers?</P>
    <P>On the last page of this document under the heading &ldquo;Guide to Completion of AF 451 and AF 451A&rdquo; there is a list of desirable qualities which, it is said, may be of help when compiling relevant paragraphs. <Col N="1821" /> The first is adaptability &mdash; adjusts to new or changing situations.  It could also mean he was able to compromise to please others, particularly his superior officers.  The next is ambition &mdash;seeks and welcomes, within bounds the military propriety, additional and more important responsibilities.  Again, depending on the personalities of the reported upon and the reporter, ambition could mean that he was prepared to push. Some people might like that and some people might not.</P>
    <P>Another quality is co-operation &mdash; works in harmony with others as a team member.  There is not much difference between that and adaptability.  The next is dependability &mdash; consistently accomplishes desired actions with minimum supervision.  That is a very desirable quality, but it could also mean that he does not annoy the boss and he watches himself. Another is ingenuity &mdash; creative ability in devising means to solve problems.</P>
    <P>One could be cynical about how these desirable qualities are going to be interpreted. Next is moral courage &mdash; intellectual honesty, willingness to speak without equivocation.  That is something we all like to see in others and think we have ourselves.  People with that quality will have to look at loyalty &mdash; faithful and willing support to superiors and subordinates. There is room for conflict there. Tenacity &mdash; the will to persevere in the face of obstacles.  If the obstacle happens to be a senior officer and it might also be the reportin officer who wants a particular thing done his way which the junior officer feels is the wrong way, is he to show tenacity?  Will it be recognised as such &mdash; willing to persevere in the face of obstacles &mdash; or will it be interpreted as stubborness?  I descry the hand of a psychologist behind that nonsence and I would earnestly suggest to the Minister that a serious look should be taken immediately at the system of annual confidential reports and that there should be an immediate reversion to the old system by which an officer was found to be satisfactory or unsatisfactory and his promotion depended on the sole requirement of successfully completing the <Col N="1822" /> command and staff course, having the necessary devotion to duty, zeal and industry that officers normally display in the course of their duty and that proper regard be had to the place in the seniority list.</P>
    <P>I assure the Minister that what Deputy Loughnane referred to as dismay and concern at the present promotion procedures is true, is widespread and becoming more widespread in the Army.  There is a feeling that promotion is no longer objective as it was in the past.  This worries many officers who stayed in the Army when they might have opted for an alternative career in their early days but because they knew where they were in the seniority list and knew its importance in promotion they were able to make an assessment of their career prospects.  If that position has been damaged, as I am informed it has been, it is important that the Minister should take steps to restore it immediately.</P>
    <P>The only other matter I wish to mention is in relation to Civil Defence.  Previous speakers have described this service as being a cinderella, which is not an inaccurate description.  We pride ourselves on our neutrality but in the event of an outbreak of hostilities that involved us it would be of vital importance to the safety of the nation and the population that we should have an efficient Civil Defence organisation.  We do not have that at present; perhaps we will never need it and that we would find our neutrality continuing to be protected by friendly countries and NATO and that we can do without Civil Defence.  But when we have a Civil Defence service it should be an efficient and well-organised one which would be recognised as having an important role to play.  Even if it never had &mdash; please God it never will have &mdash; any role to play in the context of hostilities, it could have a very definite role to play in terms of dealing physical, natural disasters.  Happily, we do not suffer from them even to the extent of adjoining countries but when they come even on the scale of the last blizzard, it is important to have a Civil Defence organisation capable of coping with whatever might arise.  It would not require money, only <Col N="1823" /> administration and organisation and attention to the men and women of the Civil Defence service to let them know that they are appreciated, to involve them more in expansion of their duties and training and above all where possible to keep them supplied with proper equipment.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by repeating that the Army are entitled to the best thanks of the House for loyal and uncomplaining service.  Because traditionally the Army have been uncomplaining and do not have any outlet for making complaints through staff associations and so on &mdash; I hope the day will never come when they will have such complaints &mdash; it is important that when a complaint does come through the parliamentary or democratic process via a Deputy and when it is a complaint as serious as I think the complaint about dissatisfaction with the present promotion system to senior rank is concerned, it behoves the Minister, because of the peculiar situation and nature and structure of our Army and their relationship to the Executive and to parliament, as the person responsible to parliament for the wellbeing of that organisation to pay careful heed to what is being said here.  I endorse what was described by Deputy Loughnane as being a situation of dismay and concern with the present reporting and promotion procedure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. B. Ahern) Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. B. Ahern)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister of State with specific responsibility for Civil Defence, I would like to expand on what the Minister for Defence has said on that subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, perhaps it should be said that Civil Defence and the whole area of modern warfare as it might affect this country is strewn with misconceptions. The optimists would tell us that, because of this country's policy of neutrality, our geographical position or some other reason, we can expect indefinitely to remain unscathed by outbreaks of war wherever they occur.  However, I think we should remind ourselves, at least now and then that the possibility of a war which could <Col N="1824" /> affect us, directly or indirectly cannot be ruled out.  We should also remind ourselves that the nuclear arsenal has been increasing year by year across the globe, that the spread of nuclear weapons has increased, that a policy of neutrality does not protect a nation from the horrible effects of nuclear war and that increasingly the civilian population is affected by modern warfare.  In World War I the ratio of military to civilian casualties was 10 to one; in World War II there was and even ratio of 1:1 and in the Vietnamese war the scales had completely turned and 20 civilians died for every one death within the armed forces.  The possible ratio, should yet another world war occur, is almost too horrible to contemplate.</P>
    <P>I suppose the pessimistic view at its extreme is that, should the unthinkable horror of a nuclear war occur, one would be better off dead.  It is an avenue of thought one does not like to pursue but I think it must be said that among the questions which the survivors of any catastrophe will ask is why more was not done in advance to be better prepared for that catastrophe, to increase protection against the effects of the catastrophe, to make life more bearable for those who survive and to hasten recovery.</P>
    <P>There are some who say that there will be no survival &mdash; that there is nothing you can do about a catastrophe on the scale of a major nuclear conflict.  I think it is part of the horror of that scenario that, in the view of military strategists and a considerable body of expert opinion, a substantial proportion of people would survive even a global nuclear war. The level of casualties would be appalling and, of course, our major aim must be to continue our efforts to promote whatever action may help to prevent the use of nuclear weapons at any stage or at any level.  But while the possibility of their use continues &mdash; and regrettably that possibility does remain &mdash; we must continue to have a reasonable state of Civil Defence preparedness against the eventuality.</P>
    <P>Here, I would like to state that I subscribe to the view of the Department of Defence that it is virtually certain that <Col N="1825" /> Civil Defence measures, even at their current relatively modest level, would save thousands of lives, particularly in the type of situation which is likely to prevail in this country in the event of a major nuclear conflict.  Indeed, the evidence from Hiroshima and Nagasaki shows that, with present knowledge, casualties even in direct hit areas would be substantially reduced by rudimentary Civil Defence measures.  Against a direct saturation attack on this island &mdash; surely an unlikely event &mdash; protection may be beyond our capability but this is no argument to suggest that we should not have some insurance &mdash; such as Civil Defence provides &mdash; against lesser but much more likely hazards.  We in Government cannot afford to take a negative attitude; among other things, we cannot choose to do nothing about the risk of radiation deaths from a nuclear war or indeed from a possible peacetime accident involving a nuclear explosion.  Civil Defence is our only insurance against that possibility and the increased provision for Civil Defence in the Estimates &mdash; approximately 50 per cent more than in 1981 &mdash; is an indication of the Government's commitment to continuing and improving Civil Defence preparedness.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to comment on what additional steps might be taken to increase Civil Defence effectiveness, perhaps I should give a short account of what has been achieved since Civil Defence was established in its modern form in the fifties.  It was set up in the shadow of the atomic bomb and the concentration of effort then and since then has been on preparing for what is seen as the most likely hazard for this country in the event of a nuclear war &mdash; namely a radioactive fallout situation.  Deputies will be aware that the primary responsibility for the co-ordination of Civil Defence planning and organisation rests with the Department of Defence and subject to my overall direction, local authorities are responsible for the recruitment and training of Civil Defence volunteers and the development of Civil Defence measures in their functional areas.  In 1951 the Civil Defence school in the Phoenix Park was set up as the central training establishment <Col N="1826" /> and, in subsequent years, under the guidance of the Civil Defence Branch of the Department of Defence, local authority Civil Defence organisations with headquarters staffs and five functional volunteer services were formed. The number of volunteer personnel trained in Civil Defence skills is currently in the region of 35,000 of which, approximately, one half are still actively involved in the Civil Defence services. other specific achievements in the intervening years, which were brought about at a cost which was generally less than 1 per cent of the total annual budget for Defence include the following: a national control has been set up and equipped &mdash; it has a broadcasting capability and communication links with the regional and county controls and other bodies with important Civil Defence roles; control centres have also been set up in the various local authorities and this network is now virtually completed; a stock of radiation instruments has also been built-up and distributed to local authorities, even though, as the Minister for Defence has stated, there is now an urgent need to commence a programme of replacement of obsolete equipment, and there is now an annual test of the effectiveness of the warning and monitoring network in the form of a nationwide fallout exercise.</P>
    <P>However, since the Civil Defence organisation was set up shortly after the Second World War, the structure of the organisation and the approach to Civil Defence generally have remained essentially the same.  I believe that there are a number of matters which should now be examined more fully and indeed that a fundamental review of the whole area of Civil Defence is desirable.  Within that review I would include whatever is necessary to increase the contribution of Civil Defence in peacetime emergency situations.</P>
    <P>As I implied earlier, the existing capacity of Civil Defence to protect and advise the population in wartime emergency situations has been arrived at by way of a slow build-up over the last quarter of a century and the question might well be asked what should we now be doing?  It is out of the question financially that we <Col N="1827" /> should aspire to the degree of preparedness attained by the Swiss, whose Civil Defence has a nominal strength of 625,000 people and who can provide shelter protection of an unusually high standard for nine-tenths of their population, or that attained by the Swedes for whom Civil Defence service is obligatory.  We can take warning from the fact that the main protaganists in the East/West polarisation take their Civil Defence very seriously indeed.  The Russian Civil Defence system is considered to be superior to the system operating in most European countries and has been well financed over the past 20 years.  Training is compulsory for all adults; they also have an industrial Civil Defence programme. In the United States there is increased emphasis on civil preparedness &mdash; this was commenced during the Carter administration and is being continued under the Reagan administration and is envisaged to entail an increase in annual outlay of the order of 80 per cent for the fiscal year 1983.</P>
    <P>So, what should we be doing?  In the Estimates before you we have a provision of £1½ million which represents a substantial increase on the provision expended last year, but more again will be needed in future years.  A considerable up-dating of equipment is overdue.  A start has been made in the matter of fire appliances, rescue equipment and ambulances but much more is called for, not only in respect of these items but also in respect of radiation measuring and monitoring equipment, communications equipment generally, and systems of educating and warning the public.  We must maintain the network we have, improving it when we can, and we must preserve the morale and the numerical strength of the organisation. Over the past two years or so a great deal of energy has been expended by the Department in launching seminars to alert various organisations to their role in wartime situations but the follow-up and feed-back could be a lot better.  The involvement of other State Departments in planning their wartime emergency roles, concerned with the supply of food, medical supplies and treatments, with the <Col N="1828" /> care of livestock, with transport etc. could be a lot better.</P>
    <P>All the wars since World War II have been fought with so-called conventional weapons and, with this consideration firmly in mind, a good deal of the organisation's training is geared to cater for the effects of conventional war.  The criticism has been advanced that it is a mistake to assume that this country will not be a target for nuclear weapons should a global conflict arise, and that it is a mistake therefore to concentrate the national effort to combat the effects of fallout.  At all times we are conscious of the possibility of our being a target, accidentally or otherwise, of nuclear weapons; in the event of such a strike, the preparation for protection against nuclear fallout will still save many thousands of lives.</P>
    <P>I referred to the morale of the organisation. There is also the rising and ebbing of the community's attitude to Civil Defence.  These are very much interconnected and I would like to see a greater involvement of the volunteers in local situations and emergencies, where that is possible.  It is to be borne in mind, of course, that the primary role of Civil Defence is wartime preparedness.  In the course of the next few weeks a working party of county managers and representatives of the Department will address this matter among others, such as the involvement of local authorities more meaningfully in Civil Defence preparedness.</P>
    <P>To conclude I quote an extract from an American Civil Defence publication:</P>
    <P>Curiously enough, human nature is basically anti-safety, anti-survival, even anti-peace.  Accepting catastrophe and annihilation &mdash; or dreaming of an angelic world &mdash; is the normal copout. Like the proverbial hole-in-roof: no use fixing it when the sun is out and when it's raining it's too late.</P>
    <P>It will be too late to attempt to prepare for the events for which Civil Defence is established when, God forbid, the dogs of war have already been unleashed.  We must continue to make the necessary preparations now.  In that commendable <Col N="1829" /> effort I look for co-operation and support from all sections of this House and all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of thanking all the volunteers in Civil Defence.  Deputy Cooney said a lot more can be done and I agree with that.  Society owes a great debt to those people who give their time, in a voluntary capacity, three or four nights a week and at weekends also.  During the month of January when we had the blizzard, Civil Defence workers in a number of counties showed how useful they can be, apart from a war situation.  People do not realise the effort and time which is put in by voluntary organisations to helping others, and it is a pity that the rest of the community do not follow their example.  The Army and Civil Defence workers always display discipline, dedication, intelligence and efficiency but, above all, they have a great readiness to help other people which, unfortunately, is dissappearing from other walks of life.  When the Civil Defence or the Army are called out to assist in emergencies far beyond the call of duty they never let the community down.  People should realise this and thank them for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Estimate.  The Minister said in his introduction that the primary role of the Defence Forces is the defence of the State against external aggression.  We are happy we have not had to use them in that role since the foundation of the State and I hope that situation will always remain.</P>
      <P>Many people ask why then do we need an army, an air force &mdash; why should we pay out £204 million annually to a group who are not being used for their primary purpose and who have not been so used since the foundation of the State?  I believe it is because we have had such dedicated service from members of these forces that we have had very little internal and no external aggression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all admit that there has been an internal threat to democracy here for a number of years.  As has been said, democracy is a very fragile flower that can be broken easily if the vigilance of <Col N="1830" /> Governments here were relaxed.  We saw the damage done in the country a few months ago, the violence and the riots in the vicinity of the British Embassy.  We saw the viciousness of the groups involved.  Members of the armed forces were not too far away on that occasion and if their had been a call they might have had to be used in defence of democracy and the rule of law.  We do not want to have to call on that protection but it is there in case the day might come when it would have to be used.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the primary role of our Defence Force is to protect us against aggression, and unfortunately it is necessary to have the big stick there in case it might be needed.  As others before me, I should like to pay particular tribute to the Defence Forces for the other roles they become involved in and for the part they have played during the years in aid of the civil power and when serious problems arise, such as the hardships last January caused by the inclement weather.  A previous speaker has paid tribute to the work they did on that occasion, in glowing terms that I will not be able to match. In my constituency we experience bad weather once every few years, and on such occasions the resources of the local council are not sufficient to do the job in Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Last January the severe weather came out of the blue.  Indeed the previous evening the weather forecasters on RTE spoke about flurries of snow in the north and over the Wicklow hills.  In fact, the severity of the snowstorms meant that the whole of the county was disrupted, all travel was brought to a halt and many parts of the county were closed to ground traffic.  As spokesman for Defence I had to ask for aid from the Defence Forces and the Civil Defence organisations.  All of these organisations, including the Army, the Air Force, Civil Defence and the Red Cross, made unstinting efforts to help the people, and I am glad of the opportunity this Estimate gives me to express the thanks of thousands of people in the villages and hills in Wicklow who would have been seriously inconvenienced had it not been for the work of the Defence Forces.  Many old people might <Col N="1831" /> not be with us today were it not for the work done then by these organisations in supplying drugs and medicines, in taking people to hospitals and in rescuing people by helicopters.  I ask the Minister to pass on to the Defence Forces the thanks of the people of Wicklow for their great efforts on that occasion.</P>
    <P>The Army have extensive property in County Wicklow.  In the Glen of Imaal they have training and exercise facilities. Some years ago when speaking either on an Estimate or at Question Time I drew attention to a serious accident on that property resulting in death and injury to children.  At that time I was critical of the Army's lack of surveillance in the Glen of Imaal from the point of view of warning sign posts, etc.  There has not been a recurrence.  The criticism was well intentioned on that occasion.  Since then care has been taken and the place is now safer as a recreational area.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence was in charge of Forestry and Fisheries at one time and will be aware of the recreational value of County Wicklow for Dublin people.  For instance, when I was driving to Dublin today I saw several buses in the Glen of the Downs carrying children for walks in the forest.  Beside those forests the Army have training areas and it is hard to tell the difference between the two types of property.  The Army have to put up &ldquo;No Trespass&rdquo; signs and the Department of Forestry are able to put up signs highlighting the amenity value of the forests. I hope the Minister will use his good offices to ensure continued vigilance on the part of the Army in Wicklow and elsewhere.  Wicklow is close to our main centre of population, and many Dublin people travel there for recreation instead of taking expensive holidays elsewhere. We must continue to be vigilant about these properties, particularly during the summer months when they are used by people visiting the county.  The work done by the Army in that area is appreciated. There is difficulty about sharing the water in the Imaal area.  Locals would like the Minister to be more generous in <Col N="1832" /> this regard and see that water is provided for villages.</P>

      <P>The Youghal Carpet group have been experiencing difficulty with contracting markets recently.  The decision to close the Celbridge plant was regarded as necessary in terms of the overall viability of the group.  It was taken against a background of a marketing report which they commissioned on their spinning activities in which they have serious over-capacity.  The same group closed a mill in Holland which got its yarn supplies from Ireland.  It is understood that a weaving mill in Southampton is on a single shift.  I am not aware that Navan was the market.  My information does not indicate that.  Numerous meetings have taken place between the IDA and the <Col N="1833" /> company in relation to the plant and every aspect of trying to keep it open was investigated but in view of the overall viability of the group it was found necessary to look for an alternative takeover of the plant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 4, 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>When Clondalkin Paper Mills closed in January 1982 the Industrial Development Authority stepped up the approaches they had earlier made to companies in Ireland and overseas that might be interested in acquiring the assets of the mills for the purpose of resuming the manufacture of paper there.  In all a total of 115 companies worldwide were contacted by the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of my judgment as to how these proposals might develop I indicated to an ICTU deputation on 15 April and again on 6 May that I would use my best endeavours to secure the opening of the mill by 9 June next.  I also informed the deputation that because of the possibility that a takeover by private interests might not in the event materialise I had decided to engage Kinnear Consultancy Ltd., 54 <Col N="1836" /> Northumberland Road, to advise me on the steps that would have to be taken in the event of nationalisation becoming necessary.  Kinnear Consultancy's present and future activities could be said to constitute a form of contingency planning. I would envisage, among other things, that they would have to have detailed discussions with representatives of the workers.  They would also have to advise me on such matters as finance, marketing and sustainable manning levels to enable me to put a final proposal before the Government.  In view of the nature of the exercise for which the consultants have been retained I do not think it would be appropriate to make available, in the manner indicated in Deputy O'Leary's question, copies of any written reports that they might furnish to me.  I expect to have the report within the next week.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will appreciate that care and maintenance is the responsibility of the liquidator until he disposes of the assets.</P>

What I said was I would bring them up to date on the meeting of 6 May, which I have done.  I told them I would discuss the preliminary plans I had for nationalisation with them and indicated the situation about the Kinnear Consultancy.  Subsequent to that meeting I made arrangements for Kinnears to meet the workers.  I understand they met the ICTU and the workers and that they are being kept up to date.

What facts does <Col N="1837" /> the Minister now wish to discover which he was not aware of when the commitment was given that nationalisation would be entered into within three months if a private interest was not found to take over the mill?  Can he indicate what extra information he needs since the commitment was given very clearly?

Would the Minister specify exactly what steps he has taken to lead up to the nationalisation of these mills to ensure their reopening on 10 June because we know that will require considerable preparation? Will the Minister indicate what steps have been taken that will lead in three weeks time only to the reopening of these mills on 10 June, including the maintenance of the plant which we understand is deteriorating rapidly all the time?</P>

      <P>I want to inform Deputy Taylor that there is no difference between what I have said is my remit and the commitment given.  The commitment given on the three objectives was quite clear in the order in which I have already enunciated them here.  There is no difference between what I have said and the commitment given.  Secondly, I have <Col N="1840" /> already indicated in a lengthy reply what steps I have taken and the contingency plans I have put into action if the private sector does not take it over.  I shall repeat it again for Deputy Taylor if he wishes, but it is there.</P>

Resolution on a mutually acceptable basis of the many complex factors involved, with which the Deputy will be generally familiar, had not been reached when proceedings in the High Court were initiated. The settlement of these proceedings, which at present must formally be regarded as adjourned, envisage that limited facilities for the importation of fully built-up cars will be afforded to the company in each of the years 1982, 1983 and 1984 subject to the company's complying <Col N="1842" /> with certain conditions which are designed to maintain employment and to create new employment opportunities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The company in question recently informed the Industrial Development Authority of their intention to close one of the production lines at their works at Clonskeagh, Dublin, and to make 242 workers redundant by 31 May 1982.</P>
      <P>The company, which are engaged in the printing of bank notes for export markets, attributed their decision principally to a decline in the market for their services.  This decline they claimed has similarly affected their plants in other countries, requiring a reduction in the work force in all of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the extent of the grant-aided investment in its Irish plant by the company in recent years, the IDA have represented to them that the level of redundancies proposed is excessive. As a result the company have agreed to reconsider this aspect of the matter but have given no other commitment.  The <Col N="1846" /> IDA are maintaining close contact with the company both at local and headquarters levels.</P>
    <P>Details of industrial and training grants which have been approved or paid to the company in respect of their operations at Clonskeagh have been published in the annual reports of the IDA for the relevant years between 1966 and 1979.

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Total recoverable reserves of coal in Ireland have been estimated at 44.68 million tonnes.  There are 25.6 million tonnes in the Connacht coalfield, 15 million tonnes in the Leinster coalfield and about 4.1 million tonnes in the Slieveardagh coalfield, County Tipperary.  Only a relatively small proportion of the reserves are being worked at present.</P>
      <P>More than half of the total reserves consist of high-ash semi-bituminous coal in the Connacht coalfiels which is regarded as technically suitable for use only in fluidised-bed combustion processes for electricity generation, and a development of this kind later in this decade has been approved.  A considerable proportion of the Leinster coalfield coal reserves has a relatively high sulphur content and I am advised that such coal would not be suitable for general domestic or industrial purposes unless it was treated.  The thinness of the Irish coalfields is also a factor which would militate against economic development of the reserves in certain locations.  Nevertheless, the coalfields, which provide employment for about 400 men at present, have a potential for further development and it is my intention to encourage and facilitate such development.</P>
      <P>A leading firm of British coalmining consultants was commissioned in 1980 in order to obtain an up-dated assessment of the nature and extent of Irish coal reserves and of the potential for the establishment of further mining operations. The consultants' report will be completed in a few weeks, and I expect to be in a position then to consider how best to secure the fullest possible development of our coal reserves.</P>

Consequently <Col N="1850" /> would he accept that it is necessary in the interim period that we do not encourage open-cast mining which endangers the deeper deposits of any fuel?  There is a tendency in certain parts of the areas he has mentioned to engage in open-cast mining.  Has the Minister taken any position in relation to discouraging these kinds of operations?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that proposals are received continously from companies in respect of projects of an open-cast mining nature?  The Minister has been in office for three months and I am asking whether he has taken any position in relation to such applications. Is he doing anything to discourage open-cast mining operations?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy how many applications for mining coal are currently before <Col N="1851" /> the Mining Board; the date on which each application was received; the identity of each applicant; and the area to which each application relates.</P>

      <P>Applications for the mining of coal are not dealt with by the Mining Board.  However, the board's functions include the consideration of applications made to them under section 15 of the Minerals Development Act, 1979 for the registration of minerals, including coal, as excepted minerals and <Col N="1852" /> this perhaps is what the Deputy has in mind.  The question is being dealt with on that assumption and the reply is in the form of a tabular statement, which with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>There are currently 16 applications before the Mining Board.  Particulars of the identity of each applicant, the date of each application and the area to which each application refers are as follows:</P>

      <P>Again, not wishing to embarrass the Minister, can he say whether he gives preference to Irish interests in these applications?  There are some Irish interests who have some experience in this area and I understand that there have been applications from some cross-channel interests also.  Without adopting the all-embracing phraseology that the Minister used in replying to the last question, does he give preference to Irish interests or has he adopted any position in relation to nationality in these matters.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy if he will take immediate steps to expedite the development of the coal resources of the Leinster coalfield with particular reference to the re-opening of Crettyard coalfield; in view of the urgent need to provide employment in south Laois and the need to provide native fuel in the national interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Contacts with two British companies are being actively pursued at present with a view to a joint underground/ open-cast coal development at the Rossmore &mdash; Crettyard &mdash; mine which is in the hands of a liquidator at present.  It is my expectation that the interests concerned will make an early decision as to whether they will make an offer to the liquidator to purchase the mine.</P>
      <P>There are two small coalmining operations in the Castlecomer area at present and a local enterprise has recently commenced site development work in the townland of Slatt Upper, County Laois preparatory to underground coalmining operations there.  There have been some indications of interest in coalmining in other parts of the Leinster coalfield but it is too early yet to say whether mine development will result.</P>
      <P>I expect to receive shortly from a firm of leading British coalmining consultants an up-dated assessment of the Irish coal reserves, including the reserves in the Leinster coalfield.  When this report is received I expect to be in a position to consider what further steps are necessary to secure the fullest possible development of the coalfield.</P>

      <P>The operational costs and other factors which gave rise to the decision by Mogul of Ireland Ltd. to close down the mine at Silvermines, County Tipperary, not later than at the end of July 1982, have been under consideration in my Department for some time.  I expect to be in a position very shortly to indicate the conclusions reached in the matter.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the company concerned have taken certain actions in relation to the mines which indicate clearly the intention to close down?  Is the Minister aware also that some of these actions may have made recovery of further ore from the ground impossible?  In these circumstances has the Minister taken any steps to ensure that the activities in question are stopped at least until he has had an opportunity to study in detail the consultants' report which is now available to him?  Can the Minister tell us also whether he has received from Mogul a request for subsidisation? I am aware that he has received representations from public representatives in the area and from a special committee set up by various interested groups urging him to keep the mine open for another 12 to 18 months.</P>

      <P>I have not received any specific request from the company in relation to the aspect to which the Deputy refers but the Deputy must be aware of the very limited amount of what is poor quality ore available at this mine.  Therefore, it was not big news to any of us to hear that the situation of which the Deputy speaks would arise.  It has been known for three or four years that the end was in sight.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may have misunderstood what I said.  I am aware of the application that was made in 1979 and also of the later one but I am not aware of the matter raised by Deputy Molony. However, as I have said, I will have my Department contact the mining people immediately.  I might add, though, that a conclusion will not be reached on this matter until I have had an opportunity of meeting a deputation from the area within the next week or two, a deputation that will include representatives of the workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy whether, in view of the planned imminent closure of the Mogul of Ireland mining operation at Silvermines, Nenagh, County Tipperary, he has any special plans to provide alternative employment for the 500 strong workforce; and, if so, what those plans are; when the alternative jobs will be provided; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the company's decision to close the mine, the Industrial Development Authority and the Shannon Free Airport Development <Col N="1858" /> Company Limited have, in recent months, significantly intensified the job creation drive in the Nenagh area.  The Authority have announced their intention to construct a 24,000 sq. ft. advance factory in the town which will be promoted for medium and large scale projects. Construction of the factory is expected to commence in September next.  A 50-acre site is also being promoted by the IDA for medium to large scale industry.</P>
      <P>In addition, the IDA, in co-operation with SFADCo, are holding special seminars for mine workers who are interested in establishing their own small industries. These efforts will be intensified and the IDA, SFADCo and the county development team will jointly take an office from Mogul on the mine site as long as is necessary to promote the establishment of new small industries.  The IDA have indicated that they would provide specific ideas for new business opportunities from their data bank and redundancy money could greatly facilitate groups of workers in establishing their own businesses.</P>
      <P>I would add that manufacturing employment in Nenagh has increased by 22 per cent over the last four years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware of the reason why the Mogul mine will close down.  There is no need for him to put on a big bluffing act here.  The reason is that the ore is running out and that there is a minor amount in a thin seam left.  That is the only reason it is closing down and it is not due to any inaction by the Government or anybody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied, in view of the traumatic effect this closure will have on the 500 workers, their families and the local economy, that the IDA have given top priority to the provision of a major replacement industry for this wasting industry which, as the Minister indicated, was on the way out in 1979? <Col N="1860" /> The ultimate outcome of the discussions that have taken place in the last three or four years is a promise of a 24,000 sq. ft. advance factory.  Does the Minister agree that all the IDA should be doing is providing an advance factory that may provide work for the 500 workers in three or four years time?  Is the Minister satisfied that that is progress?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We will never be satisfied until all possible jobs are placed throughout Ireland.  I am as conscious as the Deputy of the traumatic effect unemployment creates in any area.  The IDA must start somewhere and they have already taken steps in relation to Nenagh. The chief executive had discussions in Nenagh and SFADCo, whom I am sure the Deputy admires as I do for the efforts they made in that region, will be doing everything possible.  There is no instant solution to the problem.  One would think by the unrealistic questions put to me here that there was an instant solution to this problem and that factories could be pulled out of the air and placed in different areas.  That is not on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the information given.  I am telling the Deputy that the information given by Deputy Molony was an unemployment figure which comes from many other areas besides manufacturing industry. Deputies should not get hung up on what they think is inaccurate information.  I should like to tell Deputy O'Leary that his inactivity for seven months did not help my situation.  His allocation of a reduced amount to the IDA did not help the situation.  The inactivity of the last Government and their efforts to destroy investment confidence in Ireland has not left my job any easier.  Firstly, I must restore confidence before I can get investment here and I hope everybody is fully aware of what I have said.</P>

At a meeting on 3 December it was indicated to me that the life was September 1983. That indicates that the IDA were 18 months off target as regards projections. That is an important amount of time when one considers the need for a replacement industry.  Surely I cannot be expected to have confidence in the IDA when their predictions are so wrong.</P>

I should like to ask the Minister to ensure that in any future situation where a mine is about to close down proper steps are taken in advance to see to it that 500 people do not find themselves on the unemployment scrapheap.  The opportunity was there, as the Minister indicated, since 1979 and I urge the Minister to ensure that the appropriate agencies, SFADCo and the IDA, co-ordinate a little better with the Minister's office and companies like Mogul so that this type of situation does not occur again.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on a supply of natural gas are at an advanced stage between BGE and the Dublin Gas Company and I am hopeful that they will be concluded shortly.  I am encouraged by management changes in the company and by the operation of a comprehensive works agreement with employees.  Reforms in the operation of the company will continue to be monitored and I envisage that any arrangements with the company will be tied to its performance in achieving planned market performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consistent with the long-term requirements of premium markets, such as Cork, Dublin and other populated centres, and with a prudent depletion policy for the Kinsale Head field, it is envisaged that significant quantities of gas can be made <Col N="1865" /> available for electricity generation in Cork and Dublin over the period mentioned.</P>
    <P>At current quantities and contract price the supply terms arranged between BGE and the ESB have the effect that the price of electricity to the consumer is of the order of 10 per cent less than if imported heavy fuel oil were being used. I would emphasise that the level of electricity prices is influenced by factors other than fuel costs and that the benefit of natural gas use at any particular point is affected by factors such as the level of offtake of gas and the prices of other fuels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this is the correct strategy and it is one which I am pursuing.  There has been no delay in the construction of the gas pipeline from Cork to Dublin.  As the House is aware, I recently met the Northern Ireland Minister, Mr. Adam Butler, and there was broad agreement on many issues.  Officials from both sides are carrying out an immediate examination of other areas and I expect to have another meeting with Mr. Butler within a matter of weeks.</P>

      <P>Regarding the cost of electricity to industrial and domestic consumers, is the Minister aware that there is widespread public concern, especially in view of the fact that there is an oil glut and also because there is a supply of natural gas to the ESB?  Would the Minister consider abolishing the fuel variation clause in electricity accounts in view of the fact that it is now within our power to control the price of electricity to both industrial and domestic consumers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said that the price of electricity is a matter for the National Prices Commission, who are under the aegis of the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  That Department have received and will continue to receive full information from my Department in relation to various inputs in the <Col N="1867" /> cost of natural gas to the ESB.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that the ESB have had their offtake from Kinsale increased to 140 million cubic feet from 1 April.  Is the Minister satisfied that this is the most cost-efficient method of utilising natural gas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the situation in relation to usage but I am sure Deputy O'Leary is also aware that bulk customers were needed in order to get the pipeline into use in the first instance and to cover development costs. This is one of the reasons for the supply of gas being made available to the ESB on an interruptable basis.  Regarding the contribution of natural gas to electricity prices, my Department keep the other Department fully aware of the quantities they are getting so that this can be taken fully into account in assessing electricity prices.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy if he will outline his intentions regarding the supply of natural gas to Northern Ireland; and if he will particularly outline (a) the quantities involved on an annual basis; (b) the pricing policy to be adopted by him; (c) the route to be taken; and (d) if an underwater route has been considered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government believe that mutual co-operation in energy between North and South can be of major benefit to both communities.  A <Col N="1868" /> supply of natural gas to the North would provide an opportunity to develop a cooperative venture with potential for mutual advantages.</P>
      <P>Very recently I met the responsible Minister in Northern Ireland, Mr. Adam Butler, and we discussed certain issues outstanding.  Progress was made and we agreed that certain officials would examine the main unresolved questions before the Ministers meet again in the very near future.  Since questions relating to quantities and pricing arrangements still remain to be finally settled, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on them at the present time.</P>
      <P>All options on the routing of a possible pipeline to the North will be evaluated fully.  Until this evaluation has reached a more advanced stage than at present I will not be in a position to make a statement on the feasibility of the suggestion at (c) of the Deputy's question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are gravely concerned at the imposition by the South <Col N="1871" /> African courts of the death sentences on these three young men and believe that the carrying out of the sentences could further aggravate the already dangerous situation within South Africa.  Ireland has therefore joined with the other members of the Security Council in adopting Security Council Resolution 503 calling on the South African authorities to commute the death sentences.  Ireland's view has also been conveyed to the South African authorities through the framework of European Political Co-operation.</P>
    <P>We hope that the urgent appeals of the Secretary-General, the Security Council and of many other States, international organisations and individuals will not go unheeded and that the South African authorities will grant clemency to the three members of the ANC now under sentence of death.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment before Question Time I had paid tribute to the efforts of the Defence Forces during the snow conditions of last January in my constituency particularly. I would like to thank not only the Defence Forces but also the staffs of the Department for their courtesy and kindness during that period in relation to the entreaties of myself and the other Deputies representing Wicklow regarding the needs of the people there during that difficult situation.  I, as Minister for the Public Service, was glad that I could achieve a public pay settlement that brought its reward to the members of the civil service and the public sector.  I am glad that the Minister has mentioned in his speech that the first two phases of that agreement have benefited members of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The pay for a recruit now on entering the Army is slightly under £100 and after 14 weeks' training reaches £111.80. When further advances are made after some months it is possible to achieve £115 in present circumstances.  These pay figures are not tremendous, nevertheless they are comparable with the rate of pay that one finds in other areas of the public sector such as the local authorities, forestry and other services.  They compare well when one takes into account that they should be accompanied by proper facilities for training, education, sport, career guidance, etc. for people in the Army.  Therefore, in those circumstances they represent a reasonable level of pay settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to turn to one other section of the Estimates that has not been dealt with to any large degree.  Over the years the Naval Service in this country have never received the same prominence as that service do in other countries near us. I am sorry to say that those who are recruited into the Naval Service have not the same possibility of educational facilities being made available to them as do people who are land-based.  This is only <Col N="1918" /> natural, since their job takes them out on the seas around our country and, therefore, does not afford the opportunity of making available to them the educational facilities which would be available in areas in close proximity to the various Army camps.  Nevertheless, small though our Naval Service may be, over the years they have gained respect for themselves because of their operations.  When I was a small boy at school there was a sort of jocose approach to our Naval Service.  I am glad that that day is gone and now great respect exists for our Naval Service and for the work they do around our coasts.  Representing as I do a maritime constituency, I have first-hand knowledge of such matters.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a harbour authority. We have had regular visits from the Naval Service in the form of the mine-sweepers that patrol the coast around the Irish Sea. Recently one of the mine-sweepers visited Wicklow Bay.  These vessels do important work.  Recently we had an unfortunate incident when one of our trawlers was sunk by the activities of a British submarine.  It was the work of the Naval Service that brought to light the results that have come before us, namely, that the activities of that submarine were responsible for the sinking of the trawler. There would have been some scepticism about how that boat foundered had we not had a Naval Service to pursue the investigation into the occurrence.  That branch of the service is to be congratulated for the very efficient work done on that occasion.</P>
    <P>In co-operation with the helicopter service, the Naval Service co-operate in life-saving services around the coast.  I mention in particular the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.  Throughout the year, and particularly during the summer, the lifeboat service and the helicopter service will work with the Naval Service on those occasions when there is a need for it.  Too frequently because of the carelessness of boatmen, yachtsmen and fishermen the services are needed. On too many occasions because of a lack of concern and a certain carelessness on the part of amateur sailors in the community and visitors, we need to use the <Col N="1919" /> services involved.  On many occasions training is carried out by the lifeboat institute and the helicopter service and they work together in carrying out manoeuvres in the sea near my constituency. They are prepared to go into service at very short notice should the need arise. That part of the operations of our Defence Forces is often overlooked.</P>
    <P>One of the many proud associations my constituency, and particularly the town of Arklow, have with the Defence Forces is with the sail training ship, <i>Asgard II.</i> The Minister has given a report of the important activities in which this sail training ship is engaged in giving first-hand experience to adults and young boys and girls who would not otherwise have an opportunity to go to sea and experience the delights of sailing in such a fine ship.  We are proud that this ship was built in John Tyrrell's yard in Arklow and that craftsmen from Arklow were responsible for turning out a very fine vessel.  It can compare with any sail training ship in the world and in winning the international tall ships' race it has proved it is the equal or better of practically all vessels of that kind.  I am glad that the confidence shown by previous administrations regarding the sail training ship and in providing money for the commissioning of that boat has proved a success. I am sure the Minister has a strong commitment to ensure that the necessary finances are provided to allow it to operate in the future.  This will give more young people the opportunity to sail around our coasts and get a love for the sea that should be a part of the upbringing of young people in an island country such as ours.  I should like to congratulate the captain and the permanent crew of that ship.</P>
    <P>This is an important Estimate.  As Deputy Cooney said, because the Defence Forces do not have an opportunity to comment on their activities and to highlight their difficulties it is necessary for us as public representatives to be aware of the contribution they make and also to be aware of any difficulties they may encounter.  We take this opportunity to commend the efforts of our Defence <Col N="1920" /> Forces for their operations in Ireland and on the international scene, in the UNI-FIL context in eastern Mediterranean countries, in Cyprus and wherever they operate.  They have brought credit to this country.  On occasions it has been costly, but I know the Army welcome the task they do on behalf of the United Nations. On all occasions they have volunteered in large numbers.  This is an opportunity for us to record our satisfaction with the men and women of the Defence Forces and I am glad to have had that opportunity today.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputies from all sides of the House who contributed to this debate on the Estimate for Defence and also the Vote on Army pensions.  I agree with their comments as being very fair, responsible and knowledgeable, with one exception, and completely in tune with my own feelings in the Department in regard to both arms of the Department of Defence, the administrative and the military arm.  It is clear there is an appreciation of the work being done, of the many tasks undertaken and the immense spread of activities of the Army, the Naval Service, the Air Corps, the FCA, Civil Defence and, in other ways, by the Equitation School, the Army School of Music and the Apprentice School.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have come to have a certain admiration for a much maligned branch of the Army, the administration.  I was always under the impression that there was a constant tug-of-war between the military and the administration.  I find that is not so but that the administration too have played a very significant role in this success story.  I would compare them to the people behind the scenes.  The Defence Forces are on stage under the spotlights and the administration are those behind the scenes who are responsible for the <Col N="1921" /> lighting and the general production and are very responsible and should share in the compliments that are being paid.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that appreciation of the duties of the Defence Forces is so universal and that the amount of work they do is so well known to so many Deputies.  I would like to compliment the Minister for State, Deputy Aherne, on his contribution which was solely concerned with the Civil Defence.  I want to assure him that the commitment and the seriousness with which he treated the Civil Defence will be matched in the Department and this is very heartening. It augurs well for the future of that body.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed referred to the conditions of service of the forces with particular reference to pay and allowances which form a big part of this Vote.  The welfare of the Defence Forces has, at all times, been the special care of successive governments.  The conditions of service of all members are kept under constant and sympathetic consideration and any improvements which are regarded as necessary are made.  Very worthwhile improvements have been made and the Government constantly bear in mind the needs of the forces.  In particular the rates of pay and allowances are kept in step with the rates applicable in other areas of the public service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed referred to the question of compensation for the long and unsocial hours of duty of military personnel.  It is a fact that liability for duty at all times is one of the peculiarities of military life. Others include the liability to frequent transfers, the binding commitment to fixed periods of service and the restrictions inherent in military discipline.  To compensate personnel for these drawbacks and to encourage trained personnel to extend their service, a military service allowance is payable to privates, other than apprentices and recruits undergoing training, all non-commissioned officers and officers up to and including the rank of captain.  The current rate of this allowance for personnel with 3 or more years' service is £11.02 per week.</P>
    <P>In addition special allowances are payable to officers and men where they are called upon to perform particularly onerous <Col N="1922" /> or exceptionally demanding duties. Personnel engaged in Border areas, involving general disturbance and extended hours of duty, are paid a special allowance of £13.30 per week for men and £15.40 per week for officers.  Personnel involved in security duties such as duties in aid of the civil power and guard duty on vital installations, are paid an allowance of £6.50 for duties undertaken on week-days and £13 for duties undertaken on Sundays and Army holidays.</P>
    <P>I would like here to deal with the role and duties of the Defence Forces.  As Deputies are aware the primary role of the Defence Forces is to defend the State against external aggression.  In addition to this primary role the Defence Forces fulfil a number of other roles, which are also of great importance.  Broadly speaking these roles consist of&mdash;: (i) aid to the civil power; (ii) aid to Civil Defence; (iii) participation in United Nations peacekeeping missions; (iv) fishery protection; (v) other duties assigned to the Defence Forces such as search and rescue, helicopter ambulance service, and assistance on the occasion of natural disasters.  I would like to thank those who complimented the personnel involved and will convey those compliments to them.</P>
    <P>The role of the Defence Forces in rendering aid to the civil power has been specifically referred to by Deputies in the course of the debate.  In practice this means that the Defence Forces assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána, who have the primary responsibility for the maintenance or restoration of the public peace and for internal security. Unfortunately over the past number of years there has been a significant increase in the demands made on the Defence Forces for such assistance.  As I indicated in my previous statement this has involved the Defence Forces in a wide range of activities.</P>
    <P>Deputies will realise that, despite the cost involved, these activities are necessary in the fulfilment of the duty of the State to maintain security and civil order.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the very heavy burden which these duties place on the Defence Forces and also on the Garda Síochána. Such duties are necessary to ensure State <Col N="1923" /> security and, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, the Defence Forces must continue to undertake these duties for as long as is necessary. Personnel of the Defence Forces are given the training and equipment necessary to undertake the duties to which I have referred and I can assure Deputies that the arrangements for the provision of assistance by the Defence Forces in these cases is the subject of continuing review.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed emphasised the need for commitment on the part of the Minister for Defence.  He stressed that we should be determined to do the job well and to be forceful in providing finance for the Department.  I do not need anybody to twist my arm in this regard.  I will use every endeavour to carry out the duties that have been allotted to me as best I can.</P>
    <P>Escorts for cash in transit were introduced by the then Minister for Justice in 1978 following on some serious hold-ups and robberies.  The arrangements for these escorts are not the primary responsibility of my Department.  The Defence Forces, as in other matters of this kind, co-operate in these escorts in aid of the Garda Síochána.  The effort has been very largely successful so far.</P>
    <P>With regard to the strength figures quoted by Deputy Creed the position is that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force was 10,654 at the end of 1973 and it had increased to 14,750 by the end of 1977.  A gradual decline reduced the strength to 13,245 by the end of May 1980.  However, due to an intensive recruitment campaign a steady increase in strength was achieved from mid-1980 up to the end of 1981 when the strength stood at 15,202, its highest level since the emergency years.  There will always be wastage in any group of people for one reason or another.  But we need only be worried when the supply does not meet demand.  We can be happy in the fact that we have the biggest and, I would venture to say, the best Army for years.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of wastage it is important to bear in mind that non-commissioned personnel of the Permanent <Col N="1924" /> Defence Force are enlisted for definite periods of specified duration.  At the end of an engagement a man or woman may opt for discharge or may extend his or her service for a further definite period.  It is also possible to seek and obtain a discharge before the end of an engagement, for example, by purchase or on compassionate grounds.  Substantial turnover of personnel has always been a feature of the Permanent Defence Forces and will continue to be so in the future.  The loss of trained personnel, especially in the technical fields, can cause problems for the Defence Forces. However, this situation is kept under constant review by my Department and the military authorities with a view to ensuring that such wastage is minimised, as far as possible, and that adequate numbers are receuited and trained to compensate for any losses.  I might also add that while trained personnel who leave are a loss to the Force they continue to benefit the State by the utilisation of the skills and expertise which they have required in the Forces in outside employment. In my own native area, the Curragh, there was a reluctance to employ ex-soliders in civilian jobs as it was felt that their training did not fit them for any other type of work.  I am happy to say that this situation has been completely reversed and now ex-Army personnel are well trained and much sought after in many walks of life.</P>
    <P>In regard to participation of the military in Easter parades in Dublin the present operational demands on the Permanent Defence Force preclude the holding of a military parade at Easter.</P>
    <P>Up to and including 1971, ceremonies were held on Easter Sunday consisting of a military parade, a march past in Dublin at which the President took the salute at the General Post Office.  In 1972 and 1973, because of the heavy demands on the Defence Forces, particularly because of security duties, the parade and the march past did not take place, nor have they taken place since.</P>
    <P>While preparing for a parade it would be necessary to withdraw those participating, whether they were members of <Col N="1925" /> the Permanent Defence Forces or of the Reserve, from active service two or three weeks before the parade for training and rehearsals, thus putting an intolerable strain on the remainder as regards military aid to the civil power duties.  It was also the practice to withdraw many vehicles and equipment for maintenance and painting before the parade.  In recent years the operational tasks of the Army have increased and the deployment of troops for the Easter military parade would impose an unacceptable burden on the force.  That is why it had to be discontinued.</P>
    <P>Great stress was laid by most speakers on the question of accommodation, both in the context of this debate and recently in connection with Dáil questions. As I said when introducing the Estimate, accommodation is a major task and this is to be expected considering that many of the barracks and posts are very old.  Of its nature, the problem is not one which can be solved overnight, but I am determined to make every effort to achieve progress in this matter.  One must give credit where it is due.  Much has been done already in this area but there is still a tremendous amount of work to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>To provide modern accommodation for the single soldier, new billets have been built in recent years at Finner Camp, Dundalk Baracks, Gormanston Camp, Dún Úi Mhaoilíosa, Galway, and Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy.  Also completed recently was new billet accommodation for 90 female soldiers at Ceannt Barracks, Curragh Camp, and for 70 naval personnal at Haulbowline.  These billets are all of a high standard and compare very favourably with what is available to the single soldier in any army anywhere. Side by side with the provision of new billets there is a programme to improve existing billets &mdash; making smaller and more comfortable rooms with individual lighting, better heating and modern-day washing and toilet facilities.</P>
    <P>I believe good dining and recreational facilities are also essential.  A new cookhouse and dining hall complex has recently been completed at Kickham Barracks, Clonmel, and work is well <Col N="1926" /> advanced on another such complex at Finner Camp.  We are following a programme of improvements to men's canteens and a number have already been brought up to a very high standard.</P>
    <P>In the area of sports facilities there has been continuing progress.  The construction of squash courts at Dún Uí Mhaoilíosa, Galway, is nearing completion. Work on the erection of a new sports pavilion at the Army Athletic Association grounds, Phoenix Park, and on the modernisation of the swimming pool at Curragh Camp is expected to commence in the near future.  Improvements to the gymnasia at Cathal Brugha Barracks, Dublin and Connolly Barracks, Longford, are currently in hands. Even in a period of stringency it is nice to know money can be found for such projects and we must believe in the maxim that not on bread alone do the military live.</P>
    <P>Apart from accommodation, the building programme includes a wide variety of projects &mdash; the new FCA Headquarters being built at Portlaoise, a garage for motor transptort classes at the Army Apprentice School, Naas, a transport service facility at Cathal Brugha Barracks and an extension to the Apprentices Hostel at Casement Aerodrome in Baldonnel.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers raised the question of married quarters.  I am only too well aware from personal knowledge of the problem which arises here.  Over the years the Department have been providing new married quarters at various locations throughout the country.  The Army see their duty to provide married quarters as being one of supplementing the efforts of local authorities at centres where, from the military point of view, the need is greatest.</P>
    <P>As has been said repeatedly in this House and elsewhere &mdash; and this is the basic position &mdash; the provision of housing is primarily a matter for the local authorities and married soldiers have an equal claim on such housing with other members of the community in the same income category.  The Department's policy is to supplement the efforts of local <Col N="1927" /> authorities where soldiers' housing needs are greatest.</P>
    <P>The present stock of new married quarters is 334 and a number of fresh developments are at present being pushed forward. Work on the first phase of the programme for the replacement of the married quarters at Cathal Brugha Barracks is well advanced and planning and initial development are being undertaken on further new houses at the Curragh Camp and Cork.</P>
    <P>It is our intention that all unsuitable married quarters will eventually be replaced by modern housing.  Meantime, as the old type married quarters become vacant, it is policy not to reallocate those which are deemed unfit for occupation.  The weekly charges for the old type quarters &mdash; pre-1954 &mdash; are nominal.  Because of their general standard, however, the overall objective is to replace them with modern housing.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised the question of over-holders. I intend having this problem examined by the three Departments involved, the Department of Defence, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Environment, and I hope we can effect some breakthrough and get the people affected accommodation elsewhere.  This would have a two-fold benefit.  We would be housing the over-holders in local authority dwellings and this would free the married quarters for serving soldiers.  The payment of money due to over-holders was raised. The pensions of ex-soldiers who are overholding married quarters are withheld but the gratuities are not.  They are paid straightaway in the hope that they might assist them as down payments or help them get alternative accommodation and so vacate married quarters.</P>
    <P>The gratuities paid to members of the FCA are not taxed.  Gratuities paid to members of the FCA and An Slua Muirí in respect of attendance at annual training have been increased with effect from 1 January 1981 and they are not taxed. Those who do not less than 14 days training &mdash; area commander, officer in command of FCA staff or company battery and so on &mdash; get a gratuity of £108, or for <Col N="1928" /> seven days training £53; other officers get £71 a fortnight, or £36 a week; NCOs get £57 gratuity and £29 for a week and privates get £42 gratuity for their annual fortnight training with the FCA or Slua Muirí, or £22 a week.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy raised quite a few matters. The provision for the Defence Estimate, including the Estimate for £204,113,000 and £14 million Vote for remuneration and pay increase, amounts to £218 million.  That represents an increase of £46 million on the provision for 1981, which included a Supplementary Estimate of almost £28 million. I can assure the Deputy that, based on the current Defence Forces' Estimate, the financial allocation for 1982 will be adequate. We are providing nearly £1 million a week more than was provided last year. During the course of many urgings, Deputy Treacy urged that I should accelerate the recruiting drive.  He might examine his conscience there and ask who put a stop to recruiting and the embargo on the jobs.  In case he does not know, it was a Labour Minister, now departed from the House, who did that during his term of office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy also referred to increases in pay.  As I stated when introducing this Estimate, we have made provision for increases in pay under the recent agreement on pay in the public service and these will cost almost £14 million.  Those increases will be made on the Vote for remuneration.  I was also urged by the same Deputy not to be parochial.  I assure him that Fianna Fáil puts Ireland first.  We are not parochial. The party to which I belong are fortunate in being nationwide.  We have a representative in every constituency in the country and that did not happen because we were parochial or pandered to groups or to the lowest common denominator.</P>
    <P>There was reference to an under-estimation in 1981 to the tune of £10 million. That related to pay increases.  There was a shortfall in the Defence Estimate.  Seventy per cent of that last year related to pay and allowances.  It is normally made up by transferring money from the Vote for remuneration.  Last year the shortfall in the Estimate gave rise to a Supplementary <Col N="1929" /> Estimate which was an addition of 19.4 per cent.  In 1975 the addition required by way of Supplementary Estimate was 21.2 per cent, so this is not unusual.  It arose in the course of the year due to the buoyancy of recruiting, even though advertising for recruits was discontinued at the end of 1980.  We based our projections on that occasion on the strength of the Defence Forces in the autumn of 1980.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out to Deputy Treacy that nothing is as counterproductive as overkill.  He talked about over-holders, that there should be no harassment of these people.  There is no harassment of overholders, and I know what I am talking about.  No overholder was ever harassed or evicted and the gratuity is not withheld, though the pension is.  Even in the case of a pension, sometimes an advance is made.  The Deputy said that this harassment was not right or proper.  I assure him that his statement was not right anyhow, although it may have been proper.  It is not factual.  The service gratuity, where due, is paid to any soldier who is on discharge, whether he is overholding or not.  That is done in the hope that the overholder concerned might obtain, with the help of his gratuity, alternative accommodation.</P>
    <P>Security and Border allowances payable to personnel of units on duty in Border areas were first introduced in January 1972.  For married officers in 1972 the daily rate was 75p a day; it is now £2.20.  For single officers in 1972 it was 60p a day and it is £2.20 now.  For married men it was 50p in 1972 daily, it is now £1.90.  For single men in 1972 it was 40p a day.  It is £1.90, since 1 October 1980.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy said that the military service pension and the special allowance to our veterans were insulting to them.  I will now give the House the lower and upper income limits of the amount of pension paid.  First of all, for a military service pensioner the minimum is £658 a year and the maximum in excess of £5,000 a year.  For the widow of such pensioner it is paid at half the deceased husband's military service pension.  The minimum is £329 a year and the maximum over £2,500.  The minimum for a special allowance <Col N="1930" /> is £296 a year and the maximum £877 a year.  The widow of the special allowance holder receives an allowance of £296 a year, irrespective of means.  The total expenditure on pensions and allowances for veterans and their dependants is currently running at the rate of £8 million a year.  These allowances will be increased from 1 July next.  I would not consider that insulting.  The expression is ill-advised and wrongly used.</P>
    <P>With regard to uniforms, I am advised that, while there was a temporary shortage of uniforms last summer for particular sizes in certain items, there is an adequate stock of FCA uniforms now available and the delivery position in relation to contracts for Army uniforms is satisfactory.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Cooney pointed out, Deputy Treacy was wrong in saying that the potential officers course mentioned in my opening remarks was the first to be held.  That is not true.  The first potential officers course was held in 1922.  Then there were 20 students.  The next was held in 1970, with 31 students.  Another was held in 1975-76, when there were 22 students, then in 1978-79, when there were 25 students.  The present potential officers course has 25 students.  The decision to hold the present course was taken by my predecessor, Deputy Sylvester Barrett, on 12 May 1981 and the course commenced in October 1981.  This course has been in operation for many years.  I mention this because the subject is very dear to my heart.  Individual cases come to mind, but there was one particular NCO whom I was happy to help in regard to getting a house.  I saw him subsequently taking a second chance at his leaving certificate in the vocational school at the Curragh, when the Army block-released him for so many years to do this certificate.  Later I came upon him doing his potential officers course.  I am glad to say he is now a commissioned officer, married and living in Naas.  Happenings like this would give anyone confidence in the future of the Irish Army.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy alleged that there was some skullduggery in selecting participants for the potential officers course.  He seemed to be pretty definite about it, but <Col N="1931" /> I wonder if he made any representations in that regard &mdash; I promised to look at the files.  The course has been on for some time, so he will have had an opportunity of contacting a Minister more to his liking than I am.  I feel that I might not find any representations from Deputy Tully in the files because, instead of looking for a cure for the problem, he is more interested in coming into the House and getting publicity by raising the matter here.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, I meant Deputy Treacy.  There was mention, too, of the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  I would like to be associated with the remarks made about the invaluable services they provide to the community and to the fishing industry.  Arising from the wider responsibilities which were undertaken by these elements in the Defence Forces, the establishments have been expanded considerably in recent years.  They have been kept under constant review.  The Air Corps establishment was increased from 850 all ranks in 1980 to 1,170 all ranks now.  The Naval Service establishment was increased from 860 to 1,000 all ranks.  Any action deemed necessary in this regard will be undertaken in the future.</P>
      <P>The United Nations' allowances were also mentioned and the question was raised about allowances for our troops overseas.  These allowances are reviewed at regular intervals.  Procedures have been established over the years.  The allowances payable to personnel serving in Lebanon range from £15.25 per day for a married senior officer to £9.40 a day for an unmarried private.  The United Nations also pay an allowance of $1.28 per day to all ranks.  By any standard these can be considered fairly generous allowances.  These rates are subject to review, as necessary, and we will continue to have them reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I complimented those speakers who were involved in the debate with one exception.  As you can probably guess, a <Col N="1932" /> Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the exception is Deputy Treacy whom I find to be pious and pedantic, and full of platitudes, as he was before when he seemed to be marking me in the Department of Forestry and Fisheries.  It is nice to see an old friend there still.  He said that when Fianna Fáil left office the wages could not be paid, and but for the former Deputy Tully when he was Minister, the wages would not have been paid.  At no time in the history of this State were the Army left without their wages.  Remarks like that are demoralising.  He said it was demoralising for the Army.  I would imagine the attitude of the previous Minister who could be described as being on pre-discharge leave must have been even more demoralising.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy referred to the pitiful size of the Air Corps and the Navy.  I am glad Deputy Kavanagh did not share those views.  It might be well to ponder on what Government were in power when the order to cut from two ships to one ship was made.  It was made by the previous Government.  Deputy Treacy said there was a question mark over my credibility.  I look upon Deputy Treacy as the ultimate in hypocrites.  His carefully cultivated veneer of old world imperialistic diplomacy does not hide that fact.  He is a man who will never use one small word if he can use two big ones.  We listened to his tale about the foddering of the sheep in the Comeraghs and the debt due to the former Minister, Mr. Tully. He talked about the great credit due to him on that account.  I am not prepared to make any apology to humbugs like Deputy Treacy.  I do not have to explain myself to members of the Defence Forces or to my constituents in Kildare.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words now about the FCA.  Deputy Bellew referred to the FCA and I endorse his remarks about the value of the wonderful work they do, particularly in assisting the Permanent Defence Forces.  They have been very active in recent years.  It may not be universally appreciated that this element of the Defence Forces is the largest element we have.  It provides an outlet for young people to serve their country and, in the case of a future emergency, members <Col N="1933" /> of the FCA would make a very important contribution and play a very important part in building up our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>With regard to a specific point made by Deputy Bellew, I want to mention again that the gratuity payable to the FCA has been tax free for some years.  What is subject to income tax is the pay received by members while on annual training or security duties.  This is a question for the Revenue Commissioners.  I am aware that my predecessors in office and my Department have been making efforts, so far unsuccessful, to find some way to give some relief in this matter.  I will continue these efforts.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Bellew that the duties performed by the FCA, whether on guard duties, stand-to parties, fire pickets, or patrols, or whether they have to be present at blastings, form a very valuable contribution.  It is in the nature of things that on such duties where the FCA assist the Permanent Defence Forces there will be a certain mix of personnel to ensure continuity and experience.  This does not reflect in any way on the FCA members.  Indeed, it has been the policy of successive Governments to do everything within the limit of their resources to ensure that the standard of training in the FCA is maintained at a very high level.</P>
    <P>Deputy N. Brennan's contribution was all the more noteworthy because he is an ex-soldier.  He deserves to be listened to. He mentioned the embargo on recruiting. This is causing concern.  I hope recruiting will be re-opened this year.  I know fine young men who did three years' training and then left, and who are now anxious to re-enlist.  Such people would be a distinct benefit to the Army and I hope we will be able to accommodate them.</P>
    <P>Deputy N. Brennan spoke about housing, married quarters and sub-standard housing in the Dublin area in particular. I am examining all aspects of this very serious problem.  We will need the co-operation of the local authorities.  They will find that the Department of Defence will go more than half way to meet them in an effort to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1934" /> Deputy N. Brennan wondered why an NCO was not given an opportunity to represent Ireland in the Equestrian School.  He said representation should not be confined to officers and that there was no reason why the NCOs should not get this chance.  I agree there is a lot of sense in what he said.  The best jockeys are not the gentlemen jockeys.  They seem to come from the amateur ranks.  I have seen apprentices come up from the ranks and prove to be the jockeys I would like to have my money on.</P>
    <P>Deputy N. Brennan also remarked that he would like to see some of the barracks he served in.  We will give him an opportunity to do that.  I slept on trestles in Portobello during my FCA days.  Perhaps the pair of us could go out there and see if conditions have improved.</P>
    <P>Pensions and gratuities of officers were mentioned.  Pensions of officers are not directly pay-related.  They are based on rank, length of service in the rank, and overall length of service.  An officer may retire on reduced pension after 12 years' service.  If he wishes to obtain the maximum pension, a captain has to have a minimum of 24 years' service and have held the rank of captain for at least five years.  A commandant has to punch in 25 years' service and spend at least three years in that rank.  A lieutenant-colonel would have to have a minimum of 27 years' service and be at least one year in that rank to gain the maximum pension. For full pension for colonels and upwards, 30 years' service and one year in the retiring rank are necessary.</P>
    <P>At present a captain is required to retire at age 54, a commandant at age 56, a lieutenant-colonel at age 58, and a colonel at age 60.  Prior to 1 January maximum pension varied a little on either side of 50 per cent, or half pay.  From 1 January of last year maximum pension was brought up to 50 per cent of maximum pay in the case of captains, commandants and brigadier-generals.  The remaining commissioned ranks who enjoy pensions slightly in excess of 50 per cent will be brought back to 50 per cent.  These proposals will have effect from 1 January 1986.  For officers eligible for retirement gratuity, the maximum amount is one <Col N="1935" /> and a half years' pay, payable where the officer has served to within two years of the date on which he is required to retire.</P>
    <P>The question of pensions for non-commissioned officers and privates was raised.  These are related to the length of service and the rank.  In their case, a minimum of 21 years' service is required ordinarily for the award of a pension which could amount to about 35 per cent of their pay.  A minimum of 31 years' service is required to obtain a maximum pension, which would be about 50 per cent.  A soldier is insured under the social welfare code.  On leaving the Army, he is eligible for disability, unemployment or retirement benefits available under that code.  A man who has completed at least three years' service is eligible for a gratuity on leaving the Army.  At present the minimum is £168.93 payable to a private who has completed three years.  The maximum is 31 weeks' pay when an NCO or private has 31 years' service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney raised the matter of promotions.  He inferred this was a big issue, causing great concern.  He dwelt at length on the promotional procedure for officers and the procedure and format for confidential reports.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that the Minister for Defence is the promoting authority.  The regulations providing for promotion procedure prescribe that the Minister may, having considered such recommendations as may be made by the Chief of Staff, promote an officer from one rank to the next higher rank.  The regulations prescribe in detail the factors which the Chief of Staff takes into account when he makes a recommendation.  The amendment to the regulations made in 1979, to which Deputy Cooney referred, made no substantive change in the procedures which were introduced in their present from in 1975 &mdash; which will be well remembered in the House.  The 1979 amendment merely substituted the standard course for the command and staff course in the factors to be taken into account by the Chief of Staff and that some had been promoted to the rank of commandant.</P>
    <P>I should like to advert to Deputy Loughnane's question.  I am not aware of <Col N="1936" /> any general dissatisfaction among officers in regard to promotional procedures. Seniority and length of service weigh heavily in any promotion.  There are, of course other considerations such as suitability, but I am prepared to have the points made by Deputy Cooney examined. I do not consider it is as great an issue as he says and it is hard to believe it causes such concern and dismay.  It causes a certain amount of disappointment. Everybody will not get to the top. In my own case purely in politics I have no aspiration to become a chief of staff. I suppose qualities of loyalty, length of service and perhaps suitability are taken into account when one is promoted.  Perhaps there are others even within our own ranks who have aspirations to get to the top but when somebody does not get promotion and is disappointed possibly, he is likely to attribute that to other reasons rather than his own limitations.  Perhaps we could leave it at that.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that there will be no political patronage involved in any choices that are made in my term of office.  I am aware that in 1975 there was reason for dismay over promotions. That will not happen in my term.  I do not accept that there would be motives that one could in any way suspect attributable to the senior officers who will be making recommendations to me.  If one is worried about Army morale I do not think he should erode that morale by unfounded accusations about how promotions are made.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to confidential reports about officers.  The military authorities have reviewed the system of completing annual confidential reports and under the new arrangements introduced at the beginning of this year the report will be completed by the relevant reporting officers during the year rather than at the end of the year as had been the practice previously.  Amendments to the lay-out of the form were made at the same time by the military authorities. Perhaps we could have a look at these changes and see how they are operating.</P>
    <P>I think everybody was complimentary about the Army service in UNIFIL.  I was pleased that all Deputies agreed that it <Col N="1937" /> was a worthwhile contribution to the cause of world peace and that any request that might be received from the United Nations for Defence Forces personnel in the formation of a similar type force in the future should receive very careful consideration from the Government.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies expressed the view that Civil Defence should be under the control of the Army rather than local authorities. I think this view is not correct because in a time of war the Army would have its own role to fulfill and could not be diverted from its primary function. Civil Defence, as the title implies, is part of the national defence that is designed to mitigate the effects of war on the civilian population.  The decision that local authorities should carry out civil defence duties arose from the fact that the kind of organisation necessary for such functions &mdash; bringing succour to people who had lost their homes or food or clothing, the rescue of persons who might be trapped in damaged or collapsed buildings, extinguishing fires, rehousing the homeless &mdash; would generally be an organisation already in being under the direction of local authorities.  I think it best to leave civil defence under their umbrella but the military authorities would give Civil Defence any assistance possible with their operations.</P>
    <P>In 1982 the Estimates included provision of £1,170,000 for the purchase and maintenance of training equipment and stores but a sum of over £.5 million is deducted below the line in respect of stores ordered but not delivered during the year.  It is expected that existing quantities of most types of equipment will remain more or less sufficient for training purposes for the Civil Defence at present but the number of fire fighting appliances is running very low.  There is a need to improve the country's stock of radiation monitoring equipment.  Arrangements have been made for payment for five ambulances ordered but not delivered last year and for the ordering of at least one fire appliance and five ambulances in 1982 which will be paid for in the following year.</P>
    <P>I conclude by thanking all Deputies for their contributions.  I hope I have dealt <Col N="1938" /> pretty fully with the points raised.  It is not possible to deal with everything raised and if any Deputy has any matter now or subsequently that he would like to discuss with me I should like him to feel free to come to my office to talk about it.  Clearly, on all sides of the House there is an underlying desire to be fair to our Defence Forces.  I am delighted that this attitude prevails because for many years the financial pruning shears in successive budgets was first laid at the Defence Estimate each year.  I am glad this is no longer the case.  Unfortunately, it took our internal difficulties and the Northern troubles to alert us to the need for a strong and efficient Army.  I believe any neutral observer will realise that our Defence Forces are giving good value for money.  It is one area that proudly upholds the traditions of its foundations. They have a sense of commitment and strict discipline and real patriotism that has shown no sign of dilution despite declining standards in other walks of life. I am proud to be Minister for Defence and I look on my term of office as an opportunity to serve the country side by side with the members of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>Since the major financial provisions in the Department of Labour Estimate relate to services in the areas of employment and training I propose first to deal with the employment situation and to outline briefly the activities of my Department and their agencies which are aimed at improving the position.  The effects of the international recession continue to be felt.  Last year growth in our economy was only about 1 per cent, the same as in 1980.  This low rate of growth is reflected in the unacceptably high unemployment situation.</P>

    <P>It is worth bearing in mind, however, that rising unemployment is a problem which we share in common with most of our EEC partners and, in fact, the percentage increase in Ireland has been much lower than in some EEC member countries.  Indeed the main preoccupation of the EEC Social Affairs Ministers in recent years has been the growing crisis in employment.  In the Community, unemployment has continued to increase and has now reached 10.5 million representing 9.5 per cent of the civilian working population, which contrasts most unfavourably with some years ago.  In 1977 the figure was approximately 6 million. I do believe, however, that we have weathered the worst of the recession and that the prospects for the economy are now improving.  As the Minister for <Col N="1940" /> Finance has pointed out in his budget speech, the prospects for a modest improvement internationally are good. Despite the unfavourable climate for international investment obtaining in the past few years, the Industrial Development Authority have nevertheless continued to achieve increasing numbers of job approvals.  Many of these jobs will be coming on stream this year.  The Authority estimates that over 12,000 new jobs in IDA-backed firms came on stream last year.  In addition the Minister for Finance announced an overall boost of £50 million to building activity which should have a fairly quick impact on the unemployment level.</P>
    <P>The overall impact of the developments should be first to stabilise the level of unemployment and then to start reducing it.  Employment will be a central element in the forthcoming national plan.</P>
    <P>A new subhead in the Labour Vote under the description &ldquo;Training and Employment of Young Persons including Youth Employment Agency&rdquo; provides £41 million for advances under the Youth Employment Agency Act, 1981.  £40 million of the £41 million is the estimated yield in 1982 from the youth employment levy of 1 per cent on incomes from April this year.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise my Government's full support for the work of the Youth Employment Agency and our wish that the agency should exert a major influence on the provision of greatly expanded employment and training services for young people.  We also urge programme sponsors, existing and potential, to give full co-operation to the agency in their task.</P>
    <P>The Government view with particular concern the problem of youth unemployment. We must protect our young people from the worst effects of the recession. They are in a particularly vulnerable position.  The consequences of high levels of youth unemployment, both in terms of the demoralising effects on the individual and of the implications for society in general, cannot be stressed too much.</P>
    <P>While much of the extra employment and training facilities should come from expansion of existing schemes, I see the <Col N="1941" /> agency playing a key role, not only in co-ordinating that expansion, but in encouraging the development of new schemes, so that a wide range of facilities is available to cater for all categories of unemployed young people.  Of the £41 million in the Youth Employment Training Subhead, £32 million has already been allocated to existing services.  This provision will involve a rise of at least one third over 1981 in the capacity of programmes designed for young people under the auspices of AnCO, CERT, National Manpower Service and Departments of Education and Environment. The remaining £9 million is available to the Youth Employment Agency for allocation and may be used for further expansion of existing services and the launching of new activities.  The bulk of expenditure from this subhead is expected to qualify for aid from the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>In 1983 the Youth Employment Agency plan to make further substantial progress towards the creation of sufficient capacity to provide training and/or work experience for all young persons unemployed for six months.  The 1983 income from the 1 per cent levy will be substantially higher than the 1982 figure of £40 million and will thus support a further major increase in scale of activities.</P>
    <P>One of the youth employment schemes proposed for expansion is the work experience programme administered by the National Manpower Service.  The programme is designed to give unemployed young people first-hand work experience over a range of different activities by placing them with employers in both the private and public sectors for a period lasting up to 26 weeks.</P>
    <P>While on a programme, each young participant gets a tax free allowance and is not liable for social welfare contributions. This allowance has been increased from £20 to £30 per week and the possibility of further improvements is being considered.</P>
    <P>Since the programme commenced in September 1978 up to the end of December 1981 a total of 17,776 young people have participated in it.  The success of the programme may be gauged from the fact <Col N="1942" /> that over 80 per cent of these young people, succeeded in getting permanent jobs &mdash; this is a very significant figure &mdash; with up to half of those being retained by the firms which provided the work experience initially.</P>
    <P>The 1982 allocation of £5.4 million covers participation in the programme of 7,000 young people, that is, an average of 3,500 per week which will be an increase of 40 per cent on 1981.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Tánaiste announced certain improvements in the Employment Incentive Scheme which aids recruitment of additional workers. He indicated that we would jointly consider if further improvements could be devised.  I am happy to be able to announce the following changes in the scheme: (a) the £20 per week premium for adults is increased to £30; (b) the £14 per week premium for young people is increased to £25; (c) there is a new premium of £45 per week for employees over 25 years of age and at least 26 weeks on the live register; (d) the maximum period for payment is increased from 24 weeks to 52 weeks.</P>
    <P>In deciding on the new £45 premium we were concerned with the problems of the longer-term unemployed &mdash; those over 25 years of age and over six months on the live register &mdash; who represent about half of the total on the register. Every Member of the House will be aware of the trauma suffered by people in their late forties or early fifties who have become redundant and have difficulty in securing new employment.  They are perhaps competing with people some years younger who, in the opinion of some employers, are more adaptable and suitable to employ.  This move is needed and will assist adults over 25 years of age and who are over six months on the live register.  They represent about half the total on the live register and encounter difficulties in securing employment. AnCO and CERT cater mostly for people under 25 years of age.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Youth Employment Agency means that particular attention will now be given to those under 25.  Under the scheme at present about 60 per cent of those who qualify <Col N="1943" /> are under 25 years.  The new premium is designed to help the more mature unemployed worker.</P>
    <P>The scheme has also been simplified from the point of view of the employers who wish to claim.  The increases in premium rates, the more than doubling of the maximum period of payment, and the simpler procedures should make the scheme much more attractive to employers.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to make an additional sum of £4 million available to meet the cost of these improvements on top of the £2 million provided for in the original Estimate, and this is provided for in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer more specifically to the training activities of AnCO and CERT.  In spite of recession and its adverse effects on employment, AnCO's commitment to industrial training has not diminished.  This means that when the general economic situation improves, firms will be able to meet increased demand with a pool of well-trained staff and capitalise on the improved economic situation.</P>
    <P>This year AnCO's total non-capital allocation from the Exchequer amounts to £28.44 million including £19.3 million from the Youth subhead, and when receipts from the European Social Fund are added AnCO's non-capital funds for the year will be in the order of £60 million.</P>
    <P>AnCO aim to increase their throughput of trainees by about 30 per cent over its 1981 figures this year.  This will mean that some 24,000 people are expected to benefit from the wide range of training courses which AnCO are offering in 1982.  As might be expected, some three out of four of AnCO's trainees are under 25 years and about 10 per cent of its trainees will be trained on apprenticeship courses this year.  The vast majority of trainees however, will follow adult training courses.  Some 10,400 trainees will undergo these courses in AnCO's own centres while a further 6,600 will be trained by agencies in industry or education at AnCO's expense.  The numbers to be trained by these external agencies <Col N="1944" /> for AnCO represent a growth of 50 per cent over those catered for in this way in 1981.  AnCO also intend to provide additional training opportunities under their community youth training programme this year.  Here, it is planned to train 3,400 trainees, i.e. some 60 per cent more than they trained last year.</P>
    <P>Over and above these training activities AnCO also will train some 1,100 trainees in workshops established throughout the country to provide suitable training courses for severely disadvantaged persons, including travelling people and unemployed youths from the Dublin inner city.</P>
    <P>AnCO's capital grant this year is £9.68 million.  This sum, along with an ESF receipt of £2.6 million in respect of capital, will enable AnCO to proceed with the programme of expansion of training centre network and training capacity.</P>
    <P>This year two new centres at Finglas &mdash; the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be interested &mdash; and Cork will be completed, with trainee capacities of 400 and 700 respectively.  Building work will continue on the new 400-capacity centres in Loughlinstown and Baldoyle.  Work will also commence on new centres, one in Letterkenny and another in Limerick.</P>
    <P>As with AnCO, the bulk of CERT's trainees are under 25 and hence the bulk of their Exchequer allocation is provided from the new youth subhead &mdash; £980,000, in addition to which there is the £240,000 provision not restricted to the training of young persons.  With matching European Social Fund assistance, CERT will have a budget of some £2.4 million and this will enable CERT under their education, training and recruitment services in the hotel catering and tourism sector &mdash; to train some 2,000 young persons in formal long-term craft and management training courses and in addition some 5,000 hotel workers on short courses.  Also CERT organise special bar and catering courses for unemployed persons &mdash; 224 participated in 1981.</P>
    <P>A non-capital grant of £435,000 is provided in this year's Estimate for the Irish Management Institute.  This will be supplemented by grants from the European Social Fund which will amount to approximately <Col N="1945" /> £375,000.  While the IMI provides a comprehensive programme on management development, it has a particularly important contribution to make in identifying new areas of training and development for Irish managers and organising programmes for redundant managers in conjunction with AnCO.  The Government in supporting IMI activities are anxious to see to it that industry itself contributes its fair share to training its personnel level.  Helping to train the managers of small firms to achieve expansion and stability is an important need and it is heartening to note that two recent programmes in this area have led to significantly increased employment in the firms which have participated.</P>
    <P>The effects of the recession are apparent from the number of vacancies notified to the National Manpower Service last year, which dropped for the second year in succession.  In 1981 the vacancies notified to the service decreased by nearly 8 per cent.  However, as a result of increasing efforts to fill vacancies on the part of the NMS, almost as many placements were made by the service last year as in 1980.  There was an increase of almost 20 per cent in the number of job-seekers using the NMS last year.</P>
    <P>Improvements continue to be made in our manpower information sources in order to facilitate the more effective planning of education and training programmes to meet the present and future needs of industry and commerce.  From the beginning of last year the National Manpower Service have introduced significant improvements in the data compiled on their placement activities.  The service continue to publish the Manpower Information Quarterly, which is a valuable source of labour market information.</P>
    <P>The National Manpower Service will compile and maintain a youth employment register which will assist the Youth Employment Agency and their associate programme sponsors in the task of identifying unemployed persons under 25 years of age and addressing their problems in finding employment.  The register should help towards identifying disadvantaged groups and facilitate the agency <Col N="1946" /> in directing resources to the potentially disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>I might add that the local National Manpower Service offices and clinics are now provided at a wide range of strategic locations throughout the country.  The placement staff has been significantly augmented in recent years and training and back-up facilities have been continually improved, including the provision of more specialist occupational guidance officers.  The service is now in a position to provide a professional and efficient service to both job seekers and employers. Of course, the co-operation of those concerned is required.  I welcome all suggestions for further improvements.</P>
    <P>The resettlement assistance scheme has played an important role in attracting key workers, that is, those with skills in short supply here who have been mainly Irish emigrants to come from abroad to take up employment at home.  This helps to generate further employment opportunities for other less skilled workers.  In 1981 a total of 191 key workers resettled here from outside the country with assistance under the scheme.  I have decided that for the immediate future the benefits of the scheme will be confined to key workers and teachers of conversion courses and other specialised courses coming from abroad.</P>
    <P>The Manpower Consultative Committee have continued to advise on the role of the manpower policy in economic and social development.  The committee have examined the extent of shortages of highly qualified, skilled and semi-skilled personnel, including the possible effects of micro-electronics on the level and nature of employment.  They have also looked at other labour market questions such as attitudes to industrial employment, worksharing, the problems of the long-term unemployed, the allocation of resources between various manpower programmes and the special manpower problems of small firms.  I am glad to be able to say that courses mounted, mainly in engineering and computer disciplines, have contributed or are contributing to the elimination of imbalances between supply and demand of skilled manpower.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to employment <Col N="1947" /> issues I want to refer to the employment of disabled persons.  The 3 per cent employment quota to provide disabled persons with increased employment opportunities in the public service continues to be part of Government policy.  I am anxious that the target will be achieved as quickly as possible.  Generally speaking, all civil service employment is now open to disabled persons.  In 1981 about 175 persons were recruited into the civil service as a result of special recruitment programmes.  These special programmes will continue to be a part of general recruitment policy.  Health boards, local authorities and State bodies have taken positive steps to increase their intake of disabled persons despite the difficult employment situation.</P>
    <P>I and all Deputies should continue to remind the private sector of the importance of assisting and enabling the disabled to enter the employment arena. Many companies have been conscious of the need in the past.  I encourage those who have not seen the necessity for it to help in this way.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noonan has been given permission to raise the question of Aer Lingus charter flights by-passing Shannon on the outward journey.  The Deputy has 20 minutes and the Minister has ten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I thank the Ceann Comhairle and his staff for facilitating me in this matter.  I do not intend to take 20 minutes to make my points but with your permission, Sir, I should like Deputy Carey to be allocated part of my time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise this matter because it has been brought to my notice by constituents that Aer Lingus intend to operate from next week a weekly jumbo jet charter flight from Dublin to Toronto which will not <Col N="1948" /> stop at Shannon on the outward journey. This has very serious implications for the Shannon region, for Limerick city and the mid-west.  Under the regulations whereby Aer Lingus operate they are obliged to stop at Shannon on outward and inward scheduled flights.  In operating charter flights they have an obligation to stop in one direction.  It has been the practice that Aer Lingus flights stopped at Shannon in both directions.  When this practice was deviated from, they always stopped on the outward journey.  This is the spirit of the regulations because the benefit derives to Shannon when the stop is made on the outward flight and there is no benefit when it is made on the inward one.</P>
    <P>The overflying of Shannon on the proposed Dublin-Toronto weekly charter will mean a loss of £12,000 per week per flight.  Shannon will lose the catering on this flight to the tune of approximately £5,000.  They will lose the duty-free benefit which derives from a flight passing through.  In the case of a jumbo this is approximately £5,000.  It will lose handling and other charges of approximately £2,000, bringing the total loss to £12,000. I am seriously concerned about this financial loss to the airport and Aer Rianta are concerned about it also.  If this was the sole loss we might be able to accept it in a large international airport, but what I and my constituents fear is that this is the thin edge of the wedge and the downgrading of Shannon Airport.  Once it has been by-passed we will quickly reach a situation where most flights out of this country will be from Dublin and Dublin will become the trans-Atlantic airport despite Government commitments that Shannon would be the trans-Atlantic airport of the country.</P>
    <P>Shannon is more than just an international airport to the region in which it is situated.  It is one of the most attractive selling points the IDA and SFADCo have in attempting to attract industry.  They have been very successful in getting industry into Shannon and the mid-western region.  The airport is what makes it such an attractive location for modern, light technological industry.</P>
    <P>The Government gave repeated commitments <Col N="1949" /> that Shannon would not be downgraded.  I tried to raise this matter this morning by means of a Private Notice Question and when the Ceann Comhairle and his staff researched the appropriateness of the question they were informed by Aer Lingus that there was no change taking place.  This was a blatant attempt to avoid answering the question I am raising.  Aer Lingus are operating within the regulations but they have broken the spirit of them.  The regulations are being operated to the detriment of the country and Shannon Airport because they refuse to stop on the outward flight.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that there has been concern over the past 12 months that an international airport at Knock, for which repeated commitments were given by the Taoiseach, would be a competitor for Shannon.  This point was forcibly made by many public representatives and the Taoiseach repeatedly said that the status of Knock Airport would be that of an international one.  In my region there was a fear that international traffic would be diverted from Shannon to an airport 90 miles up the road.  This is far more serious.  We know the desire of various international air companies to fly directly from capital to capital and to fly in and out of Dublin and ignore Shannon. Now we have our own international airline aiding the attempt to upgrade Dublin and downgrade Shannon and the western region.  Other airlines will follow this precedent.</P>
    <P>This is the seriousness of the problem. It is not the loss of £12,000 a week.  It is not the fear of redundancies among the staff.  It is not the financial loss or downgrading of the airport, but the fear of a precedent.  Aer Lingus will explore this avenue further once they make the initial breakthrough and other airline companies will do the same.  I appeal to the Minister to stop it now.  He should contact Aer Lingus, open negotiations with them and ask them to keep the spirit of the agreement where Shannon was getting the maximum benefit from charter flights by their stopping on the outward journey.</P>
    <P>I am sure Aer Lingus will claim that they are doing this to benefit tourists and <Col N="1950" /> people using the route.  If a person is flying from Dublin it may be of benefit if he is domiciled in Dublin.  However, if you are driving from the south to Dublin to go to Toronto it is not of much benefit to you to be dropped in Shannon on your way back if your car is in Dublin.  The stop-over in Shannon on the return journey is merely a device to comply with the regulations.  It is of no benefit to the airline passengers, to Shannon Airport, to Aer Lingus, to Aer Rianta or to anyone. I appeal to the Minister to stop it before it goes any further.  It is serious for Shannon Airport, for the workers and for the whole region and, if it continues, there will be a very strong protest not alone in this House but in the region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Noonan in what he has said about the anxiety of constituents in Counties Clare and Limerick as a result of the decision of the Minister to grant Aer Lingus charter rights to fly direct to Toronto in competition with Trans-World Airways and to stop at Shannon on the east-bound journey only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a west of Ireland man the Minister of State should be familiar with the fact that we in the west want to have security of jobs.  This re-routing of charter flights by Aer Lingus is seen in Shannon &mdash; and was seen yesterday at a meeting in Shannon at which workers asked the chief executive of Aer Rianta, Mr. Dully, for an assurance in regard to this charter &mdash; as the thin end of the wedge as far as security of employment is concerned in the sales and catering end of the Aer Rianta operation.  At that meeting Mr. Dully told the workers that Aer Rianta had made representations to the Minister regarding this proposed flight by Aer Lingus. The workers themselves remember very well a statement by an Aer Lingus captain in which he maintained that Aer Lingus were losing money and were mad to stop at Shannon at all.  If my information to the effect that some Aer Lingus pilots require more time in New York is accurate it seems odd that Aer Lingus should have changed their system of charter, now stopping on the east-bound flight, in order to accommodate a crew <Col N="1951" /> change.  People in Shannon must look doubtingly at the intentions of our national airline if this is what they are endeavouring to do, starting off with a charter.  I appreciate that, under international regulations scheduled flights must stop at Shannon on the east-bound and west-bound journeys but how long more will expire before that regulation is changed?</P>
    <P>As far as continuity of employment is concerned we have had redundancies recently around Shannon Airport, and indeed in the Aer Rianta terminal itself there have been no replacements.  The number of people employed at the terminal by Aer Rianta has dropped some 8 to 12 per cent.  Therefore, workers employed in the sales and catering sections have become very nervous.  There was at one time in Shannon an international restaurant of repute but its clientele and output have fallen.  The workers are concerned that, with this flight and Aer Lingus not making use of the catering facilities, they will slowly but surely be made redundant and the kitchens become obsolete.  I understand that the competitor on this charter, Trans-World Airways, have not taken up the sales and catering contract which they maintain is too expensive.  Does it not look odd that Aer Lingus, our national airline, are not making use of the kitchens at Shannon? Surely they are the people to uphold the status of Shannon and, if they are having crew change problems, surely there should be more flexibility amongst their staff instead of downgrading the only international airport that we in Clare and the west generally recognise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to apologise for the absence of the Minister who is at a union conference in Cork.  He was not aware that this question was being taken or he might have been able to make alternative arrangements.  In the meantime I am standing in for him and have been briefed at very short notice because the question was taken at such short notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall reply to the points raised by both <Col N="1952" /> Deputies Noonan (Limerick East) and Carey.  First of all I should make it quite clear that there is no question of this being the thin end of the wedge, as was contended by both Deputies.  As far as we are concerned, we are totally committed to Shannon; there is no doubt whatsoever about that.  As the House is aware, historically we always have been and always will be committed to Shannon International Airport.  Indeed, this debate affords me an opportunity of emphasising, as did my predecessor in office, that Government policy in regard to Shannon Airport is that it is Ireland's sole trans-Atlantic gateway.  It is firm Government policy that it should remain so.  The health of Shannon Airport is vital not only for aviation purposes but also for its importance to the economic life of the Shannon and mid-west regions which cannot be overstressed.  I am not prepared to countenance any action in my sphere of responsibility which could conceivably damage the interests of Shannon Airport.  I should stress that this approach has been adopted by successive Governments. I wish specificially to affirm that the question of the compulsory Shannon stop by all airlines serving Ireland is not one on which I will countenanace any policy change.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the nub of the question and to the points raised by Deputies Noonan and Carey.  The rule on this matter is that scheduled flights must stop at Shannon Airport in both directions.  The only exception to this rule is where safety is an issue and in those conditions the captain of the aircraft is the judge.  As far as charters are concerned the rule is slightly different.  In the late sixties, in the context of encouraging tourism by removing a cost penalty, it was decided that in respect of charter flights one stop only at Shannon, on either the outbound or inbound journey, would be required. This rule has remained unchanged since that time and applies, obviously, to all carriers operating trans-Atlantic charters. The series to which both Deputies Noonan and Carey referred is a charter series and Aer Lingus are stopping at Shannon on all flights on the return journey, <Col N="1953" /> complying fully with the rules as they stand.</P>
    <P>I should say also that Aer Lingus are committed fully to Shannon, their scheduled flights stopping there in both directions and indeed they are the backbone of Shannon Airport.  We must recognise that and I hope that Deputies Noonan and Carey recognise their commitment and the contribution they make to Shannon Airport.  I hope that neither Deputy was voicing any criticism of or aspersion on our national airline and its contribution to Shannon Airport.  Without Aer Lingus Shannon Airport would not be the viable international airport it is today. As the House knows, it has been Government policy to have three United States carriers providing services to Shannon, none of them going to Dublin at all. Again, that constitutes another contribution to Shannon Airport.  I wish to stress also that there has been no change in the rules applying to both Irish and North-American carriers who are both obliged to stop at Shannon in either direction but not for chartered flights, as has been stated already.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that Aer Lingus's financial position on the North-Atlantic route has not proved profitable and we must bear this in mind whenever we discuss policy on anything else in regard to Aer Lingus requirements as far as their charter flights are concerned.</P>
    <P>I shall be bringing the points raised by both Deputies to the immediate notice of the Minister.  I shall ask him to examine the appropriateness of the rules in these <Col N="1954" /> particular circumstances and to discuss this matter with Aer Lingus.  But I cannot give any commitment whatsoever to changing these.  Certainly, the Minister will discuss this matter with Aer Lingus, because I know he will be concerned about the matter generally.  We must concede that it is in the national interest that Aer Lingus be profitable.  Where Aer Lingus make a case that they are complying with the rules &mdash; they are complying totally with the rules and I am sure are so doing to make their programme and charter flights viable &mdash; then we as a Government must bear in mind that we could not countenance a situation in which we would allow Aer Lingus engage in a loss-making operation.  I am sure Deputies Carey and Noonan are aware of this.  We will brief the Minister fully on this debate and bring the points raised by both Deputies to his attention early next week.  We will ask him to discuss this matter with the senior executives of Aer Lingus to see if there is any possibility of improvement in the situation.</P>
