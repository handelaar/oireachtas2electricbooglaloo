      <P>May we take it that this is an effort by Deputy Molloy to prevent the Government from making foolish promises in the coming Galway by-election, as they did in Dublin West &mdash; an example was the promised drainage of the Shannon and the promise of new community centres and new schools &mdash;<Col N="3" /> especially in view of the fact that we have not yet been told where the £45 million for PRSI is coming from?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Would the appointment of the ten new people in the Minister of State's office, with the transfer of the Forest and Wildlife Service to that section, not permit of a reduction in the numbers employed in the Minister's office, instead of an increase there as well?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I appreciate that, but does the Minister not appreciate that he has told me that the duties in connection with forestry and wildlife were transferred from the Minister to the Minister of State?  In spite of that, the number of staff in the Minister's office was increased by two and ten new people were employed in the Minister of State's office.  Can the Minister explain that?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> A final supplementary.  I do not think there were any advisers there &mdash; perhaps around the Department.  If the senior <Col N="6" /> Minister was relieved of duties in connection with forestry and wildlife, why was it necessary to increase the staff in his office by two and to create ten new jobs in the Minister of State's office?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I cannot let that go.  Did the Minister not realise on that occasion that I was having him on, that I was being jocose, that I told him my wife thought I was a hell of a fine fellow altogether because it was taking two people now to do the job that I had been doing when I was there for seven months?

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that for some time negotiations have been taking place between Dublin Corporation and St. Anne's Golf Club on the question of an extension of the club's golf course on North Bull Island.  In that context, discussions involving the corporation, the golf club and a number of private conservation interests have been held with a view to ensuring the conservation of ecological values arising from the proposed extension. As a result, proposals which will permit the golf club to develop an area of the island which is of little ecological importance have been formulated and agreed to by all interested parties.  It remains for these proposals to be approved by Dublin City Council.</P>
      <P>As far as my Department are concerned, no specific orders in relation to the Bull Island have been made under the Wildlife Act, 1976 but the area is excluded from the provisions of the open seasons orders in relation to the hunting of game species.  This factor &mdash; together with the general protection for wild birds, other than pest species, under the Wildlife Act &mdash; means that for practical purposes the area is a wildlife sanctuary. Some progress has also been made between my Department and Dublin Corporation with a view to the recognition, by way of an order under section 16 of the Wildlife Act, of an appropriate area on the island as a statutory nature reserve.</P>

Moreover, following a detailed joint study carried out by the IDA and the Forest and Wildlife Service, a mediumterm plan for industrial development, based on produce of the State forest, was published by the IDA last July in a comprehensive document entitled &ldquo;Developing the Timber Industry for the 80s&rdquo;.

    <Speaker pid="GodfreyTimmins" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry the present method by which his Department sell trees to timber processors; if representations have been made to him in connection with changing the present system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of methods for the sale of timber by my Department to processors.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the timber is sold standing, mainly by tender, partly by negotiation. Some timber is also offered for tender, either felled by forest staff at stump for extraction by purchaser or made available at roadside, having been felled and extracted by forest staff and cut to agreed specifications.</P>
      <P>A limited quantity of timber is harvested and prepared to varying specifications by forest staff and offered for sale at set prices which are designed as far as possible to cover the Department's costs &mdash; the price for the timber itself being based on expectations derived from the other systems of sale.</P>
      <P>The sales methods referred to apply mainly to small and large sawlog and, to a lesser extent, to pulpwood-size timber for which an over-supply situation has arisen since the closure of a number of processing mills in recent years.  Arising from this over-supply position and also taking into account sylvicultural problems resulting from delay in removing overdue early thinnings, a contract for a limited period was negotiated in respect of a quantity of pulpwood for export.  In addition, the bulk of the remaining chipboard factory's pulpwood requirements are being supplied under contract for a limited period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representations have been made by some large sawmills that they should be supplied with all, or at any rate the bulk, of their timber requirements without the necessity for tendering.  It is represented by the majority of these sawmills, constituting the Department's customers, that their collective sawing capacity now exceeds the available national sawlog <Col N="21" /> supply.  In the face of this, even if other considerations did not apply, selective treatment for individual firms would be difficult to justify.  However, a scheme has been devised in consultation with the trade whereby a limited proportion of individual firm's annual requirements of large sawlog can be allocated outside the tender system &mdash; this allocation being based on such factors as efficiency and previous consumption levels.  It is hoped to develop a similar scheme for small sawlog in due course.  The objective of the scheme is to encourage sawmilling efficiency and upgrading of Irish timber with a view to achieving a greater degree of import substitution and added value.</P>
    <P>In general, however, it remains public policy to dispose of State-owned timber by competitive tendering as far as is practicable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us that one of the objectives in part of the sales referred to is to cover the Department's costs.  He has told us also that total saw milling capacity is greater than the total output from the State forests. Would the Minister not agree that there is reason to review the situation since, if the sawmills can handle more that we produce, it is open to the Department to act in such a way as to more than cover their costs?  In other words, if the demand is greater than the supply should we not increase our prices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>We are supplying as much timber as possible to the sawmills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that the output of sawlogs was less than the total capacity of the sawmills.  If that is the case, if demand is greater than supply, should it not be open to the supplier to increase the price of the product? Surely that is one of the normal laws of <Col N="22" /> the market.  Therefore, would the Minister not agree that the Department should do better than to merely cover costs?  Is the Minister aware that there is a great deal of unease concerning the arrangements that have been made for the supply of timber for the manufacture of chipboard?  There is the suspicion that we are not getting as great a return from the State forests as we might be getting.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>We had discussions recently with the sawmillers concerned and reached some agreement with them. We hope to have further meetings with them but we consider the tender method to be the best method of selling our timber. Having regard to the meeting we have had with the sawmillers I am confident that a satisfactory arrangement will be made.</P>

Caithfidh mé a chur in iúl don Teachta freisin gur méadaíodh go mór ar an méid tonnaí a bailíodh anuraidh, timpeall 745 tonnaí, agus ní raibh ann ach 207 tonnaí sa bhliain roimhe sin.  Tá teacht isteach i bhfad níos mó ag na bailitheoirí faoi láthair agus tá Arramara lán tsásta na tonnaí go léir a cheannach ó na bailitheoirí freisin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if any progress has been made in the investigation into the alleged abduction of a 15-year old girl (details supplied) from Dunmore East, County Waterford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Doherty) Sean (Longford-Roscommon) Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 561 of 24 June 1982 in which I referred to the impracticability of furnishing reports to the House about the progress of individual Garda investigations. However, I think it only right to add in regard to this particular case that the girl in question was in touch with her family since she was reported missing. The contact was made from outside the State and, accordingly, the matter is in large measure in the hands of another police force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how up-to-date the Minister's reply is.  That question has been on the Order Paper for some seven or eight months and I do not know if it has been updated.  The information that the Minister has in his reply that the girl has been in contact with her family since she disappeared is absolutely incorrect and I have been asked by the family to state so here.  I have heard that before but it is incorrect.  I would like the Minister to tell me if possible if he is satisfied that the matter has been properly and fully investigated.  It seems rather incredible <Col N="30" /> that a girl of 15 years of age could disappear off the face of the earth.  It is over a year now since her disappearance without trace.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that all the necessary steps were taken in this regard and I am also satisfied that the present position now means that the responsibility for this investigation is in the hands of another police force while at the same time the Garda are constantly keeping in contact to ensure that whatever is necessary from this side can be supplied at the shortest notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be in a position to give that information now.  I am replying in regard to a specific case which the Deputy has raised and I can only give details as I know them about the case of which I am speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister make inquiries into what I raised earlier, that the part of his reply which stated that there was contact between the girl and her parents was incorrect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>That is valuable information and I am always delighted to have any information.  Naturally I would have to establish the veracity of that, but the information that I have from official sources suggests that contact has been made between the girl and her family and it was suggested to me that the family have identified the location of the girl but <Col N="31" /> not to the extent that the police were in a position to locate the girl.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice who bears the cost of the Garda and Army patrols which guard transfers of moneys and valuables between banks; and the estimated cost of these patrols in 1981.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Waterford)</i> asked the Minister for Justice the arrangements, if any, that exist for reimbursing the cost of the State of supplying Garda/Army escorts for private security firms delivering to banks and private companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of Garda-Army escorts for deliveries of cash to banks in 1981 was £363,000 in the case of the Garda Síochána and £1,054,000 in the case of the Army.  The cost is borne by the State and in that context I should perhaps point out that the escorts have been provided not at the request of the banks but on the initiative of the Government in a situation where large sums of money were falling into the hands of paramilitary groups or organised criminal gangs.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the transport of some of the money in question is undertaken in order to facilitate, directly or indirectly, the delivery of cash to local post offices for the payment of a variety of social welfare benefits.  This is so even in some cases where the cash is being moved from one bank premises to another.  The same principle applies to costs incurred in affording protection in certain cases to deliveries of cash to firms other than banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much regret, particularly at a time of economic difficulty and a time <Col N="32" /> when crime generally is on the increase, that substantial manpower and financial resources have to be devoted to tasks of this nature, but I am satisfied that the alternative of leaving large sums of money easy prey for terrorist and criminal elements would be fraught with danger.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely some of the costs should fall on the banks.  Nowadays the banks are being taxed heavily, but why should the State have to pay for the protection of the banks' money in instances like this?  You have to prevent robberies, but surely the banks have a duty to provide part of the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much more than the mere prevention of robberies involved in this situation.  What brought about the provision of escorts by the State resulted in a very serious bank robbery involving subversives.  Apart from the individual robbery itself and the crime attached to the taking of the money at that time, we have the other difficulty where large amounts of money fall into the hands of illegal groups or subversive organisations and are used and have been used in the past for the furtherance of their evil motives.  In that regard it is important that the State ensure that this is prevented.  At the moment we are paying the price of that, so to speak.  Unfortunately, that is the position, but it is a position that I would be prepared to review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the banks been asked to contribute to the cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The banks have been asked in the past to contribute and there were views expressed on both sides, from the Government's point of view and the banks' point of view, but at that time a Government decision was consciously taken that the present facilities should obtain for the reason I have given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be correct because where one has paramilitary groups or subversive organisations there is a definite assault being made on the security of the State.  Criminal gangs pursue their acts of criminality for other motives.  There is a very clear distinction.</P>

I want to suggest that you have the possibility of widening the terms of reference of this protective committee so that individuals like Deputy Mitchell who have deliberately set out to character-assassinate Members of this House could be brought before it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purposes of the Bill are to increase the authorised share capital of Irish Steel Limited from £25 million to £50 million; to provide, as a consequence, a similar increase in the value of shares which the Minister for Finance may take up; and to provide for an increase in the limit on the ministerial guarantee of borrowings by the company from £60 million to £75 million.</P>
      <P>The Dáil will be aware already that Irish Steel Limited are a wholly State-owned company with fully paid up shares amounting to £25 million held by the Minister for Finance.  The total amount of borrowings covered by ministerial guarantee at present is approximately £6 million.  The principal activity of the company is the manufacture of steel from scrap.  Their principal products are reinforcing bars, merchant bars and sections in a range of sizes mainly for the construction industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Finance dealt with the general background leading to the company's present difficulties when a supplementary Estimate of £25 million was passed by the Dáil on 13 May last to enable the company to repay their short-term borrowings. I consider it appropriate, nevertheless, for the benefit of the Deputies present today to again outline at somelength the general background to the company's difficulties and to provide more detail in relation to the present state of Irish Steel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to 1978 Irish Steel's production capacity was about 150,000 tonnes per annum but by that stage the free trade conditions resulting from accession to the EEC and the obsolescent plant had led to serious losses.  It had become abundantly clear that the company's entire <Col N="154" /> operation required restructuring if they were to stand any chance of becoming viable within the European Community. The company therefore, with the help of a Canadian engineering firm, had a restructuring plan drawn up and work on implementing this plan began in 1978.</P>
    <P>The old plant was replaced by a modern electric arc furnace capable of melting a load of 114 tonnes of scrap in between two and three hours to make 90 tonnes of molten steel.  This is poured into a new casting machine which produces three continuous steel beams. These are rolled on a unique rolling mill to produce bars which can be round, angular or flanged in cross-section and can be up to 70 metres long.</P>
    <P>The project is now essentially complete and its final cost is estimated to be £80 million.  Of this, £64 million is the cost of fixed assets and preproduction expenses and £16 million is the additional working capital requirement of the project projected over the period June 1978 to June 1986.  The £64 million fixed asset costs and preproduction expenses of the project represents an increase of more than 100 per cent over the first estimate for the project when it was initially approved by the Government in February, 1977. The reasons for the increase are several. Firstly, the original estimate was based on a general design concept and not on detailed costings.  Cost increases since then are attributable to the following principal factors: the need to extend and modify the original design, which was the principal cause in the increased cost; delays in deliveries and delays due to the restricted factory site itself; increases in preproduction expenses due to increased interest charge resulting from delays, and to higher interest rates than anticipated; and exchange losses due to the break with sterling.</P>
    <P>It gives me no pleasure to announce these cost increases but the reality of the situation is that these cost increases have already occurred and our concern now is to overcome their consequences.  The cost of the development itself is only one of the costs incurred by irish Steel.  They also incurred losses from 1974 to 1980 due to the obsolescence of the old plant: <Col N="155" /> they had it suspend production for 18 months while major items of plant were installed; and losses have been incurred since July 1981 running-in the new plant and attempting to break into international markets.  These factors together had resulted in borrowings totalling £85 million in May 1982.  These borrowings are reduced to £60 million when account is taken of the Supplementary Estimate for £25 million, which was passed by the Dáil on 13 May 1982.</P>
    <P>The company's accumulated losses at 30 June 1981 amounted to almost £26.3 million and their anticipated losses for the year to 30 June 1982 are about £22.8 million.  Further losses are expected to be incurred in each of the years up to 30 June 1986.  The company have recently negotiated a loan facility for £5 million and are now in the process of attempting to arrange further borrowings amounting to £10 million to enable them to continue in operation to the end of the year.  Their ability to raise this amount will be heavily dependent on the enactment of legislation to provide for an increase in the ministerial guarantee limit.  It is clear that the level of borrowing is far too high for the company to bear and corrective measures are obviously necessary.</P>
    <P>The current situation in the world steel market is very poor.  The oil crisis of 1974 severely depressed the steel market and it has not yet recovered.  At present the level of overcapacity in steel production in Europe is estimated at 30 million tonnes.  In addition to this the European steel industry is experiencing increasing competition from such countries as Japan, Korea and Brazil in the case of the market for heavy steel, as the steel plants in these countries are of a more modern design and efficiency.  In the market for the lighter range of products, where Irish Steel operate, there is also stiff competition from third world countries with their cheap labour and cheap energy in many cases.</P>
    <P>To prevent the European steel industry from being destroyed by internal competition a scheme was drawn up in the late seventies, called the &ldquo;Davignon Plan&rdquo;, with the overall purposes of cutting <Col N="156" /> down production capacity and restoring international competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Measures currently being exercised by the EEC Commission in this connection include: Restrictions on investment in steel; restrictions on State aids to steel; restrictions on steel production; measures to raise steel prices; aids for redundancy, short-time working and early retirement; loans to industries which can help to replace employment lost through steel plant closures and loans to help steel undertakings to carry restructuring plans, involving reduction in capacity.</P>
    <P>As far as the Irish steel industry is concerned, which represents only about 0.2 per cent of Community production, our principal concern in the context the ECSC discussions on the continuation of such measures for the foreseeable future has been ensure that Irish Steel, who carried out their recent restructuring plan with EEC Commission approval, should now be viable.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil debate on the Supplementary Estimate for Irish Steel, accusations of spreading pessimism and of creating a lack of confidence were made.  I should like to reiterate that it is in the interest of the taxpayer that all the factors relating to Irish Steel's difficult position should be fully spelled out.  To put things into their proper perspective, it must be pointed out that it is in the context of the uniquely difficult world market situation to which I have referred that Irish Steel must quickly acquire the ability to export over 70 per cent of their products to other European countries.  The difficulties facing Irish Steel are enormous and it would be misleading for me to understate them here today.  The prospects for the international steel market simply cannot be viewed optimistically.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, some 11,000 tonnes of reinforcing bars from Argentina were imported into Ireland earlier this year.  Normally, the total Irish rebar market is about 65,000 tonnes per annum, of which Argentina has traditionally no part.  The fact that some 17 per cent of the market has now been supplied by a new entrant will cut back the market share of the suppliers who normally service the Irish steel market and will <Col N="157" /> have a particularly serious effect on Irish Steel.  I had an immediate complaint made to the EEC Commission regarding these imports and I understand that Irish Steel Ltd. lodged an anti-dumping complaint with the Commission on 28 May 1982.  It is my intention to support this anti-dumping complaint in any way possible.</P>
    <P>As far as employment is concerned, Deputies may be aware that, earlier this year, the company negotiated a voluntary redundancy scheme for employees who were surplus to requirements.  Under this scheme 64 employees have accepted redundancy.  I understand that, due to the current very depressed market conditions and the substantial accumulation of finished and semi-finished products, the company propose to introduce a three-day working week for some 500 employees in the near future.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these difficulties it is relevant to point out that Irish Steel now have one of the most modern plants of its kind in the world.  It has the advantage of being able to produce a far wider range of products, 84 in all, than any other mill of its size in Europe.  This gives the company a competitive advantage in dealing with merchants.  In addition, it is fair to say that a small, efficient and flexible producer has a special advantage in the market, however depressed it may be. The plant being used by Irish Steel is the only type of steel plant which is now profitable in Europe.  Taking these factors into account, Irish Steel's prospects, though difficult, are reasonably good given a proper approach to sales management and cost control.</P>
    <P>In relation to marketing, I should again like to point out that a new sales manager, who had considerable experience selling in international markets, has been appointed.  A total of 20 new management personnel have been recruited since 1978, including the new chief executive and the new sales manager, in the company's efforts to build up a management team of the highest calibre in order to make it more competitive in the market place.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel's current position, in the absence of a proper capital structure, is <Col N="158" /> such that they will be forced to have continued recourse to borrowings.  A crucial stage has been reached in the affairs of Irish Steel and it is normal good administrative practice for the Government to consider very carefully over the next year, all the options for the future of Irish Steel, to ensure that the best interests of both the company and the taxpayer are safeguarded.  In this connection, I should say that the Government and the European Commission will jointly appoint consultants in the near future to assess the viability of the company. Until this examination is completed it would not be possible for me to say what the Government's future intentions would be for the future financing of the company.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress that no new financial aid, and this includes equity investment, may be made by a member state to a steel undertaking without the prior approval of the Commission.  As far as the provisions in the present Bill are concerned, the Commission has approved the increase of £15 million in the ministerial guarantee limit.  The Commission has not, however, approved the taking up of additional shares in the company and will not consider an application for further investment in the company until the results of the consultancy study are available.  In the meantime, the increase in the ministerial guarantee limit will be sufficient to ensure the continued operation of the company for some months.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel are under no misapprehension of the difficulties facing them.  I am hopeful, however, that with the continued good response from the company, and with a properly worked our strategy, the future of the company may be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>The only other provision in the Bill is a minor amendment to provide that the company should comply with directives about remuneration and conditions issued from time to time by the Minister for Industry and Energy, given with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Bill will commend itself to the Dáil and I recommend the Bill for its approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no exaggeration to say that the past number of years have not been happy times for Irish Steel Holdings.  It is equally true to say that the past eight years especially have not been happy for the steel industry in Europe and internationally.</P>
      <P>In relation to the company, the subject matter of the Bill before us, they have gone through the trauma of modernisation and change from an obsolescent plant to one that is now among the most modern of its type in Europe and throughout the world.  In 1974 the company, together with their competitors, had to endure the trauma of the revolution in oil prices and the effect that had on steel production and steel markets throughout the world.  With other manufacturers in Europe the company have experienced the increasing aggression and competitiveness of steel manufactured by Third World countries who have the benefit of cheap labour and who have been making inroads into the European and other markets.</P>
      <P>It was for such reasons that the decision was made in early 1977 to initiate this programme of modernisation for Irish Steel Holdings.  It was interesting to read the statement in the speech of the Minister today that the final costs of restructuring the plant and providing adequate working capital have resulted in a figure which is more than 100 per cent in excess of the original estimate presented to the Government at that time.  It is fair to say that it is difficult to keep down costs in times of high inflation in many countries &mdash; an inflation that apparently has been allowed to become endemic in our economy &mdash; but nonetheless it is disturbing that estimates of such a substantial nature could be so out of line as not to have sufficiently estimated the potential factor of continuing inflation and of other costs which might influence the eventual out-turn of the cost of a plant of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to very many of the heavy investments &mdash; not just Irish Steel &mdash; which the State have undertaken and are being asked to undertake, sufficient attention has not been paid to the production <Col N="160" /> of realistic estimates of high capital costings, of restructuring and of State investment in both State companies and participation in the equity of private companies. The history of the estimates provided to Governments in this regard is a sorry one and, to some extent, reflects upon us all.  Public representatives and public servants must examine their collective consciences as to whether sufficient attention has been given to how realistic estimates of this nature are at their time of presentation, and how that presentation influences the decision of Governments as to the extent of their participation and commitment to any particular venture.</P>
    <P>The losses in Irish Steel have been steadily mounting each year since 1974, initially because of the effects of the oil revolution and the increasing obsolescence of the type of plant which has been operated.  In more recent years it was due to the disruption in production and sales because of the installation of the new plant, the gearing up of that plant and the attempts which are now being made to break into new markets.  All these factors have resulted in a total borrowing by Irish Steel of some £84 million or £85 million.  That is indeed a daunting figure when one looks at the existing share capital of the company and the Government's participation in it.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look at the loss figures produced by Irish Steel for each of the last three years for which accounts have been published.  The losses to June 1979 amounted to £2.926 million.  A year later they were £6.614 million and, in the last year for which figures are available, the losses amounted to £12.946 million. While I think the House would accept that there were exceptional reasons for the losses in the year up to June 1981 because of the finalisation of the commissioning and installation of the new plant, they are nonetheless daunting figures. In many respects one of the few heartening things that one could take from the production of the annual report and the chairman's statement for Irish Steel, is that the report itself was published very efficiently and expeditiously <Col N="161" /> in the context of the financial year in question, a trait that is not common among a number of the companies that enjoy heavy investment by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I was a little taken aback that the Minister, while explaining that the old plant had a production capacity of 150,000 tonnes per annum up to 1978, did not outline what would be the minimum amount that would be required to be produced by the new plant in order to make it viable.  There are two separate figures to be given: the total production capacity of the new plant operating at peak and the other, the more realistic one, is the figure which would be required to be produced in order to reach any level of viability on the new mini mill, which is of the modern electric furnace type. There seems to be a divergence of opinion between the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, the Minister for Industry and Energy and the chairman as to the range of products that can be produced in the new plant.  The Minister and his colleague have stated that the plant is capable of producing 84 products when it is operating at full range.  The chairman in his statement claimed that the plant can produce a range of over 100 products. It is a small point but the Minister responsible and the chairman ought to be <i>ad idem</i> as to what can be produced.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has said, the total capital cost of the plant and preproduction expenses now amount to £64 million. There is a requirement of an additional £16 million for extra working capital.  I was glad to see those figures presented today by the Minister separately.  There was to some extent an attempt in the moving of the Supplementary Estimate to combine the figures.  The point was fairly made at that time by Deputy Eddie Collins that the addition of working capital ought not to be included in the initial capital cost of setting up and gearing up plants.</P>
    <P>In relation to the last year for which we have figures there was, as the chairman said, a particularly strange situation where the firm had minimum production, maximum costs and negligible sales.  The sales involved existing stock and the company <Col N="162" /> made no finished deals during the last financial year.  The upshot was that in October 1980, 213 employees were laid off.  It was hoped this would be of a temporary nature and in July last year 112 workers were re-employed.  Subsequently a scheme has been introduced to persuade people into early retirement.</P>
    <P>We should have discussed at greater length the situation regarding the total workforce in the firm at present.  The Minister referred to the fact that it may be necessary for Irish Steel to put the total workforce on a three-day week.  I am not clear whether the 500 workers he refers to are the total workforce of the firm or the core of that force.  From the point of view of the substantial numbers employed by Irish Steel it should be made clear what the future earning potential of that workforce is.  It has been suggested that at present, even with the limited amount of production in Irish Steel, production quantities exceed the amount of sales and to some degree stockpiling is taking place.  If that is the case when we are in the initial period of production and the prospect for the workforce is a three-day week, it is a very serious matter and should be discussed by this House in greater detail than has been outlined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced that there is to be a study of the future viability of the firm and, while there was an indication given of that previously, he has today indicated that that study will be set up not just by our Government but by the European Steel and Coal Commission also.</P>
    <P>I realise from the Minister's remarks that there is to be further clarification in regard to the amount of authorised borrowing that the EEC Commission may permit.  This is an enabling Bill to allow borrowing to be made by the company on the State, with the proviso that this must be agreed to by the European Commission. I would like some indication to be given to the House of how long it is expected that that study will take.  We have a year ago, in a Supplementary Estimate a few months ago, and today, seen further and fairly massive injections of State funds into Irish Steel.  It is important <Col N="163" /> from the point of view of all concerned, the taxpayer, this House which has a responsibility to that taxpayer, but which has equally a responsibility to the employees of Irish Steel Holdings Ltd., that there be some indication given of the Government's intention and commitment towards the future of Irish Steel Holdings Ltd., not just for the remainder of this year &mdash; as would appear to have been indicated by the Minister now &mdash; but during what obviously will be the considerably difficult period of endeavouring to break into new markets with these new products and to regain Irish Steel Holdings traditional share of the Irish market.  I fear there will be perhaps less than full enthusiasm displayed, or that might be expected to be displayed, from the sales and marketing personnel, apart from any other employees, if they find themselves in a situation in which there is a very large question mark hanging over the Government's future attitude to Irish Steel Holdings.  Whilst a study may be deemed inevitable by the EEC there is nonetheless an urgency attaching to this from the point of view of the employees of the company, their whole approach to the operations of Irish Steel Holdings and their confidence in the knowledge of what is Government policy in relation to their company.</P>
    <P>It is now generally accepted that the sort of mini-mill provided in Cork is the most modern of its kind in Europe, indeed is one of the only type of steel mill likely to make a profit in the foreseeable future.  It is heartening that at least in relation to the type of plant, and more especially the type of product capable of manufacture in Cork, there is great potential if and when there is an upturn in world markets and return to a more realistic pricing structure.  However, the worry will have to be in regard to the extremely high capital costs incurred in the installation of this plant, accumulated losses over that period of installation and the servicing of the debt that has developed during that period.</P>
    <P>The strategy outlined by Irish Steel Holdings is that over 70 per cent of the products they will manufacture will be <Col N="164" /> exported.  That laudable aim must also be described as a brave aim in the context of an already much overcrowded and depressed world market.  It is sobering to reflect that at present over-capacity amongst European steel mills amounts to 30 million tonnes per annum.  Apart from that over-capacity within the Community there has been also the much more aggressive marketing policy adopted by Japanese, Korean, Brazilian and other manufacturers.  That strategy on the part of Irish Steel Holdings must involve a most aggressive marketing policy combined with a stringent cost control in relation to production costs.  Those two factors alone will not suffice.  Unless there continues to be in an increasing way an adequate EEC pricing policy and also an adequate EEC policy in relation to production control and the policing of quotas then in the medium term there is no real hope of a return to a viable European steel industry.  Whilst one must welcome the changes introduced in the management and marketing policies of Irish Steel Holdings and in their very real commitment, as illustrated in their annual report, to adopt not only an aggressive marketing policy but also one of having stringent production cost control, those alone &mdash; good housekeeping in relation to the Irish producer &mdash; will not suffice as long as there is a depressed European and world market with artificially low prices and with the extraordinary over-production capacity existing amongst the major steel mills throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it behoves the Government, not alone in regard to any study they may commission as to the viability of Irish Steel Holdings but also in relation to their approach and representations to the EEC Commission, to ensure that the best interests of Irish Steel Holdings and their future marketing policies are pursued aggressively, and also that their interests in relation to ensuring production quotas are extended.  I understand it had been hoped that steel production quotas would be extended until the end of 1983 but that as a result of a decision taken at the beginning of May production quotas will be extended for a further 12 months only until the middle of next year. <Col N="165" /> We are already talking about a situation in which apparently it will take Irish Steel Holdings four to five years to bring their full range of products into production progressively and to market them.  We are also talking about a situation in which the introduction of production controls in Europe has helped but marginally only within the market at present.  Unless there can be a decision taken over a realistically and reasonably long period to insist on those quotas for production amongst the major steel manufacturers of Europe, together with a progressive upgrading of pricing policy, the prospect for Irish Steel Holdings of being able to branch out into the other range of products available to them will be seriously diminished.</P>
    <P>For that reason it is very important that the attitude of Irish Steel Holdings be supported by the Irish Government and the Minister responsible in their dealings with the European Economic Commission. In that regard, a number of factors arise.  Whilst Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. were out of production &mdash; presumably because of the depressed state of the market &mdash; there was quite an active campaign engaged in by those who will now be competitors of Irish Steel Holdings in an effort to gain that section of the market traditionally enjoyed by Irish Steel Holdings.  Such things as specially extended credit terms were extended to customers of Irish Steel Holdings on the Irish market with the result that one of the first tasks now facing the company is to recover for themselves their traditional share of the Irish market.  In that regard the importation of 11,000 tonnes of Argentinian reinforcing bars referred to by the Minister is of considerable worry. While the Minister has referred to this matter now and said that he has supported the complaint lodged by Irish Steel Holdings Ltd., it is incumbent on him to explain to the House exactly how this Argentinian steel &mdash; steel coming from outside the Community &mdash; could find its way onto and be dumped on the Irish market in such a manner that the only action that could be taken by an Irish Minister was to complain retrospectively that it had arrived and was on sale.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="166" /> When we are talking about a world situation of over-production and of manufacturers outside the Community surely there could have been devised a safeguard whereby it would have been impossible for that non-EEC steel to have found its way onto the Irish market.  It is a little too late to talk about a State company in the difficult position in which Irish Steel Holdings now find themselves, facing heavy competition from their competitors, to discover also steel produced from outside the Community arriving on the Irish market at about the same time as the only Irish steel mill owned by the State is endeavouring to recover their share of that market.  Whilst the Minister's support of Irish Steel Holdings complaint is to be welcomed I should prefer to hear from him the steps he intends taking to ensure that there cannot be a repetition of such an occurrence.</P>
    <P>I accept that Governments generally are anxious to see their own steel industry supported.  Perhaps the Minister is not the only one who has experienced problems with Argentinian steel merchants of one sort or another in recent times.  The Minister should have told us how he intends to tackle this or similar problems in the future.  He should also have referred to the controls he has taken or would take to prohibit the exportation of Irish scrap to countries outside the EEC. The situation generally about licences in relation to the importation of scrap from non-EEC countries should be attended to.  We should be told if the Minister has power to prohibit the exportation of scrap to non-EEC countries.</P>
    <P>The new plant at Cork is well placed to benefit from any increase in world or EEC markets.  Our production represents only .2 per cent of the total steel production capacity of the EEC.  The EEC capacity represents only 18 per cent of the total world capacity as opposed to 29 per cent manufactured in eastern Europe, 16 per cent in the USA and 25 per cent in Asia.  The production capacity of Irish Steel in world context is, therefore, miniscule.  In relation to the production quotas I referred to which the Commission introduced, have temporarily extended and, we hope, will extend <Col N="167" /> further, it is as well to make the point that while Irish Steel are manufacturing at the moment far less than their total capacity, because the new plant is only going into commission, it would be wrong for the Government to agree to a quota being assigned to Irish Steel based on the production capacity of the old plant because that capacity is far less than the capacity of the new mill.  That is why I inquired about the viable level of the new plant.  In any negotiations in regard to Irish quotas it is necessary that those quotas are based on the viable level of the new plant rather than on the traditional output of the old plant which ceased operation in 1978-79.</P>
    <P>I accept that in the last year, through the activities of the Commission, there has been an increase of 12 to 14 per cent in the price of steel in Europe although during 1980 the EEC prices were 15 to 20 per cent lower than the price in the USA.  It should also be said, in relation to pricing and production quota controls, that it would clearly favour the type of product and the range of product manufactured by Irish Steel if the quotas in relation to dealers, which apparently at present are set in relation to dealers who handle over 12,000 tonnes per annum, were lowered and applied to dealers handling smaller amounts of steel.  I understand that it would be in the interests of Irish Steel Holdings Limited if the regulations applied to dealers handling steel in excess of 3,000 tonnes per annum rather than the existing quotas of 12,000 tonnes because of the type of product Irish Steel are capable of producing.  The Minister should investigate the possibility of having those quotas in relation to dealers extended to the smaller type dealers as well.</P>
    <P>The chairman's report refers to the fact that the 1981 energy costs for Irish Steel were the highest energy costs incurred by any steel mill in Europe.  The Minister should explain to what extent Irish Steel are at present using natural gas produced in Cork and to what extent the plant might be capable of using further supplies of that natural gas.  I accept that before we endeavour to solve the energy costs <Col N="168" /> problem in relation to Irish Steel, we should establish a national pricing policy for energy sources.  Perhaps, in regard to assessing the capabilities of large State companies like Irish Steel to use the natural energy sources produced here, we should as well assess the pricing policy in relation to the sale of that gas or other native energy sources to such production companies.  We should receive clarification of the extent to which Irish Steel could rely on natural gas for their total production from the point of view of energy needs.</P>
    <P>It is sobering to reflect on the fact that a company operating in such a competitive and depressed market should have to say that they have found themselves with higher energy costs than any of their competitors in Europe.  This factor will have to be taken into account and will have to reflect itself in the pricing structure of Irish Steel products.  I would like the Minister to tell us when the mill will be capable of being in full production. There was a suggestion in the chairman's statement that the mill would not reach its optimum output until the end of the fourth year after start up.  In view of the serious situation obtaining in relation to sales and the possible stockpiling, which I hope the Minister will deal with in his reply, and the employment prospects of the existing employees, we should be given an indication if it is intended to progressively carry through the implementation of the introduction of the greater range of products in each of the years over the four-year period to bring Irish Steel to a situation where the company will be producing the full range of their products within four years.  If that is not now the intention we should be told the range of products it is expected will be produced by Irish Steel in each of the next few years.</P>
    <P>I understand there has been IDA involvement in the financing of the new plant.  We should be told if the IDA involvement in financial terms has been included as part of the assessment of the State's financial contribution towards the modernisation costs of Irish Steel or if the IDA involvement is being treated <Col N="169" /> separately and has not been shown in the figures we have been given.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins raised two questions on the Supplementary Estimate which might be dealt with by the Minister when he is replying to the Second Stage.  The social aspects of steel restructuring are being financed by direct contributions within the EEC.  Deputy Collins said that any such financing should be funded from the social fund rather than by direct contributions from the member states.  He also raised a point in relation to Article 56 of the European Coal and Steel Treaty about subsidised loans for industries which re-employ steel workers.  He made the point that if those loans were to be used extensively in other countries to attract employees away from non-viable steel mills employing large numbers, such loans at very attractive rates could operate to the detriment of the IDA's general policy of attracting industry to this country. As a progression on that, I would ask whether any investigation has been carried out or any thought been given to the use of such loans by this country if it is found necessary for more employees of Irish Steel Holdings to be placed on short-time working.  Has there been any investigation of the possibility of the utilisation of loans of this nature to attract or stimulate other industries in the Cork area towards re-employing these highly skilled workers by using the subsidised loans available from Europe?</P>
    <P>The annual report of Irish Steel for the year ended 30 June 1981 sums up the position in regard to that company better than the Minister or I could do.  On page 9 of this report it is stated:</P>
    <P>We have already obtained sufficient evidence from our experience during commissioning to forecast with confidence that the plant will produce goods competitively if it is operated within the constraints of the planned costs attached to a plant of this nature. If costs, whether remuneration or interest charges or overheads, are allowed to get out of hand to the extent that the economies of this very modern plant are distorted, our customers, traditional and new, will have no choice <Col N="170" /> but to turn to alternative sources of supply.</P>
    <P>The company is obliged to operate within Government policy as to pay in the public sector, an obligation which is in the national interest as well as that of the company.</P>
    <P>The company is delicately balanced, very heavily burdened with debt, seeking substantial equity investment from the State at a time of severe economic constraints.  We are seeking new markets and attempting to recover those which we had to opt out of substantially while our new plant was being prepared for, installed and commissioned. The present market situation is one of unprecedented difficulty with capacity far exceeding demand.  The result is intense competitiveness in the market place.</P>
    <P>We cannot sell what is too dear to a potential customer.  We cannot stockpile in the hope of rising prices because the cost of working capital would be prohibitive.  We look with confidence to all who work in the company to recognise the difficult and special circumstances surrounding the emergence of this virtually new company and realistically to abate their personal expectations from the company until it is established and once again in sight of profits.</P>
    <P>That is not exactly the most optimistic of reports but it is a very realistic assessment on the part of the chairman of this company, which has undergone the trauma of such a major modernisation programme and loss of their existing markets, as well as conversion of their marketing policy and the production of a range of products in new areas.  These are the daunting tasks facing Irish Steel. They are the same sort of problems which face a number of other State companies engaged in the competition of European and world markets.  This company are, however, facing a situation of enormous over-production together with a very depressed market which makes trading for profit an extremely difficult task in Europe, whatever about parts of the Third World.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> The potential exists within the new plant in Cork and the expertise exists within the work force to produce competitively and contain production costs. The desire exists there to market aggressively and endeavour to re-establish their position on the Irish market, as well as breaking into new export markets.  I do not believe that any of those things will lead to a guaranteed future for Irish Steel without the support of the Government and the European Commission, both in relation to pricing policy for steel in Europe and the control of steel production, with the progressive closing down of obsolescent and older mills throughout Europe.  There must be strong support by the Government towards the continuation of the control of production quotas and the restructuring of pricing policy by the Commission.  These matters must be aggressively pursued by the Government, as must policy in relation to licensing of the importation of steel from non-EEC countries, the prohibition of scrap exportation from this country to non-EEC countries and a definite and firm enunciation of policy by the Minister as to the role the Government see for Irish Steel in the future and an indication of the period during which the Government accept that it will not be possible for Irish Steel to show trading profits. What targets have the Government set for the company and in what year do they expect that Irish Steel might be in a position to reach a break-even point or begin to make a return on the heavy level of State investment?</P>
    <P>We are at the crossroads for this company and we need a series of correct decisions by the management of the company and by the Government in regard to our economy, as well as supportive and corrective action by the EEC to ensure that Irish Steel can fight through and attain the share of the market which will enable the mill to operate viably and enable their employees to look with confidence to a continued career.  All those things are possible with the combined good will and expertise of all involved. There must be a definite decision by the Government as to what is required from <Col N="172" /> Irish Steel Holdings and as to the supportive action they will take with the European Commission to ensure that market conditions make it possible for the company to operate viably and increase their range of products.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill and ask the Minister when replying to deal with the points I have made and to give not only to the House but to Irish Steel an indication of the time scale of the investigation which he has announced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill principally to increase the authorised share capital of Irish Steel from £25 million to £50 million.  The Minister explained that agreement must be reached with the European Steel and Coal Community before this can be done.</P>
      <P>Before discussing the Bill we must look at the background to Irish Steel.  In May 1978 the Government approved new plant there at a cost of £30.8 million.  We are told today that the plant cost £80 million, but that includes some running costs or necessary capital.  I am completely confused.  The Minister must have reasons and excuses &mdash; but probably more excuses than reasons &mdash; for this increase.  When the last amendment was made to the legislation in 1979 the then Minister made some interesting remarks. I can, if the House so wishes, quote him directly but he intimated to the House that this company would be viable over a three-year period.  Perhaps the installation of the new plant was not completed in time.  Has the Minister now any idea when this company has a reasonable prospect of being viable?  We must give the company the opportunity of being at full production before we can pronounce on its viability.  In the very near future consultants will be called in from Europe and from the Irish Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Fair enough, they are in.  How long is the examination of the company to take?  Will it be undertaken before capacity production is possible in the new plant?  If so, will the results of that examination be the big <Col N="173" /> stick to be used to close down this company? We complained on the debate on the Estimates for this company that the Minister of State was taking a pessimistic view; but the view being taken today is even more pessimistic.  I would be frightened if I were one of the workers in the steel industry.  The whole thinking appears to be woolly.  The most modern plant of its kind in Europe has been installed and before it starts production the consultants are in examining the question of its viability.  There is something defeatist in this procedure, which needs an explanation from somebody. This plant, which has cost from £60 million to £80 million, is necessary if steel is to be produced here.  Production had to be held up for a time during installation of this expensive plant.  I am an ordinary layman, not <i>au fait</i> with the intricacies of the EEC and am completely at a loss in this matter.  Would the Minister be specific in his replies?  Perhaps I am being foolish or ignorant, but there appears to be something really wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chairman of Irish Steel in a review estimated the cost at £60 million and the Minister now says it is £80 million.  I would not be satisfied if I had an estimate of £30 million which over a period of three years became £60 million.  There are factors bringing up the cost, interest rates and many other items, but Irish Steel had been making a modest profit from the early seventies with the old plant.  Losses have been recorded since 1975 which have escalated over the last three years.  The losses in 1976 amounted to just over £2 million, in 1977 they were a little less and in 1978 they fell to £1 million; but up to the mid-1981 they amounted to £12 million.  Perhaps the explanation was that the plant was not in full operation and that there were costs nonetheless.  Whatever the explanation, this wholly State-owned company, with a capital share of £6 million in 1979, has been continuously losing money.  We have now, it is agreed, the most modern plant in Europe capable of economic production of a range of from 80 to 100 products.  Will we have a quota imposed from Europe which will never allow the company to develop to the full capacity? <Col N="174" /> If that is the case, it is about time we started to bargain and said that that would not do us.  It will not do us.  Every effort will be made to restrict the production of steel in the European Community. If we are not allowed to develop the company to its full capacity, we can hardly expect it to be viable.  We know how the quota system has worked previously. Side by side with that unfavourable position we are going to import from third countries.  The Minister has mentioned that a good proportion of our steel last year came from Argentina and the European Community seems unable to protect us from that importation.  The sooner we get out of that type of conglomeration the better.  As far as our industry is concerned, it is not doing it much good and the sooner we talk turkey to those people the better.</P>

      <P>On the one hand, we will be restricted from using the company's capacity to the full and in the most economical way, and on the other hand, a price will be imposed on us by the Community.  If this is the way the thing is to be operated I am sorry for Irish Steel, because in these circumstances they will have no chance of survival.  The European steel people have agreed reluctantly that this industry should be developed. Surely that agreement was that the industry would be allowed to develop at full production capacity?  It is agreed &mdash; the company have paid tribute to them &mdash; that there are highly skilled workers there.  That being so, our aim must be to have the mills working at full economic capacity, but it seems to me that the Minister is pessimistic about it.  When the Estimate was being presented we complained that the Minister of State at that time was being over-pessimistic, but I think the Minister today was even more pessimistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay this necessary Bill, which I welcome.  Neither do I want to see lame ducks being allowed to survive; but if this industry is not allowed to survive it will have a devastating effect not only throughout the country but on <Col N="175" /> the workers and their families.  I do not think we are sufficiently firm with our European partners in matters of this kind.  We always seem to be the good boys who all the time play to the rules while our partners are inclined to overlook the rules.</P>
    <P>This company complained about dumping of steel here by third countries, but by the time there is a European decision on that I am afraid the steel will be rusting in any buildings it has been used in, because there seems to be no end to the length of time it takes the EEC to operate.  Even before discussions begin the harm is done and by the time a decision is arrived at the whole atmosphere has changed.  By the time we have a decision on the company's complaint the whole problem of dumping will have become irrelevant.  It is up to the Minister, in the Council of Ministers and at Commission level, to determine this matter quickly.  If the third countries like Argentina and others are competing unfairly with us, if steel is being dumped here either directly by third countries or through the EEC, then a decision must be reached on this urgently if we are to save our own industry.  When will this dumping be investigated and when will we begin to talk about procedures to prevent it?  Dumping has been occurring, but let us not waste time talking about that now: let us get on to discuss the most efficient ways to prevent it happening again this year or next year.  If it is found that action cannot be taken to prevent it let us be told that that is so.</P>
    <P>Will this mill be allowed to produce at full capacity?  We know that if that were to be the case it would be viable.  The Minister must spell this out to us.  We have been told that consultants are inquiring into the position, and my understanding is that we cannot do anything until these consultants have finished their inquiries.  If the results of the inquiry are not favourable, does it mean we will not be able to do anything further for this industry, that we will have to let it die a natural death?  If that is so we will have killed a valuable industry without giving it a chance, without giving it an <Col N="176" /> opportunity to prove itself.  We have been told that efforts are afoot to fix a reasonable price for the product over a number of years.  If a reasonable price is allowed and if the mill is allowed to work at full capacity &mdash; and this is an ideal set by the EEC &mdash; surely the undertaking must be viable?  If we hinder that prematurely before the mill is in full production we will have wasted the money we spent building it, we will have invested the money but not given it a chance to work. If we start on the road with this we must see it to its final conclusion.  I am worried that the Government are not determined enough in many of these areas.  They must insist, irrespective of what the European consultants say, on the industry being permitted to produce to its full capacity over a period of years so as to be able to assess whether it is fully viable or not.  If there is any danger, due to restrictions on producton or limitations in investment, that we are not going to allow it reach that stage we should stop now.  There is no point in proceeding any further unless we give the company an opportunity of working to their full capacity.  After that we will be in a position to assess whether they are viable and capable of competing in the European markets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the 700 people employed at Irish Steel I should like to put a number of questions to the Minister.  Those people deserve straight answers because they have endured three to four years of inconvenience, some of them on short-time work, while the plant was being modernised.  When the Supplementary Estimate was discussed in May management and work force in Irish Steel were praised for enduring the inconvenience. The chairman of Irish Steel Holdings, in the course of his annual report, praised the work force for the co-operation given to management during those difficult three years.  The chairman also praised the excellent labour relations that exist in the company.  In my view a question mark about the future of Irish Steel Holdings was introduced that day and what I said then has been borne out by subsequent events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" /> The work force in Irish Steel have been faced with the possibility of the introduction of a three-day week and all sides accept that that is inevitable.</P>
    <P>In June I asked the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he would take steps to eliminate the dumping of cut price steel on the Irish market and if he would investigate reports that imported Argentinian steel was being used by local authorities.  The Minister said he was aware that some 11,000 tonnes of Argentinian steel were imported into Ireland in the first quarter of 1982.  He said he understood that an anti-dumping complaint was lodged by Irish Steel on 28 May 1982 with the Commission, the responsible body for taking action in relation to dumping.  The Minister said it was his intention to support this complaint.</P>
    <P>What the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism said then and what has been stated in the House today are different.  The Minister for Industry and Energy should explain the change that has taken place since then.  Today the Minister told us that Deputies would be aware that 11,000 tonnes of reinforcing bars from Argentina were imported into Ireland earlier this year.  He said he had an immediate complaint made to the EEC Commision regarding these imports and he understood that Irish Steel lodged an anti-dumping complaint with the Commission on 28 May.  The impression created on 15 June was that the Minister was supporting the complaint by Irish Steel but the impression being created today is that the Minister took immediate action when the problem was brought to his attention earlier this year.  The workers would like to know what took place.  They expected immediate action to be taken by the Minister when the question of imports was brought to his attention but the impression created here was that the Minister was supporting the stand by the company on the issue.  The Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism earlier this month also said, with regard to Argentinian steel already in Ireland, that he had been informed that some inquiries about its use in public <Col N="178" /> authority contracts were made but the indications in those cases were that the steel being used was not Argentinian.  I should like to know if the steel being used was Irish.  Will the Minister for Industry and Energy confirm that all steel being used in local authority contracts is of Irish origin?  That is worrying the work force of Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>The next question I should like to put to the Minister relates to quotas.  Deputy Eddie Collins in May raised the question of quotas.  The Minister, in the course of a reply to him, said that in the case of Irish Steel the method of quotas was unsuitable as Irish Steel's historical production was very small and they now needed a higher than average capacity utilisation rate.  The Minister said he had been taking steps to have the company treated as a special case and made the point at a Council of Ministers meeting on 4 May that any quota system after 30 June 1982 should not make it difficult for a company, whose restructuring was approved by the Commission, to be viable. He said he understood that the Commission would propose more flexible systems for the period after June 1982.</P>
    <P>That statement of the Minister's worries me because in a European Commission publication a news item stated that the ten Industry Ministers who met in Brussels at the beginning of May agreed to extend the Community's system of steel production quotas for a further 12 months, until the middle of next year. That item stated that the quotas which the European Commision had hoped to have extended until the end of next year were introduced last year in an effort to curb over-production and to stabilise prices.  The Minister on 25 May said he would be hopeful of a more flexible system at the end of June this year and it appears that a decision had already been made to extend the present system until the end of next year.  It worries those in Irish Steel that the Minister is not consistent or familiar with what is happening in relation to quotas.  The Minister should explain those inconsistencies in his reply.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty has confirmed that consultants entered Irish Steel this week to begin their study.  That was news to me <Col N="179" /> because I was under the impression they would be going in during the first two weeks in July.  In the course of the detailed reply to Deputy Eddie Collins the Minister said, in relation to future aid to the steel industry within the EEC, that the long-term prospects of the company would have to be discussed with the Commission and the decision governing aids required that all aids envisaged should be notified by 30 September 1982.  As he had not fully worked out the future needs of the company he could not say whether problems would arise with the Commission. A team of consultants are going into Irish Steel this month.  They will have to report to the Minister, the Government will have to consider the report and submit a case to the Commission and there are fears that it will be a quick decision and another rushed job.  I appeal to the Minister to give this his undivided attention over the next three months.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel is one of the prime concerns of the Cork region, a region which has experienced higher than average unemployment over the last few years.  We are losing our nerve as a nation in the present severe economic situation.  There is a tendency to eliminate what we consider to be lame ducks.  There is an inference that Irish Steel is a lame duck and should be eliminated.  The pressures being experienced in the economy at present should not be used as an excuse for cutting out companies which are in temporary difficulty.  It is far more expensive to create new jobs.</P>
    <P>The company have now commissioned their plant.  They will not be in full production for another four years.  I agree with Deputy Bermingham when he said that now was not the time to make decisions in relation to the future of Irish Steel.  We should ride out the economic storm we are experiencing and wait until the company get back on their feet.  I am sure the company realised that they would lose part of their market.  They are attempting to re-establish their place in the steel market and should be given a life-line and time to do this.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give an assurance to workers who will be on a three-day <Col N="180" /> week from next week that this will not last for very long.  He is the Minister responsible and people expect him to give them an indication as to their future. Their living standards will be further cut. I hope it will not be mentioned that workers will be better off being on a three-day week because they will also get social welfare.  Most workers want to work a full week for an honest wage.  It might be acceptable to them financially to work a three-day week for six or nine months, but in other areas it would not be acceptable.  I ask the Minister to give an assurance that three-day week working will not last for a long time but will be curtailed before the end of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that decisions will have to be made by Irish Steel and the Government in this matter.  The real decisions will rest with the Minister because they will have to be taken in a political and social context.  The chairman and management of Irish Steel, when making their decisions, will have to operate within certain constraints. Through no negligence or inefficiency on their part they have had to suffer and will do so for a considerable time.  The world situation as regards steel has been going from bad to worse.  In America, the great home of free enterprise in steel, there have been complaints that the off-loading by European steel producers is taking up to a 20 per cent cut of the American steel market.  For the first time since 1938 American steel production is at its lowest level.</P>
      <P>As regards the situation in Europe, the picture has been one of strikes in Britain and riots outside the steel mills in Belgium and France.  Where there is a total dependancy on the steel industry for jobs there is an increasing wage burden and indebtedness.  The situation in America is that there are now losses where profits were once the scene.  Something in the region of £1 billion has been lost by the steel industry in Europe in the last two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real decision the Minister and the Government must face up to is: where does Irish Steel stand in this context? What did we expect of it when it was <Col N="181" /> taken over by the State?  We could not have judged it even then by the ordinary business criteria of profit motive or added-value motive.  The real motive behind the takeover of Irish Steel by the State lay in the social and strategic fields. It is time the Government inquired into how strategic it is to have our own steel production unit.  We are involved in the manufacture of light steel.  Will this reliance on light steel meet our construction needs if the crunch comes as regards difficulty in meeting total steel requirements in the future?  We have thrown a lot of money into Irish Steel and will have to give more in the years ahead.  What do we expect out of it?  Do we expect jobs or a unit cost of production which is at least as competitive as most other European countries?</P>
    <P>If it is on the job security front we must recognise that having regard to the amount of money that has been put into Irish Steel down through the years the jobs there are probably some of the most expensive in Irish industry.  I appreciate that the Minister is being frank with us today, though perhaps not as frank as he would like to be.  He would be a fool if he were to say that there is the utmost Government confidence in the future of Irish Steel.  We must have regard to what the world situation is.  However, the Minister would be making a far better case for Irish Steel if he were to spell out how strategic the industry is from the point of view of the national purpose and if he were to tell us how production figures are likely to be in the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>When talk emanated first about investment in the new furnaces and so on we were presented with a target figure of the order of 250,000 tonnes by 1984.  How close are we to that figure or will we ever have the opportunity of nearing it having regard to what is happening in the other European countries?  In other words, how well are Irish Steel serving Irish industry?  For a steel industry to be viable we must have a very healthy construction industry but I see no evidence that would lead one to conclude that this is the situation. If we are to export to the level that has been mentioned &mdash; and there has been produced in this regard a figure of <Col N="182" /> up to 70 per cent of production &mdash; we must have healthy prices for our exports. Again, this question is tied in with the question of what our production costs will be.  We have diversified by widening the range of products of Irish Steel but I wonder whether this might not be an inhibiting factor in terms of keeping down our production costs.  It is possible to spread our production load widely and to continue to have very high overhead costs.  I would prefer to think that there were certain bread and butter lines in the steel industry as in any other on which we could concentrate for a greater dividend for ourselves.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the provision of jobs in Irish Steel has been a costly business and, naturally, the public representatives both in the constituecy concerned and in the neighbouring constituencies wish those jobs to be preserved, but in addition to the Minister's speech there have been signs emanating from the Government in recent weeks about having a fresh look at the whole picture, about identifying the lame ducks of industry and so on. This Bill will enable the Minister to seek further loans to help Irish Steel but he will not be in a position to take up any more shareholdings in the company without having the consent of the European Commission.  Perhaps it is good that we have a big brother in that form overseeing us at this time in the progress of semi-State bodies such as Irish Steel so as to ensure that we put money only in those areas in which there is some evidence of viability.  Otherwise, we could be putting ourselves on a very slippery slope, as has been the case in respect of many other State bodies down through the years.  The European Commission in the terms of reference in which were set up the Davignon Committee have no reservations about the future of the European steel business.  Contained in the terms of reference was the suggestion that provision be made for Davignon to consider aids for redundancy, short-time working and early retirement as well as for loans to industries which could help to replace employment loss suffered because of Steel plant closures.  This is all an indication of the arena into which we are <Col N="183" /> putting ourselves and that is why I say that the real decisions lie not with the management of Irish Steel but with the Government.  These are political as well as social decisions and are not related totally to economics.</P>
    <P>We must decide what we want to do with Irish Steel.  We must decide on how strategic it is to have our own steel production. Reference has been made to imports, overnight as it were, from Argentina.  There is nothing to stop us importing steel from other Third World countries.  But if it is strategic for us to have our own steel production, the Minister should begin to spell out just how strategic that is.  I am of the opinion that we should have our own steel production unit.  Indeed, we would be a very backward and primitive country if at this time we did not have some form of steel production, but whether that production should be in the private sphere or in the public sector is a question that we must consider.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that before their absorption by the State, Irish Steel showed a profit, not every year but in one out of four years.  That was a commendable performance by any enterprise engaged in such business.  The timescale being given to Irish Steel by way of this enabling measure is not at all generous but it is inhibited by the consultancy study being carried out by the European Commission and by the Irish Government.  In the next three to four months, or between now and the time when that study is concluded, the Minister must decide where we are to take up increased shareholdings in Irish Steel in the years to come.  There has been a considerable jump in the amounts sought in enabling legislation in recent years, particularly in 1979.  That is why it is as well now for the Government to decide how strategic and how important steel production is to us. We must decide whether we would be better off importing all our requirements from other countries, be they within Europe or outside it.</P>
    <P>The management of Irish Steel will have to make decisions also but their decisions will be in the context of being <Col N="184" /> as efficient as possible in the field of using the most freely available and the most cheaply available forms of energy.  Their decisions, too, will be in the field of industrial relations.  Perhaps when replying the Minister would indicate how succesful or otherwise has been the performance in Irish Steel in terms of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>One would hope that the workers in Irish Steel, workers who are privileged and fortunate in having such a concern in their midst, appreciate the high level of State funding that goes into maintaining their jobs.  At the end of the day, Irish Steel depend on a healthy home construction industry.  If we can meet the needs of our construction industry in so far as steel products are concerned we will be going far along the way to justifying the high level of investment in the company.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation because I consider it important that we have a steel production unit for the years ahead.  It is heartening to find the Minister being frank enough with us today to spell out the situation and I hope he will be as willing to make the major decisions that will have to be made as a result of the consultancy report to which I have referred.  Even in America high wages have been the most outstanding feature of the whole steel industry in recent years.  If high producation costs coupled with high wages become part of the scene with Irish Steel Holdings, we will have considerable difficulties in the years to come.  Perhaps now is the time to face up to making real decisions.  I hope the Minister will do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with pleasure that I rise to support this increased authorisation of share capital.  I welcome this Bill. It is, to my mind, a statesmanlike approach to an industry that down the years has contributed much to our industry and agriculture and which was founded when working in a steel mill was a tough job, second only to mining, where people worked under terrible conditions and built up a viable industry with Irish labour.  Added to that they had the disadvantages, which since have been overcome, of being on the island.  The steel industry now has become a status <Col N="185" /> symbol in the harbour area.  The families of the original workers are working in Irish Steel Holdings and are proud of what is happening.  We do not have to patronise them here in this House.  They are doing an honest day's work for an honest day's pay, and it is not because I am from the constituency that I say that. I invite Deputy Markey to come down and see for himself that we have good men there.  They are not privileged in any way.  They work hard still under extreme heat but they are proud of what they are doing and they have reason to be proud of their product, which is good by any standards.  I have used some of it myself for roofing, farm sheds and all sorts of construction work.  That aspect has not been mentioned this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not engaged in the initial stages of the industry but we are producing a considerable amount of corrugated and sheet iron for agricultural purposes.  The labour relations in Irish Steel Holdings now are excellent.  We had one or two incidents and some problems, during a Coalition period as it happened, but they were overcome and generally speaking that industry is running smoothly and well.  The fact that it has financial problems has little or nothing to do with the work force.  As it is now a small, modern, efficient mill, there is no reason why we should not be able to compete once the market opens up.  One of the biggest problems in Irish Steel Holdings &mdash; this is where I disagree with the previous speaker &mdash; is that we are in a world-wide, European-wide recession, but most of all we have our own recession which is worse than the European recession.  We have our own financial problems here and very high inflation.  Many of the big customers of Irish Steel are themselves in financial difficulties.  There is very little point in selling a large quantity of steel to a big operator if he is not going to pay you or if you are not sure that his cheques are OK.  Some of our big customers have problems.  The Minister's problem is more one for the Government at this stage, whatever Government are in power, to sort out the difficulties of our economy and our inflation.  We were talking here the other day about agriculture <Col N="186" /> and the problem is still the same.  If we get things rolling, if we get this country moving as it should move, there will be plenty of markets for Irish steel here at home for quite a quantity of their products in the building industry and in agriculture.  The Minister knows as well as I do that construction in agriculture has almost ceased, and the agricultural sector were substantial customers.</P>
    <P>With regard to diversification, I do not think we should have too much of it.  We have sufficient diversification to be viable.  We have not spread out into sheet steel for ship-building or anything like that.  We are producing the sort of thing that normally sells well and will sell well again.  With the confidence that we can inspire we will ride out this storm.  I will not stand for shutting down, paring off at a time like this.  By all means we must batten down during a period of storm.  At times we must do things like that, but I do not believe that we should jettison any of our valuable cargo.  That is where I differ from many people in this House.  I believe that we can ride out this storm and when we do so we will need Irish Steel Holdings.  Of course we will, because, as everybody in this House must realise, if the day comes when there is a market on the European mainland for steel the Third World will not be coming here with it.  We will have to go out, cap in hand, and bid for it and pay through the nose for it, and what are we to do with all the waste iron, steel and so on that at present is being processed in Cork harbour?  It is a natural thing to have a steel industry and the only reason ours is not doing well is the recession.</P>
    <P>On the question of electricity for the steel mill, the Government should avail forthwith of the surplus black oil that will be produced at Whitegate to get our electric turbines going down there.  I believe that the piping is there for conveying black oil from the refinery to the ESB power station, and if that is so it will be energy at a very right price because no shipping would be involved.  This is a source of electricity that we have, as it were, going for waste and it would help with regard to our economy.  As was <Col N="187" /> pointed out, our full capacity is something around 280,000 tonnes and that sort of tonnage would not cause a problem if we hold tough now, if we ride out this recession and, as our Labour spokesman said, if we stop imports.</P>
    <P>I would like a clear answer as to how this 10,000 or 11,000 tonnes of steel got in here, from the Argentine or anywhere else, without us knowing about it.  I am of the opinion that we are and have for far too long been the good boys of the EEC.  We are the people who keep all the rules and allow things to happen.  We heard this morning in Dublin Castle from some of our colleagues in the Council of Europe, and I think they would have much more respect for us if we began to act tough in ensuring that no bar of iron that we can produce here is allowed in from anywhere else, I do not care a damn where it comes from.  That should be our prime duty as a Government.  We should not leave it to a few workers here and there who probably will not know about it until they see it on an articulated lorry, or they might not see it at all.  Remember they are living down at the extreme tip of the country.  It could be coming in through various ports around the place and we would never hear about it.  A firm decision of the House should be that once we start rolling, no more imports will be allowed in.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with this money for Irish Steel Holdings.  This is money put to good use.  It will not be a recurring decimal as some people seem to think.  It will not be throwing good money after bad.  Once this major injection of capital is made and once we get out of our troubles we will make a profit again.  If we are going to adopt the attitude that as soon as there is any trouble in Irish Steel or the Sugar Company or NET or whatever company it happens to be we should rationalise, we are wrong because all rationalisation means is closing down.  In relation to NET, we had the consultants again and rationalisation came up, and in NET we are faced with a high risk industry and the possibility even of cutting down the numbers of security people.  That sort of rationalisation is like a farmer who when <Col N="188" /> times are tough closes the gate of the field, forgets about it and presumes he will do a better job with a smaller operation, instead of selling the field and making a profit.  That is not good business. There is only one way out of our present economic difficulties and that is to fight our way out.  In this Estimate the Minister has given Irish Steel an opportunity to batten down and to hold on.  I know many of the people in it personally and I can guarantee that when the time comes they will not let us down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me take this opportunity of thanking the Deputies who contributed to this debate.  It is interesting to contrast the attitudes of various Deputies as to how the situation of Irish Steel should be approached.  There was a very realistic and pragmatic approach by all concerned.  That is the way the problems of Irish Steel have to be approached.  I know I have been accused of being pessimistic by some Deputies.  But I set out to be realistic and pragmatic in relation to the situation as I found it in regard to Irish Steel.  There is no question but that the mini-mill which came on-stream and started production only in the middle of last year is one of the finest in this category anywhere in the world.  Only last week on my visit to the States I talked to directors of large companies involved in the steel business and they would have been delighted to have nothing to operate in such a depressed steel market but a mini-mill.  But that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are serious problems that originated when this programme was put together.  The estimated costs at the time have doubled and we have to work out how we are going to attack and live with those additional costs.  Coupled with that we are now going through the worst depression ever seen in the steel market in Europe and throughout the world.  To ask me to take a look into a crystal ball and make a commitment here this evening as to when the problems of Irish Steel might be resolved would be to ask the impossible.  It would be unrealistic to attempt to project it.  I cannot say when <Col N="189" /> the problems of the steel markets of the world are going to be solved.</P>
    <P>My duty is to bring the facts before the House to allow Deputies the opportunity to express their views on them.  When I came into office I looked at the various semi-State organisations under my control and at the question of monitoring the expenditure of the various semi-State bodies.  This has to be done in the best interests of spending public money so that we do not find out too late down the line that costly mistakes are being made. We all know that costly mistakes have been made and if we had found out about them earlier corrective action could have been taken and some of the problems alleviated.  But for far too long we have been finding out too late what the real extent of the economic problems in various projects have been &mdash; too late to do very much about them.</P>
    <P>In regard to Irish Steel, the Government are faced with the situation where the estimated cost of additional State equity to make Irish Steel carry through until such time as they might become viable, which is estimated as being about 1986 or 1987, would be about £75 million. That is a lot of money.  Some people in this House talk about getting the economy right and getting the finances right and not losing our nerve in difficult situations and riding out the storm.  But it takes money to do all those things.  We are the custodians of the taxpayers' money.  We have to be satisfied that we are spending it in the right direction so that we can get a return.  For anybody to suggest that one can ignore an estimated figure of £75 million because it will not have any bearing on our financial affairs is ridiculous because it will certainly have a major impact.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that we must look at this very seriously.  We just cannot write in a figure of £75 million.  It does not grow on the trees.  It comes from two sources.  It can be borrowed or the public can be taxed with it.  We have to be realistic when we look at where we are going to get this sort of money that is being demanded by various State agencies to keep them going.  In 1979 when a package was being put together for Irish <Col N="190" /> Steel everybody felt that that was sufficient and would see them through.  It was not sufficient and that is why we are in the situation we are in today.  I have to be satisfied that the figures now being put out are realistic and that it is the final figure.  If so, let us quantify it and make sure that it is.  I know the difficulties of the market are a problem for every steel mill and I am not pointing the finger at the work force in Irish Steel when I say that there are problems that they cannot overcome.  That is the position.  But we have to find out exactly what the position is for our own sake in the first instance and, second, because no State aid can be delivered to Irish Steel without the approval of the European Commission.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not that is the position.  Deputy Bermingham suggested that he did not like Big Brother at all and suggested one way of dealing with him. Deputy Markey suggested a different way of dealing with him and said that maybe it is as well that he is there and that we have to at least satisfy him that what we are doing is the right thing.  But the fact remains that we have to produce before the European Commission the full extent of the package of State equity for Irish Steel before approval will be given and we must do this by 30 September of this year.  I spoke to the commissioner concerned in relation to this when the question of sending in consultants on behalf of the EEC and ourselves arose. I said it was imperative that we get in there and get the information as soon as possible and have all the facts on the table before decisions are taken and that I also had to bear in mind the question of 30 September.  I do not see a problem in that respect.  The consultants have gone in and the study will be done expeditiously and all the facts will be on the table.</P>
    <P>It is worth knowing at this point that the projections presented to me on 23 April and prepared by Irish Steel did not foresee any viability before 1986 or 1987. But already those projections are out of line because the projected sales for this year of over 100,000 tonnes will now reach only about 41,000 tonnes.  That means we have to have a totally new look <Col N="191" /> at the projections for the next four or five years because the basis for this year's figures are certainly not going to bear themselves out.  On that basis it is right and proper that a full study should be done.  We should get all the facts on the table.  That is what we are doing.  The consultants will be reporting back to the Government and the EEC at the earliest possible moment and then the decisions will be made in relation to where we go from here.</P>
    <P>I was asked what was Government policy and I have spelled out where we are going.  This is the first step to enable the operation to be a holding operation for the remainder of this year, and we expect the measures to be implemented by the passing of this Bill will fit the needs of Irish Steel for this year.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the projections laid before me on 23 April and commented that they are out of date.  Because of the drop in sales this year the whole question of projections has to be recast.  That is what the consultants will be doing.  Most people do not like working a three-day week; they would prefer to work a five-day week, but when one judges the actions that had to be taken in the steel industry not alone in Europe but in the United States one sees how lightly the situation has affected us so far.  In the EEC countries as of 31 March 1982, 35,998 people, or 8 per cent of the total steel work force, were on short time and up to May 1982 job losses were 94,600, or 14.8 per cent of the total work force.  That gives some indication of the magnitude of the problem and how other countries have suffered.</P>
    <P>I was asked for the full production capacity figure of the Irish Steel mill: it is 345,000 tonnes.  The projected figure of 250,000 tonnes was not expected to be reached until 1986-87 and those projections had to be recast.  The number affected by the three-day week will be 500 out of 637 people employed.  This move is part of the day-to-day working of the company and it is for management to decide how it is to be implemented.  The IDA grant for Irish Steel is £4.1 million. Deputy Boland asked if EEC loans in <Col N="192" /> relation to steel closures had a detrimental effect on the prospects of the IDA attracting industry to this country.  It has had an effect because that fund has been used to top-up incentives in other parts of the EEC which made it possible for other areas to attract industries which might otherwise have come here.</P>
    <P>The importation of 11,000 tonnes of Argentinian steel was raised.  Only my Department lodged a complaint in advance of that steel coming here.</P>

      <P>Irish Steel also lodged a complaint.  The real difficulty is that one has to establish that it is being sold at an anti-dumping price.  While it may appear to be so, one still has to prove it, which is a very slow and complex matter. Such importations are tied up in very complicated EEC agreements and we do not have any legal basis on which to stop them.</P>
      <P>I was asked if I was certain that all the steel used in the Irish construction industry comes from Irish Steel and if there is any way I can ensure that that will happen. In the interests of Irish Steel, the economy and the work force, I appeal that where possible the construction industry should use Irish Steel.  It is very difficult to give the guarantee Deputies are looking for.  To go to a building site and pick up a round steel bar and say it is an Irish steel bar or an Argentinian steel bar is very difficult but it is part of the Government's proposed economic plan that an attack will be made on import substitution.</P>
      <P>Recently I saw 28 baths, bought outside our area, being installed in a local authority housing scheme because they were 48p each cheaper than those being made in the locality.  We have become very complacent about public sector purchasing. Since I took office I have undertaken to issue a directive to ensure that Irish goods are purchased where possible.</P>

      <P>I have explained that we are a party to very complicated EEC agreements.  Deputy Boland raised the question of prices.  The pricing rules that have been applied to steel producers for several years oblige them to adhere to published price lists which must be aligned on the prices prevailing in the <Col N="194" /> area in which the producer wishes to sell. This system had limited success because the steel dealers were still involved in price competition and brought pressure to bear on the producers to provide hidden discounts and rebates which negated an increase in the prices.  In order to achieve some raising of prices therefore, the Commission introduced a decision which extends to dealers the obligations on producers, namely, that the price list must be published and adhered to, prices must be arrived at by a process of alignment and no significant price under-cutting is permitted.  The decision currently applies to dealers handling over 12,000 tonnes per year but it has been agreed that this threshold will be lowered to 6,000 tonnes for ordinary steel and to 3,000 tonnes for special steel.  This has been accepted by the Irish National Association of Iron and Steel Merchants.</P>
      <P>Scrap is Irish Steel's basic raw material and at full production it will be necessary to import about two-thirds of the total requirements after taking up all scrap available.  It is the policy of the Government to prevent the export of scrap to non-EEC countries except where Irish Steel do not require it.</P>
      <P>On the question of energy, it is true that the company are very heavy energy users.  They have taken steps to reduce their energy costs by having an energy savings programme and they are at present in discussion with the ESB in relation to a priority rate.  At the moment they use a small amount of natural gas.</P>

Irish Steel find themselves in a difficult situation but it is part of a major world wide problem.  The Government have to ensure that any future investment that is made will be sufficient to make the company viable and, if not, to look at alternative measures.  In the interest of prudent financial management, of which we <Col N="195" /> have heard so much and which we are going to hear much more about in the future, we will have to ensure that we get value for money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The objective of this section and of the Bill in general is to enable the Minister for Finance, with the consent of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, to make advances to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara not exceeding in all £40 million.  At the moment the permitted ceiling for advances is £15 million and this section proposes to increase that ceiling to £40 million.  This is to enable An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to perform their functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the large amount of money involved, it is right that we should have a look at the board and the constitution <Col N="197" /> of the board without in any way going into personalities.  Deputies will know that the statute establishing most semi-State bodies, or the articles of association of such boards where that is appropriate, have a provision that Members of the Oireachtas shall not be qualified to be members of State boards. When I looked at An Bord Iascaigh Mhara it struck me as somewhat unusual to find that one of the members of the board was also a Member of Seanad Éireann.  That was the situation when I became Minister for Fisheries and Forestry but I assumed it was only a temporary matter that could be put right later on.  I think that subsequent to being appointed a member of the board the person of whom I am speaking was elected in a by-election as a Member of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>I assumed that was an unusual occurrence and that an opportunity would be availed of to bring An Bord Iascaigh Mhara into line with the other State bodies. However, I noticed after the last general election that, when the Taoiseach was naming his 11 nominees for the Seanad under the Constitution, he nominated another member of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to be a Member of Seanad Eireann.  The position, therefore, is that two members of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are also Members of Seanad Éireann.  I propose to make the House aware of the fact that nearly all State bodies have provision in their constitutions disqualifying Members of the Oireachtas from being members of their boards.  I should point out that there is no such provision in the statute setting up An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  It is legally in order to have two members of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara as Senators but it is not in keeping with the convention of many years standing.</P>
    <P>Professor Basil Chubb, in his book on <i>The Government and Politics of Ireland</i> said, when dealing with State-sponsored bodies, that Members of the Oireachtas, who were of course the leading and most active politicians, were in many cases barred by statute from holding such posts and, where no such legal barrier existed, the convention had been established.</P>
    <P>It has been established because, going <Col N="198" /> back as far as the Transport Act, 1950, we find that Members of the Oireachtas are disqualified from sitting on boards set up by that Act.  I took the opportunity of going quickly over the various State-sponsored bodies.  There are about 50 and, with the exception of Bord na gCon, Bord na Móna and a few others, there is provision in the statutes setting them up or in the articles of association of their companies, disqualifying Members of the Oireachtas from being members of the board.  There is an argument in favour of Members of the Oireachtas being members of these boards and there is an argument against that practice.  A convention has grown up over the years, going back as far as 1950, precluding Members of the Oireachtas from being members of these boards.  In some cases the provision is made in the original statute setting up the board and in other cases the original statute has been amended, when the occasion presented itself, to provide that Members of the Oireachtas shall not be members of the board.  For that reason, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara should be brought into line with the other boards. I do not intend to introduce personalities into this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am making the case that we are entrusting this board with an additional £25 million. Because of this I feel I should look at the board and its composition and compare it with other boards to see if it differs from other boards, and, if so, ask ourselves is that difference accidental or deliberate.  Should it be corrected, if not in this Bill, in some future Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Yes, but I think I would be very negligent if I did not look at the constitution of the board since it is mentioned in the section and since we are voting £25 million to it under this section.  There is an argument for and against Members of the Oireachtas being members of these boards.  Convention and the wisdom of the House over the last 30 years seemed to prove that the policy has been established and accepted that Members of the Oireachtas should not be members of these boards. This board is a particularly sensitive board because it is empowered to give loans and grants and to advance large sums of money to fishermen who want to purchase or repair boats.  For example, it is in a somewhat similar position to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  The constitution of the Agricultural Credit Corporation disqualifies Members of the Oireachtas from sitting on the board. This board should also disqualify Members of the Oireachtas from sitting on it.</P>
      <P>I know the Central Fisheries Board do preclude Senators and Deputies from their membership.  I know my amendment had been ruled out of order and there is nothing more I can do about it now.  But I should like to hear the views of the Minister of State on this point and, in particular, whether he has any proposals to change the law in regard to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>

I should like to know from the Minister when it is proposed to do so.  I should like to know also whether there will be any resignations from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara between now and the alteration of the law.  I did feel that the fact that two members of the board are Senators was not deliberate or designed.  I believe it happened with regard to the first member because he decided that he would contest the Seanad election and was successful and because the second man involved was nominated by the Taoiseach to the present Seanad.  One does not like to be personal about things like these but one might have thought that the members concerned could have quite easily resigned from the board in line with the long-standing convention of over 30 years, be replaced, and that the law could have been changed then when an opportunity arose.  I am not my party's spokesman on Fisheries &mdash; I am the person in charge of this Bill &mdash; and while it is a delicate subject I feel it my duty to raise it.  I should like to know what the Minister of State has to say about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Apparently we have now established that the long-standing convention and policy regarding State-sponsored bodies is that Members of the Oireachtas should not be members of them.  I am glad to hear the Minister of State say that that is recognised and that it is proposed to introduce amending legislation later this year.  When the law has been amended presumably &mdash; in accordance with my amendment which could not be accepted because it is outside the terms of this Bill as read a second time &mdash; that means that in effect my amendment is being accepted.  That having been established, I feel it my duty to say that the two members on the board should now resign and I make no apology for so <Col N="201" /> saying because the principle is accepted that Members of the Oireachtas should not be members of State-sponsored bodies; generally speaking that is accepted. That being accepted, it is wrong that the two members should continue to serve on the board until the end of this year or perhaps into next year, continuing to adjudicate on matters such as the granting of loans and so on.</P>
      <P>Indeed, there is another reason why Members of the Oireachtas should not be members of State-sponsored bodies &mdash; a reason that did not exist when Professor Chubb wrote his book, or when many of the amending Bills passed through this House disqualifying Members of the Oireachtas.  I refer to the joint committee set up to investigate the activities of State-sponsored bodies, to vet them, to examine their reports and accounts and report to the House on them.  It is somewhat ludicrous to have Members of the Oireachtas investigating themselves and I do not use the word &ldquo;investigate&rdquo; in any offensive or ugly manner.  It is somewhat incongruous to have Members of the Dáil and Seanad auditing the accounts of companies of which they are directors.  Now that this matter has been brought to the attention of the Minister and the Government the right and proper thing for those two Senators to do is resign from the board and not be a source of embarrassment, in one case, to the Taoiseach and, in both cases, to the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister of State did not deal with the question I put to him.  I am saying, in deference to the long-standing policy applicable to those State-sponsored bodies, that the two members concerned should be invited to resign and, if necessary, the Minister should exercise the powers he has and remove them.  When the first man was appointed a member of the Board he was not a Member of the Seanad.  He was appointed a Member of the Seanad and he is holding on to his <Col N="205" /> position as a member of the board.  The second man was nominated by the Taoiseach to the Seanad.  The Taoiseach should have made it a condition of his nomination that he resign from the State-sponsored body.  The Minister is inviting trouble.  If there is some difference of opinion about matters and the membership of this board comes into question, the Minister will not have the defence that he was not warned about this or he did not know about it.  It is a bit ungracious of the two members.  The Minister has conceded that the policy is as I thought it was and that it is desirable that the law should be amended to exclude those two members.  He said he hopes the law will be amended before the end of the year.  Surely it would be a gracious act on the part of these two members to resign from the board.  If they intend to brazen it out until the very last hour and the Taoiseach and the Minister are prepared to stand over it, there is nothing further I can do.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The purpose of section 1 is to increase the lending limit of BIM from £15 million to £40 million so that they can make advances to skippers of trawlers and fishermen in general to enable them to purchase or repair boats.  While we owe this to the fishing industry and agree that the Oireachtas should provide such funds for BIM, we have a greater obligation to the fishing industry, that is, to organise it in such a way that fishermen will be in a position to repay the very heavy loans they have undertaken to equip themselves for their work.  I understand that orders have been obtained against dozens of fishermen for the repossession of boats.</P>
      <P>It is a coincidence that this Bill is being taken today while the Minister is in Brussels negotiating the common fisheries policy.  I do not know how long these negotiations will continue but nothing less than a good deal for our fishermen will be acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> During the period in office of the Coalition Government between 1973 and 1977 I was under pressure from some bright members of Fianna Fáil who seemed to think I should get an exclusive 200-mile limit.  I thought they were joking but they were quite serious about it.  Then there was a campaign for a 50-mile limit and perhaps a lot could be said for such a limit.  I am glad to see Deputy Lenihan, a former Minister for Fisheries, in the House.  He went to Brussels and abandoned the fight for an exclusive 30-mile limit.  He did so on his first trip to Brussels and thereby disarmed his successors, who would otherwise have been in a strong position to fight for an exclusive 30-mile limit.  This was all the more extraordinary because only a short time before that the same Deputy Lenihan was a member of the front bench of Fianna Fáil who introduced a Bill here taking an exclusive 50-mile limit.  In spite of this, he abandoned the fishermen and said that talk of a 30-mile limit was quite unrealistic.  I was shocked to hear the suggestion that an indented 12-mile limit was being accepted, that is, a 12-mile limit with rights in favour of foreign trawlers to fish to within six miles.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>When we entered the EEC we did so in the firm hope that there would be big gains in the agricultural and fisheries sectors. We were agriculturally undeveloped and we are certainly recognised now as having an undeveloped fishing industry. The greatest protection which could be given to Irish fishermen is a meaningful exclusive area around our coast.  Our fleet is not capable of fishing in foreign oceans and the only meaningful concession is a zone to which only they would have access.  We talk about total allowable catches and quotas but neither is worth a damn if we are to be exposed to trawlers from other member states.  If these trawlers are to have rights to fish virtually into our shores, there is no hope for the future of Irish fishermen.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister I had the goodwill and, I think, the backing of the UK delegation and their Minister, who seemed to have a lot in common with us on that issue.  I fear for some reason this has <Col N="207" /> changed.  Unless we fight for a meaningful exclusive fishing area around our own shores, we are not doing our job in regard to the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour the point, but it is a positive disgrace that fish are being imported wholesale into the EEC countries. Far too much fish is being imported from outside the Community waters when there is an abundance of fish within those waters.  It is also a disgrace that the Faroese are attacking our salmon to such an extent.  The salmon catch in our waters has dropped dramatically in the past five years &mdash; I have not the fishing figures with me but the catch has been about halved. I agree that there was some improvement in the quota this year, but it was not enough and whether the Faroese are obeying the quota limits is another question. A real effort should be made to protect the salmon that naturally return to our waters.</P>
    <P>Unless we organise our fishing industry and make the best possible case to get favourable conditions for our fishermen in regard to access and other matters, grants or loans will not be enough to build up the industry and enable our fishermen to earn a decent living.  Expenses and fuel costs have gone up for skippers, interest rates on loans have increased and it will be a tough battle for these men to repay the loans which we are now authorising the Minister for Finance to make available to them through An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>

      <P>As we know, this Bill is to increase the £15 million, which is exhausted, to £40 million.  The extended facilities being sought are required to enable BIM to provide for further developments of the sea fishing industry, and, particularly, the expansion of the fishing fleet, the establishment of additional fish processing and marketing facilities and the development of commercial marine fish farms.  In addition to financing boat purchase with Exchequer advances, BIM also arrange for financing of boat loans by means of loans from commercial banks which are <Col N="208" /> made direct to fishermen with BIM guarantees. This arrangement normally applies to the largest type of boat.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, our Minister is in Brussels at the moment trying to negotiate the best possible deal for our fishermen.  This is a little irrelevant to this Bill, but I have every confidence that our Minister will contract a very good deal for our fishermen and come back with a satisfactory arrangement which will be accepted by those fishermen.</P>
      <P>I recommend this Bill to the House.  It will enable BIM to make loans available to our fishermen to purchase more boats and, indeed, better boats.</P>

The present Bill enables the Minister for Finance, with the consent of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, to make large advances, up to £25 million, to Irish fishermen to enable them to make their living out of fishing.  Unless the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry is able to make a good bargain and can get a meaningful exclusive area around our waters, money alone will not save our fishing industry. It could very well be wasted money.  If the Minister and the Government do not bring home the bait, there is no use in providing boats and gear for fishermen who will be operating at a great disadvantage against their competitors in the other states of the Community.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to instruct the IDA to participate in a joint venture with interested parties including existing management and workers, on a majority equity basis if necessary, to reopen the Fieldcrest factory, Kilkenny, now in receivership and secure the maximum level of employment consistent with long-term viability.</P>
      <P>On a motion such as this there is a danger that some Members might get the impression that I am talking about just another closure like the many recent factory closures throughout the country.  Therefore I will show complete justification for putting down a motion like this to give the House an opportunity to hear exactly what is involved and to take a decision on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fieldcrest factory is not a white elephant or a lame duck.  It is the most modern and best equipped factory of its kind in the world, the biggest ever built in Ireland.  It stands on a 30-acre site, 12 acres of which are under buildings.  The perimeter wall is one mile in length and the factory has the potential to employ <Col N="210" /> 1,200 people.  It uses one million gallons of water daily.</P>
    <P>I have given these figures to illustrate the magnitude of the undertaking and therefore the importance of the motion, and in doing that I stress again what Fieldcrest is not: it is not an industry which often has been described as a lame duck or a white elephant.  Fieldcrest is neither.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism at the time, Deputy O'Malley, at the official opening in September 1980, less than two years ago, is reported in the <i>Kilkenny People</i> as having said that Fieldcrest was the biggest factory ever built in Ireland, 5,000 square feet larger than the Limerick factory which the Minister said should remain nameless.  Of course he was talking about Ferenka.  The circumstances of the two factories are not in any way similar.  I will quote from the same paper a comment made on that occasion by Mr. William Battle, President of that company at that time:</P>
    <P>My technicians in the United States tell me that this mill is consistently producing the highest quality yarn we have ever seen and that already Terry Towels of quite excellent quality are being produced.</P>
    <P>That comment was made by a man of vast experience in that kind of work. Fieldcrest is the most modern towel plant in Europe.  The product was of the highest quality, with potential annual sales of £30 million.  Though the sales figures did not reach the hoped for level, they showed a consistent increase in the sales graph in the two-and-a-half years up to the time the receiver was called in.  The factory employed a highly skilled workforce and AnCO had spent approximately £1 million training them.  It had an extremely highly skilled management team, and productivity was equal to the best plant in Europe, as acknowledged by plant owners throughout Europe who came to examine Fieldcrest in recent months.</P>
    <P>The factory had an excellent industrial relations record from the beginning.  The most striking feature was the number of young people employed, the average age <Col N="211" /> of the 640 employees being 24 years.  The factory indirectly supported a number of service industries not only in Kilkenny but in the neighbouring counties.  It is not possible to give an accurate figure of the number of people in the service industries in the region who will lose their jobs as a result of this closure but it has been estimated at 300 or 400.  The factory contributed enormously to the economy of the region.  All this indicates that I am fully justified in seeking the time of the House to get a decision on this motion. The effect of the closure is the human tragedy that 640 people have lost their employment.</P>
    <P>In carrying out some research in preparation for this debate I came across a statement made by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald in 1977 when in Opposition. At that time the European Investment Bank had refused a loan for this venture and Deputy Fitzgerald, Fianna Fáil spokesman on Labour, said the European Investment Bank had completely overlooked the social implications of their decision.  Of course, the same can be said today of the Government.  In allowing Fieldcrest to close the Government have overlooked the social implications of their decision.  We are discussing the loss of 640 jobs at a time when the number on the live register is rapidly approaching 150,000, at a time when even prior to the closure County Kilkenny had an unemployment figure of 2,393.  That was the situation in February 1982 compared to the situation that existed in December 1979 when 1,111 were unemployed in the county.  Between December 1979 and February 1982 the unemployment figure in the county rose by more than 100 per cent.  In June 1982 we could ill afford to add another 600 to that figure.  It should be pointed out that in the same period the unemployment figure in Kilkenny city went up by 130 per cent.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind the many hardships created by this closure, particularly those in relation to youth unemployment. Hardships also exist for those who have expensive mortgages on houses.  One of the many redundant workers who called <Col N="212" /> to me last week told me that as a married man with one child he qualified for £59 per week unemployment benefit but his mortgage was £65 per week.  He asked me what he would do but I could not offer him any help on the matter.  He is one of the many who face problems in relation to a mortgage.  Other workers received State grants to pull out of jobs in England and return to Kilkenny.  The State paid them to return to Ireland and the question is, has the State a responsibility for those people?</P>
    <P>It is difficult to describe the type of human devastation that has taken place as a result of the closure.  In some cases workers gave up secure employment to return to Kilkenny.  They were attracted by the lavish advertising campaign carried out by the company, aided and abetted by the State through the National Manpower Service.  Those workers were also offered incentives in the form of grants to move residence.  They now find that their world has been torn apart and nothing is being done about it.</P>
    <P>The question being asked is, what can be done about this matter?  Our motion seeks to direct the Government to do something.  They have the power under the Industrial Development Act, 1977. For the enlightenment of the House I should like to quote what the then Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy O'Malley, said, on 2 November 1977 as reported in volume 301, column 156, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The present Bill includes a provision which will extend the shareholding powers of the IDA.  Under the Industrial Development Act, 1969, the IDA are empowered to take shares in certain industrial undertakings.  Equity participation by the IDA can be an important and valuable part of the overall financial package put together to assist an industrial undertaking, and it can provide the State with a share in profitable new enterprises and thus secure a return on capital invested in industrial development.</P>
    <P>Later in that debate the Minister said:</P>
    <P>In order to remove the doubt regarding <Col N="213" /> the authority's power to take majority shareholdings and to ensure that it has adequate flexibility to operate successfully in the increasingly sophisticated financial and industrial environment, I propose to extend the authority's shareholding powers to enable it to take shareholdings of up to 100 per cent in suitable industrial undertakings, or in companies participating in the ownership, control or management of suitable industrial undertakings, and to enable it to form or participate with others in the formation of new industrial companies.</P>
    <P>I suggest that that is what should be done now.  Some time ago the receiver indicated that more than 70 per cent of the output of Fieldcrest went to customers carrying their own labels.  Those companies have indicated a willingness &mdash; at least they did before the Government allowed the plant to close &mdash; to continue business with a new company provided delivery, price and quality continued as they were.  We are aware that the IDA approached many major textile concerns presumably on the basis of a complete takeover by those interests. That had little hope of success for many reasons, one being that most of those approached were directly in competition with the Kilkenny plant.  It was in their commercial and business interest that Kilkenny would not continue to operate. It was all the more difficult to get a complete takeover of the plant when the Irish interests who had 49 per cent of the share capital and had carried the risk burden of the operation were no longer interested. The minimum package the IDA should have been instructed to offer was that they would take 49 per cent of the equity in a new company.  Alternatively, the IDA could initially take a major shareholding with an agreement progressively to reduce this to 49 per cent once breakeven point had been reached in production. This would ensure that an international company would not be put off by the State having an initial major shareholding through the IDA.</P>
    <P>No one is suggesting that the State should take over white elephants or lame <Col N="214" /> ducks.  Neither do I suggest this.  We are all convinced, as are management and workers, that given the right marketing approach which of necessity would have to be under the control of Irish management, the plant could be viable in the long run.  The company if re-constituted may not provide 630 jobs or it may well exceed that number.  The point is that a £30 million investment should not be written off.  Neither should the livelihood of 640 workers and their families be written off.  Those jobs should not be snatched away without any attempt such as what I am suggesting being made.  The unemployment situation could not be worse.  When there is an investment of over £30 million involved surely what I am proposing should be attempted.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to instruct the IDA to do this.  It would cost about £12 million.  Where will the money come from?  The IDA allocation for 1982 should be able to cover it because we all know that new projects are very thin on the ground.  Taking the ongoing commitments into account there should be extra resources available and, if necessary, I am sure the House would support a Supplementary Estimate to cover whatever amount was required and provide whatever working capital was necessary to get a new company going.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I would fully support any Supplementary Estimate to provide money for this company. However, I feel it could be done from the existing IDA allocation.  We must remember the cost to the State: extra social welfare payments, loss of taxation and social welfare contributions.  That would amount to £3 million per year or thereabouts.  If a successful partnership can operate the plant for less than the amount we might provide, the Exchequer would be better off.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the efforts of the IDA who have tried everything to get a buyer for the plant as a going concern.  It was almost an impossible task given that their brief was to sell it as a going concern. That is why I feel what I propose in the motion would be more practical and might meet with more success than has met the case to date.  I ask the Minister <Col N="215" /> to give the IDA the go-ahead with the necessary financial backing to put an attractive package together which will involve the State, management and workers.  The State should take a majority share in the initial risk because there is no doubt about the ability of the plant to prove itself if given a reasonable chance.  No one is convinced that it has been given a reasonable opportunity. This could be described as a desperate situation and, as such, every possible measure should be taken to maintain employment.  With the right partnership and a majority holding by the State, I am convinced that the plant could be viable and give steady, good employment and contribute enormously to the economy.</P>
    <P>The provision in the 1977 legislation made it necessary for the Minister to give his approval to IDA involvement by way of major equity holding.  The Minister might say it was not the intention to use this provision for restructuring companies such as in the case of Fieldcrest but it makes sense to maintain employment as well as create new employment.  The provision was clearly to create new employment but what is the point if, as is happening, job losses are exceeding the number of new jobs created?  It is about time these provisions were used to maintain employment as well as creating new employment.</P>
    <P>My party propose that a national development corporation be established to promote joint ventures with the private sector.  It was never envisaged that this would be a home for lame ducks or white elephants.  Neither do I suggest the IDA or the Government should artifically keep Fieldcrest open only to close it again in a few years' time.  That would be an insult to the workers and a waste of public money.  I am asking the Minister to give the IDA the necessary direction to go into partnership with a suitable company and, if necessary, with the existing management and workers make an arrangement which could effectively utilise the excellent plant and modern machinery in this factory.  There is a highly qualified and skilled management and work force.  They should be given an <Col N="216" /> opportunity to create a new life for themselves. The workers and management are willing to make sacrifices to achieve this. The Minister must know that in the difficult months since the receiver went into the factory, the workers and management suffered much by way of making sacrifices, short time working and so on but they continued the operation in a way that impressed everyone who visited the factory.  Unfortunately, though, the workers placed enough trust in the Minister and in the Government to have expected more from them.  Perhaps I must share some responsibility in this regard also because I, too, shared that confidence.  But we did have some justification for believing that the Minister would have his contingency plan ready for the time when the banks would pull out, and that the Government would be in a position to ensure the continuance of employment there until an alternative package was put together.  On a number of occasions of deputations to the Minister, he seemed confident or hopeful&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that he would have a contingency plan ready when needed. On the occasion of the first deputation in March, the Minister indicated that it would not be right or proper for the Government to step in with assistance in the first instance.  There was a clear indication in that that they would step in perhaps in the second or in the third instance.  Everyone on the deputation at that time understood what the Minister said regarding not giving a commitment in the first instance but even at the second deputation the Minister said that the Government did not propose to step in at that stage.  In the light of the use of the words, &ldquo;at that stage&rdquo;, one could hardly be blamed for believing that there was some stage at which the Government would intervene.  I was aware that they campaigned in the general election on a slogan of &ldquo;stop factory closures&rdquo;.  If ever a pending closure was to be prevented it must have been in respect of Fieldcrest because it was the one that would hit <Col N="217" /> hardest.  It was the biggest in the country and the best of its kind in the world.  What better example could any Government find for the purpose of showing that they meant what they said in regard to the closure of factories, to show that they were serious about the unemployment question?</P>
      <P>I do not propose to go into the general financial background that made up the Fieldcrest company.  It is sufficient at this stage to remind the House that the American company for relatively little money had control of the operation and that there were certain aspects of the whole operation that would need to be thoroughly examined.  However, the top priority should be to reopen the plant.  I have no wish to see those people who are engaged in efforts at re-opening it &mdash; the IDA, the Government or any other &mdash; using their time in holding a post-mortem at this stage.  I am confident that some if not all of these people are seeking a solution to the problem.  At the appropriate time an inquiry should be set up, but to set it up now would only complicate the whole process of trying to find perhaps a new company to take over the plant.  If an inquiry were in process at this time it might be seen by some as a kind of witch hunt.  The whole purpose of this motion is to put the people concerned back to work.  No useful purpose would be served at this point by apportioning blame, if blame is to be apportioned, and I am not saying that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the House to support the motion and I trust that I have been able during my contribution to justify the necessity for the motion.  The plant in question is a viable workable operation. It was opened officially less than two years ago.  At that time the Minister concerned together with the heads of the various companies involved in the undertaking expressed much confidence about the future of the plant.  However, they realised that there was a recession in Europe &mdash; indeed in the world &mdash; but despite that they were confident that all these difficulties could be overcome in time.  Nobody said that the factory would make money in the short term.  It was accepted that it would not be in a <Col N="218" /> money-making position for some years. It was only in November last that a package was put together.  It was based on reports available then.  Only four months later the receiver was sent in but to show how up to date the situation was in a company of that size, the package was put together in November.  At that time the participants &mdash; the Bank of Ireland, Carrolls and Fieldcrest &mdash; expressed confidence in that package.  They said that while the road ahead would be tough they were confident that they would survive.</P>
    <P>Since then Fieldcrest have pulled out but the point is that the plant can operate without Fieldcrest.  The management, the skill and the know-how are available. What is needed is a marketing structure that can dig in to the European market and get its share of that market.  What is required is aggressive and positive marketing. If this is achieved and if the Minister and the Government give to the workers and the management in this plant the necessary opportunities to do that, I am confident they will prove that the decision of the Government to allow this plant to close was wrong and one that should not have been taken.  Therefore, I ask the House to support fully the motion before it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> I move. Amendment No. a.1.:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Government commit itself to the continuation of the Fieldcrest plant as a textile plant in order to safeguard its huge investment and that the IDA be instructed to commit itself to this end with a view to creating maximum employment in the shortest possible time through any arrangement and furthermore Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to set up an inquiry into the establishment and subsequent collapse of the plant at Kilkenny with special emphasis on all the financial arrangements involved.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On moving the amendment on behalf of The Workers' Party I would like the Members of the Labour Party and the <Col N="219" /> other parties concerned to study very carefully the language in which our amendment is phrased.  It says that we are asking the Government to commit themselves to creating the maximum employment in the shortest possible time through any arrangements.  Furthermore, we are seeking an inquiry into the establishment and subsequent collapse of Fieldcrest in Kilkenny.  There is a fundamental difference between our amendment, the motion proposed by Deputy Pattison and the addendum of Deputy Crotty and Deputy Governey.  Their motion does not include a call for an inquiry, which our party believe is an essential issue in the question of the closure of the Fieldcrest factory after a lifespan of less than two years.  We do not support the Government's amendment which in its phraseology, states that Dáil Éireann supports the continuing efforts of the Government.  In view of the efforts to date our party cannot lend support to the amendment as proposed by the Government.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the proposition and addendum, it is of fundamental importance that an inquiry should take place. There are many reasons why it should take place, not least of which would be the fact of the huge investment of public funds, in the region of £12 million, and the failure within such a short time and the collapse of this industry that, to quote the IDA, was a blueprint for the future, one of the most modern plants in the world in relation to textiles.  A &ldquo;blueprint for the future&rdquo; is now closing after a massive Government subvention and after less than two years.  There is also the investment by another area of Government, the investment of approximately £1 million by AnCO in the training of personnel.  Time without number various Taoisigh, Ministers and so on have spoken about the need for Irish industry to involve itself in the modern technological development taking place and to meet the challenge of the future. Here is a challenge that was met by the Government through AnCO at an expenditure of about £1 million and an investment through the IDA of about £12 <Col N="220" /> million.  Trained, skilled, Irish personnel have now been thrown on to the industrial scrap-heap.</P>
    <P>Another factor which my party believe necessitates an inquiry into the closure of this factory is the extent of the commitment of the workforce of Fieldcrest.  We have heard that 630 jobs were lost.  The media from time to time have taken up and made public issue of closures in other areas much minor to this one and highlighted the impact of these smaller closures. The media are entitled to highlight these, but the scale of the closure and the redundancies in Fieldcrest warrant an in-depth investigation by all aspects of the media, and to date this investigation has not taken place.  Why has it not taken place?  Are they doing their job as they should be doing it?  This is not a criticism. I have worked in the media.  I speak as a Waterford Deputy and the effect of the closure of this factory with a loss of in excess of 630 jobs, which represents one-third of the total workforce of Kilkenny, would be equivalent to the effect on Waterford if Waterford Glass were to close down.  It will cause immense and total devastation, economic disruption and hardship.  I have spoken about the fact that 630 jobs have been lost as a result of this closure, but a key-note for the inquiry would be the method by which 250 of these workers were enticed by promises about the great future that this industry had to leave other places of employment and other places in the country to take up employment in Fieldcrest in Kilkenny, to come from abroad to develop their skills, to take up mortgages and so on.  From that point of view alone this inquiry must take place.</P>
    <P>In relation to the financial arrangements, I understand that roughly half the investment by the Bank of Ireland and Carrolls was borrowed.  Did this cause undue financial strain in some fashion, perhaps leading the company into financial difficulties?  This again is a subject matter for an inquiry.</P>
    <P>One of the most crucial aspects of such an inquiry is the investment by Fieldcrest America, a modest investment by comparison with the State investment of approximately £12 million relating to the <Col N="221" /> IDA and £1 million for training by AnCO, representing a total probably in excess of £13 million.  The question must be posed: how did Fieldcrest America come into this country with a modest capital investment of £2.5 million and then gain 51 per cent of the equity of that company?  With that investment they are now back in America having, more than likely, written off their £2.5 million investment against their tax returns and in the process are endeavouring to steal the marketing potential of Fieldcrest in Kilkenny.  A very serious question arises, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, out of a discussion which your party had with both the management and the workforce. Here I must pay tribute to those parties concerned because rarely have I seen such unanimity of purpose and spirit of co-operation between management and workforce as exists between the management and workforce of Fieldcrest in Kilkenny, but they are asking a serious question, which must be posed should this inquiry take place, as to whether there was ever a serious attempt to market the product.  The Fieldcrest America market operates from their plant in Carolina, and I understand that the lead personnel who are responsible for marketing their product throughout Europe have been retained to supply the market for America at the taxpayers' expense.  We are given to understand further that the main customers of Fieldcrest in Kilkenny &mdash; Harrods and Marks and Spencers &mdash; have now been invited to &mdash; and no doubt will be lavishly entertained at &mdash; the headquarters of Fieldcrest America in Carolina, with a view to securing their contracts for the American company.</P>
    <P>These are a few of the questions and doubts that exist not only in the minds of the management and the workers of Fieldcrest but in my party's mind also. These questions are of such crucial public importance that a public inquiry into this must take place.  Having said that, it is fair to say that this closure represents possibly the single greatest failure of the IDA to date.  It is not my intention to make a scapegoat of the IDA because we cannot overlook the culpability and liability of the Government of the day. <Col N="222" /> After all, the Government of the day sanctioned, after detailed scrutiny by the Minister of the time, Deputy Keating, the go-ahead for this development.  Even though the Government's amendment deals with one aspect of my party's motion, which calls for the Minister for Industry and Energy to inquire into the future of this project, I cannot, and my party will not, support the first line, which states that &ldquo;Dáil Éireann supports the continuing efforts of the Government&rdquo;. Our opinion is that the appropriate time for the present Government initiative was when Fieldcrest America failed to honour the rescue package.  Why at the time did the Minister not take the initiative to safeguard the taxpayers' huge investment in the Fieldcrest plant when the American company announced their intention of withdrawing from the operation by becoming directly involved and if necessary taking the role of the American company, particularly in view of the McKinsey Report that firmly established the viability of the market and the excellent quality of the product achieved in the plant?  Why has the Minister insisted that the market was not viable?  Indeed, on what grounds does the Minister make this statement?  Will the Minister quote the reports in support of his argument? Is the Minister not aware that Fieldcrest America are making arrangements to take over the European market, as I have already stated?  Would the Minister be prepared to investigate this matter with our European partners in the EEC?</P>
    <P>During his general election campaign the Minister stated that the Government have a commitment to assist all ailing industries with a view to maintaining employment and this is precisely what the Fieldcrest workers are demanding now, particularly in view of the great commitment they have given to the industry over the past two years and because of the extent and nature of the personal commitments they are obliged to enter into arising out of their employment in the plant.  It is our contention that this matter must not be left until the Minister gives a commitment to the continuation of this plant which will give some real hope to the workers and some <Col N="223" /> confidence in the future.  This is the least that would be expected of the Minister. Furthermore, the Minister must be aware that the management and workers are more than competent and, indeed, more than capable of operating this plant as a viable unit and all they require is a sales promotion on the European market.  In conversations with both management and workers it came out quite clearly that they resent the implication that the factory could not operate without taxpayers' investment.  This amounts to a vote of no confidence in Irish management and workers who have produced high quality products superior to those produced in Fieldcrest in America just because the Americans have pulled out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison spoke at length about the devastating impact of the closure of this factory.  It is an economic disaster for Kilkenny city and the surrounding areas. The loss of PAYE and PRSI payments from the workforce represents £100,000 per week.  In terms of unemployment benefit the State will now be committed to paying out approximately £240,000. But when one stands back and evaluates the whole circumstances surrounding the closure of Fieldcrest in Kilkenny, it must not be accepted as typical of the daily closures of factories because many of these factories are not in the same league in terms of capital investment.  Many of them are non-competitive by virtue of the fact that much of the plant they have is obsolete.  But this is not true of Fieldcrest in Kilkenny.  Fieldcrest in Kilkenny have the most modern plant of its kind in the world and yet after two years they are closing down.  In discussion with both management and workers it has been stated that they are fearful that there may be an attempt by the receiver within the next couple of weeks to hive off sections of the plant to recoup the losses arising out of them.  The Minister must use all his influence with the receiver to ensure that this does not happen.  I appeal publicly to the unions involved in Fieldcrest not to allow such an eventuality to come to pass.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I have listened to and studied the Labour Party motion.  My <Col N="224" /> party are not simply putting down their amendment to go one better than the Labour Party in this issue because this matter is so serious it overrides all political considerations.  In that event I am making a public appeal to Deputy Pattison that if he is prepared to compromise with our motion dealing with Fieldcrest, if they are prepared to incorporate the inquiry aspect of our motion then The Workers' Party will support the motion of the Labour Party in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Both of the last speakers, Deputies Pattison and Gallagher, have understandably dwelt at length on the dimensions of the calamity that has befallen the city and county of Kilkenny as a result of the closure of the Fieldcrest plant.  One can do nothing but agree with many of the sentiments they have expressed when one looks back on the high hopes that were entertained for Fieldcrest a mere two years ago, when what we all believed and still believe to be the most modern plant in the world was launched and began to produce goods of the very highest quality.  Two years afterwards the whole project is blasted off the face of the map.  Now we are told by some people that the plant was obsolete to begin with.  I think that an error of catastrophic dimensions has been made first of all in the closure of the plant and in the establishment at all of a plant that would inevitably close after two years because it was felt to be in some way obsolete.  I do not believe this is so but if it is so it had better be investigated thoroughly.  I said that some catastrophic error had been made and it is a question of finding out now who made the error, not to victimise whoever made it but to know the reason.  What the workers in Kilkenny are asking and will continue to ask is if there is any redress for them.  Deputy Pattison mentioned young people who will now be getting £50 a week in unemployment benefit and whose mortgage repayments are nearly 20 per cent more than that.  That is not exceptional.  That is typical because I am sure there are hundreds of young people in precisely the same position because, as <Col N="225" /> was pointed out here before, the average wage of the workforce is remarkably low.</P>
      <P>As has been pointed out, people were brought home from Britain and elsewhere with the prospect of establishing their own homes here.  They are entitled to ask if they can get any assistance to rebuild their lives that were shattered by this calamity.  The Fieldcrest plant is in my own parish, where I was born, reared and still live.  I would like to know on behalf of my neighbours whether the Government believe that a viable plant can be operated profitably again by the introduction and operation of a marketing arm.  If this were found not to be possible, I would like to know, because these are the questions the workers will ask me.  What will be done with the plant? Will it continue to be a textile plant producing a slightly different product?  If so, who would operate it?  If all the efforts of the IDA, the Government and interested parties are to get a viable plant running again, employing the 640 former employees, what use has the Minister in mind for the premises?  As has already been pointed out, this is a huge factory, there is no other like it in Ireland.  This is not a boast, but it might very well be an apology.  The economy of the whole of County Kilkenny crashed with the closure of that plant and these people need answers to their questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are precedents where the Government took special action when industries were experiencing difficulties. I am reluctant to name them but I feel I must &mdash; the Tuam sugar factory, the Talbot motor plant, the Clondalkin Paper Mills, Clover Meats, the Whitegate Refinery and, lastly and most remarkable, a few weeks ago, on a Tuesday night, a Minister told us of the intention to discontinue the operation of the Ardmore Studios, and the next night that decision was reversed.  I realise there are sharp differences in the matter of scale in these industries, but the inference is inescapable. What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.  If special measures were adopted for the people working in the industries I mentioned, it is logical for the people in the Fieldcrest <Col N="226" /> plant to ask if those rules will apply to them.  If they do not, I am afraid all the children of the nation are not being treated equally.  This matter must be of grave concern to the Government and it is a matter of life and death to the politicians in the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny. The workers of Fieldcrest must know the answers to these questions immediately.</P>
    <P>I do not think this is a time for speeches of the live horse get grass kind.  I realise the mechanics of reactivating the Fieldcrest plant are formidable but we have very efficient State agencies.  The IDA have shown themselves to be enterprising and their enterprise can be reactivated a second time.  I do not know of any case in our history where action of a special kind was called for as urgently by so many people as in this case.  I am not speaking merely of the future of the work force, big as it is, I am speaking of the whole county of Kilkenny.  When one contemplates the abstraction from the income of the city and county, one cannot but see that the future of every man, woman and child in that county will be very considerably reduced if this plant closes.  That is a very serious matter to which I draw the Minister's attention once again.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his reception of me and my colleagues on several deputations.  He was extremely patient with us.  The people of Kilkenny are very patient too.  They are prepared to wait, but not indefinitely for the re-establishment of their employment in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>I am not sure how it came about that the Fieldcrest plant was established in Kilkenny but what is relevant is that it was established there and was staffed by Kilkenny men and women.  Therefore, it is not acceptable that the rug should be pulled from under their feet, that the key should be turned quietly in the lock and that one should walk away and allow the economic standards in Carlow-Kilkenny to collapse to a level they have not hit in many decades.</P>
    <P>There are a number of amendments to this motion.  I do not think industries are established or maintained by the passage of motions on the Order Paper of this House, although they are very important. <Col N="227" /> If Deputies on this side of the House were to support any amendment, except the Minister's, all that would result would be that the present Government would collapse, presumably there would be a general election and a new Government would be formed.  It is very plain to every honest Deputy that for the new Government, whoever they might be, it would be just as difficult to find the economic resources as for the present Government, to get the Fieldcrest plant going again.  I do not propose by my vote to bring down the Government because I do not believe that is the solution to this problem.  If I did, I would be obliged to vote for the motion.  I do not believe the passage of these motions, which are political in themselves, will offer any tangible suggestions as to how the plant could be maintained or how the money could be raised to allow the operation of the Fieldcrest plant to continue.</P>
    <P>I accept that the motion and the amendments serve a useful purpose in allowing the House to discuss this grave situation but I do not think they offer any tangible suggestions as to how the money could be raised to allow the operations of the company to continue; in other words, to allow the Kilkenny workers, men and women, to continue in their jobs and to continue to pay for their houses and their investments in the future.</P>
    <P>I am confident the Government will listen to what has been said by Deputies on all sides of the House.  We are attempting to articulate a feeling that is passionately felt by the men, women and children of Kilkenny.  It is our business to articulate what they feel.  If we did not attempt to do so to the best of our ability we would be failing in our duty as Deputies who have the honour to represent them.  Therefore, we must speak plainly and call a spade a spade.</P>
    <P>I appeal once more to the Minister to look at the human tragedy that has occurred in Kilkenny and I appeal to the Government to look at their own priorities. I ask them to consider postponing other schemes they may be contemplating and to take some action here.  This is a matter that will brook no postponement. <Col N="228" /> If that were to be contemplated, the city and county of Kilkenny would be the poorer for many a long day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the amendment in my name be added to the motion put down by Deputy Pattison.  This motion is quite specific in that it asks the Minister to take certain action to reopen the factory and the Deputy points out what action should be taken.  My amendment calls on the Government &ldquo;to provide the necessary finance and to take whatever steps are necessary to effect this in 1982.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>From the contributions of all concerned the message should be getting home to the Minister at this stage.  It is the third time in a few weeks that we have debated the matter on the floor of the House.  The Minister has had to sit here and listen to Deputies who have pointed out why the factory should be re-opened immediately.  It is my contention that the company should not be allowed to close.  The company is trading. A receiver is managing it and I understand that up to three container loads of towels leave that factory every day.  We are not talking about something that is defunct.  We are talking about a factory that is operating and if they were called upon to do so in the morning the workers would be ready to put the factory into full production.</P>
      <P>This factory is most important to Kilkenny.  It has a considerable effect on the economy not only of that county but also of the surrounding counties and I think that perhaps the Minister should have taken a look at it.  It is a unique company.  It was set up in 1977 and two outstanding concerns were involved, namely, Carrolls and the Bank of Ireland, together with an American company.  They set up what is one of the most modern factories in Ireland.  It covers 11 acres and it is sited on 40 acres of landscaped ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The factory warranted a visit from the Minister and I am disappointed we had not a visit from him to show his concern for the traumatic events that took place. At a meeting of Kilkenny Corporation last night a resolution was passed unanimously <Col N="229" /> seeking a meeting with the Taoiseach. We hope the Taoiseach will meet a deputation who will bring home to him as head of the Government, in the office where the buck must stop, that action must be taken immediately to put the company back into operation and to get the 630 people back to work.</P>
    <P>When I put down the amendment I was not being political about it.  I am rather surprised that any action on the Order Paper should be referred to as being political.  In our efforts to help the people who are involved in the closure all Deputies came together and spoke with one voice.  Our aim will continue to be the re-opening of the factory and the provision of employment for people who have lost their jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt briefly with the setting up of the industry and I pointed out how well it was received in Kilkenny and in the country as a whole.  Carroll's were diversifying from their traditional involvement in the tobacco industry and the banks for the first time were prepared to take equity in a company.  We are all aware that the banks will loan you money if you can prove to them you do not really want it.  When Fieldcrest came on the scene the Bank of Ireland got involved and took equity in this company and I felt this was a new era in industrialisation. As a result it is all the more disappointing that this industry should be allowed to fail.  Why did this happen?  I will deal with this later on.</P>
      <P>In Kilkenny the arrival of this wonderful industry, the most modern in the world, with a bright future, led to a lot of activity.  There was an expansion of the fire services, which cost a substantial amount; water and sewerage works were extended and more schools and houses were built.  Business houses expanded, took on new commitments and created new jobs.  We are not just talking about the loss of 630 jobs in Fieldcrest; we are also talking about a loss of 400 to 500 jobs in service and back-up industries in Kilkenny.  The Minister and the Government are not taking stock of this development and investment made by the local authority and by local industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said before, but I think it is worth repeating, that it is the workers who suffer most.  I was at many workers' meetings and it was remarkable to note how many speakers had English accents. They had spent a considerable time working in England and this was the first time they had got an opportunity to return to their native country to work and rear their families.  Fieldcrest was the first Government-sponsored industry to come to Kilkenny.  All the other industries <Col N="231" /> there were started by local effort.  Before that we had been a commercial city serving the agricultural hinterland which is so important to the well-being of our county.  We were a centre for insurance companies and banks.  The arrival of an industry of this magnitude was bound to have an effect on the city.  The result was that we had an influx of people from all over the country, and also from abroad, to work in Kilkenny; and now they are wondering what happened.  Why were they told there was a rosy future for them in this industry and why was it let fail? They deserve answers to these questions. It is very easy to fob off unemployed people and to say that they get as much in unemployment benefit anyway.  These people do not want unemployment benefit. I have spoken to them on many occasions over the last few weeks and months and they are not interested in unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>When this industry was established the workers had a great sense of pride.  In two-and-a-half years of operation it is their proud boast that there was only one stoppage lasting for half an hour.  We had excellent labour relations and a workforce who were prepared to pull with one another and with management to make a success of their factory.  There were difficulties at the start and new technology took time to sort out.  We had four important units &mdash; spinning, weaving, dyeing and make-up &mdash; and it was a new concept to incorporate them all into one unit.  This took some time and there was a fair amount of finance lost in this operation. The Minister referred to a loss of £10 million.  When one takes into consideration the amount of funds that were lost in setting up this plant and getting it working in a streamlined fashion, it is clear that a substantial portion of this £10 million was assigned to that operation.  I do not accept that the losses were as great as the Minister stated.  He is not delving into what caused these losses and he was prepared to take advice from people in Dublin rather than from people in Kilkenny who were working on the plant.</P>

      <P>We will be very interested to hear if the Minister is going to set up an investigation into how all the money was lost and why a situation was allowed to arise and continue whereby a visiting company, who set up an operation like this, invested £2 million in it and then coolly walked away.  We want the Minister to provide funds to re-open this factory.</P>
      <P>I dealt with the problems of setting up this factory and the difficulties which arose.  When the problems were ironed out production was brought to a high level in a very short time.  The problem then was that people were producing a high grade product so fast that the warehouses were full.  We were producing a first-class product.  When the factory in Kilkenny were supplying one of the major outlets in the UK there was a problem about supplies at one stage and they got supplies from the American factory. This product was sent back to the American factory and the UK company said they wanted the Kilkenny product.  There was no problem about quality: we had the highest quality and we had the production. Therefore we must ask ourselves: where did we fall down?  We fell down on sales.  The whole question of viability of this company hinges on sales. The Minister does not believe this company is viable; I do.  The workers in Kilkenny believe that it is viable and we are asking the Minister to take the necessary action to provide funds to the receiver to re-open this factory and to get it working.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to raise the limit imposed by existing legislation on the authorised share capital of the Sugar Company.  At present, that limit stands at £10 million, a figure set by the <Col N="233" /> Oireachtas in 1973.  The Bill seeks to raise it to £75 million and to make a corresponding increase in the statutory limit on the aggregate of Exchequer advances to the company and of State guarantees for its borrowings.  It also seeks to enable the Minister for Finance to acquire the whole of the company's share capital should that appear desirable.</P>
    <P>In discussing the affairs of the Sugar Company I believe that the House would do well to keep a number of considerations of a general nature in mind.  The first of these is that the company has been in existence now for very nearly half a century.  In that time it has demonstrated a capacity for innovation and adjustment and a sense of vocation that has helped to change the face of rural Ireland, and that has contributed greatly to the establishment of long-term confidence in the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>A second is that the company is a major employer.  Apart from the 3,000 or so employed directly it also provides employment in cultivation and harvesting on the farm, in the provision of fertilisers, seed and machinery and in road and rail haulage.</P>
    <P>A third consideration is that over those 50 years the number of occasions on which a loss has had to be reported are few in spite of periods when the economic climate was far from encouraging.</P>
    <P>With so much standing to its credit one might reasonably ask why it is that the company has run into difficulties over the past two or three years.  To find an answer, at least in outline, Deputies need only turn to the report of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, completed just 18 months ago.  This report is a model of detailed and far-sighted analysis.  It was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and the Seanad debated it in March of last year.  I mention it at this stage for two reasons.  Its contents are an excellent introduction to the problems faced by the Sugar Company and the initiative taken by the committee is a starting-point for the process culminating in the Bill under discussion.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that the committee began its examination of the Sugar Company at a time when the company faced <Col N="234" /> a series of difficult and interrelated problems, including a substantial anticipated loss for the year ending September 1980. In its report the committee drew attention to the company's capital investment and modernisation programme, which had involved an expenditure of £30 million in the years 1975 to 1979, and then to the further three-year programme to cost £40 million which was under way. The committee went on to point out that this programme was financed almost entirely by loans from financial institutions. The company had indicated that the investment was essential to ensure the survival of the sugar industry since it would replace obsolete machinery and increase production efficiency.  The report drew out very clearly the implications that this situation had for the financial structure of the company.  It stated unequivocally that large recurrent interest charges were constituting a serious drain on the company's resources.</P>
    <P>The Committee went on to observe that the company's debt/equity ratio exceeded commercial norms and that interest charges had become a very heavy burden on the company's operating profit.  They noted that a large company in the private sector would already have sought to raise additional capital to correct matters.  They further noted, and expressly supported, the view advanced by the company itself that an injection of £25 million in equity capital was then needed as a first step.  Finally, they accepted that, over the next few years, there would be further calls on Exchequer resources to support a prudent and stable capital structure for the company.</P>
    <P>The Committee did not attribute the company's difficulties solely to its financial structure and its investment programme. Among the causes of the change in the company's fortunes they identified unfavourable cost price developments, high interest rates and depressed market conditions.  Thus, while they recognised that Government action alone would not be sufficient to help the company through its present difficulties they, nevertheless, considered the debt/equity imbalance to be the main item susceptible of improvement by such action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" /> The committee's report was, as I have said, considered by the Seanad early in 1981 and led to wide-ranging and constructive debate.  In the course of this contribution, the Tánaiste, who was then Minister for Agriculture, stated that the report was forming the basis of an examination of the company's affairs within his Department.  He also indicated that he was seeking the views of the company as to how it could be restored to full viability as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>The company responded in May 1981, stressing the need for new capital and citing three main reasons.  These were: firstly, the need to deal with the deterioration in its financial base mainly due to losses on the food operations and necessary investment required in the sugar factories; secondly, the need to continue its modernisation programme, and thirdly, the need to bring its debt/equity ratio into line with commercial norms.  The company then asked that its equity capital be brought up to the level of £75 million.</P>
    <P>The company's approach fell to be considered by the Coalition Government in July of last year.  That Government, quite rightly in my view, decided in principle to make new capital available to the company, but reserved a decision on the amount, manner and timing of the capital injection until they obtained the results of an examination by independent consultants of the company's financial affairs.  This course had the merit of reassuring the company's creditors on the Government's intentions, while avoiding a hasty and possibly ill-judged commitment of public money made without an independent and detailed assessment of the financial position.</P>
    <P>The consultants' report was submitted to my Department in late March of this year and the Government now believe that they are in possession of the information necessary to enable them to make a rational and considered response to the company's needs.</P>
    <P>The Government therefore propose to make the sum of £30 million available to the company in 1982.  The Government anticipate that the need for further capital for the company may arise over the <Col N="236" /> next three or four years.  They are therefore proposing enabling statutory authority, in line with the usual practice for Central Fund issues of this kind.</P>
    <P>The allocation of new capital to the company will of course be subject to certain conditions.  The main one will be the submission by the company of a clear and specific programme for the rationalisation of its food-processing activities and of the beet-growing and sugar industry. The programme is to be furnished rapidly. If it is with my Department soon, and is satisfactory, it will mean that the Company will have new funding available to it in the autumn.</P>
    <P>In relation to beet and sugar it is disappointing that in practically none of the past years has the company been able to obtain sufficient beet to fill even the A quota of 182,000 tonnes allocated to Ireland by the EEC.  This quota was secured in Brussels only with considerable difficulty and it will not be long until the quota arrangements are up for discussion again.  If we do not fill the quota allocated to us it will be more difficult to hold on to what we have.  This places an onus of responsibility on farmers.  If they do not grow sufficient beet to enable the company's production targets to be achieved, then the future of the company will be threatened.  I would regard farmers as partners of the Sugar Company when it comes to ensuring the survival of the sugar company.</P>
    <P>What is true of the company in general is, of course, true of the Tuam factory in particular.  In deciding that this factory should remain open the Government are affording an opportunity to all concerned to ensure that the necessary efforts are made to guarantee its future.</P>
    <P>In relation to food processing, it has to be admitted that Erin Foods is largely at the root of the company's inability to make consistent profits with which to fund re-investment.  The joint committee noted that throughput during the 1970s remained static and that the contribution of the food sector to group turnover has been falling.  Problems in this area include the small size of the home market as well as the squeezing of profit margins and the intensity of competition in the <Col N="237" /> export market.  The company, therefore, must make the best use of the skills and judgment available to it in developing a strategy suitable to the scale of its operations in order to turn the food activities around.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions recently I have discussed with the chairman the nature of the problems which must be tackled and the broad manner in which this might be done.  We have also discussed the progress which has been made to date in this direction.</P>
    <P>Before going on to deal with the contents of the Bill, I would like to draw attention to the company's losses over the last few years.  In 1980 they amounted to £11.2 million, in 1981 to £12 million and they are expected to be of the same order this year.</P>
    <P>As regards the Bill itself, section 2 deals with the amount of the share capital and section 4 deals with advances and State guarantees.  The feature which will strike Deputies immediately is the figure of £75 million.  The fact that such a figure is provided for does not, however, mean that the Government intend automatically to furnish new capital to the full amount of £75 million being set, or to do so in an uncritical way.  My Department, together with the Department of Finance, will be monitoring the company's affairs closely.  As I have indicated, the amount to be provided in 1982 will be limited to £30 million and that will be subject to certain conditions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes raised this particular issue last week during the debate on the Estimate for Agriculture.  He mentioned that this was a matter of concern to him. I can assure him that I share that concern. Before I recommend to the Government the issue of any funds to CSET &mdash; funds which in any case are designed to broaden the company's equity base &mdash; I will have to be thoroughly satisfied that the company are putting themselves in the best possible position to take advantage of them.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill calls for specific comment on two grounds.  First, it is, given the company's overall projected capital structure, in some ways a change of technical nature.  Secondly, it has a <Col N="238" /> bearing on a point of some interest which the joint committee made.  I will take this point first.</P>
    <P>The joint committee raised the question of whether the ownership basis of the company might not be broadened.  As it happens, there is in existence a volume of preferential share capital amounting to £500,000 which was taken up by the general public in 1934.  Its existence points to a feature which seems to have been lost sight of in recent years.  This is State involvement without 100 per cent State ownership.  It is open to the company to seek some additional capital by means of further issues to the general public.  The joint committee spoke of possible farmer or staff participation.  If the company were to feel that this afforded a reasonable possibility of funding their activities, I do not think it would encounter major opposition.</P>
    <P>I mention this because, taken out of its context, section 3 of the Bill might give the contrary impression.  In the original legislation of 1933 a volume of £1.5 million out of a total authorised capital of £2 million was reserved for shareholders other than the Minister for Finance.  In spite of subsequent increases in the authorised share capital, that £1.5 million has remained as an amount of shares which the Minister for Finance is precluded from taking up.  As the company's capital base is now to be expanded significantly, the amount of this reserved class of capital has lost its original relevance, and the time has come to abolish it.  However, its abolition does not affect the practical position relating to issues to the general public in any significant way. The provision in the Bill does not oblige the Minister to take up shares at present held by the public.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House has a simple enough purpose.  It is designed to enable the State to carry out its duties as a share-holder in the company.  It enables it to correct the situation of under-capitalisation which has been forced upon the company for a variety of reasons.  The State is now, as it has been in the past, a willing shareholder in the company.  I have no hesitation in commending the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Col N="239" />
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This side of the House welcomes the Bill for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that we appreciate the situation the Sugar Company are in, a very difficult one.  We have, as I indicated last Friday, a particular concern that the Sugar Company can continue to carry out their activities in the interests of the workers in the company, the farmers who grow sugar beet and vegetables for the company, the wider general interest of having a major sugar industry and, if this can be brought about, an expanded food industry in the country. I also welcome the fact that we have this Bill before the House because it affords us an opportunity to examine some issues which need examination and to which I ask the Minister to direct his attention in carrying out what he proposed to do under the Bill.</P>
      <P>I make the point, which was adverted to by the Minister, that the previous Government were committed to making a substantial injection of capital into the Sugar Company largely for the same reasons that the Minister has outlined. We made the decision in principle to inject a substantial sum into the company because we believed the case put forward by the company, which has been repeated by the Minister this evening, that the company's capital base must be expanded in order to allow them to continue in operation and in order to provide for the possibility that we could get the kind of expansion in the overall operations of the company we would all like to see.</P>
      <P>In our budget proposals last January, looking at the semi-State sector in general, we provided £90 million for allocation one way or another to semi-State companies, a number of whom had put forward a case for extra State funding. The demands made by the companies in question amounted to a great deal more than that.  We believed, given the constraints of the time and the undoubted merits of many of the requests made by the companies, that a figure of £90 million was required in order to provide a reasonable response to the situation which had emerged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="240" /> I regret to say that the Fianna Fáil Government reduced this figure to £30 million for the full year.  That gives rise to a question.  If the Minister has his way will the Sugar Company use up all that available capital this year?  Does that mean that no other funding will be available for other State companies?  I do not want in any way to give rise to any divisive argument between State companies, all of whom have their own needs and all of whom must inevitably compete with one another for State capital.</P>
    <P>This Bill and the Minister's presentation of it illustrate very clearly the unreflecting way in which the Government went about chopping off that allocation, reducing it by two-thirds and now they find themselves in the position where in one year for one company they must use all their allocation which apparently they believed they could allocate to all the State companies for this year.  I do not make that point in any spirit of creating division between State companies nor do I make it in any way to criticise the Minister's provision for the Sugar Company for this year.  There is a more general point there which the Government would do well to reconsider and which they need to explain to the general public very quickly because there are a number of other companies who have valid claims on the public purse.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that in May last year the company put forward a corporate plan setting out their views on the proper course of development for them over the next few years.  The company indicated a need for an extra capital injection of £75 million over three years, £44 million in the first year, roughly £18 million in the second year and some £13 million in the third year.  That corporate plan was drawn up by the company with three substantial objectives: first, to correct the financial base of the company; second, to allow the company to continue with a significant development of capital investment in order to allow them to meet the demands on their processing ability in the foreseeable future; third, to correct the company's debt to equity ratio. Nobody looking through the company's report could disagree that these are the <Col N="241" /> objectives to which we must address ourselves. The figures contained in that report show the urgency and gravity of the situation.</P>
    <P>The report for the year ended 30 September 1981 shows a total loss attributable to CSET of almost £12.1 million. This loss arises after an operating profit of £379,000, offset to a very large extent by £9.9 million of interest payable during the year.  A second feature is a total of £66 million in overdrafts and advances outstanding on 30 September.  To cap it all, shareholders' funds actually constitute a deficit of almost £3.5 million in the balance sheet.  When one takes all those factors together one can see that the company find themselves in a very difficult position, to which the chairman referred in his report.  Under the heading &ldquo;Capital Requirements&rdquo; the chairman stated:</P>
    <P>Since 1976 this Company has spent over IR£40 million modernising its factories, reducing their oil dependence and increasing their throughput.  Our current plans provide for a further IR£50 million of capital investment in the immediate years ahead.  This inevitably puts a heavy financial strain on the Company.</P>
    <P>The IR£40 million came from our own resources, or from borrowing which has had to be serviced at historically high interest rates.  That investment has not been supported by grants as would have been the case in the private sector.  Our borrowings &mdash; and the resultant cost factors indicated in the accounts &mdash; are reflections of an equity base totally inadequate to the scale of our operations.</P>
    <P>That is the problem which the company brought to the then Government in May last year.  The scale of the problem, illustrated by the figures I have quoted, certainly takes one aback.  It is compounded by the historically high interest rates and if we are to proceed on the basis set out in the Bill and if the company proceed on the lines set out in the corporate plan, there is still no absolute guarantee that we can make a fundamental difference which will prevent a recurrence of this problem in the coming years.  It is evident <Col N="242" /> from the accounts that this company, as well as all other manufacturing enterprises and farms, are being very severely hit by a combination of internal cost factors and very high level of interest rates.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister and his colleagues to consider that this is an acute example of what is happening to companies throughout the country and I would impress on them the need to adopt the kind of overall policies which will allow us to get to the root of these problems.  I said last Friday that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste appear to have got this message in recent days and I hope for all our sakes and for the sake of the Sugar Company that they will take seriously the words they have been uttering and act accordingly.</P>
    <P>We agreed with the company that there was a need for a substantial injection of capital and my feeling was that without some further analysis of the programme put forward by the company and their operations it would be unwise to go ahead on the basis of the information we had and make an extra capital injection.  For that reason I recommended to the Government that we should commission an independent study of the company's operations in order to assist us in identifying the level of capital injection required before making a decision on the specific amount to be allocated to the company.  That consultants' report was commissioned and set in motion.</P>
    <P>On 10 June Deputy Molony and I put down a number of questions to the Minister concerning this company and the consultants' report.  I put down three questions, the first of which asked if the Minister had received the report and if he intended to publish it.  The second question concerned the plans the Minister had for providing extra capital for the company and the third related to the conditions he intended to attach to the granting of extra capital.  Deputy Molony had a specific question related to the provision of £5 million for special development of the sugar factory in Thurles in accordance with the commitment given prior to the general election last February. The Minister answered the four <Col N="243" /> questions together, as was his right, and said that he had received the consultants' report and hoped to introduce legislation shortly to make provision for extra capital for the company.  He said he was not yet in a position to indicate the conditions to be attached to such capital.  He went on to say, &ldquo;As the report relates to a company engaged in competitive trading, it is not my intention to have it published&rdquo;. I can see the point the Minister might have wished to make but it is in common parlance a &ldquo;po-faced&rdquo; answer. If the Minister and the company persisted in being so sensitive about these matters why would we have had the publication of the report of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies to which the Minister has referred?  The committee examined in detail the operations of the company and gave many of us more than food for thought and expanded our understanding of the problems faced by the company and of what is necessary to deal with those problems.  The same considerations apply to this consultants' report, particularly since the Minister is now telling us that on the basis of the report, taken in conjunction with the company's own proposals of May last year, he now proposes to allocate £30 million this year to the company, with the possibility of a further £35 million being allocated in future years.</P>
    <P>I can understand that the Minister is not in a position to say now what specific plans he would have for the remainder of the overall amount which he proposes to allocate.  I again ask the Minister if he would give more details of what he has in mind when he says that he is attaching conditions to the allocation of the new capital.  He says that the main condition would be the submission by the company of a clear and specific programme for the rationalisation of its food processing activities and of the beet growing and sugar industries.  I am not quite clear what exactly the Minister means by this.  Has he had a programme which enables him to allocate £30 million, or is he allocating £30 million in the expectation that he will be given a programme of that kind?  This is not very clear from his speech.  In asking <Col N="244" /> for more details on this, I am not carping at the company, or in any way arguing about the need for extra capital for them, but we must all be sure that the programme will get general acceptance. The company are obliged to run their affairs to the best of their ability, in line with their own view of how they see this future development.  However, we are talking about an allocation of capital by the State, about an industry which employs, as the Minister says, over 3,000 people, about an industry which is the outlet for the products of thousands of our farmers, which provides a great deal of haulage business, which is a user of all kinds of raw materials, fertilisers and so on.  This is an operation which reaches right across the country into many different sectors.  This House is entitled to know, before we vote extra money, what precisely is being done with the money, so that we can all be sure that the programme is one to which we can give our support, to which beet growers, sugar factory workers and workers in Erin Foods can give their undivided support and commit their efforts to making the programme work.  It would be of assistance generally to know what that programme is.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect which we should look at in considering this.  As everybody here knows, a number of allegations about the way some of these operations have been run have appeared in recent days and have followed on the recent court case of the company.  I have no wish to rake over matters which would be painful for a number of people, but again there is a duty on us to ensure that a company in the State sector to which it is now proposed to give £30 million is being operated, in so far as it is possible, according to the best management practices. It appears from the allegations and from the evidence given in the recent trial that, to say the least, there is a question mark over some of the internal accounting procedures of the company.  We have their statements in court and subsequent allegations to the effect that various ploys were used to get around their internal accounting system.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister should <Col N="245" /> give this some attention and tell us this evening what he has in mind to rectify the situation.  The question inevitably arises, what is wrong with the internal accounting system of the company that it can apparently be circumvented with such relative ease and over such a long period?  What is being done to correct this situation, to avoid its recurrence, to improve the security of the company's internal accounting system?  It appears from what we have seen that it is not watertight by any means and that leakages from it are possible.  The list of difficulties which emerges from these various sources is quite considerable.  We have examples of double and, indeed, multiple invoicing of products, false labelling of products, false orders, fictitious debits and credits in accounts, the entry of false documentation into the internal accounting system of the company &mdash; all of which went on, apparently, for some time without being detected.</P>
    <P>If these things can happen in this company, we need, first, to ask what is being done to rectify this, to ensure that it does not happen again.  Another question arises of what is being done to check that this cannot happen in other State companies. These are very important questions which need to be examined very closely.  Now is the appropriate time to examine them, when the Minister is proposing to allocate a very substantial and sorely needed sum to the company.  I and my colleagues on this side of the House are very much in favour of improving the capital structure of the company.  There is no question about that.  However, before we proceed along the lines indicated by the Minister, we want to be clear in our minds on what exactly is being done with the funds being allocated.  We also want to be clear on what is being done within that company to prevent the recurrence of abuses which have emerged in the recent past.</P>
    <P>One or two other points were raised by the Minister on which I would like more information.  The Minister made the point that in practically none of the past years had the company been able to obtain sufficient beet to fill even the A quota of 182,000 tonnes allocated to <Col N="246" /> Ireland by the EEC.  This is something which concerns all of us.  We are all anxious to ensure, particularly in today's difficult times, that we continue to have the maximum possible outlet for farm production of what is, in spite of the difficulties we have seen in the past few years, a reasonably remunerative crop for farmers. We are concerned to ensure that that situation continues and that, in so far as it is possible, that outlet for farmers is expanded.  The Minister has quite rightly pointed out that the level of our quota will come up again for discussion.  Procedures are used for fixing these quotas &mdash;&ldquo;procedures&rdquo; is probably too fancy a term with which to dignify what happens; a great deal of haggling goes on.  Inevitably, past performances is one of the main factors taken into account.  That was the case before our EEC entry and it has been the same since, whenever sugar quotas have been discussed.</P>
    <P>I join with the Minister in emphasising that as far as we can we should try to reach the maximum level of sugar beet production allowed by the quota arrangements. The Minister said that this places an onus of responsibility on farmers.  I agree, but equally it places an onus on other people, particularly the Government. I have said that we can regard the production of sugar beet as a reasonably remunerative enterprise compared with other farming enterprises, but it is just as susceptible, possibly more so, as many other farming enterprises to the kind of difficulties farmers have been having.  So, if there is an onus on farmers to produce sugar beet up to the level which would enable us to maintain our present sugar quota and to bring the throughput in the sugar factories up to that level, equally there is an onus on the Government to produce the kind of economic conditions that will allow farmers to provide the input necessary to ensure that we will get an expansion in sugar beet production so that in total production we will come up to the target level we have set ourselves.</P>
    <P>The provision of such economic conditions is largely a matter of making sure that firm action will be taken to reduce specifically the rate of inflation in farm costs and firm action by the Government <Col N="247" /> to make capital available at something less than the present impossible rate of interest.  A wide range of action is open to the Government and I hope the Government will show some commitment to taking such action in the near future.  Otherwise the ambition to fill our sugar quota and to get the company on a sound footing will be difficult to realise. I ask the Minister to bear in mind that if there is an onus on farmers to produce sugar beet at a level necessary to bring us up to our sugar quota, there is equally an onus on the Government to bring about conditions in which farmers can do that profitably.  During the course of his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>In relation to food processing, it has to be admitted that Erin Foods is largely at the root of the company's inability to make consistent profits with which to fund re-investment.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if we should read that in the wider context of the company's overall operations or in the narrower context of Erin Foods.  Looking at the accounts, we can see that the main problem the company have encountered is the high level of borrowing at which they have been forced to work.  It is clear that the sugar side has been one of the reasons for that high level of borrowing.  It is not clear to me that Erin Foods can be taken to have been largely at the root of that situation, and I ask the Minister to elaborate on that.  It is important that we look at it because one of the ambitions we must have in relation to the future development of the CSET group must be the expansion of the Erin Foods-type operation. We have a particular problem in relation to our sugar quota, and although we would want to expand that to the maximum level possible, it is clear that beyond the present level there is some limitation on how far we can go, even if we had a rapid expansion in the total acreage of sugar beet.</P>
    <P>Even if we are looking for expansion in the total level of the company's operations, there must be heavy reliance on the Erin Foods type operation.  Other sectors of the company's activities could <Col N="248" /> contribute, but there must be heavy reliance on sectors like Erin Foods.  Taking the kind of food market we have and food imports in competition with what we produce here, there must be a great deal of scope for expansion of food processing on the lines CSET have been involved in, and I ask the Minister to consider that and to give some details of the plans he has in mind for such operations.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to compare what the Minister and CSET have said about that with what the IDA said recently in their programme of strategy for development in the food industry.  If we could build the IDA approach into the CSET operations there might be something beneficial for the future development of the company.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to section 3 of the Bill and stressed that the section as it stands does not affect the practical position relating to the general share capital issues to the public.  I thank the Minister for that reflection and I hope that in the future we will get to the point when the share capital issues by the group will be a practical proposition for the public.  If that had been tried in recent years I am not convinced there would have been an enormous lot of capital forthcoming.  The Minister's point is a fair one in so far as the intention of the section is concerned, but is he suggesting there may be a time when privatisation of the company will be considered?  I suggest he would find that we would have to go a great deal further to restore the health of the group before that would become an attractive proposition for the ordinary private investor.</P>
    <P>I will end by repeating what I said at the beginning.  We are anxious to see progress made to improve the capital structure of the company, for all the reasons I gave: in the interests of the sugar beet producing farmers, of the company workers and in an effort to develop ways in which we can expand the industry and improve it, based on home produced raw materials.  I would insist on the point that the House should be given more information, more detail on what is planned with the capital put into the company.  The Minister has gone some distance this evening in indicating that <Col N="249" /> the £30 million he proposes to allocate this year will be additional to the programme of the type he outlined.  I am glad to hear that because there were rumours recently to the effect that of the £65 million extra capital proposed in the Bill, £30 million was to be made available without conditions and the remainder made available possibly with conditions. I am glad the Minister has dispelled that and that we can all be sure that constructive use will be made of this money.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give us some assurance on the operation of the company. A number of doubts have been raised recently by allegations concerning the operation of sectors within the company. The House needs to be assured that that kind of thing cannot happen again.  The House should also be told what is being done to avoid that.  We have particular responsibility in the matter but the workers of the company should also be given that information and so also should those who produce the raw materials and the clients.  We are all committed to the further development and expansion of these operations to the maximum possible extent.  Measures that will clearly prevent a recurrence of this situation can only do good in the context of that kind of expansion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I should like to welcome the Bill. There are a few points I should like to make in so far as reference has been made to the history of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta, to recent matters of controversy affecting the company and to not so recent controversies surrounding some of its operations in the different regions.  When I listened to speeches about the background in which the company was founded and in which it operates today I am always amazed at the manner in which people who should know better in the matter of economics choose to be silent about great omissions in relation to, for example, the operation of the company's plant in Tuam.  One of these is the absence of planning for the food processing sector.  The company which has been in existence for almost half a century has had to operate for <Col N="250" /> those 50 years in an atmosphere in which there has been no systematic planning for the food processing industry, for the inputs to that industry, its structure its organisation, the employment yield of that sector or any of the regional conditions that might be attached to planning in the food processing sector.</P>
      <P>Equally, there has been no attempt to set the different plants of the company into any regional economic setting, in other words, to assess the impact of the capital allocated to its different operations in a regional setting or assess the impact of the institutions in terms of regional employment patterns.  I often wonder about that because the idea of a planned sector within the economy is not new.  Neither is the idea of regional economics. What is old, vulgar and reactionary is the idea that economics consist of the market place, and the market place only.  That is an atmosphere in which this company has been forced to operate for decades.  When the company was founded the people who turned the stones in the different factories which it quickly established spoke of the social impact that this investment in the thirties would have.  Today when people read of the affairs of the company they seek to test it narrowly by the market place.  That is fair enough but at what stage did social criteria give way to commercial criteria? At what stage was one set of criteria clearly abandoned and another put in its place?  Do both exist today?  I suspect they do in an atmosphere where there is an obdurate opposition to planning the economy.  Where there is both ignorance and obduracy in relation to regional planning it is natural that we would have some kind of schizophrenic atmosphere in which sometimes the contribution of the Sugar Company's different operations will be discussed in terms of their social importance in different areas, particularly in relation to employment and very often in relation to their contribution to some employment for small farmers. Every now and again its products have to be sold in the market place and we make a kind of leap to see how its products are performing there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know my own voice is a minority in <Col N="251" /> this regard.  In the land of the blind there are those who want to go on imagining that the absence of planning is not important, that regional planning is a type of cranky novel idea, that the idea that we would, for example, specify whether purposes of investment were social or simply commercial, and I am prepared to live with that.  At the same time I must put it on record that the company for most of its existence has a fine record for seeking to innovate, establish new things and introduce new techniques in Irish agriculture in an almost impossible atmosphere. I should like to be more specific. I believe when the history of the company comes to be written there will be many people who will want the historian to write not only of what the company did but also what it was not allowed to do, and why and where the opposition came from.  Those people will want the historian to write about the times when, for example, the marvellous people who chose to take up employment in this State company rather than going into the private sector first established factories, introduced techniques and made many more suggestions but then were told that there were people in the private sector who were upset by what they wanted to do, who were upset by the conditions they wanted to put into even their regular operations and how they must give way. They were told that they must not, for example, stretch out sideways into all the different elements of Irish agriculture.  It must be remembered that Irish agriculture was changing through those decades and was moving from being labour-intensive to being capital-intensive as it is today.  The techniques in agriculture were changing and new forms of machinery were being introduced.  Even to the most minor forms of machinery the company was blocked from becoming involved.</P>
    <P>I can recall an old farmer telling me on one occasion that the company could not produce a galvanised bucket if there was some private bucket manufacturer lurking around the backward Irish economy of the day.  The company came through this backward, private sector-obsessed economy into the modern period.  It has <Col N="252" /> to its record that it provided employment &mdash; those figures are contained in the Minister's speech.  We are aware of today's employment figures but what the company provided over the years is equally important.  If the national economy was decaying before the so-called opening up of the Irish economy took place at the end of the fifties the regional economy almost did not exist in terms of any income being circulated or employment being provided in the regions.  I applaud the people who founded the factories in rural Ireland and who gave jobs initially to those who wanted to work with a product that was related to something they and their families had experience of, the food industry.  Equally they gave employment within the cycle of small farmers. That was very important.  They will be applauded for it.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that today the Sugar Company are being assessed in terms of the present markets which exist for Irish food.  It might be appropriate to offer an old fashioned note about the Irish food market.  It has changed to one of great dependency on imported products.  I regard myself as one of the few parents in Ireland who is rearing his children independent of Heinz baby food products.  Our food market is dominated by foreign products.</P>
    <P>The Minister should direct his attention to some of the marketing conditions in which the Irish Sugar Company are forced to operate.  Is the Minister satisfied that the conditions some supermarket operators are insisting on in relation to the Sugar Company could be regarded as fair trading practices?  Is the Minister satisfied that there is no supermarket chain telling the company that they must allow their sugar to be processed by companies who may or may not be using Irish sugar and who are involved in the processing of sugar from abroad and products such as flour, or face the threat of their other products being removed from the shelves?  If we speak about the confused atmosphere in which the Irish Sugar Company are being forced to operate in terms of the absence of any planning and if we speak of their products going to represent a greater proportion <Col N="253" /> of food consumption, we need to be assured that fair trading is being practised by those who are dominating consumer patterns.</P>
    <P>I listened to two excellent speeches on this Bill by the Minister and Deputy Dukes.  I was impressed by how much positive purpose is shared around the House in terms of the future role of Comhluct Siúicre Éireann.  I share that optimism.  What I worry about is the confusion which exists as to the criteria by which the performance of the company will be judged.  I share the view with Deputy Dukes that one could know if one's investment was being spent wisely if one had the published programme of investment by the company for the years ahead.  Equally, would Deputies agree that it would be easier to assess the state of that investment and its efficacy if we had any commitment to regional planning? That point is crucial.  Suppose one does not approach investment by the Sugar Company in a plant such as Tuam within the context of a regional plan, what is one doing?  Tuam becomes a project which has a question mark associated with it.  It is like other projects.  It joins Knock airport.  To evaluate a plant or an aspect of a company's operations in this manner is piecemeal.  One must ask what are the conditions within the region, what is the employment situation and what opportunities exist.  In any speech I have read which was made in the Dáil on the question of the Irish Sugar Company or the operation in Tuam, I have not seen any assessment as to how these factors, such as agricultural factors in the hinterland of these plants, are being addressed in terms of corporate strategy.  The physical structure, the size of farms, access to farms, relationships to market and the social composition of the people who own the farms all affect the ability of the people in the hinterland to produce beet.</P>
    <P>One can take factories located in different places.  One can cross all the headings I have mentioned and find differences in soil, size of holding and ability to relate to the market which are real and affect the ability to grow beet to supply to a factory in the region.  These factors tend to be ignored.  They are ignored as <Col N="254" /> a specific omission within the general opposition to establish a plan for a region in which agriculture would be a component and within that there would be a plant for food processing which would relate to regional performance across a whole series of criteria.</P>
    <P>If there is a programme within the company to assess how the money is spent, surely it is equally important to know the impact of the investment within the regional economy and society.  It reveals an ideological conservatism that this question is not being addressed but rather that it is the specific performance within the Sugar Company which is being addressed.</P>
    <P>We should have more information. When all the parades, marches, deputations, delegations, pastoral letters and so on were all over I kept asking myself about one point which struck me but which tended not to be emphasised and that was in relation to the insecurity about the future, the people who were not consulted and given very much information were the workers and organised trade unions even though there were worker directors within the company who could be elected to the board.  The worker director legislation within which those worker directors had to function is and was seriously limiting as to how the information could be secured by the people involved and related to those they represented.  I was appalled but not surprised by the absence of information.  I was appalled because at the end of the day the people whose loyalty was given to the company were the workers.</P>
    <P>It is arguable as to whether the factory was supported at all times by the people in the agricultural community.  They failed to provide beet and other products when it was necessary.  There is some evidence that there is a greater consciousness among farmers as to the importance of meeting the requirements and there is an encouraging response to which we should respond.  The workers' loyalty to the company was never in question.  One might say what of recent events?  I offer a cautionary note.  In the private enterprise economy in which we live, there are many examples of fraud and embezzlement <Col N="255" /> which never come to light.  Many companies,, banks and so on know it is sometimes better to buy off trouble.  We need to be careful in relation to State companies.  In their performance here they have been innovative.  They have promoted people and given them responsibility on the basis of intelligence and ability.  They have received public money and have been more accountable for it than many private sector firms which have received assistance from the State.</P>
    <P>Can we truthfully say that the Irish private sector have succeeded while the State companies have failed?  The lesson of history teaches us that private enterprise is good at recording profits.  We have been told time and again by those marvellously honest people in the CII and other such people that they are there to make profits and that the State should get on with the business of employment creation; but we have often imposed social obligations on our State companies without being willing to develop an accountancy system to take that into account.  I reject totally the idea that in modern times of increased economic competition, depressed markets, we can simply ransack through the economy taking this semi-State company or another and saying &ldquo;This one does not look well in terms of commercial criteria&rdquo;.  I repeat my question, a question I wish to leave on the record of this House and one to which I shall return again and again during whatever time I spend here: at what time in history was one set of criteria, social, departed from in the interest of commercial criteria and where was the crucial decision that decided we must measure by commercial economic criteria alone the performance of State and semi-State companies?</P>
    <P>In my brief time in public life I have seen within the regional economy, of which Galway is a part, people make chewing gum for Italian factories and crolly dolls which sometimes were sold and at other times were not sold.  I have seen the food processing sector being allowed to stagnate because we lost out on the many opportunities in that field. We lost these opportunities in the early <Col N="256" /> decades by reason of waiting for this magic private entrepreneur to emerge to make all the money for us and then when we opened up our economy our retail patterns were dominated by these people.  The decisions in relation to food were taken elsewhere so that we had almost lost the opportunities.  It is very important that our own failures, and by that I mean our political failures, should not be allowed to be visited on the semi-State and State bodies who have been forced to operate in an atmosphere of political and economic schizophrenia.</P>
    <P>I welcome the IDA publication, <i>Strategy for the Development of the Food Industry</i> and I would agree, too, with the Deputy who says that if we knew how this fitted into the programme of development the Sugar Company might have, it would be of benefit.  I agree that the more published information we have the more we will know about our investment.</P>
    <P>In the course of my remarks I have been concentrating perhaps too much on aspects of beet production.  We must bear in mind always that there is no company either in the private or in the semi-State sector in any country that has stayed with one product without diversifying from it for more than half a century.  I make no apology for saying that if the Sugar Company had been released down through the years into other lines of production, into becoming involved in other areas that had been cornered by the private sector, this situation might be very different, and let us be clear that what we are talking about is the native private sector.  Later when the natives became socially mobile we opened up for the foreign private sector.  It is important to bear that in mind.  We have not been fair always in assessing the performance of companies like the Sugar Company.  I wish this company every success in the future.  I admire and applaud the people who have worked for the company down through the years and I look forward to a time when there will be a planned economy, when the food sector will be more exciting to work in, but in the interim I wish to place on the record my appreciation and admiration for the people who have gone into the public <Col N="257" /> service in companies such as the Sugar Company at times in which the only context in which they had to work was a non-primed economy, no food sector production plan and a great deal of political uncertainty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which in essence will be the means of improving the capital structure of the Sugar Company by raising the limit to £75 million. I congratulate the Minister in bringing forward the Bill.  As the Minister stated, the Sugar Company have been a major employer for 50 years during which time they have changed the face of rural Ireland and of the west in particular.  In addition to the direct employment in Tuam, for instance, there are light engineering works, haulage and turf cutting machinery and the cultivating and harvesting of the crop.  In Tuam alone there are more than 600 jobs in the sugar beet industry.  The company have a fine record.  The only years in which they did not record profits were the past two years but some of the reasons for that are given in the report of the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies.  I might not be as complimentary as other speakers have been about the report of that committee, particularly in respect of some of the recommendations that were made, but the report did give some insight into the problems of the Sugar Company.  I was in the Seanad when the report was debated fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur with Deputy Higgins concerning the encouraging response to the growing of beet in the Tuam catchment area. This year the acreage under beet is more than 7,000, which is an increase of 25 per cent on last year or of more than 50 per cent for the past two years.  That is the kind of response that is needed if we are to reach our quota of 182,000 tonnes. Like other speakers here, I hope that that beet acreage will be increased.  After all, in the interests of the long-term future of the factories, particularly the factory in the west of Ireland which has certain handicaps, it is very encouraging to think that that acreage is increasing.  I welcome the Bill and I am glad that it will correct <Col N="258" /> the under-capitalisation of the Irish Sugar Company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Bill. I welcome in particular the additional clarification we have had from the Minister this evening.  It is unfortunate that we are trying to crowd this important legislation into such a short time at such a late hour.</P>
      <P>It has been said by both the Minister and Deputy Dukes that the Sugar Company have proved to be a very vital part of our agricultural history.  Deputy Higgins rightly stated that the company in their initial stages were founded for social as well as commercial purposes.  I doubt if otherwise we would have had a beet factory located in Tuam which is not the ideal location for a sugar company. Down the years &mdash; I can go back a long time &mdash; that company were faced with massive problems.  Apart from finance, in the early days there was the difficulty of growing the crop, getting people to keep it clean, the difficult manual job of pulling and harvesting the beet and so on.  It has left a sort of bad taste in the mouths of the farmers but the money was good.  This is why, if for no other reason, in rural Ireland sugar beet survived and flourished</P>
      <P>In regard to technology, much of that was developed by the Irish Sugar Company themselves.  I accept Deputy Higgins's point that they were prevented in many cases from developing the machinery technology in many other areas but we have developed in this country the only successful sugar beet harvester. It is the best machine in the world for Irish and UK conditions, small acreages and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For social as well as commercial reasons we founded Erin Foods with Sugar Company funding and Sugar Company staff without any particular investment from any government.  Basically the Sugar Company were asked to set up Erin Foods under Lieutenant General Costello.  It was the Sugar Company technicians who initiated it in Carlow, Mallow, and eventually in Midleton and Fastnet and then we had the potato plant in Tuam.  Some of these companies have <Col N="259" /> unnecessarily gone by the wayside and there is no point in talking about them, but we can grow the best seller in the world in West Cork and we are no longer doing so.  Some of the best horticultural crops in the world were grown in the Carlow area and now we are limited to Mallow and Midleton.  However, there are plenty of processing plants around to do a good job.  The problems of the Sugar Company were financial.  The company themselves were always under-financed and it was too much to expect them not only to finance their their own operations where they had a monopoly on the sugar side, but also to finance an operation in food in which they had by no means a monopoly.  In order to succeed we had to go outside this country for our markets and this is where our problems started. The multi-nationals pounded us left, right and centre when we crossed the Irish Sea.  We attempted a small television programme in Britain in one area which I remember well, and they came in the following evening with massive television programmes and money and drove us out of that market.  It was a pity because it would have benefited those companies had they allowed what was basically a very diminutive competitor among them.  The change has come about rather slowly but very surely.  We now have the rather anomalous situation where Batchelors are coming to us to ask us to grow and to process for them, and they are delighted with our product.  Having failed themselves to get what they wanted, they can now get what they want in east Cork and Mallow.</P>
    <P>Coupled with that, we have our own R &amp; D in Carlow, if the Minister has not already done so I suggest that he take a day off and visit the R &amp; D plant in Carlow and see for himself the advance that has taken place there with regard to food technology and what they are doing with little dinners and all these products which are so convenient for everybody, civil servants and so on, who have to take a quick lunch and all they need do is add a little boiling water and in two minutes they have a lunch.  It is completely new, developed by us and nobody else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> To consider doing anything regressive with regard to food is unheard of.  Of course the Sugar Company are going through tough times and even with this additional capital, things will be tight and tough.  Basically our problem, as in other areas, is our national inflation which has gone through the roof.  We are no longer as competitive as we should be and other people can come into the markets that we once controlled and sell cheaper than we can.  We must tackle this because it affects also the farming side, even with sugar beet.  The Minister mentioned in his speech, and he was right, that we have a falling off in acreage.  That will have very serious consequences for the group, not to mention the factories.  The falling off in acreage has very serious consequences for the Sugar Company group because they need extra acreage to stay in business and they are not getting it. The reason is that sugar beet is not as lucrative as it used to be, basically because of high cost and high inflation.  I believe that in some areas there is a swing to dairying and that applies to some extent in our area.  We had a very unsatisfactory situation which sorted itself out, but in that we lost some very good growers. A series of little things can cause problems.</P>
    <P>I have nothing but admiration for the Sugar Company.  They have initiated within that group a farm machinery section in Carlow which at this minute is starved of funds.  People with the greatest inventive brains in the world down there who have developed machines of the highest quality are working on the machinery floor because we have not enough funds in that machinery section to allow them develop, expand and create jobs.  It is the old story.  When the scare is on we pull back instead of going forward, and forward we should and could go with regard to the Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>Once we get our economy right &mdash; and this must be done sooner rather than later; we cannot wait too long to get inflation under control; we heard a good deal about that this morning in the Council of Europe &mdash; we will get this crop back to its former glory and stature <Col N="261" /> because it is a good cash crop.  It is also a useful feed crop for animals.  This is a first class field for producing grain.  The sugar industry employs something like 25,000 people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I should like to thank you most sincerely for allowing me to raise this issue on the Adjournment.  The recent decision on the future of the rural home economics college in Navan, County Meath, is most serious for a large number of people in the midland counties.  As the Minister is aware, in 1980 the nuns at St. Martha's College informed the county committee of agriculture that they were withdrawing their services from that college the following year.  On the committee of agriculture we were alarmed about the possibility of the withdrawal of these services from the young ladies who were interested in home economics.</P>
      <P>We met the superior of the college and asked her permission to have negotiations with the Department of Agriculture and the board of ACOT to ensure the future of St. Martha's College and the services being provided by that college. When we contacted the Department we were told that negotiations were taking place on the taking over of the college. Last year before the general election we were informed by the then Minister for Agriculture, now the Minister for Finance, that the college would be taken over by the Government when and if he was returned to office.  He gave that commitment. Recently he introduced a budget which provided £14 million to the board of ACOT to run their services for the coming year.  In their February estimate they set aside £33,000 for the renting of the college premises for a 12 month period.  I was delighted to hear that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an average of 71 pupils per year in the college since it was founded in 1932, and a large number of them have gone on into the field of home economics in hospitals and so on.  They <Col N="262" /> have been very successful and many of them have become good farmers' wives. In 1975, 21 per cent of the population were directly involved in agriculture.  In 1981 the figure was 18.5 per cent.  This figure is higher than the figure in any other country in Europe.  The training at St. Martha's and the technical skills taught were cost effective compared with other services.</P>
    <P>In 1979 there were 62 pupils at the college.  In 1980 there were 51 or 52.  In 1981 there were 42.  The fall in numbers was not due to a lack of applications but because pupils were being transferred to other colleges throughout the country, one in the Minister's constituency and another in the west of Ireland.  This facility was very convenient to a large number of families in the midlands.  Pupils could go home at the weekends.  The relatively inexpensive cost was important to the families involved.  In 1982-83 if students wish to take advantage of the same services they will have to travel the length and breadth of the country.  The extra expense could have been avoided if the college had been taken over by the Department.</P>
    <P>On a national scale, statistics from the training bodies in the industrial and agricultural field covering ACOT, CERT and the agricultural colleges, show that less than 30 per cent of the applicants for courses are females while over 50 per cent of our population are females.  If we are not serious about providing training services in the field of agriculture our major industry will not prosper.  The ICA and the IFA made strong recommendations when the Youth Employment Agency was being established for suitable courses to meet the needs of prospective farmers' wives.  These courses have been available at St. Martha's for 50 years.  I know numerous girls who have attended this college and have walked into jobs as instructors in home economics all over the country.  This college is having a great effect on the local community from the point of view of young girls who can get their first year in basic rural economics.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably tell me that it is a matter for ACOT as to whether this college will be taken over and run. <Col N="263" /> But I believe that when the Minister is providing money for ACOT he should have some say as to how it is spent and what training facilities he would like to see particularly for the young people in our community so many of whom will be unable to find jobs at the end of this year's school term.  Here we have the premises and the facilities to provide courses for 70 to 90 students per year and it would be more beneficial to have this number on a course in this college than on the dole queues and unable to find a place in any walk of life.  The Minister may also say that the Coalition Ministers for Agriculture and Finance did not provide money.  But our budget was defeated here and it was not our budget that was implemented at the end of March.  It is the money provided by the present Government for ACOT that should be spent on the taking over of this college.</P>
    <P>Here I want to compliment the St. Vincent de Paul Society to which these nuns belong for giving the option to the Department and the board of ACOT to buy the premises lock, stock and barrel with its 200-acre farm and excellent dairy herd which could have been used by the Department as a demonstration college. I feel that this would be more beneficial than a stud farm for ponies in Connemara.</P>

      <P>I say that even though my colleague, Deputy Kenny might not agree with me.  But this college would definitely be a lot more beneficial to a larger number of people.  The Department were also given the option, which was negotiated partly by the former chairman of my own committee who died last year, to rent these premises at a cost of £33,000 per year and there was a fluctuating clause in relation to interest rates and inflation.  The orders should have come from the Department of Agriculture. Only two weeks ago I met the Minister with a deputation from ACOT committee in Meath and he said he would do all in his power to ensure that St. Martha's College would be taken over, that <Col N="264" /> negotiations could continue with our committee and the board of ACOT so that some courses could continue.  We are not against changing the courses in some way but some form of rural home economics courses should be provided in St. Martha's.</P>
      <P>But here is another example of lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Government for ensuring that as much education as possible be given to the community. This college has given wonderful service to pupils from six to eight counties and has had the highest praise from the families of any one who has attended it.  I am calling on the Minister to tell the directors of ACOT and the board to have another look at the possibility of taking over this college.  The Minister may not be aware that this college and the land that goes with it and everything else has been placed on the market for the end of July because of the decision taken last week by the board of ACOT.  There were discussions with the mother superior of the college over the last two or three days and she was dumbfounded at the decision taken because in 1980 we negotiated with the mother superior to have the college run for another 12 months to give time to the board of ACOT and the Department of Agriculture to draw up plans and agreements to ensure that this college would not be closed and the facilities no longer available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that we will not hear from the Minister about what happened in the seven months that we were in office.  This has been going on since June 1980, two years.  If the Government are committed to the future of Irish agriculture, to the future of the young people who could be attending this college for years to come and may instead find themselves on the dole queues, they will do something for this most important section of our community. If this college does not receive the attention it should, not alone will the community in the areas surrounding this college suffer but it will be a disaster for each and every one of us in this House. This college should be taken over and run efficiently by the Department or the board of ACOT.  I am disappointed that we were not informed by ACOT that this <Col N="265" /> was not taking place and that a decision had been taken to put the premises on the market.  We asked for £33,000 a year for a viable proposition.  We took over this enterprise lock, stock and barrel.  If I were Minister of State and this college was in my constituency, I would not leave it to an Opposition Deputy to raise this matter here.  I would have done my best in my ministerial capacity knowing this was a viable proposition for the community and the future of agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. L. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Farrelly for raising this very important matter.  At the outset it is only right that I should express my deep appreciation of the very valuable contribution to the education of girls which has been made for many years by the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul in St. Martha's College.  It is a matter of great regret that the order find themselves unable to continue providing training in rural home economics at the college after the end of the current academic year.</P>
      <P>I can therefore readily understand the desire of the people in the area served by the college that it should not be closed. There were suggestions that the State should take it over and, in this context, ACOT, as the national body responsible for agricultural education and training, were mentioned in particular.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Farrelly questioning the decision taken by ACOT.  I know most of the members on that board and nobody can say any of them are political hacks of any party.</P>
      <P>I should mention at this point that ACOT under the legislation require the specific approval of the Minister for the purchase of any property, while, on the other hand, they have full discretion in the matter of leasing, subject of course to the availability of the necessary funds. Deputy Farrelly said provision was made in this year's Estimate but no provision was made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He was a member of the major Government party.  In the Estimates for 1982 ACOT's capital and general purposes grant-in-aid did not make provision for any new services or an expansion of existing services.  This was the position when ACOT made a formal request to the Minister in April this year for approval to purchase the property. As I said, the Deputy first mentioned £35,000 and £33,000 much later.</P>
      <P>Following discussions with the college authorities on 6 April the board requested approval for the outright purchase of the college.  Alternatively the board had in mind leasing the college.  I want the Deputy to note this point because he has been harping on it for 20 minutes.  The board made it clear that should they acquire the property, they intended to discontinue the rural home economics course which had hitherto been provided at St. Martha's.  The board are happy that the 260 places available throughout the country are adequate to meet the requirements of the State.</P>

      <P>While one would have every sympathy with the board's desire to acquire the college for use as a resource for agricultural advisory and training work, it was nevertheless found necessary to inform the board that having regard to the budgetary situation at the present time, it was not possible to provide the organisation with the additional funds which would be required for the operation of the college on either a purchase or lease arrangement.  The board have since informed the Minister of their decision not to lease the property.</P>
      <P>I might perhaps mention at this point that ACOT have already under way a substantial capital programme for the expansion and improvement of advisory and training facilities generally.  In particular, under the western package they are committed to the provision of 200 additional places at agricultural colleges, 22 new local training centres and a resource centre for the development of advisory staff.  As the Deputy is aware, ACOT training and advisory centres have been established at Navan, Trim and the one at Drogheda is nearing completion, and they include first class training facilities for the teaching of farm home management. There are also other excellent facilities in the vicinity for residential training in both agriculture and horticulture &mdash; Warrenstown and An Grianán. Young farmers and girls who wish to train in home economics can do so in County Longford which is not very far away. There are adequate spaces available in different parts of the country for girls who wish to qualify in home economics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the highest regard for Warrenstown Agricultural College where I spent some of my younger years and I have no <Col N="268" /> doubt that in future Warrenstown will provide all the facilities necessary for Meath farmers.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The law provides that so far as may be practicable having regard to all relevant circumstances, the Justice of the District Court assigned to a district which includes an area where the Irish language is in general use shall possess such a knowledge of the Irish language as would enable him to dispense with the assistance of an interpreter when evidence is given in that language.  Regard is always had to this provision when a Justice is being permanently assigned to such a district and every effort is made to ensure, so far as it is possible to do so, that the Justice possesses the requisite knowledge of Irish.</P>
      <P>However, a fluent knowledge of Irish on the part of a District Justice would not necessarily enable him in every case fully to understand evidence when given in that language by native Irish speakers.  I have in mind difficulties with local dialect or local idiom.  For that reason a District Justice might consider it necessary, in the interests of justice, to have the services of an interpreter.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of this matter arises where people who have little or no Irish are involved in a case.  If they are involved in a case which is conducted in Irish or in which evidence is given in Irish, the interests of justice may require that an interpreter should be present rather than that the Justice should act as interpreter as well as Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incidentally, the wording of the question seems to imply &mdash; though I feel sure the Deputy does not intend it to &mdash; that the present District Justice of the Galway district has not sufficient Irish to enable him to hear evidence from native Irish speakers.  My information is that the Justice <Col N="37" /> in question is fluent in the Irish language.</P>

    <P>A provision of £33 million is made in the Department's Estimates for 1982 for the payment of grants under the terms of the Farm Modernisation Scheme.  This provision, which relates to the country as a whole, represents the total <Col N="40" /> amount of grants under the scheme likely to mature for payment in 1982.</P>
    <P>As the grants are payable only on the completion of approved works to the required specification and as any such works carried out in County Galway in 1982 could relate not only to schemes approved in 1982, but also to schemes approved at any time during the past few years, it would not be possible to supply the information sought.</P>

      <P>In October 1980 the then Government announced that some 3,200 civil service posts would be relocated in new purpose-built accommodation in 12 provincial centres.  The centres designated were Athlone, Ballina, Cavan, Dundalk, Ennis, Galway, Killarney, Letterkenny, Limerick, Nenagh, Sligo and Waterford.  Up to June 1981 considerable progress was achieved &mdash; particularly in relation to site acquisition, planning and design of the new offices. However, after the 1981 General Election, the incoming Government placed the programme under review and so it remained throughout their term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since assuming office the present Government have reactivated the programme, and arrangements are again in hands for its early implementation.  In five centres the stage has been reached where advertisements have now been placed inviting proposals for the provision of the necessary offices.  Work is proceeding on the other seven centres and similar proposals will be sought in respect of these offices as soon as practicable. The five centres for which proposals are now being sought and the numbers of staff involved are: 200 Department of <Col N="42" /> Defence staff to Galway, 130 Department of Justice staff to Killarney, 270 Department of Social Welfare staff to Sligo, 200 Department of the Environment staff to Ballina, 180 Department of Education staff to Athlone.</P>

      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 240 and 241 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recipients of CIE wages staff pensions are also entitled to pensions under the Social Welfare Acts which amount at present to £40.25 per week for a single person and to £65.95 per week for a married couple with variations upwards depending on recipients's age and age of recipient's wife.  As it is on this basis that the sum of £16.50 to which the Deputy refers, and the associated contributions are calculated, it would not be appropriate to comment on the figure in isolation. However, the amount of £16.50 was settled <Col N="43" /> in 1977 as part of an interim scheme and requires to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>In this regard, as I have indicated in a reply on 26 May 1982, negotiations have been in progress between CIE and the Unions for the drawing up, in respect of the regular wages staff of CIE, of a definitive scheme on similar lines to those in operation in the public sector generally. The negotiations cover the introduction of a widows' and children's scheme.  I am anxious to approve, at the earliest possible opportunity, a definitive scheme within public sector norms subject to prevailing financial considerations.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit for the periods from 15 April to 24 April 1982, 28 April 1982 to 4 May 1982 and 6 May to 29 May 1982. All disability benefit and pay-related benefit due on those claims has been paid to him.  Payment on these claims was delayed due to the fact that the claimant delayed the submission of medical evidence. For instance, the first two claims were not received until after he had resumed work.</P>

      <P>Because of their critical financial position and heavy losses, NET have been engaged over the past 18 months in a series of rationalisation measures designed to improve their financial performance. Part of the rationalisation programme involves a detailed review &mdash; with the help of external consultants &mdash; of organisation structures and manning levels at the company's Arklow and Marino Point plants.</P>
      <P>Certain redundancies have already been put in train at the Arklow plant following consideration of a detailed consultancy report and consultations with the trade unions.  The consultants have recently separately reported in relation to the Marino Point plant.  The consultants' report has now been considered by the NET board and management have invited the trade unions to discuss the situation with them.  In addition, management have invited applications for voluntary redundancies from the work force.</P>
      <P>While redundancies at NET are most regrettable, I am advised that the company regard them as vital to help restore NET's viability and to bring plant manning levels more into line with NET's international competitors.</P>

      <P>On the basis of the original brief from the Department of Education a feasibility study was prepared in October 1981 by the Commissioners of Public Works for the provision on the existing site of two additional classrooms and a general purposes room at Ballinameela national school, County Waterford.  In January 1982 the Department of Education decided that four new classrooms and a general purposes room should be provided. The new proposals necessitated the acquisition of additional ground by the chairman of the board of management and he was given maps to assist him in the matter.  I understand that he expects to be able to acquire the additional land and in anticipation of the completion of that transaction the commissioners will prepare sketch plans at an early date.  There has been no undue delay in dealing with the case.</P>

      <P>The Government's decisions on the future of the Pigs and Bacon Commission were outlined in a press release issued on 30 March.  These decisions had been arrived at after full consultation by me with the Irish Bacon Curers' Society, Irish Farmers' Association and the Pigs and Bacon Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> They provided for the taking over by the State of responsibility for a deficit of the Pigs and Bacon Commission (PBC) then amounting to £5.6 million, as well as the cost of some redundant staff and certain pension rights of a number of retired staff of the commission.  The need for a restructuring of the present organisation arose from decisions of the European Court and the Irish Supreme Court which resulted in the PBC being no longer in a position to derive income from compulsory levies on bacon factories. Since 5 April all costs arising are the responsibility of the industry.</P>
    <P>Discussions now taking place between the various interests concerned in the industry are directed primarily at establishing a new organisational structure which will replace the present PBC and enable the industry to continue centralised exporting arrangements under the control of and fully financed by the industry itself.  These discussions will take full account of staff interests including their future employment but until the discussions have been concluded it is not possible to be more specific.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware of the present plight of the potato industry in Ireland, as a result of which we are headed for a situation in which we shall meet most of our potato needs by imports; and whether he will consider a proper marketing board to safeguard the interests of growers, distributors and consumers and thus bring about an orderly development of the industry.</P>

      <P>A proposal for a common market organisation for the potato sector has been made to the Council of Ministers by the EEC Commission and considerable progress has already been made towards its finalisation.  A major aim of the proposal is to help to stabilise the market and this is provided for by offering inducements for the setting up of producer groups and also by providing for withdrawal aids in times of surplus.  Any new marketing arrangement which we might introduce here would have to fit in with the form of common market organisation finally adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, it would have to allow for free imports of potatoes from other member states.  This latter requirement would present considerable difficulties for a marketing board of the classical type and so there has been a development in some areas where farmers are forming themselves into producer groups.  Pending the adoption of the common market organisation, <Col N="63" /> I would urge producers generally to follow this trend.  It should also be borne in mind that the best defence against imports of potatoes is to provide a steady supply of good quality potatoes which are properly presented and marketed.</P>

      <P>The Council regulation prescribes the installation and use of tachographs in the following vehicles: (a) goods vehicles which have a permissible maximum weight, including any trailer or semi-trailer, of more than 3.5 metric tons; and (b)  passenger vehicles, except those on regular services.</P>
      <P>Within these broad categories, the following are exempt from the EEC tachograph requirements for both national and international journeys: (1)  vehicles which in construction and equipment are suitable for carrying not more than nine persons including the driver and are intended for that purpose; (2)  vehicles used by the police, gendarmerie, armed forces, fire brigades, civil defence, drainage or flood prevention authorities, water, gas or electricity services, highway authorities and refuse collection, telegraph or telephone services, by the postal authorities for the carriage of mail, by radio or television services or for the detection of radio or television transmitters or receivers, or vehicles which are used by other public authorities for public services and which are not in competition with professional road hauliers; (3)  vehicles used for the carriage of sick or injured persons and for carrying rescue material, and any other specialised vehicles used for medical purposes; (4) tractors with a maximum authorised speed not exceeding 30 kilometres per hour; (5) tractors and other machines used exclusively for local agricultural and forestry work; (6)  vehicles used to transport circus and fun-fair equipment; (7) specialised breakdown vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the following vehicles are <Col N="69" /> exempt when operating within the State for the purposes stated: (i)  passenger vehicles which are constructed and equipped to carry not more than 15 persons including the driver; (ii)  vehicles undergoing local road tests for purposes of repair or maintainance; (iii)  vehicles transporting live animals from farms to local markets and vice versa, and vehicles transporting animal carcasses or waste not intended for human consumption; (iv) specialised vehicles used at local markets, for door-to-door selling, for mobile banking, exchange or savings transactions, for purposes of worship, for the lending of books, records or cassettes, for cultural events or mobile exhibitions.</P>

He accepted that some calls were made, including an operator assisted trunk call, which was made on 8 July 1981.  In the circumstances, the call charges for the period, which have been checked and found correct, have to be maintained. The matter will, however, be discussed further with him.</P>

      <P>The loss of telephone service in the area was due to the main cable being flooded.  The section of cable affected has been replaced and service restored. Because of the number of such faults which require attention by specially trained staff, I regret that there has been delay in repairing them.  A programme of preventive maintenance is in hands throughout the 01 area with a view to reducing the incidence of cable outages through flooding.  Given the many demands on the Department's resources however, it will be some time before the programme is completed.</P>

      <P>The acknowledgement card dated 29 April refers to the receipt of an inquiry form from the addressee.  The usual procedure in cases in which the Department's investigation fails to locate a missing registered letter includes the reasonable safeguard of a subsequent approach to the addressee for a formal denial of receipt.  The denial was obtained from the addressee by an out door inquiry officer on 28 June, and arrangements are being made to pay compensation of £100.26 (which includes a refund of 26p postage) to the sender.</P>

All these centres will be fully operational again in September.  A limited service is available at the Portlaoise centre.  The centre in Longford is fully operational.</P>
      <P>While regretting these closures I would like to point out that because of the additional allocation of £880,000 which I made available to the board last April it will be possible for the board to maintain all other elements of the community care programme at existing levels.</P>
      <P>I regret that I have no funds at my disposal from which I can make direct grants to the voluntary committees. However, I understand that the additional funding which I allocated to the health board has enabled it to increase by 20 per cent the level of grant-aiding to voluntary organisations and committees providing meals, laundry and similar services for the elderly.  The Home Help Service has also been fully maintained and increased in some instances.</P>

      <P>Therapy programmes for patients within the hospital are carried out in the special industrial therapy unit and to a limited extent in the hospital wards depending on the needs and capabilities of the individuals concerned.  There are five staff employed in the industrial therapy unit and there are 413 nurses employed on the wards of the hospital. There are in addition a further nine education staff, six of whom are seconded from the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee who provide an input to ward therapy programmes as part of their duties.</P>
      <P>It is the health board's intention to expand the existing range of therapy programmes, particularly in the ward setting. This will be facilitated by the completion of certain adaptation works within the hospital in respect of which I have allocated capital funds.  Included in these works will be the creation of a special rehabilitation unit in units 23 and 23A which will serve primarily as a special training area for patients prior to their discharge into hostel accommodation within the community.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed old age contributory pension on 20 October 1981 but he had not then reached the prescribed age of 66 years for old age pension.  As he had, however, attained age 65 years on 13 May 1981 his claim <Col N="98" /> was accepted as a claim for retirement pension which is payable at that age.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of retirement pension requires the claimant to have 156 paid contributions since his entry into insurance.  As he had only a total of 117 paid contributions under the insurance number quoted by him, it was necessary to make inquiries with a view to ascertaining whether he had further contributions which would qualify him for pension.  On completion of these inquiries it was established that he had sufficient additional contributions to qualify him for a partial rate pension at the rate appropriate to an average of 25 contributions to his credit since his entry into insurance.</P>
      <P>A pension book containing orders valid for payment from 13 May 1982 issued to the designated post office on 24 June 1982 and he was notified accordingly.

On completion of the inquiries, in February 1982, injury benefit was authorised and an adjustment cheque for the period 9 to 21 February 1982 was issued to the claimant. An adjustment on the second injury benefit claim from 30 May to 8 August 1981, the date on which entitlement to injury benefit ceased on the expiration of 26 weeks from the date of the accident, was withheld against an overpayment of pay-related benefit in respect of the period 13 June to 6 October 1981.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for the receipt of old age contributory pension requires a person to have a yearly average of not less than 20 insurance contributions in order to qualify.  In the case of the person concerned the yearly average fell to be calculated over the 28 year period from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1981, the end of the contribution year immediately preceding the contribution year in which he attained pension age. The Department's records show that he had only 276 qualifying contributions during that period.

      <P>The person concerned who attained pension age on 16 May 1982, was awarded old age contributory pension at a partial rate, with effect from 21 May 1982.  One of the conditions for the receipt of old age contributory pension at the maximum rate requires a person to have a yearly average of not less than 48 contributions to qualify for pension.  The yearly average is calculated over the period from 1953 or year of entry into insurance, if later, to the end of the contribution year immediately preceding that in which pension age is attained.  The claimant's average fell to be calculated over the 29 year period from 1953 to 1981-82 and she had a total of 786 qualifying contributions in that period.  This gave her a yearly average of 27 contributions and the rate of pension appropriate to this average is £37.80 a week. The maximum rate is £40.25 which is payable to claimants with a yearly average of 48 or more contributions.</P>
      <P>A pension book containing orders payable from 28 May 1982 issued to the designated post office on 24 May 1982 for collection by the claimant.

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of pension at a reduced rate since 1 December 1977.  Because of annual increases in his American social security pension from the date he was first awarded non-contributory old age pension, a question for reduction of his old age pension is being raised and will be referred to the local pension committee for decision.  A pension order book at the reduced rate of £14.45 a week plus £7.30 adult dependant allowance has been issued to him pending the decision of the pension committee.  If he is dissatisfied with the decision of the pension committee he will have the right of appeal against it.</P>

      <P>The person concerned, whose husband died on 23 November 1967, made two applications for widow's non-contributory pension in 1968 and 1978. Both applications were refused as her means were in excess of the statutory limit for receipt of pension by a widow with no qualified children.  She again claimed widow's pension in May 1982. <Col N="122" /> The local officer who is investigating the claim reported that he had made several calls to the widow's home but she was not there.  On his most recent visit he left a message requesting her to contact him. As soon as she does so her circumstances will be investigated, following which a decision on her claim will be given without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned attained pension age on 28 March 1982 and claimed old age contributory pension from the Department.  One of the conditions for the receipt of old age contributory pension requires a person to have a yearly average of not less than 20 contributions in order to qualify.  The yearly average is calculated over the period from 5 January 1953 in the case of the person concerned, to the end of the contribution year immediately preceding that in which pension age is attained.  The claimant had aa total of 481 contributions in the 28 year period from 1953 to 1980-81. As this is equivalent to a yearly average of only 17 contributions the claimant did not qualify on this record.  A social welfare officer has been asked to investigate the gaps in the claimant's insurance record tp ascertain if he had any further periods of insurable employment which might enable him to qualify for the pension.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the claimant has been awarded a non-contributory old age pension at the rate of £14.45 per week plus an additional £7.30 a week adult dependant allowance.  A pension book containing orders valid for payment from 16 April 1982 was issued on 31 May 1982 to the designated post office and the claimant was notified accordingly.  A payable order in respect of the arrears due for the period 2 April to 15 April 1982 was issued direct to him on 23 June 1982.</P>

Pending inquiries regarding the nature and origin of the incapacity disability benefit was authorised from 20 May 1982, fourth day of incapacity.  Payment was made at the maximum rate appropriate to a single person as a claim form for increases in respect of dependants was not submitted by the claimant.  Pay-related benefit was also authorised from 31 May 1982, thirteenth day of incapacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A medical certificate received on 3 June 1982 indicated that the claimant was in hospital and in accordance with normal practice in relation to single persons in such instances he was requested to furnish the address to which his cheques should be sent while he remained in hospital. <Col N="125" /> A reply was received on 15 June 1982 and further cheques issued to him.</P>
    <P>Further inquiries have revealed that the claimant is a married man with four dependant children.  The claim has accordingly been reviewed and arrears of disability benefit and pay-related benefit due to 26 June 1982, less supplementary welfare allowance advanced, have now issued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>When housing authorities were asked in January 1980, to assess the nature and extent of accumulated and prospective housing requirements in their areas in the period up to 1985, they were also requested to indicate separately the estimated requirements for housing to cater for the needs of physically handicapped persons.  The results of these assessments, which are being analysed by my Department, will form the basis for the White Paper on Housing which I propose to publish around the end of this year.  I have also received a submission from the Irish Wheelchair Association, the proposals in which are being examined in conjunction with submissions from other interested parties in the context of the preparation of the White Paper.  It will deal, <i>inter alia</i>, with future housing policy for the physically handicapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable effort is being made at present in providing suitable housing for the physically handicapped by means of a variety of approaches.  As Deputies are aware, responsibility for the provision of housing accommodation for person who are in need of rehousing and unable to provide it from their own resources rest <Col N="135" /> with housing authorities, who are encouraged by my Department to provide appropriate and suitable housing accommodation for the physically handicapped according as the need arises. Decisions and action on the form of housing accommodation to be provided in these cases are primarily matters for the housing authorities concerned in the light of the local housing requirements.  Such housing requirements are met by either the provision of specially designed housing units or by the adaptation of existing dwellings.  In recent years, the total number of new local authority dwellings so provided or adapted has been approximately 1 per cent of total local authority housing completions.</P>
    <P>A grant may also be paid by housing authorities for the provision of an additional room or chalet or for the carrying out of other structural works that in the opinion of the authority are reasonably necessary for the proper accommodation of a physically disabled, severely mentally handicapped or severely mentally ill person.  The Department recoup half of the cost incurred by the housing authority, subject to a recoupment limit in any case of £2,000.  In April 1981 I raised the limit of recoupment from £1,200 to £2,000 in the Housing Package, 1981.</P>
    <P>Voluntary housing associations are also encouraged to provide housing accommodation for the physically handicapped with the aid of a package of financial assistance embracing loan, grant and subsidy.  I also announced improvements in the scope of these incentives in the Housing Package, 1981.</P>

    <P>Last year, following agreement with staff representatives on the design of a new uniform for female prison officers, it was decided that the new uniforms should be introduced and appropriate arrangements were made with post office stores.  Despite efforts by my Department and by post office stores to speed up supplies, delays occurred.  There tend to <Col N="147" /> be difficulties where tenders involve new specifications.</P>
    <P>Delays in supplies of items of the new uniform led to female prison officers choosing a dramatic form of protest: all refused to wear their uniforms from 1 April 1982.</P>
    <P>The present position is that all items of the new uniform bar the overcoats and caps are available but female prison officers continue to refuse to wear any uniform until complete sets of all the items are available.  Of the total of 69 female officers only 19 are due replacement overcoats in accordance with the agreed arrangements and many officers do not apply for new caps for years on end even though they are entitled to apply every year.</P>

Accordingly, there was no reduction in Garda strength between the two dates in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of increasing Garda foot patrols in the Dundalk area, the position is that the precise arrangements made for the allocation of manpower between foot patrols and other duties in any particular area are matters for the Garda officers concerned.  The Garda authorities report that in the case of Dundalk the local Garda officers are not in a position to increase the level of foot patrolling at present, having regard to the current strength of the station party and other demands on Garda services in the area, but the matter will be reviewed <Col N="149" /> as soon as extra manpower becomes available for assignment to the centre.</P>
