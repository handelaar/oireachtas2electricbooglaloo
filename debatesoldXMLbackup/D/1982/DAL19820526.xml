      <P>Under section 11 of the Principal Act, a company limited by guarantee and not having a share capital must register articles of association.  Section 16 (b) of the Principal Act provides that articles for such a company must be in accordance with the form set out in Table C in the First Schedule or as near thereto as circumstances permit.  In contrast, section <Col N="4" /> 13 provides that if a company limited by shares do not register any articles of their own or if they register articles which do not exclude or modify the regulations in Table A, those regulations will apply to the company as if they were contained in duly registered articles.  The proposed amendment would give a company limited by guarantee and not having share capital the option of not registering articles of association, an option enjoyed by companies limited by shares.  In that case under the provisions of section 14 of this Bill the regulations in Table C will automatically and without further formality become the articles of association of the company in the same manner as described in Table A applying to companies limited by shares.</P>

      <P>There is a question here concerning the address of a company's registered office.  Very often all that appears in the returns is possibly the name of the townland or of a street but with no number given.  There should be an obligation on a company to register their main office for the purpose of facilitating the service of documents.  Very often the registered office may be given as a solicitor's or an accountant's address while in the same town or city the company may have their principal trading place at a different address.  There is an assumption frequently that the main trading place is the registered office and documents tend to be served there.  As this is a technical fault which can be taken advantage of in proceedings, perhaps the Minister would consider some tightening of the obligation with regard to strict notification of a company's registered office.  Perhaps the Minister would even consider imposing an obligation that the registered office should be at the main place of trading.</P>

      <P>Subsections (6) and (7) of section 195 of the Principal Act provide <Col N="5" /><i>inter alia</i> that the particulars of the first director and secretary of a company should be sent to the registrar of companies within 14 days of appointment.  In many cases this provision is ignored and a large proportion, up to half, of newly-registered companies fail to forward the particulars within 14 days.  In an effort to redress this situation and to reduce the work involved in pursuing newly-registered companies who fail to provide the requirements, it is proposed in this section to provide before incorporation for the delivery of particulars of directors and secretaries to the Registration of Companies Office.</P>
      <P>Assigned consent to act as director or secretary is also provided for.  This is a new requirement.  Similarly, the period of 14 days allowed by section 113 of the Principal Act for notification of a registered office is being largely ignored and that information will also be required before incorporation.</P>
      <P>On the Deputy's point that the principal place of business should also be the registered office, there is an argument for that certainly but it might create some problems in the sense that the formalities that need to be complied with might more easily be complied with at the registrar's office rather than at the place of business where frequently nowadays the secretary of a company is often an incorporated entity formed by accountants, or people like that, for the purpose of carrying out the secretarial work of companies.  While in many cases I do not think it would create any problem I believe it would in a number of companies.  I should like to think about the matter before I commit myself to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 5, to insert the following section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;Section 114 (1) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion <Col N="6" /> after paragraph (c) of the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>`(d)  notice of the issue of debentures of a company shall be mentioned in all of the said company's documents referred to in paragraph (c) of this section.'.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide that where a company have issued a debenture particulars of that fact should be noted on all letters, papers, invoices and documents of that company.  As we know, a debenture is a mortgage of all the assets of that company and it is a potentially serious matter for a member of the public having dealings with a company where such a debenture exists.  A likely result of that in the event of a debenture being called in by the bank, or whatever other institution would hold it, is that a person entering into that business with the company could find himself at the loss of his money or at the loss of owing money to him by the company. That happens often.  I am aware that there is an obligation on the company to register particulars of the debenture in the Companies' office and that it is open to any person to go down to the Companies Office to see if there is a mortgage by the company.  However, the reality of the situation is that the average member of the public is unlikely to do that.  It is most unlikely that he would be aware that he could go down to the Companies Office and make a search to see whether or not the company had mortgaged their entire property to some financial institution or whatever.</P>
    <P>It would be some help if a company were obligated to put on all its papers particulars of the fact that a mortgage debenture existed.  In other words, if a person wanted to do a deal with such a company, a building company where he would be putting a deposit on a house, he would see from the papers of that company that the company had issued a mortgage debenture over their assets. Companies are already obliged by law to put certain information on all their papers and documentation, things like the situation of the registered office, particulars of the directors and the registered <Col N="7" /> number.  Our amendment proposes to add one further important item, from the point of view of members of the public, to the details and particulars that a company would be obliged to specify on all documentation.  That in many cases might bring to the notice of members of the public who are about to have dealings with the company the fact that danger was looming ahead of them in their dealings with that company and the fact that somebody else had a mortgage ahead of them so that in the event of something going wrong with the company they could be in danger of suffering serious losses. The intent of compelling the company to register the mortgage at the Companies Office is directed towards the same purpose but this would provide an additional safeguard to that end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. There is no doubt that there is an extraordinary degree of naivety in the minds of many persons dealing with limited companies.  People seem to have the impression that because one establishes a company and proceeds to produce rather glossy and well-designed notepaper and seems to enter into industrial or commercial activity that, automatically, one has some divine protection under law.  In the performance of ones work as a public representative one never ceases to be amazed at the number of individuals and trading companies who are caught in this situation.  Our amendment would be a salutary reminder to the public in their company dealings that debentures should be clearly indicated on company documents. It would be a forewarning to persons of the extent to which the company have other commitments.  It is a basic suggestion and one which I believe will appear extensively in company law in the years ahead.  We commend the amendment to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the considerations which lie behind the proposing of the amendment.  I will explain the reasons why I believe the amendment must be rejected but I undertake to examine carefully those considerations <Col N="8" /> and any other measures which would put an end to the various forms of abuse. They will be included in the Bill which I already mentioned will deal with domestic as opposed to EEC issues.  The notice which will be required by the amendment will impose an impossible burden.  It is not practicable to give that information on documents such as cheques and invoices as required by section 114 (1) (c).  As Deputy Taylor recognises not everyone understands the meaning and relevance of a debenture.  The Principal Act requires that a debenture and charges be registered at the Companies Registration Office or otherwise they are void against the liquidator and any creditor. In those circumstances these charges will always be promptly registered and be available for inspection at the Companies Registration Office.</P>
      <P>I should like to expand a little on the impracticability of the proposal as I see it.  It would be necessary to print on each cheque and invoice the existence of and the broad nature of the amount of a debenture.  A company might change their debenture a number of times within a year and it would be impossible to expect a company to comply with that. There is the other point that a mortgage, either equitable or legal, by the company would have to all intents and purposes as far as a creditor is concerned the same effect in financial terms but if the mortgage were not registered as a debeture there would not be an obligation under this amendment, if it was passed.  That would seriously mislead creditors or others. The net effect of it would be that people would engage in mortgages rather than in debentures.  The value of the point of the amendment would then be lost.  The real problem is the physical one of printing details of debentures on documents of the kind mentioned of which a company might issue tens of thousands in the course of a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they issue thousands of such documents but the point is that they are all printed.  I cannot see that there should be any problem.  When they give in their printing order that fact should be printed on them.  Their invoices <Col N="9" /> and cheques are printed anyway.  We are not asking that the amount of the debenture should be specified but only that notice should be given of the issue of the debenture, the fact that this is a company which is tainted by the fact that a debenture has issued.</P>
      <P>The Minister made reference to a mortgage.  Certainly a mortgage bears some similarity to a debenture but there is the very keen difference in that a mortgage is directed to a specific asset of a company whereas a debenture normally takes the form of a floating charge over the entire assets of the company.  This puts a debenture into a different category from a mortgage.</P>
      <P>This is a very reasonable amendment and I do not see that it would put any undue burden on a company.  Letterheads and cheques are printed by the company anyway and what increased difficulty would it present to the company when complying with their obligations under section 114 of the main Act to add a further sentence to the effect that they have issued a debenture?  This would be a protection to the public and would involve no great problem for the company. The intent is that the public should know about these things and that is why details must be registered in the Companies Office.  Why not have a slightly wider dispersal of this very crucial information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the public will not go to the Companies Office to find out if there is a floating charge in existence on a company from whom they wish to purchase a house.  We have recently seen some examples of hefty liquidations and receiverships. An unfortunate member of the public who has paid a deposit on a house may find that a receiver has been put in by a financial institution.  These institutions look after their own interests and do searches before they part with any money.  The unfortunate purchaser finds that he is committed to a certain company in the important matter of buying a house but the transaction has been put into a state of limbo.  He cannot sue or get his money back while the receiver is in full charge of all the property of the company. That is the effect of the debenture. <Col N="10" /> The receiver takes full control and calls in whatever money is due but he operates the company with only one objective: to secure the money for the bank which put him in.  It usually is a bank who take this action.  Receiverships can go on for very many years and in the meantime the unfortunate person who paid a deposit on a house in ignorance of the fact that the company had mortgaged their entire assets to a bank finds himself at a loss when finally the bank have taken whatever assests exist.  He never knew that the debenture existed.</P>
    <P>Why not avail of this very simple expedient of making it obligatory to give the widest possible publicity by companies to the fact that they have issued a debenture? A person should see on printed documents issued by a company that a debenture has been issued so that he can find out what this means.  It should be drawn to the attention of the public in printed documentation that a company have this taint.  This is a reasonable request.  The average citizen knows little enough about these matters.  Why not, at no cost at all to the company, give this additional possible protection?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would apply not only to building companies but to trading companies or any types of companies. I agree that in many cases it might not help but it would focus the mind of a person about to deal with a company.  A person could be impressed by the assets of a company and conclude that he would be perfectly safe in entering into business commitments with the company.  However, that could be very far from the truth.  The company could have assets of <Col N="11" /> £1 million and debts of £1.5 million owing on the debenture.  If the person about to deal with the company spotted the fact that a debenture had been issued he might find out that the company had mortgaged their entire property to a bank and that in the event of anything going wrong with the company the bank would have first call on the entire assets.  There could be cases where it would help members of the public to know that a debenture had been issued.  All that is required is that the company make an additional provision when doing their printing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Irish Distillers and other leading industrial companies have all issued debentures.  I do not accept Deputy Taylor's use of the word &ldquo;taint&rdquo; or that a company which has issued a debenture is tainted in some fashion. What possible advantage is it to a member of the public to say that he will not deal with Smurfits because they have issued a debenture?  I am not certain that they have issued a debenture but I would be surprised if it were not so.  Is that person to go to Smurfits and say that Deputy Taylor warned him at a certain column in the Official Report of 26 May that he should not deal with them because they had issued a debenture?</P>

      <P>I do not think that any great advantage would have accrued to <Col N="12" /> anybody dealing with the people concerned. I would have thought that anyone seriously dealing with them would have looked at the file in the Companies Office.  It would be amazing if Gallaghers did not have any debentures in existence because it is unlikely that any other building company or similar type of company would not have debentures.  With regard to the point that it is not a problem to print this on cheques and so on, that may well be the case; but if the debentures change a month later will all the cheques and invoices that have been printed have to be withdrawn because of the change in the nature of the debentures?  I am afraid this is not really practicable and would not be of any value to the public.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned he has a Bill to deal with matters that are raised domestically as needing reform in our company law code.  I do not know if this is the section on which to mention this, but I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the need to impose an obligation on a person who transforms his private business into a private limited company so that the change in status would be formally notified to the customers and that without such formal notification of change of status the personal liability of the promoter would continue. People set up private companies using their personal name and add the word Limited and the creditors find they are presented with an insolvent corporated company having thought they had been dealing with a private individual.  I think that loophole should be plugged. The Minister should give consideration to it by the appropriate legislation, whether by way of further amendment to this Bill or in another Bill.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 is in the name of Deputy Taylor, Deputy Desmond and Deputy Ryan.  Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are related and amendment No. 10 is consequential. Amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 10 will be taken together for discussion by agreement.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 9, paragraph (a), line 17, to delete &ldquo;employees.';&rdquo; and substitute the following: &ldquo;employees;</P>
      <P>(j)  any amounts (including costs) due to a person who paid a deposit to the company in respect of a new house;&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>The purport of the amendment is two-fold. First, it identifies certain categories of persons having dealings with companies and, in the event of certain transactions, gives a preferential right to those persons because of the special situation that arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first is in the case of a person who has paid a deposit to a company in respect of a new house.  This was highlighted by recent unfortunate receiverships and liquidations by building companies.  The amendment provides that, where a person has paid a deposit on a new house to such a company and where that company goes into liquidation the deposit held by that company would rank as a preferential debt by the company in liquidation to <Col N="14" /> the person who paid the deposit on the new house.  The intent is that such a person would thereby be given a higher chance of recouping the money paid as a deposit.</P>
    <P>We know it is a great struggle, particularly for young people, to put together the money needed for a deposit on a new house.  The cost of building land and houses has escalated considerably, loans are difficult to get and the amount of deposit required is high relative to the cost of the house and people's incomes. It is an appalling thought that a young couple having struggled for many years to put together the money for a deposit then find that they lose their deposit when the company goes into liquidation.  In many cases that would mean the complete end of any possibility such a couple would have of being able to raise a deposit to set up a home for themselves and their families.  That is the first category of special case we identified as suitable to be dealt with as a preferential situation.</P>
    <P>The second refers to a case where a company has given a guarantee or indemnity in respect of a new house to remedy defects in that house.  It is standard practice when a new house is sold that the building company or developers who sell the house give a guarantee they will remedy all defects that become obvious within a fixed period &mdash; sometimes one year, sometimes 18 months or two years.  This is apart from the guarantee scheme of the national house-builders which covers certain structural defects of a limited nature.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that, in the event of a company going into liquidation during the period when the guarantee against defects was still in force, that money would become payable to the unfortunate buyer of the house and would be dealt with as a preferential payment. Some defects can be very serious. Unfortunately, defects in new houses are all too common and sometimes quite substantial sums of money are payable by building companies to purchasers of new houses within the first year or two of purchase.  The purport of the amendment would be that payments becoming due <Col N="15" /> under this category would be dealt with as preferential.</P>
    <P>The third category is different.  It deals with the situation where a guarantee has been given by a company which sold goods to a purchaser acting as a consumer. It has always been recongnised that a consumer, the person who buys for retail for his own personal use, requires a special degree of protection and that was recognised in the Sale of Goods and Supplies of Services Act, 1980, which defines a consumer.  This could apply to sales of television sets, cars and any goods.  We know that companies selling such goods on occasion give guarantees against defects arising within a certain period.  The purport of the amendment would be that moneys becoming payable under such a guarantee would be dealt with as preferential.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 is, advisedly, a new departure.  It would provide that where a guarantee was given in respect of defects in a new house or where a deposit was paid on a new house or in respect of goods purchased there would be a liability element on the people who were directors of that company at the time the deposit was paid or at the time the guarantees were given.  It seems to me entirely wrong that by means of the device of limited liability in companies the directors, in all cases, should be enabled to escape entirely all personal responsibility for matters with which they were concerned or should have been actively concerned and have had knowledge of that the time they entered into the transactions.  I would say &mdash; and this is the purport of the amendment &mdash; that in the case of a person who puts a deposit on a new house and finds himself at a loss when the company go into liquidation at a later date and that deposit money is passed into the hands of that company notwithstanding the preferential provision that would be accorded by the amendment, the people who were directors of that company at the time the deposit was paid are liable to recoup the losses to the person who paid the deposit on that new house.</P>
    <P>It highlights a situation that arises with <Col N="16" /> companies very often, including building and development companies.  That is the practice of bringing onto company boards what might be described, for want of a better word, as &ldquo;gentlemen&rdquo; directors. By that I mean people who have no direct involvement with the affairs of that company but who are brought in for prestige purposes, to give colour.  People will look to see who they are going to deal with, who the directors of this company are, and they will see some very well known names and get the idea that by reason of the fact that such a well known person was a director of the company it would have an air of respectability that in many cases might not be warranted by the affairs of that company.  This is a habit that has been increasing.  People who have very little, if any, involvement with the day to day affairs of the company or even any knowledge of the actualities of the running of that company or its financial position, will accept appointments as directors for the sake of a director's fee to be paid annually for little trouble.  That is all right as far as it goes, but anybody who allows that to be done with his name for that purpose should carry some measure of responsibility in return for getting a director's fee for little or no effort; he should have some responsibility.  The amendment we are proposing would bring that about by making that director, in common with the other working directors of the company, personally liable.  In the event of a building company going into liquidation and a person having paid the deposit being at the loss of it the director would be liable.  The same applies to the other two categories, namely, a company that has given guarantees in respect of defects in a house or a guarantee in respect of goods.  When such a guarantee is given the people who are directors either know or should know what the financial situation of the company is and what the prospects are and if they proceed to lend their name to the company and give out these guarantees they should have a personal responsibility in such situation.</P>
    <P>Those are three categories that we identified as warranting cutting back to some small extent the blanket indemnity <Col N="17" /> that directors otherwise have when a company goes into liquidation.  At present they are enabled to wash their hands of liability to unfortunate people who very often incur quite substantial losses arising from company liquidation.  When they enter into these commitments then, in these limited cases at least, they should carry a personal responsibility.  I do not say that the three cases we have identified are in any way exhaustive of special cases that might arise where personal liability should attach to directors notwithstanding the fact that the company has gone into liquidation.  There are probably others that would be equally deserving and perhaps could be examined at a later date, but these three examples require special protection above the normal &mdash; the defenceless position of a person putting a deposit on a new house, a person who having bought a new house and having got a guarantee in respect of defects finds that because the company goes into liquidation he has to carry that heavy loss himself, and the consumer buying goods who finds the guarantee in respect of the goods is worthless because of a company going into liquidation.  The amendment would have the effect of enabling such people to go after the directors who either knew or should have known about the position when they entered into those commitments.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with what Deputy Taylor proposes here.  Of course there is the dilemma that if this were to be acceded to in his terms, the whole basis of incorporation would be seriously, possibly fatally, damaged.  There are still theoretical arguments to justify incorporation. But I would strongly urge the Minister to consider the abuse which this amendment pinpoints of people who use the device of incorporation to evade what should be personal liability.  There has been more and more of that in recent times.  It is difficult to deal with such people without infringing the principle of incorporation and the fact that it obviates any personal liability.  But it is something that we have to look at.  There is a dilemma in the way the use of incorporation has developed in recent times. <Col N="18" /> There is a problem that we have to try to solve and at the same time escape from the dilemma.</P>
      <P>There are further considerations arising out of this amendment.  One must have total sympathy with it and for the type of person that the amendment seeks to protect.  But we must not lose sight of the plight of the general creditors of a company that is in difficulty, the people who provide the wherewithal for the company to trade, the people who sell goods in good faith and who could have a substantial amount of business and who now because of the emergence of more and more preferential creditors find themselves further and further down the field and possibly out of court altogether. We are inclined to lose sympathy for the commercial creditors.  If there were not people prepared to give commercial credit trade just could not carry on and more and more people are now giving credit on the basis of this retention of title clause and that will also affect winding up.</P>
      <P>I just make the plea that while we are right to show preference for all the people that the Bill provides for and that the amendment provides for, let us not forget the poor unfortunate trade creditor who gives the means of trading to the company in the first instance.</P>

      <P>As a matter of general information I would preface my remarks on these four amendments by pointing out that the question of preferential payments normally arises only where the asset position of the company being wound up is precarious and the company are unable to meet their debts and obligations in full.  In this situation it is clear that employees are best protected by keeping the list of preferential aims as short as possible.  If one were to include, for example, as suggested in amendment No. 2, a deposit on a house, there would appear to be no valid reason why deposits on various other goods and services should not be included and the preferential list would then be endless.  As a general rule the preferential payments in a winding up are confined to employees and the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we can ever exclude the State; it impinges more than ever as time passes.</P>
      <P>On amendment No. 3 the argument against the previous amendment &mdash; that is, keeping the preferential payments list short as to the advantage of employees &mdash; holds with equal force against this amendment.  Moreover, there is the difficulty inherent in this amendment of trying to get preferential status for indeterminate amounts at indeterminate times.  For example, the winding up of a building company, which is involved here, could properly take place after, say, two years of a five year guarantee.  At that time no defect might appear in the house and the other problems referred to in the amendment might not have arisen.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 would represent an extremely long extension of the preferential list because the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act embraces everybody who buys goods or services for private use and consumption.  This would be extremely disadvantageous to employees, whom section 285 in many respects seeks to protect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 must be rejected because section 297 of the Principal Act already provides that the court, on the application of the liquidator or any creditor, may declare that any persons who were knowingly parties to the carrying on of the business in a manner intended to defraud creditors shall be personally responsible without any limitation of liability for all or any of the debts or other liabilities of the company.  That section, which I had not adverted to when Deputy Cooney made the point on an earlier section, may cover the point he made about non-disclosure by a former sole trader of his transformation into an incorporated company.  It appears that under section 297 if he failed to disclose the fact of his incorporation he would continue to be liable on a personal basis.  This amendment raises the general question of limited liability.  While I understand clearly <Col N="20" /> the reasons which gave rise to it, I suggest it is inappropriate to deal with such a fundamental matter by way of an amendment to this short Bill.</P>
    <P>I am only too well aware that there have been abuses by certain companies, but it is necessary to take a broad view and to recognise that entities with limited liability have been the means by which considerable economic and commercial development and social progress have taken place and whereby much employment has been provided.  This progress and employment would not have been provided without the concept and benefit of limited liability.  In general the good outweighs the bad.  As I indicated, I will be trying hard to introduce as soon as possible a Bill dealing with such issues &mdash; measures designed to prevent or eliminate abuses and evasion of responsibility in the general operation of companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments, particularly amendment No. 2.  Time and again I have met many constituents who paid deposits to construction companies for new dwellings and their lives have been destroyed because the company went into liquidation and there was no way their deposits could be returned.  It is not anti-industrial, anti-economic or anti-social development to suggest that anybody who establishes a company and takes a deposit, which nowadays can be for a substantial amount, should do all in his power to ensure that if his company goes into liquidation people will have their deposits refunded.  Very often these people have very little hope of starting again once they have lost their deposits. It is possible that the wife may have started to work a number of years to help save the deposit.  They may then have started a family and if they lose their deposits they will not have any hope of saving such a substantial sum a second time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view this simple amendment is of major social importance.  It should have not just the understanding and sympathy of the Minister, he should bite the bullet and accept it.  If construction and development companies find it excessively penal, it could be subsequently <Col N="21" /> amended.  At this time we should give this matter a priority rating and ensure that when companies, or their legal advisers, accept deposits they know exactly what they are doing and the extent to which they will be liable.  In this way basic protection will be given to the people who pay these deposits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the good outweighing the bad.  I do not think it is a case where we have to choose between the good and the bad: in my view it is a case where we take the good, tone it down a bit and restrict the blanket immunity of limited liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the section dealing with fraud but, as he rightly pointed out on Second Stage, it is extremely difficult to prove fraud and it only in very exceptional cases that that could be done.  What we are doing here is making a small inroad into the overall principle of limited liability, but the time has come to do that.  The law is a developing process and attitudes to it change. The whole idea of limited liability as I said on Second Stage culminating at the turn of the century in the Companies Act of 1908, has operated on a more or less blanket basis up to now.  Now is the time for some evolution in the existing blanket limited liability.  In many cases a person having dealt with a company loses money as a result of having paid a deposit on a new house.  The company then goes into liquidation but in six or nine months time or a year the directors who, as far as he is concerned, took his money are back in business, still carrying on millionaire transactions.  The Minister referred to examples in his contribution on Second Stage.  It is very annoying and happens all the time.  That blanket freedom of liability of directors should be curtailed. Where they have substantial personal assets, in many cases amounting to huge sums of money, those assets should be used to pay back casual members of the public who have deposited money with them for a new house, or for whose house these directors are liable regarding defects in the sale.  It is entirely wrong, inequitable and unjust that such directors, having put their company into liquidation, <Col N="22" /> thereby causing members of the public to lose their savings in this way should then be in a position, as a result of using their personal assets which will have come, in most cases, from the company being put into liquidation, to set up very substantial businesses in a relatively short space of time.  It is time something was done about that affront and insult and the opportunity presents itself in this Bill.  The three cases isolated here as being appropriate warrant such care, consideration and protection of people in those weak situations.  Firstly, there is the young couple who have put down a deposit on a new house, having struggled hard for many years to amass that deposit.  There is a responsibility on the Oireachtas to ensure their maximum possible protection in the event of a company being liquidated; they should be considered preferential and there should be a carry-over of a personal responsibility on the part of directors to make good their financial loss.  Likewise, people who bought a new house and find it defective should be similarly protected.</P>
    <P>This highlights the situation prevailing in company groups.  One company make good profits and formulate groups of companies.  At their discretion, they liquidate one company and carry on another.  The person having dealings with the liquidated company may suffer heavy financial losses and be affronted by seeing other companies in the same groups carrying on a booming business.  People who have been employees of the liquidated company will also suffer very considerably. A matter which should be considered at some stage is that of inter-liability for companies in a group.  This is not touched on in the present amendments. The time has come to cut back on the blanket absolution, the immunity which directors have had up to now.  These are three classic cases of people in a weak financial position who need protection on a preferential basis and the right to claim against the personal assets of directors who were involved with the company which took their money.</P>

      <P>The section to which the Deputy is now referring is section 184, not section 297.  I dealt for five or ten minutes with some aspects of section 297.  One can only get a Committee Stage to work if there is interplay.  There is no point in making speeches which do not take account of what has just been said. Basically, because Deputy Taylor made essentially the same speech on Committee Stage as on Second Stage, all I can do is repeat what I said the first time, which is rather pointless.  The Deputy is very hung up on builders and I can quite see why.  There have been tremendous abuses in the past and they are still going on.  There is no doubt about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>One reason is that the amendments relate to a winding-up situation, meaning that the company is wound up for reasons of insolvency.  The builders, to whom the Deputy properly objects &mdash; and I equally vehemently object to their actions &mdash; in the meantime, having handed the company over <Col N="24" /> to the liquidators, have gone into the next field to build more houses under a new name.  It is immaterial to the builders in what order the creditors should be paid, or if they are ever to be paid.  The particular point I wish to make to Mr. Taylor, which he does not realise, is that if those amendments were accepted, it would enormously increase the length of preferential creditors under section 285.  The main losers by lengthening that list are the employees.  These four amendments would very seriously damage the interests of the employees.  I ask Deputy Taylor to accept that, in the interests of the employees, I will have to resist these amendments, if for no other reason than that.  That is, as I have tried to explain, the supervening reason.  If there are going to be virtually endless preferential creditors, the existing preferential creditors under the 1963 Act will have their position considerably weakened.  They will stand <i>pari passu</i> with all those on the new list of preferential creditors introduced under these amendments.</P>
      <P>The other point I wish to make is, in simple terms, that there has been a lot of emphasis on guarantees and indemnities by builders for improvements to sewers, footpaths and the like.  I believe it is not uncommon to have an indemnity of that kind lasting for five years.  If a building company is being wound up it will not be possible for the liquidator to wind it up and make preferential payments, let alone non-preferential payments, in under five years.  He will have to wait to see whether indemnities are called in at the end of the indemnity period.  If he were to make payment before he had ascertained his liability under these amendments, at the end of the indemnity period he would be in default and the liquidator would become personally liable to reimburse the preferential creditors. The effect of that would be that he would not pay employees' wages due to them until at least five years had expired. This is another example of the damage that would be done to employees by this series of amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the Deputy's point fully, but the point I am trying to make to him is that you do not make amendments of this <Col N="25" /> kind to a section dealing with preferential creditors.  It has to be done in a more fundamental way in relation to the control of the abuses of limited liability.  I accept fully that there are the abuses he talks about, but this is not the way to deal with them.  You do not cure those abuses by damaging seriously the interests of the employees or former employees of a wound-up company.  That would be the practical effect here.</P>
    <P>As drafted, his amendments are loose in practical terms.  It would be possible, for example, for a company going into liquidation deliberately to put down an enormous deposit on one of their own houses with their own money, and become a preferential creditor for that amount, and ensure that all the ordinary creditors got nothing.  In particular the Deputy will have to look also at the provisions of section 297 which get round more of the problem he talks about than he realises.  I do not think section 297 is not workable.  It is not worked enough. Sufficient applications are not made to he courts under it.  Perhaps that is the greatest difficulty.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate the Deputy's anxiety and concern.  I have been looking in some depth at activities in a certain part of suburban Dublin in the past week or two. I noticed, for example, that in some suburbs of Dublin the same people who built houses on one road are building a new set of houses up the road but as a different company.  There is no indication that they necessarily have gone into liquidation on the first stage but, strangely enough, the second stage of the development is being carried out by the same company with a different name.  I ask myself why.  It may be done for tax reasons.  It may be done for some technical reasons which do not appear obvious to me at first sight.  Basically people like Deputy Taylor and myself are entitled to be suspicious about why they are doing that.</P>
    <P>Normally somebody who is trading, if he is trading reasonably successfully, will and should continue to trade as the same company.  One is entitled to ask why they do that type of thing.  Undoubtedly, it must be enormously aggravating for people who have paid a deposit and lost <Col N="26" /> their money to see the same builders abusing the privilege of limited liability. This House will cure that, but we cannot cure it by way of amendments to a section which set out lists of preferential creditors. We can do it only by a more fundamental approach, particularly as we would seriously damage the existing preferential creditors, primarily the employees, if we did it this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to defects in indemnities existing for five years.  That may be, although I have never come across one which existed for as long as that.  The longest such indemnity I have ever come across in the course of my experience lasted for two years. The whole effort of builders and developers in this day and age is to cut down the period as far as possible.  It is very rare today to get one for as long as two years.  An 18 months or 12 months period is more the order of the day now.  I have never come across one of five years in length.  I do not think that point holds water because liquidations are not the quickest things either.  In the normal course they run on for some years before the companies are wound up.  In his last contribution, the Minister did not advert to amendment No. 10 which we are also discussing.</P>

      <P>That is the amendment which would put personal liability in these limited cases on to the directors.  I take his point about adding on a deposit on a new house to the list of the amount owed to preferential creditors.  I have no wish in any way to make inroads into wages or salaries owing to employees, or to affect what their rights should be, or what they should get out of that company. The question of personal liability of directors for those wages and salaries could be considered at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is reasonable that the person who has paid the deposit should rank as preferential. In most cases that money would have been put into the company fairly recently before the company went into liquidation.  There would not have been <Col N="27" /> a long gap in most cases between the paying of the deposit and the liquidation. They paid that money into the company and, therefore, the position of the employees would not be altered that much, or at all indeed, from what it would have been before the deposit was paid in.</P>
    <P>The whole concept of a perferential claim is that there are certain specialised cases which require special treatment or consideration over and above the general body of creditors.  Employees are regarded as preferential.  They are in a special situation.  The purport of the amendments is that there are certain other limited categories which, by reason of the weakness of the position in setting about their dealings with the company, should likewise be regarded as preferential. <Col N="28" /> Where their money went into the company in most cases in recent times, as I have said, the fact that that money was put in and would come back to them on a preferential basis would not reduce to any appreciable extent the money the employees would get on the distribution dealing with their wages.  Nonetheless they are a special case by reason of their weakness, and they require preferential treatment.  Therefore I have to ask that the amendment be put.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 18, to delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) by the deletion of subsection (3);&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>I am glad that amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7 are being taken together.  I am strongly of the view that section 10 (b) should be amended because it is totally inadequate. I am also strongly of the view that section 10 does not provide any real additional protection for employees because the proposed amendment of the ceiling for payment of employees' outstanding claims from £300 to £1,500 is, in current money values, unrealistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To protect employees adequately in the event of winding up a company, the Bill should provide that all claims owing to employees in the form of wages, salaries, holiday pay and superannuation should be paid in full and should rank above all other creditors.  I am concerned that the figure is only £1,500.  The Minister said here the other day that that figure represented 11 weeks' wages but one must bear in mind that an amendment of this nature is going to stand for quite a number of years.  Current average earnings are between £140 and £150 a week and, inevitably, within a matter of three or four years the figure of £1,500 is going to be substantially diluted by inflation and wage increases.  The figure should be at least £4,000 because we have a situation where companies go into receivership and liquidation and workers are left waiting for many months until, finally, they may get back payment of wages.  In the construction industry, for example, when a company runs into trouble, workers may be paid £80 or £90 a week when they may well be due £140 or £150 a week.  There is an accumulated deficit owing to workers and that can quite easily grow substantially over a period of months, especially when you consider holiday pay amounting to three or four weeks wages.  The amount of money due to workers can be quite substantial <Col N="31" /> when the shutters come down.</P>
    <P>If the figure of £1,500 is not increased to £4,000 we will be back here in about four or five years to adjust this figure again.  It is equally arguable that the figure should have an aspect of reasonable inflation indexation, which is the purport of amendment No. 8, that an order should be made periodically whereby the Minister should take into account any changes in average earnings of workers in the transportable goods industries sector as recorded by the CSO, and then the amount of moneys could be appropriately adjusted upwards.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept the amendment, which would make a fundamental change in the Bill.  Because of the interesting discussion we had on this matter during Second Stage I will not press my arguments further on this occasion, but we could have a discussion across the floor of the House and perhaps reach agreement to increase substantially the £1,500 to at least £4,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 seeks to remove the limit on the amount which qualifies for preferential payment on winding up in respect of wages and salaries in the four months before winding up.  Opposition amendment No. 7 seeks to increase the £1,500 proposed in the Bill to £4,000.  There must be serious doubt about the effect of that proposal because nobody these days is likely to go without pay for as long as four months. In any event, in a winding up situation involving preferential payments, the actual position is likely to be precarious. As well as that, an EEC directive has been adopted and is due for implementation here by the Minister for Labour in 1983 about the position of employees in the event of insolvency of their employers, and further development of ideas about the position of preferential payment in respect of wages and salaries should be left until that stage.  However, if the figure of £1,500 were to be settled on the basis of the CPI when the Bill was being prepared in 1980, it is now possible to go some way to meet the amount specified in Opposition amendment No. 7. <Col N="32" /> The figure of £2,500 which I now propose in amendment No. 6 is generous because it represents an eight-fold increase on the figure in the Principal Act and because it exceeds the CPI increase since 1980.</P>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy, who did not refer to my amendment No. 6, that my amendment No. 11 has the effect of enabling further increases to be made by order, if the necessity should arise for it.  There are two reasons why I do not think this is of great practical importance. The first, and most important, is that nobody will work for any substantial period if he does not get paid.  It might happen in very unusual circumstances, perhaps at managerial level, but not lower down.  Secondly, the whole thing will be superseded by the implementation of the directive from Europe on this point.  That will not be implemented as part of company law but as part of employer-employee law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the decision of the Minister to increase the £1,500 to £2,500 in amendment No. 6. That is a step in the right direction.  I also appreciate the insertion of a new subsection through amendment No. 11, which indicates that he has authority by order to vary the amount.  They are welcome amendments, but I am sceptical about the reference to the EEC directive.  I do not know what has happened in recent years but there was a time when if we said we would implement a directive within a month or two we did so.  At the moment nothing happens and the House has deteriorated into an appalling logjam in regard to implementing even the simplest legislative reforms.  I hope the Minister for Labour, who will be responsible, will implement this directive without further delay because there is considerable criticism in relation to the non-implementation of a number of EEC directives on company law.  During Second Stage the Minister told us we are in good company with other EEC states who also have not implemented many directives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons we have not implemented some of the directives is because we have decided to do it by legislation.  I could make an order implementing them but they could not come before the House, and I wonder would the House consider that that should be done rather than have long delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We remember the lengthy debate the House engaged in about the establishment of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities and the tremendous anxiety of Deputies on all sides that that committee would scrutinise European legislation.  I get the impression that very few Deputies now pay the slightest attention to the scrutiny process or to detailed debate in the House on these matters.  That could well be the subject of all-party discussion.  Certainly we should not be sluggish in implementing directives.  I accept the good faith of the Minister in bringing forward the amendment to increase the £1,500 to £2,500 and introducing a mechanism whereby by order he can vary the sum specified.  That is a progressive decision and it is generally welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am puzzled by what the Minister said in regard to delays in implementing directives because of a policy decision to incorporate this work in legislation. The Minister seemed to say that he could save a lot of time and short circuit the process by way of ministerial order.  Surely a ministerial order which would become part of the law would require as careful drafting as would a piece of legislation.  I do not see how it would make for greater speed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the order will have to be drafted just as carefully as a Bill but I would draw the attention of the House to the time this little Bill has taken.  This is a tiny and minor document. The next Bill will be published in about a week and it will be an appallingly large document.  I draw the attention of the House to how long this little Bill has been before us.  I think this is the third Dáil <Col N="34" /> before which this Bill was discussed Unhappily, Bills of this nature in regard to which there is not much political interest usually tend to be put at the bottom of the heap.  This one has been around for a long time.  I remember finalising the draft of it in the second last Government.</P>

      <P>Before indicating what I intend to do with the amendment, can the Minister say if we are including superannuation payments?  The amount of money proposed relates to wages, salaries and holiday pay.  Does it include arrears of pension and superannuation payments?  A refund of superannuation payments might amount to £1,200 or £1,300.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy looks at section 285 he will see that these are set aside separately.  The sum of £2,500 applied to wages <i>simpliciter.</i>  Superannuation, redundancy, sick pay and so on are separate.  They are preferential debts. They are accumulative on the £2,500, or additional to it.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any point in accepting this amendment. I have no objection to doing so but I do not see any value in it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a small drafting point on this section.  The Minister will see that there is reference to a registered letter.  It is stated in subsection (1): &ldquo;if an answer is not received within one month from the date of that letter, a notice will be published in <i>Irish Oifigiúil</i>&rdquo;.  In subsection (2), which is part of the same mechanism, the date referred to is one month after sending the letter.  It is a small point which might not arise in 999 out of 1,000 cases.  A letter may easily carry a date but that may not be the date on which it is sent.  As the Minister knows, sometimes a letter will hang around on a desk for a day or two before it is posted and before the date of registration will appear.  It does not make much difference which formula the Minister uses but he should use the same one in both subsections.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment should be read in conjunction with the related amendment; anyway the other amendment related to the Schedule.  Section 21 of the Bill, as at present drafted, repeals portion of certain Acts which are mentioned in the Second Schedule.  The Acts affected are the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893, the Friendly Societies Act, 1896 and the Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961.  The portions of the 1893 and 1896 Acts which it was proposed to repeal refer to the Minister's power to appoint public auditors.  These proposed repeals arose out of the provisions of section 6 of the Bill which laid down the qualifications for appointment as a public <Col N="42" /> auditor.  The Attorney General's Office have reconsidered the proposed repeals. That office feels that doubt might be cast on the validity of the appointment of public auditors were the repeals to be proceeded with and, accordingly, have advised that the repeals be deleted.  This amendment provides accordingly.</P>

Alternatively the side note to the section about which we are talking should be changed so as to include the word &ldquo;construction&rdquo;. As the section stands it does not say so.

      <P>In following the Schedule the last time the Bill was before the House I was struck by quite unrealistically exquisite differentiation which it imported into a range of offences, a differentiation reflected in the tariff of penalties. I am not sure, listening to discussions about this on various Bills, if we ought not in an age of inflation have a single statute bearing on penalties which will free us from the ludicrous situation that we are changing a £1 fine to a £5 fine, such as is now proposed.  I am looking at the extreme case, where there is only a single offence of this kind under section 143(6) of the Principal Act.  It might be well to have a kind of blanket Act which would apply to all statutes with a criminal dimension which impose monetary penalties and which would entitle the court to review those statutory penalties without specific enactment on their behalf.</P>
      <P>I feel I am right in saying that the penalties attached to the offences incurred now, imposing a £5 fine and a £25 fine, will not be worth prosecuting. A few weeks ago, when the Litter Bill was before the House, I raised the point that we were really only erecting scarecrows by intensifying penalties for dropping litter when the existing law, which has been there for 20 years, is never enforced.  I may have been wrong when I said that I thought no prosecution for dropping litter was ever taken anywhere in the country.  As I was on my way out of the Chamber one of my colleagues sitting behind me who is a member of a local authority stopped me and said what I said was not literally true, that the prosecutions were not often brought because the cost of bringing a prosecution far outweighed the very trivial inconvenience to the offender represented by a fine of £5 or £10 or whatever it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same may be true with regard to the offences in categories 7 and 8 of the First Schedule.  While I do not want to hold the House up about it, I believe it <Col N="45" /> would be worthwhile having the Attorney General's Office consider and advise the Government about whether we ought to have a unitary statute bearing on all Acts which purport to inflict monetary penalties, and which would empower courts, within the limits of some mechanism which the Act would prescribe, to vary the ceilings of the penalties to have regard to the progress of inflation.</P>
    <P>In Victorian times, when the pound was worth as much at the end of the century as in the year 1837 and in which there were long periods when the value of money rose rather than fell, it was fair enough to impose a penalty of 40 shillings. It meant the same at the end of Victoria's reign as it did at the beginning. The same might be said about long periods of the present century in the years between the two wars when there was virtually no inflation and at some points in that period the value of money rose because the price of commodities fell.  It was in that context, when the real value of the benefit had increased, that Ernest Blythe produced his famous reduction of the old age pension.  That was done in a year in which the value of money had perceptively increased because the price of commodities fell.  I still think it was a niggling thing to do, but he felt that he would be conferring the same real benefit on the old age pensioners by giving them nine shillings as they had got in the previous year by receiving ten shillings.  It was a politically illjudged millstone he carved for his party but those were the circumstances in which he designed this and put it around our necks.</P>
    <P>In stable periods like that there is no necessity to worry about the level of those fines, but here we have a situation that within 20 years fines have to be quintupled and I suspect ought to be more than quintupled in some instances.  It might be worth using this absurd list of exquisitely calibrated penalties here to put under the nose of the Attorney General and invite him to consider if there is not some more rational way of doing the State's business in this kind of context.</P>

      <P>This amendment is consequential on an amendment to section 40.  Section 40 refers to the concept of exhaustion of rights.  It is a new principle imported from the Community Patent Convention, Article 81.  The principle was brought into the UK Act of 1977 at section 60, subsection (4), but that section will not be in force until the UK ratifies the Community Patent Convention.  The patent agents here have argued that section 40 as drafted originally, now section 40, subsection (1), places greater restrictions on Irish inventors than on British inventors. The subject of the amendment is to provide that the exhaustion of rights provision will not come into effect until a date to be fixed by the Minister by order.  The Minister will not fix the date until Ireland ratifies the CPC.  It is my intention, immediately on the enacting of this Bill, to have work started on the further legislation that will be required to enable Ireland to ratify the convention.  It is not possible at this stage to forecast how long it will be before this separate legislation will be enacted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to offend the Minister, but what is involved here is more than a change of name.  It arose from a very serious political decision which I understood the leader of the Minister's party was only waiting for an opportunity to reverse.  Before we go through with this change, which involves the deletion of the word &ldquo;industry&rdquo; from the title of the Department as it was known when the Bill was drafted, I should like to know what exactly is the status of the Department and also what is the status of the industry wing of the Department of Industry and Energy.  The party to which the Minister belongs made a serious fuss about the separation of the industry and commerce functions.  I must admit that I sympathised with their point of view, but I understood from the Taoiseach in 1981 that this was the subject of very early questioning after the Government of which I was a member came into office.  I understood that the then Deputy Haughey was only awaiting an opportunity to reverse this decision which he found reason to criticise.  Admittedly, it was not the wisest decision made by our Government.  Before we simply wave the matter through by way of purely a verbal change, I should like to know if there is any likelihood that the Department which the Minister opposite presided over once will be re-integrated in the same form or whether the new brass plate which I have observed only recently gracing the portals of the Kildare Street building indicates that the situation has become solidified rather than remaining provisional.</P>

The House is entitled to some indication as to what is the future of this Department and also of the Department headed by Deputy Reynolds.  Is there any prospect of re-integrating the industry and commerce functions, something that I understood the Minister's colleagues to be keen to do as quickly as possible and something also which the Minister, though not for reasons of personal aggrandisement would wish to do also?  May we take it that the decision of the last Taoiseach in this matter, though criticised at the time by his opponents, is to stand permanently?</P>

      <P>A patent shall not be granted in respect of:</P>
      <P>(a) an invention the publication or exploitation of which would be contrary to public order or morality, provided that the exploitation shall not be deemed to be so contrary only because it is prohibited by law; </P>
      <P>There is the material for a lot of trouble lurking behind that paragraph.  I do not wish to open the can unduly wide but perhaps the Minister will give us some hint &mdash; he can veil it as well as he wishes &mdash; of what he is referring to in that phrase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the provisions of this section correspond broadly to existing law.  Paragraph (a) excludes inventions objectionable on grounds of morality or public order corresponding to EPC Article 53(a) and to section 51(b) of the 1964 Act.  The proviso has the effect that although the use of an invention may be unlawful here this is not of itself to prevent the grant of a patent for a product which may be exported to countries where its use is not illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, some device or preparation could be invented here in conditions where its use or sale here was against the law but it would not prevent a patent being granted with the object that it could be exploited elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there is a point of law here.  Anybody who would be manufacturing or involved with that product would be an accessory and would be involved in criminal activity.  Are we purporting to legalise that, provided it is for export?  That would involve a change in the criminal law as well as a change in the industrial law.  The word &ldquo;morality&rdquo; is a <Col N="55" /> very loose one and can mean all sorts of things to different people.  There is no definition of it here and I do not know who would determine the parameters of the morality that is envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We might also be in a position where a patent granted under this section was the subject of a licensing contract or a contract to dispose of it by sale outright here.  That contract might run into questions of its validity having regard to public order and morality, notwithstanding the fact that we had formally patented the thing.  I do not want to explore this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither do I.  I do not wish to get into the vein of public order or morality which tends to be a longwinded one when a discussion opens on it.  I cannot imagine that there can be very many things that this would apply to but in the days before the Act was passed about contraceptives, the sale of them was illegal but that did not stop one patenting some new form of contraceptive and exporting it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us leave that delicate area out altogether if we can and take the instance of some form of drug, an intoxicant. Let us suppose the Minister, or Deputy Taylor, discovered that some process other than fermentation produced an agreeable intoxicant effect so much so that it could be sold and exploited.  If the intoxicant were a serious one presumably its sale would be prohibited under one of the Acts on this subject so that it would fall under the rubric of being prohibited by law.  Clearly the exploitation of it in this jurisdiction would be contrary to public order and morality but we would leave ourselves in the situation of permitting it to be patented. I draw the Minister's attention to this fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection is remarkable in that it is debasing the law in the sense that if a process is brought forward which is contrary to public morality it cannot be patented, but if it is only contrary to law that does not matter.  It is <Col N="56" /> putting the impact of morality above that of the law and this seems rather strange. If it is infringing a law, it is all right; if it is infringing morality, it is not on.  That is putting morality at a higher level than law.</P>

The whole thing sounds a bit ridiculous to me but it is there and I am advised that we have to pass it.  Even though we are all rather amazed and confused by it we might as well let it go through.  I understand that it is in the convention and that it corresponds broadly to present law.  They put it in in 1964, Whether they knew why or not I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be more satisfactory generally in cases of this kind to enact something here to which an international convention would be scheduled? This convention is cast in language which both from the legal point of view and from the technical point of view is not really all that transparent.  We do not know what some of this stuff means or may mean or is likely to mean.  Rather than pass it in the form of sections of an Irish Act, might it not be better to hold it at something of a distance, to schedule it and to enact the schedule as part of the law, so far as that is not inconsistent with our own domestic law and the Constitution?</P>

      <P>Article 53, under the heading &ldquo;Exceptions to Patent ability&rdquo; states:</P>
      <P>European patents shall not be granted in respect of:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  inventions the publication or exploitation of which would be contrary to &ldquo;ordre publique&rdquo; or morality, provided that the exploitation <Col N="57" /> shall not be deemed to be so contrary merely because it is prohibited by law or regulation in some or all of the Contracting States.  </P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that article means that the thing shall not be deemed by the Irish Patent Office to be contrary to public order and morality simply because it is contrary to law to make it in Denmark. Perhaps the reference to some or all of the member states is not intended to be reflexive, not intended to comprehend the state in which the application is being processed.  I can see the sense of that if we are not to be asked to import into our own law the content of the statute law of other member states.  It seems to be putting the Minister and any successor he may have in an impossible position in presiding over a Bill in which there is a clause of this kind.  He is not really able to explain what it means and I do not blame him.  Perhaps his Department might inquire whether the suggestion I have made is what the convention was aiming at.  I can scarcely believe that in the other member states they are solemnly enacting something which permits their patent offices to patent something unless it is contrary to public order and morality but that it shall not be deemed to be such merely because it infringes their own national law.  I always understood that respect for the positive law was an item of morality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly may very well be right because it is a contradiction in terms.  If something is prohibited by law it is contrary to public order and morality and the section would purport to put a degree of respectability on something which would be prohibited by law. The explanation may well be as Deputy Kelly suggests.  It is the only possible explanation of the subsection as it stands. It gives a most remarkable result by saying that one can disregard a matter that would be prohibited by the law of this State.</P>

      <P>Article 53 envisages a situation where, for example, an invention or its exploitation could be deemed to be contrary to the law of all the contracting states and it still could be patentable because the phrase used is &ldquo;in some or all&rdquo; and even if illegal in all the contracting states it would still be patentable.</P>
      <P>Section 1 (3) of the British Act of 1977 expressed it more briefly but bluntly than we have done.  It states that a patent shall not be granted for an invention, the publication or exploitation of which would be generally expected to encourage offensive, immoral or anti-social behaviour.  Subsection (4) goes on to state that for the purposes of subsection (3) behaviour shall not be regarded as offensive, immoral or anti-social only because it is prohibited by any law in force in the United Kingdom or any part of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure I agree with Deputy Taylor because there are all kinds of offensive behaviour which may be against by-laws but not against the statute law.  There are all sorts of by-laws applicable to Saint Stephen's Green and to the city buses.  One might be guilty of that behaviour by being rude to passengers or singing ballads into their ear without doing anything which by any ordinary acceptance of the expression is in any palpable sense against public order or morality.  Although I have very often condemned in this House the habit of copying the British, here is an instance in which we have declined to copy them but I must say their solution as the Minister has enunciated it is a better one than ours.  &ldquo;Public Order and morality&rdquo; is, as far as I can remember, a constitutionally-anchored phrase here and has fairly serious, sonorous over-tones and significances while the rather more general English expression implying brandishing umbrellas in a bus or any kind of boisterous offensiveness creates less conflict.  Will the Minister ask his advisers to look at the matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  Our draftsman was more inclined than the UK draftsman to follow the exact text of the European Patents Convention and to allow interpretation of it to await case law.  Ours is subject only to public order and morality whereas the UK one is much more specific in the sense that it is not a high constitutional phrase.  It is &ldquo;anything that would encourage offensive, immoral or anti-social behaviour&rdquo;.  They are broad phrases.  Anti-social activity can be relatively trivial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Such as smoking cigarettes. That is anti-social but in a trivial way.  It is prohibited in certain public buildings and in certain parts of buses and so on. I can accept that in trivial areas like this the English legislature or some other legislature might say they do not mind patenting certain things, even though their law might disapprove of their use as being offensive or anti-social, for use in countries that do not have the same standards. However, our phrase, &ldquo;public order and morality&rdquo; occurs in Article 40 of our Constitution and covers an area of activity such as the Minister instinctively thought it did when we started to discuss this matter because he got into the subject of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act and family planning legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>To leave the subsection as it stands would mean it would be quite in order to patent something that was prohibited under our law, provided only that it was not contrary to public order or morality.  That is really the test.  The question of its legality under our law would be neither here nor there.  We would have a situation where we would say it would be in order for the Patents Office to grant a patent for something that was prohibited by law here.  It seems a remarkable conclusion.</P>

However, if someone were to start inventing armaments here, although it would be illegal to use or to sell them here, that person would be entitled to a patent.

I do not know what is the situation with regard to that but I understand it was intended for warlike purposes.  The exploitation of that is not prohibited here but I presume it is subject to some kind of licensing regime.  I cannot believe we have a complete legal prohibition on the development of munitions of war.  On the contrary, we have statutes which envisage such things.

      <P>Since countries within the Community cannot utilise the veto to prevent ongoing Community policies, would the Taoiseach agree that if the veto can no longer be exercised &mdash; which is the implication &mdash; it poses a very serious threat perhaps to the long-term national interests of this State if it cannot be used in defence of legitimate national interests? Would the Taoiseach agree that this should be looked into?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there is a need to go into this issue very carefully. It is a complex one.  I would like to distinguish between the use of the veto in regard to the implementation of ongoing policies of the Community and the introduction of new policies, There is in most peoples' minds an important distinction between these two aspects of the veto. The use of the veto in regard to the introduction of fundamentally new policies is one thing and the use of the same veto in regard to relatively current issues is another matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that there are serious implications as a result of the recent decision which must be looked at from the point of view of our national interest?  Would the Taoiseach agree that the national interest of smaller countries could be threatened if there is not a decision to increase the national contributions from VAT revenue above their present level and that failing such a decision by the Community there could be a decision to cut expenditure on regional and social policies and on the CAP and this could affect the national interest here?  If we were unable to use our veto in that situation it would not be in our interests.  Would the Taoiseach agree that we should, without delay, consult with like-minded EEC states who are worried about the implications of the abandonment of the veto?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the second last reply confuses the situation further and betrays a lack of knowledge of the working of the Community because of course all new policies have to be introduced under their own treaty by unanimity?  Qualified majority voting only arises on the implementation of policy.  Therefore, the Taoiseach's reply makes no sense.  Would the Taoiseach also agree that the position adopted on the use of the veto by this Government is in direct contradiction to the position they have adopted consistently in this House in criticising the policy of our Government in supporting the use of qualified majority voting when national interests are not involved and when the questions involved are not ones that affect the national interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Recent developments have proved that this is not a situation in which it is possible to take a very hard and fast view.  The Community is continually envolving.  The Community faces very many difficulties and crises from time to time and, fortunately, has shown a capacity to overcome difficult problems and survive crises and I hope that will continue to be the situation.  Deputy FitzGerald should not adopt any particular legalistic point of view in regard to the use of the veto.  I know that he has taken the view that the majority voting system is a preferable system.  I do not think that he can maintain that conclusively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The position that we have taken up consistently on this side of the House is that the qualified majority voting system in cases where there is not a vital national interest should be allowed to operate for the very reason that failure to allow it to operate prevents policies being implemented to our benefit.  The Taoiseach has misrepresented our position. Would he not agree further that Fianna Fáil have in fact taken up a hard position in the past which they changed <Col N="66" /> very fast on this occasion and that it is only in that sense that the phrase &ldquo;hard and fast&rdquo; can be used by him?</P>

It goes to the root of our membership and participation in the Community and our national interests and any of us who have participated from time to time in the Community discussions and conferences and meetings understands that it is something on which certainly most of our officials have a common view in regard to the difficulties they encounter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

In the medium term we could be net losers if we were not able to use this weapon of the veto and if its status is in doubt after that meeting, would the Taoiseach agree it should be examined as soon as possible?</P>

      <P>There was a very definite move by all the Community partners, with the exception of the United Kingdom, to settle the farm price package. Among seven of the partners there was a desire to have that price package settled in the absence of agreement by majority voting.  Two of the partners wished to have the farm price package settled but they were not happy about proceeding by way of majority vote.  It was a fairly tangled situation.  I do not think it is appropriate to talk about taking initiatives.  It was a general movement among seven of the Community partners to get a state of majority voting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Power) (for the Minister for Industry and Energy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that my responsibilities relate to employment in manufacturing industry and not to all aspects of employment.  For that reason I do not consider it appropriate to make a statement on the general employment situation.</P>
      <P>As to an assessment of the number of jobs likely to be lost in the circumstances mentioned in the question, I would point out that, first, in the nature of business, all firms encounter difficulties of some magnitude at one time or another; secondly, not all firms that encounter difficulties either close or lose jobs.</P>
      <P>Because of the inherent problem in defining the term &ldquo;difficulties&rdquo; in the context which the Deputy appears to have in mind and the many subjective considerations that would be involved, I do not consider that it would be feasible to undertake, in an accurate and meaningful way, an assessment of the kind mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the situation of firms in manufacturing industry that <Col N="71" /> come to notice or are otherwise identified as encountering difficulties is continuously monitored by my Department in conjunction with other relevant State bodies, notably the IDA and Fóir Teoranta.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The on-going operation of the fuel variation charge is dealt with by the National Prices Commission who review the charge on a four-monthly basis and, therefore, I have not specific responsibility in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fuel variation charge was introduced as a procedure for dealing with wide and frequent fluctuations in the cost of fuels, particularly oil, which were occurring at the time and which have also been experienced more recently.  Apart from the fact that this variable charge dealt with frequent fuel cost fluctuations more appropriately than the normal general review of costs, it was seen as demonstrating more clearly to consumers the effects which fuel costs, largely beyond <Col N="72" /> the control of the ESB, were having on electricity charges.</P>
    <P>Given the experience of oil prices over the past year or so, it does not appear to me that such a degree of stability in prices is in prospect that abandonment of the charge would be an appropriate course. However, I express this as a comment and not as a policy decision.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>Funds are available through the Vote for my Department to provide grant assistance towards the costs of access roads to bogs and bog drainage, including outfall drainage.  The grants are available under a scheme which was introduced under the Turf Development Act, 1981, and which is administered by Bord na Móna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the scheme persons who wish to develop a bog for the production of turf products for fuel may apply to Bord na Móna for a development grant towards the cost of access roads to the bog, as well as the costs of bog drainage and the <Col N="75" /> purchase, lease or hire of turf development equipment.  In general each application must be accompanied by a bog development plan.  The amount of the grant may be up to 60 per cent of the cost of the bog development where the applicant is a qualified group or a qualified society, as defined in the Act, and up to 45 per cent in any other case.</P>
    <P>I understand that grants are also available under schemes administered by the Department of the Environment for the improvement of non-public roads and from Roinn na Gaeltachta for certain roads in Gaeltacht areas.  These grants are not specifically designed to aid bog road development but they have in the past been used for this purpose.  The extent to which grants may be available under these schemes is taken into account in determining the amount of any grant available under the scheme administered by Bord na Móna.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell me whether, in regard to private individuals who in the past owned bogs or had turbary rights, there has been a considerable fall-off in the amount of turf cut by such individuals, as opposed to larger groups, in recent years?  If so, does he consider it to be a bad thing and that steps should be taken to try to reverse that pattern?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the amount of turf cut by private individuals in the traditional fashion has declined over the last ten years or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any figures on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the figures here, but am aware from my own knowledge in my constituency.  The Act which was introduced in 1981 has been availed of by private individuals and by private individuals coming together in societies to form co-operatives.  The new system of turf cutting, where turf can be cut on the plough system over open land, has enabled people again to win fuel.  This will become increasingly obvious in the next year or so.</P>

    <Col N="76" />
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that there should be a major drive to encourage the cutting of turf by individuals from the point of view of our balance of payments, the high cost of oil, coal and so on and as part of that drive that there should be funds directly available for the improvement of access roads?  In effect, the old bog road will then become meaningful in Irish life again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing succeeds like success. Those who have availed of the 60 per cent grant, which in any language is quite generous, will encourage others in the immediate area and further afield to avail of this type of grant and develop bogs which have lain uncut for quite a number of years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, would the Minister accept that the scheme to which he refers is more applicable to a major operation and would hardly apply to the smallholder in the west of Ireland or in west Cork with perhaps only a few acres of bog or, indeed, only a turbary right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the present scheme operating in regard to people owning quite small quantities of turf. When speaking about new access roads and the old bog road, it is hardly likely that one individual cutting turf could avail of improvements there.  It would be to everyone's advantage to come together to improve access roads and provide access to a bog in those cases.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Bord na Móna that further areas of bogland in Bangor, County Mayo, are at present being developed.  It is estimated that this development will produce an annual output of 20,000 tonnes of sod peat mainly for domestic use.  The board acquire bogland for their own use only and not for the purpose of letting.</P>
      <P>My Department do not hold any bog plots for letting.  However, I understand that the Land Commission and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry do hold such plots, including some in County Mayo, and that they make annual lettings of these plots to interested parties and will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that literally thousands of people all over the country, and not only in County Mayo, are more than willing to cut turf every summer provided they can acquire a bog plot for such purposes?  Is he further aware that, not only in my county but in many counties, the Land Commission have such land plots which are not let on a regular basis?  He should instruct the Department to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the position outlined by the Deputy.  It arises in particular because there was a great fall-off in the number of people anxious to cut turf over the past ten years.  The Land Commission and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry acquired land for their own purposes which nobody else appeared to be interested in at the time. Now, because of the increase in the price of fuel, many people realise that they will have to go back to the old way of life and they would like to be considered for turbary rights, or plots of turf.  The Land Commission and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry help to facilitate them. Where there is a demand locally, the Land Commission and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, as I am personally <Col N="79" /> aware, make every effort to facilitate people with plots like that.</P>

Is he further aware that, in respect of the sale of certain of the products produced by Bord na Móna, excessive profits are being made by distributors and retailers, profits which should properly lie with Bord na Móna and, because of this, Bord na Móna are being starved of the funds necessary for development and marketing?</P>

      <P>I am well aware that Bord na Móna are pursuing a policy of having a market related price available for their products.  I am also aware that middlemen <Col N="82" /> engaged in the resale of Bord na Móna products are making quite considerable profits.  The intention is that Bord na Móna will test the market.  They do not want to lose any sales.  They need to discover the price the market will bear for their products.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, in relation to our only indigenous fuel, the marketing or pricing policy should be production costs plus margins to cover development and sales costs, and that it is contributing to inflation, bearing in mind that one of the key factors in inflation is the high cost of imported fuel, and compounding that situation if the board seek a pricing policy based on energy related prices or market prices, as he says?  Would it not be better to make the maximum use of our indigenous fuel by costing it at production plus a margin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>We would want to differentiate between the energy related cost, which probably would apply only to the ESB in burning milled peat for the generation of electricity, and the market related price.  I agree that we would be foolish to fritter away our indigenous fuel and sell it at a price that would allow it to be possibly over utilised, at a price that was less than it deserves.  This matter is being considered but I think it will be resolved in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish National Petroleum Corporation will hold the entire share capital of the Irish Refining Company on behalf of the Government and will, through the latter company, and in consultation with me, make the necessary arrangements to ensure that the refinery continues to be operated effectively.  It is expected that the refinery can resume operations in August.</P>
      <P>As already announced, it is intended that operation of the Whitegate Refinery will be on a cost-recovery basis.</P>
      <P>A sum of upwards of £10 million is being earmarked to get the refinery back into operation and the Deputy will have noted from the Minister for Finance's Budget Statement that provision has been made for this amount in the current year.</P>
      <P>I intend, in the near future, to introduce legislation to provide a statutory basis for the capital structure, organisation and functions of the INPC.  This legislation will also provide for the preparation and presentation of an annual report and accounts and any other matters relevant to public accountability.  It is my intention, when presenting this legislation to the House, to make a full statement in regard to the Government's policy on the corporation, including in particular, its future role and functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the decision to buy this refinery was a difficult one and was taken by the former Government only after consideration of certain proposals?  Is he aware that unless the refinery is managed most <Col N="84" /> efficiently and that the role it plays in the Irish economy is handled with care there could be a heavy cost to the taxpayers? Will he ensure when introducing legislation that the concept of the management of the refinery will be one of public accountability and that we in this House will at all times be able to get the fullest information necessary to ensure that the refinery is run efficiently and that the policy being pursued by the Government in office can be open to full scrutiny in this House?</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's opinion when he said that the decision was a difficult one.  I know it was the correct one.  I also share his opinion when he said it will be essential that the management of the refinery be efficiently conducted. I think the legislation that will be presented to the House and the presentation of the annual report and accounts will permit the House to take a close look every year at the management, running and success of the refinery.  In that way I think public accountability will be well looked after.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to tell the Deputy much about that because it is not in my brief but much will depend on the type of mix used.  I am sure the Minister will be conscious of the need to minimise the lead content of the petrol.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any information as to whether it is intended that the INPC in operating Whitegate will be given power, if that can be done legally, to compel the oil companies here to take a certain proportion of the Whitegate product from them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that will be included in the specific instances, in that the different companies trading in our State will utilise a certain amount of the product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>On the assumption that the Whitegate product will be more costly than imported products would the Minister agree that that arrangement will imply compelling the oil companies to take a certain proportion of their supplies from Whitegate at a higher price than they would be paying for products imported from elsewhere?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's assumption may not be correct because one would have assumed then that with the closure of Whitegate there should have been a consequent reduction in the price of the products used by the different companies <Col N="87" /> here.  The closure of Whitegate did not bring any reduction in the price of petrol or oil, here, so it would be wrong to assume that when companies are utilising the Whitegate products it should bring an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Accepting the force of the Minister's argument, I would like to know why the closure of Whitegate did not produce a fall in the cost of product to the consumer?  The Minister is getting away from what I wanted to find out. Does he not acknowledge that an arrangement under which the oil companies operating in this State will be obliged to accept and pay for a proportion of the Whitegate output can be nothing but a compulsory arrangement, in other words, that the only way it can be done is by forcing them to do it, because everyone is agreed that the Whitegate product was and will continue to be substantially dearer than the imported product and that is admitting the relevance of the question which the Minister himself asked?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I will have to make it a long and complicated question if you are going to confine me like that.  Would the Minister agree that, having regard to the fact that the INPC losses last year were only maintained at their level of £2 million by virtue of the fact that the ESB were compelled to absorb the real loss by taking from the INPC oil which the INPC had bought at a price much dearer than the going spot price, and that with that kind of record behind the INPC, it is all too likely that an arrangement of the kind I envisage will be what they will be looking for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="88" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to comment on that, because the Deputy is envisaging a situation where the spot price of oil would always be lower than the price for which they would have entered into a contract and that situation might not always apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It might not but it has applied in the last couple of years.  Would the Minister admit that the only reason the INPC's shown losses are as little as £2 million is that during that period they were in a position to oblige the ESB to take oil for a far larger price than the ESB would have been able to get it on a spot market&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy if he will confirm that the annual cost of operating the Whitegate Oil Refinery will result in a 1p per gallon excise duty on the retail sale price of all oil products in the country; and the manner in which this excise duty will be channelled to the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to say precisely at this stage what the incremental per gallon cost of operating the Whitegate refinery will be, assuming any such incremental costs do arise; nor is it correct to assume that such cost would necessarity be recovered by way of excise duty mechanism.  When the INPC, in consultation as necessary, with my Department, have made all necessary arrangements as regards the &ldquo;mix&rdquo; of crude oil to be fed into Whitegate and have established the exact nature and level of their operating programmes, only then will it be possible to identify with precision what the operating costs will be.  Until that stage is reached it would be impossible to quantify accurately the possible impact on oil product prices.  It is fair to say, however, that indications are that any additional per gallon cost which might arise is unlikely to be significant.  Indeed I am most anxious to ensure, in all relevant arrangements being made, that the cost is minimised.  I will continue to impress on the board the need to achieve the highest degree of competitiveness possible, consistent with the technical and marketing circumstances applicable.</P>

      <P>We have had a full debate on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>To my recollection the full debate we had was on section 7.  However, I have only a small point to make. It is in regard to subsection (3).  Is there a special reason for confining the scope of the addition which the subsection represents to applications inside the State but not including application from outside the State in the same span of time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that the patent applications comprised in this subsection could only be Irish.  That is true.  The subsection concerns only our own applications.  The examiner must search these concurrent applications as a topping up search in addition to other documents comprised in the section 27 (4) search, for evidence of novelty required by 27 (2) which ensures that a wide search of patent documents available in other countries will be undertaken. In relation to subsection (2), Deputy Taylor asked about an applicant who can prove that this invention is new having regard to what has been published in the State or elsewhere before the date of his application.  The answer is that <Col N="254" /> novelty must be universal.  The examiner is required to carry out a search which in the controller's opinion is practical and necessary.  Because the examiner cannot carry out a universal search in the Irish office, the applicant is required to furnish evidence of novelty for his invention in the form, for example, of evidence of grant by a patent office outside the State which has the capability of carrying out a wide search.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <P>Are Eastern European countries parties to the patent procedures?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear about the reason for this.  Subsection (3) contains an addition to the concept of state of the art as described in subsection (2): the state of the art is to comply with everything made available to the public whether inside or outside the State by means of a written or oral description by use or any other way before the date of filing of the patent application.  On top of what is made available to the public in various alternative forms, the state of the art is also to be held to comprise the content of a patent application filed subsequent to the date of the filing of the present application but only inside the State.  In other words, the patent application filed in that span of time in any other member state will not be taken as part of the state of the art.  It may be that there is a reason for that.  Perhaps it would be unreasonable to expect the office to go through the patent records of the European office plus nine other national offices.  However, let us have the reason rather than let it slip through without consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that it is impossible for the Patent's Office to check concurrent applications abroad because they have no access to them. They are not published.  In practice they check on the register of patents abroad in the appropriate countries and they check on the concurrent applications <Col N="255" /> which have been made here.  They cannot check the concurrent foreign applications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the practical difficulties but we ought to realise that what we are doing may leave us in a situation where patent applications which are filed concurrently in different member states could proceed independently, each on the basis that the other is not part of the state of the art.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The examiners are familiar with the up-to-date literature which emanates from all countries on their sphere of activity and that includes publications from Eastern Europe.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  Where a statement appears in the Journal stating that an international exhibition specified in the statement is or was an international exhibition of the class referred to in subsection (1) of this section, then for the purposes of this section the statement shall be evidence that the <Col N="256" /> international exhibition specified therein is or was an international exhibition of such class.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that Irish inventors are protected against disclosure if they exhibit their inventions at international exhibitions.  The amendment was suggested by the patent agents who were worried that the section as originally drafted did not provide for such protection because Ireland has not yet ratified the Convention on International Exhibitions.  The proposed new subsection follows the line of the UK Patents Act, 1977, section 130.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording used &ldquo;having regard to the state of the art, it is not obvious to a person skilled in the art&rdquo; seems unusual.  It might be obvious to one person skilled in the art but not to another.  Would it be adequate if a would-be patenter seeking a patent produced a person skilled in the art who says that it was not obvious to him?  It could be that there would be other persons skilled in the art who might take an opposing view.  Does the controller make the decision?  The wording in the section seems to make it conclusive that once a person skilled in the art is produced to say that it is not obvious, that would be the end of the matter.  It seems to me that it could be a controversial matter.  Would the section not be better worded indicating that the controller would decide in the event of such a controversy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 6 to 11 are a set of sections which set out the substantive law on patentability.  Apart from minor drafting differences they follow exactly the corresponding Articles, 52 to 57, of the European Patent Convention, thus bringing Irish law into line with governing European patents and avoiding the possibility of domestic Irish patents on the one hand and European patents effective in Ireland on the other hand being subject to different standards of patentability. Section 6 follows closely Article 52 and so on down along the line with the other ones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reference to something being susceptible of industrial application as something that had to be manufactured, could not be, with respect, what the phrase &ldquo;susceptible of industrial application&rdquo; means, because any damn thing, whatever its purpose, has to be manufactured or brought into existence in some shape or from by human ingenuity and human hands.  The Minister must have heard &mdash; I am sure it is part of his apparatus of received phrases &mdash; of patent medicine, of patent cough bottles of something like that.  That is not something that I would accept as <Col N="259" /> being susceptible of industrial application; it is really susceptible of medical application.  I am not complaining about this.

      <P>The phrase &ldquo;used in any kind of industry&rdquo; reads well enough but the phrase &ldquo;made in any kind of industry&rdquo; leaves something to be desired.  A better wording might be &ldquo;made by any kind of industrial process&rdquo; or something like that.  Perhaps the Minister would consider the wording there.</P>
      <P>One final point on it, which does not warrant too much labouring, is this.  Can we be sure that the word &ldquo;industry&rdquo; will not be interpreted as conjuring up some grandiose procedure?  Let us take the case of a backyard firm, a one-man, small operation assembling materials.  Can we be certain that nobody will come along and say that that is not industry, that it requires a more elaborate operation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (1), line 37, to delete &ldquo;attached.&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;attached; provided also where the inventor is an employee wholly or mainly employed in the State (but not by the State, or any State-sponsored body) and the right to the patent is to be determined under this subsection in accordance with the law of the State, the right to the patent shall lie between the employer and employee in such share as they may agree or in default of such agreement as the Controller or Court shall determine, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any service agreement between the employer and employee;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provided further that if the employee creates his invention not in the employer's premises nor during working hours and uses his own equipment, then the right to patent for such invention shall belong entirely to the employee.&rdquo;<Col N="262" /> The purpose of the amendment is to make provision for an employee of a firm who discovers something to patent, to make provision that it should be open to the controller or the court to determine that he should have a share in the invention he had discovered in the proportion that the controller or court would determine. This seems a very reasonable proposal, that where, through one's labour or ingenuity, an employee discovers some novel process which could be a source of tremendous wealth to his employer, some proportion &mdash; the exact proportion would be a matter to be determined according to the particular circumstances in any individual case &mdash; should accrue to the employee.  But certainly it is a reasonable proposal that an employee should have some share in the fruits of his discovery.  Admittedly, of course, the employer would provide the apparatus and materials for the research and so on on which the employee would be engaged.  Nonetheless, it is the special skill and ingenuity of the employee who produces the invention or discovery that enables the employer to patent that, something that could be a source of tremendous revenue to the employer.  In that the employee should rightly and reasonably have some share.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides that it would be left open to the employer and the employee to agree, if possible, on what the percentage that would accrue to the worker should be.  Failing that, then the controller or the court would determine what should be the proportion attributable to the employee.  The second part of the amendment deals with the case of an employee who creates an invention not in his employer's premises, nor during working hours, and uses his own equipment.  It states that in such a case the right of the patent belongs to the employee entirely and the employer would have no claim on the invention if discovery was made in such circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the merits of the Labour Party's amendment it occurs to me, in reading this subsection, <Col N="263" /> that we seem to be in the course of giving a fairly large degree of <i>carte blanche</i> to the laws of other states in this regard. Suppose the inventor is an employee in Denmark, Greece or some other member state, then the right to the patent shall be determined in accordance with the law of that state but the law of that state might be in a sense which this country would recognise as unjust and discriminatory.  It might be confiscatory and it might very easily come to pass that the courts would establish among the undefined personal rights of the citizen, a right to fair compensation for his intellectual property, including his own inventions and our statute law might be supplemented by something of that kind even without a direct legislative amendment.</P>
      <P>I believe that to give this immunity to the laws of other states even though the law of any of those other states might be something which we could not stomach and which would not pass muster in one of our statutes may be unwise.  A relatively unexplored field is the degree to which the State will respect the laws of other countries where their features are such as would be repugnant to our way of doing things under the Constitution. This seems to be an instance where this could arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment moved by Deputy Taylor consists of two provisos. The first relates to the case of an employee-inventor employed in Ireland. The section as drafted provides that the ordinary law of contract will determine who has the right to the patent.  I feel this is the just solution.  The proviso seeks to change this, notwithstanding any agreements that are in existence between the parties concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second proviso relates to an employee creating an invention outside his working hours or place of employment. It is similarly felt that this should be regulated by ordinary contract law.  It is difficult to forecast what results would flow from changes of the kind proposed. I should say that for some reason the amendment seeks to apply only to the relationship between an employee and a <Col N="264" /> private employer and does not seek to bind the State or semi-State bodies.  I do not see why it is seen as appropriate to take away something from a private employer but allow the State to retain full control and ownership.  I suggest that the State has no greater rights than a private employer at the very least.  There are some of us who feel that the State should have less rights in matters of this kind certainly.</P>
    <P>In 1981 the Minister received representations from a union.  Either my predecessor or I took the view that the employee-inventor is well protected in the Bill by reference to section 13 (1) and they also referred to section 76 under which the High Court will determine disputes on entitlement, including employer-employee disputes.  Consequent on court decisions in favour of the employee-inventor he may apply for revocation of the patent under section 54 and can then effectively under section 76(4) have the full benefit of the patent or the relevant part of it transferred to him.  In my view these arrangements give full protection to the employee-inventor. The Patents Office in Ireland do not recall any dispute in this field.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister said in regard to the exemption which Deputy Taylor and his colleagues are proposing to insert by this amendment. There is no reason why the State and still less a State-sponsored body, should not be subjected to the same regime, the general lines of which I naturally sympathise with, that Deputy Taylor wants to seek.  I cannot see any reason why the Sugar Company, Bord na Móna or CIE should be any better placed than a private employer in the context we are discussing or, for that matter, a Department of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister sees difficulty with the exemption in the case of the State or semi-State bodies I have no objection to deleting that exemption.  I believe the amendment is a reasonable one.  It is not right that the ordinary open market law of contract should apply in this kind of situation.  There is nothing <Col N="265" /> unusual about the laws of the country taking a hand in the free and open law of contract.  That is done frequently, particularly in the case where there is not a free and open market situation.  Here a would-be employee, the state of unemployment being what it is, is not in a position to negotiate the minute details of the conditions in his contract of employment one would wish would be so if there was an equality of supply of jobs and applicants for them.  That is not the case and the employee does not have that strength of bargaining power behind him. Consequently on occasion the law has to assist him.  This is a very reasonable provision. Nobody is suggesting in it that the lion's share or anything like that would accrue to an employee who makes the discovery but because he was a key factor in the production of that novel item or that new thing it is right and just that he should have at least some stake in it having regard to the fact that it was his ingenuity which brought this about in the first place.  The existing law of contract does not provide for that.  It provides that in its entirely it belongs to the employer.  I consider it reasonable to change that by inserting this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence that the existing law of contract provides that it belongs entirely to the employer. The existing law of contract enforces the contract between the parties.  There is no external law imposed on the parties.  If they want to come to an agreement that they share certain things 50-50 or 60-40 they share them 50-50, 60-40 or whatever it is.</P>
      <P>The other point I would make is that this section is a reproduction, <i>mutatis mutandis</i> of Article 60 of the European Convention and that because there is a question of mutuality and reciprocal treatment as between ourselves and the other contracting parties we cannot depart significantly from the terms of Article 60.  None of the other parties have departed significantly from these terms either.</P>

      <P>Far be it from me to recommend our following the English but the Minister said a moment ago that what we have here is a word-for-word production, a <i>mutatis mutandis</i> of Article 60 of the convention but he now tells us that the English law is more complicated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Usually it is the other way round.  Deputy Taylor's suggestion that what has been freely agreed in a service contract between an employer and an employee is to be overridden in the interests of the employee is one in which I do not see any great virtue, provided it is a freely negotiated arrangement.  If an employee in such a situation is unionised it would be a matter for his union to ensure that any arrangement entered into is not one that will be prejudicial to the employee.  Consequently, I do not see much use in the first part of the Deputy's amendment but I see some point and some value in the second part of it.  Perhaps between now and Report Stage the Minister would consider this part of the amendment.  The section refers simply to an employee and does not differentiate between a situation in which an employee, for example, a laboratory technician working in an R &amp; D facility, discovers or invents something in his firm's time or whether he is doing the research involved in his own time but very likely in consequence of the skill and experience he has acquired during his working life including the time spent in the R &amp; D facility.  There is a case for distinguishing between the time and the effort that the employee is being paid to put into the job &mdash; and in which case it might be reasonable to suppose that the <Col N="267" /> fruits of his work would accrue substantially to the man paying him &mdash; and for the time and effort he is investing in his own time and with his own equipment.  It would be a liberal move to allow specifically for that.  That is why I hope the Minister will consider the suggestion between now and the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not follow the point that the Minister is making regarding our being caught here by the convention. Apparently the convention permits, on this issue, each of the signatory states to have their local law.  That is stated clearly in the section.  Therefore, that law could vary from state to state.  The purport of the amendment would be that if the provision should turn out to be determined in accordance with the law of this State, then it should be the law that an employee in default of an agreement between himself and his employer would have a participating share in the invention concerned.  The section makes provision for that and the amendment is simply categorising what is to be the law of this State.  Some countries may already have this provision in their national laws. Therefore, it appears to be open to the signatory states to have their own private law on this issue, and that is what the amendment seeks to do.  It is a reasonable amendment and I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As suggested by Deputy Kelly, I will consider accepting the second proviso contained in the amendment but not the first.  I should like to look into the question of what is the present position regarding an invention <Col N="268" /> in the circumstances of an employee's own time and of his working hours.  I am unable to procure any advice at the moment as to that matter but I will endeavour to obtain it and when I find out what the position is I shall consider the second proviso as proposed by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are speaking of may be the law already in which case the second proviso would be simply declaratory of the existing position.</P>
      <P>So far as the first part of the amendment is concerned I would be anxious that this be adopted also.  It involves a basic factor.  If the contract provides for the subject in question that is fine but the contract may very well be silent in that respect in which case agreement may be reached between an employer and his employee but the nub of the matter is that the person through whose ingenuity the discovery was made should not be entirely denied participation in it.  The proportion of the participation could be great or small depending on the circumstances in which the invention was discovered. The circumstances might be such that to have employed the employee in the first place required heavy capital investment by the employer, while in other cases the investment might be relatively small.  In the case of large investment the employee's share would be small.  But the net point is that the person whose ingenuity and work brought about the discovery should have some participation in it.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 13 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have obtained a copy of the British Act of 1977 and, as the Minister says, the corresponding English provisions are more extended and speak their message in many more words than the provisions before us in this Bill.  I find that they incorporate, very nearly in the <Col N="271" /> words I used myself, the purport of the second part of Deputy Taylor's amendment. This is of no importance in the sense that I never would recommend copying an English Act, nor am I doing so now, but it is of significance in relation to what the Minister told us was our bounded duty under the European Patents Convention, namely, to enact the article of that convention which section 13 of this Bill represents with as few modifications as possible.  He said that our section 13 represents the European Article turned into Irish legislative language.</P>
      <P>The English are under exactly the same obligation, but they have succeeded in distilling from their obligation a more elaborate series of sections which I have not had the opportunity of studying properly and on which I will not pronounce, except to say that there is the distinction which I was trying to get the Minister to acknowledge and which I thought was the principal strength of Deputy Taylor's amendment, namely, that there should be some explicit distinction between an invention achieved in an employer's time, perhaps by a man working in a research and development facility for the owner of that facility, and an invention developed by a man in his own time in quite different conditions.  Deputy Taylor's amendment permitted that distinction to be made and I find that the English in 1977 expressed that very distinction in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 39 of their Act.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) of section 39 of the British Act states:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything in any rule of law, an invention made by an employee shall, as between him and his employer, be taken to belong to his employer for the purposes of this Act and all other purposes if&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> (a)  it was made in the course of the normal duties of the employee or in the course of duties falling outside his normal duties, but specifically assigned to him, and the circumstances in either case were such that an invention might reasonably <Col N="272" /> be expected to result from the carrying out of his duties; or</P>
    <P>(b)  the invention was made in the course of the duties of the employee and, at the time of making the invention, because of the nature of his duties and the particular responsibilities arising from the nature of his duties he had a special obligation to further the interests of the employer's undertaking.   </P>
    <P>Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>Any other invention made by an employee shall, as between him and his employer, be taken for those purposes to belong to the employee. </P>
    <P>I do not especially applaud that form of words, and it might have been possible to express it in fewer words, but it would be as well to have recognised in our Bill a distinction of roughly this kind.  I do not mind what words are used.  I entirely understand the pressure which exists in the Patents Office through the workload and over-working by a very small specialised and dedicated staff.  I do not underestimate that and I am not trying to make work for them.  The Labour Party put down an amendment, the second part of which aims at this distinciton.  In spite of the fact that we and the British are governed by the same convention, they have succeeded in inserting such a distinction and we have failed to do so.  Will the Minister look at this matter again and consider an amendment of his own for Report Stage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I had already offered to do that, but Deputy Taylor declined to accept that offer and he proceeded to put his own amendment to a vote.  I do not know what is my position now.  For the benefit of those who may not have been here for a long time, perhaps I should explain that with a difficult technical Bill one does not amend it by a series of divisions.  The best way to amend it is by considering some of these difficult matters before the next Stage and working out an appropriate amendment.  I made it clear why, even on his own admission, Deputy Taylor's amendment could not <Col N="273" /> work because it was outrageously biased in favour of the State in a quite unfair way and it differentiated against private employers in a arbitrary fashion.  I had already made the offer, as requested by Deputy Kelly, to see if it was thought appropriate to draft an amendment based on the second proviso.  I do not know if that understanding is still binding on me in the circumstances, but if anything might come of it I am prepared to look at it.</P>

The Chair indicated to Deputy Taylor before he looked for the vote that the Minister had indicated he was prepared to look at this section or the spirit of part or all of the amendment.  The Chair is merely indicating to the House the situation under Standing Order 100, which states that when an amendment is defeated it cannot be moved again.

      <P>There seems to be some atmosphere pervading matters, including the contribution from the Chair if I may say so, which would suggest that I should not have pressed my amendment.  I put that amendment advisedly because I believed it was a right and proper amendment to have proposed.  I stand over the sentiments behind it and I make no apologies to anyone for having done so.  The fact that Deputy Kelly agrees with one part of the amendment and has reservations about another part is a matter for him.  So far as I am concerned, the key part of the amendment was the first part, giving a right to an employee to participate in an invention he has discovered.  It was on that basis, coupled with the second part, that I put the amendment and I make no apologies for having done so. I resent the tone and some of the comments that have been made here about it, as though I were in some way improper in doing so.</P>

If a Deputy is anxious to have what is in his amendment considered on Report Stage, ordinarily he withdraws the amendment.

      <P>My quibble is not with the Chair but with the tone of the Minister's last contribution.  If one were to interpret it exactly as it was offered, literally it would mean that if one puts forward an amendment with more than one element and encounters the displeasure of the Minister of the day one has lost the opportunity completely by not having the amendment altogether right. I find that an extraordinary suggestion. In this case there were two elements in the amendment and one element could have been accommodated in some formula. How can it make sense one moment and not make sense the next moment?  If one interprets the Minister correctly, he is saying that one loses the opportunity of introducing one element by simply including anything else that encounters ministerial displeasure.  It is a rather partisan interpretation of the process of amendment.</P>

We have been members of the Paris Convention for a very long time, not since 1883 but presumably since the twenties, and these concepts are defined in the Paris Convention.

      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to another curious thing here in subsection (5) where it states that the controller may cause to be omitted from the published patent application statements or other matter contrary to public order or morality.  I do not want to reopen what we were talking about <Col N="279" /> before lunch but surely this is an absurdity. He is going to be considering a patent application with the intention presumably of granting it but he is not allowed to publish that part of the application &mdash; although it may be seriously intended and by no means polemical or evangelical, so to speak, in the bad sense &mdash; which he judges to be contrary to public order or morality.  To have a provision like that would seem, at first flush, something the Dáil may well have enacted in 1942 but it would seem a bit curious for 1982. Perhaps the Minister would satisfy us between now and the next stage that we really need such a provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister look at a small point?  Subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>A request for substantive examination shall be made by the applicant in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed period and be accompanied by&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the prescribed substantive examination fee,  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is another part of the Bill <Col N="280" /> which empowers the Minister to fix scales of fees in such matters.  I hope when he comes to do so &mdash; perhaps he might even consider putting in a requirement that he should do so &mdash; he would make it flexible. There could be a very large difference in the cost to the Patents Office, and ultimately to the State, in carrying out an examination of a trivial, modest invention on the one hand, and something of extreme sophistication on the other.  A lumpish bureaucratic fist would be out of place in prescribing a fee tailored to, on the one hand, a sophisticated product, which would only yield to examination by very highly paid experts, and, on the other, a modest item which an ordinary engineer would be able to judge quickly. In other words, I am asking the Minister to consider whether he should be required by the law to prescribe a flexible scale of substantive examination fees proportionate to the trouble and expense involved for the Patents Office in carrying out the examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The fees will not be fixed under the Bill; they will be prescribed by an order to be made later.  I understand there are problems about having different amounts of fees for the same activity.  The Patents Office take the view that what they lose on the swings they make up on the roundabouts.  This is no consolation to the small inventor and I will see if there is any way we can get around it.</P>

      <P>The Patents Office are one of the small number of State activities which are not only self-financing but make a modest profit.  They are so proud of that unusual status that they are anxious to maximise their profits.  I would not fault them for that because it is a very healthy intention.  Would the Minister consider putting in a fee which would cover even the most sophisticated process for inventions and empower the office to remit or waive some or all of this fee in an appropriate case?  What I mean by an appropriate case is where the fee specified in the order would be grossly disproportionate to the amount of professional <Col N="281" /> trouble involved in making the examination and disproportionate to the amount of financial benefit the applicant for patent could be expected to derive from the patent if and when granted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Kelly's comments on fees.  Clearly fees should be commensurate with the time and work spent by the officials of the Patents Office on the examinations.  One could visualise some examinations requiring lengthly and prolonged procedures and many people would be involved.  The fees to be charged should be commensurate with that.  The State, in granting this valuable piece of commercial property, should be at no loss to the general body of taxpayers in carrying out the investigation necessary to substantiate the patent.</P>
      <P>I want to ask for clarification on two points.  There are three elements involved in patentability: first, it must be an invention; second, the novelty element, it must be new; and, third, it must be susceptible of industrial application. Under section 27 (2) we find that evidence is required of only two of those steps; for some reason the third is omitted. I do not know why.  It seeks evidence on the novelty aspect and the inventive step aspect, but for some reason it leaves out the necessity for evidence on the susceptibility of industrial application.  I wonder if there is any reason for that?</P>
      <P>The second point calls in as evidence that question of a grant by any patent office outside this State of a patent for the same invention.  Should reference there not be made also to a patent as to the utility model, utility certificate or an inventor's certificate?  If either of those certificates operated, would it not be a relevant factor in the examination as well as the fact that an actual patent might have been granted elsewhere?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple answer is that I do not know why two of these steps are listed and not the third.  I understand <Col N="282" /> the third point is to apply throughout the Bill and presumably it was thought unnecessary to repeat it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something which runs through the Bill and which has been mentioned before, but I am not sure that it has been satisfactorily dealt with.  There are many places in the Bill where the controller or the Minister is given power to make determinations of one sort or another.  The various sections in which this power is conferred do not specifically <Col N="284" /> require that the Minister or the controller, as the case may be, give notice to anybody, even to the person affected or likely to be affected that the making of such a determination or decision is in contemplation.  An attempt is made to cure that to some extent, or completely, no doubt, in a section towards the end of the Bill, section 85.  This section prescribes that the Minister &mdash; I am speaking from memory now &mdash; when making a discretionary decision must observe the ordinary rules of justice and must give the applicant the opportunity of stating his case.  This section states:</P>
      <P>Where any discretionary power is by or under this Act given to the Controller, he shall not exercise that power adversely to any party in proceedings before him without giving that party an opportunity of being heard as regards such exercise. </P>
      <P>I will have something more to say about that section when we come to it.  It does not seem to cover, section 31 (1) which is as follows:</P>
      <P>Where a patent application has been published pursuant to this Act but a patent has not been granted to the applicant, any other person may make observations in writing to the Controller on the question whether the invention is a patentable invention, stating reasons of the observations, and the Controller shall consider the observations in accordance with such rules (if any) for the purposes of this subsection as may be in force for the time being. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have thought that there should be an obligation resting on the controller to transmit the substance of these observations to the applicant, so that he can have an opportunity to counter them.  I would have thought this would have been the right thing to do at that stage.  I do not know if the provision under section 85 which confers this discretionary power on the controller really comes through here.  I would have thought that when somebody had raised these observations the applicant should have had the opportunity, as soon as the observations arrived in the controller's office, of knowing <Col N="285" /> that they were there and of taking an opportunity to meet them if they are hostile to his case.  I will be asking the Minister and the Attorney General to look at the word &ldquo;discretionary&rdquo; in this connection. I am not so sure that we know what this word means in this context.  The word &ldquo;discretionary&rdquo; sometimes means something not far removed from arbitrary, but the controller or the Minister is most certainly not entitled to be arbitrary in the exercise of his powers under the Act. There are discretionary powers which the Minister must exercise every day, as to whether to appoint X, Y or Z to a board, or to discontinue getting the paper supply for his office from one newsagent instead of another.  He is not obliged to give reasons for or notice of such decisions to anybody.  These are truly discretionary decisions.  If this is the extent of the purview of section 85, it is not going far enough.  There are a large number of decisions that are by no means discretionary. They must be taken having regard to to the procedures which the Act explicitly or implicitly commands.  Speaking of section 31, no particular determination or decision is expected of the controller, but it is clear that his mind is in the process of being formed on the merits of the patent application once observations hostile to it come in on his invitation.  At that stage the person likely to be affected by the controller forming an adverse point of view should be given notice of the substance of the observations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the practice is that if such observations come in, they are furnished to the applicant. Also, in regard to the rules which will be made under this Bill, provision will be made for such matters as the furnishing of copies.  Much of the point of this extremely long winded procedure on patents is to have as much as possible carried out in public and therefore to give notice to interested parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some other sections which specifically state that notice be given.  There is an irregularity in pattern which states that which perhaps <Col N="286" /> ought not to be stated in some sections, but it is neglected to state it in others. This is something which it would be as well not to have.  We should have an even usage in matters like this throughout the Bill and, indeed, throughout all legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am right in thinking that these sections are there, I will look them up.  I am at present going on memory. The law of this country is that, even if such a thing is not stated in the Bill, a controller, or a Minister, or anybody else, who is adjudicating on, or taking any steps towards the adjudication of, something an unfavourable result in which will prejudice somebody else, must treat him fairly.  Implicitly that requires him to give him notice of what objections are being raised to him, or what observations are being expressed about his application, and so forth.  Even if none of this were in the Bill, it still would not relieve the controller, or the Minister, or anyone else exercising a function of this kind, from the ordinary, natural and constitutional duty of exercising fair play, which includes the idea of giving the party a second chance to be heard, which you cannot do unless you let him know what the nature of case being made against him is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not that I am apprehensive of any unfair play.  I know quite well that will not happen.  The law books of this country are stuffed with examples &mdash; they are there by the hundreds going back to the foundation of the State &mdash; in which well-meaning officials, under pressure of time, or misreading something without proper advice, have made decisions, and have overlooked the necessity for giving people notice of what they were up to, and have overlooked some requirement of justice which they would not have overlooked had it been set out expressly <Col N="287" /> in the Act in the section which they were trying to operate quite fairly.  In their hurry they cut a corner and did an injustice without meaning to, or did not let justice be seen to be done, and ended up in the High Court to the dismay and expense of the State.  That is best avoided by making it explicit wherever you confer a function of this kind that it has to be exercised by way of giving notice to the person affected.</P>

      <P>One wonders whether the examiner should not have a role in looking at observations submitted.  Apparently the observations go directly to the controller.  As Deputy Kelly pointed out, that can colour the mind of the controller in coming to his decision, perhaps over-strongly having regard to the fact that the observations were not tested in the same way as the actual submission of the patent application would have been tested by having been subjected to a substantive examination by the examiner.  Apparently the examiner has no role in dealing with the observations.  Perhaps it would be appropriate that the examiner should have a role in looking at these observations and commenting on them before they were passed to the controller.</P>

      <P>In reply to the last point, the examiner is an officer of the controller, I am informed, and the controller can consult the examiner, and I presume does.  On the point Deputy Kelly made, in fact the controller sends copies of the observations to the applicant. I do not know why that point is not brought out here in the Bill.  Apparently it is covered in the Rules.  If there seems to be any major need for it, I have no objection to including it in the Bill on the next Stage.  Whether or not it is in the Bill, if the controller is in error in not providing copies of the observations to an applicant, or presumably the applicant's reply, all the actions of the controller are subject to review by the High Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 20, subsection (1), lines 46 and 47, to delete &ldquo;the period of twenty years&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;such period between five and fifteen years, as the Controller shall determine to be reasonable to enable the inventor to secure a fair return,&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the term for which the patent is granted.  The Bill provides one fixed, specified term of 20 years.  More flexibility would be appropriate here on the term which should be granted.  The amendment would provide that, instead of a fixed term of 20 years in all cases, irrespective of the type of patent it was, irrespective of the work or research expense which had gone into it, it would be at the discretion of the controller to determine on a term between five years and 15 years.</P>
      <P>Quite clearly the work and expense involved in getting patents and doing the research work which would lead to a patent would vary enormously from case to case.  Some cases could involve the expenditure of vast amounts of money, prolonged period of research with a huge research establishment, in which it would be reasonable to secure the protection of a patent for that developer for a prolonged period.  On the other hand, there could be a strike-lucky situation in which, with very little effort and very little expenditure of money, a firm could make a discovery, and it would be reasonable that the term should be less than the maximum which would be allowable under the discretionary figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be clear about this.  There is a regressive element in the whole patent concept.  I am not saying there is not a need for it.  I appreciate the need for it. Nonetheless, it is a regressive element; it is a restrictive element; it is a monopolistic element.  It can have deleterious effects in many ways.  It could cut back on employment.  It could result in prices of the commodity to members of the public <Col N="289" /> being higher than they would otherwise be by reason of the existence of a patent.  Therefore, it is prudent that a balance should be struck between the profit element made available and secured to the owner of the patent, and the rights of members of the public to purchase commodities at the lowest possible price.</P>
    <P>The blanket provision of a 20-year term makes no distinction between those different categories.  There is a reference in the Bill in a different section to a limited class of commodities which touches on this aspect of the matter, that is, in section 65 (2).  In that subsection terms of licences involving medicines, food, and things like that are mentioned. There is a reference to the fact that they should be available to the public at the lowest prices consistent with the proprietors of patents deriving a reasonable advantage from their patents.  A reasonable advantage would depend on the expenditure or trouble involved for the patent holder.  That varies from case to case.</P>
    <P>In any case a term of 20 years is too long.  A maximum appropriate term would be 15 years and, in certain cases, it could be considerably lower if the expenditure involved on the item did not warrant keeping up prices artificially to the consumers to an inordinate extent. One might find that, after a relatively small research programme, the consumers were paying a very high price for a prolonged period of 20 years.  It may be that 20 years is specified in the Paris Convention.  I do not know if that is so. I anticipate that the Minister will say it is.</P>
    <P>Everything in the Paris Convention may not necessarily be to our advantage. It may well be that many of the items in that Convention are more to the commercial advantage of the more industrialised countries where they put more into research than we do.  I wish we put more money into research.  We should not necessarily be too hung up on the basis that what is good for the highly industrialised countries of Europe is necessarily equally good for us.  There is a potentially vast difference in possible situations <Col N="290" /> between different categories of patents and what would have led to them.  For that reason there should be a degree of flexibility permitted here in the term granted.  The section as it stands is a fixed term irrespective of what was involved or what work or expense went into that patent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no strong feelings about the appropriate number of years, but whatever number is appropriate I think it should be the same for all inventions. Deputy Taylor's point in mentioning section 65 is interesting, and I agree that seems to reflect a willingness to cut down in the public interest the profit which a patent or otherwise might expect. That is an instance in which the Oireachtas itself has singled out a particular area as being one which for social reasons needs adjustment in favour of the public interest against a private interest.  I would not quarrel with that.  It was for that reason that the Government I supported removed VAT from those very items in 1973 &mdash; food and medicine.  It would be quite a different matter to leave it to another authority, the controller, to make up his own mind on criteria which are not supplied for him which patent should have a currency of five years and which 15.  I do not think discrimination of that kind can lawfully be entrusted to anyone in this country except the Oireachtas itself.  I think it would fall foul of the same principle which underlay the adverse decision of the High Court on the Livestock Marts Bill ten years ago.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Deputy Kelly has said.  I do not think this amendment would be practicable.  The European Convention contains the sentence: &ldquo;The term of the European patent shall be 20 years as from the date of the filing of the application&rdquo;.  I am informed that in every European country which is a signatory to this convention the term is 20 years.  Modern thinking in regard to patents suggests that 20 years is the appropriate period.  An invention costs money to develop and market and modern life makes these processes more and more expensive.  It is widely thought in <Col N="291" /> Europe that 20 years is the appropriate period.  In any event it would be impossible for the controller to decide what period should apply if it were not a fixed one.  He would be at a loss to know what criteria to apply in making the decision. It would have to be spelled out for him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would stifle invention in this country certainly if the period here were to be significantly shorter than the period now applying in the whole of Europe.  Under the amendment the period could be as short as one quarter of the standard European term and clearly that is very much too low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the point that there should be any difficulty for the controller in assessing what period would be appropriate.  The basis on which he would do it is specified in the amendment. He does it on the basis of determining what is reasonable to enable the inventor to secure a fair return.  That is very similar to what is in the Bill in a different context in section 65 (2) which says that in settling the terms of licences the controller is to endeavour to secure that food, medicines and medical, surgical and other remedial devices are available to the public at the lowest prices <Col N="292" /> consistent with the proprietors of the patents deriving a reasonable advantage from their patents.</P>
      <P>He is given that precise power in the Bill to determine what terms would be reasonable to enable the patentor to obtain a reasonable advantage.  The section deals with the sanctioning of licences and the controller has to settle the terms of the licence under the section.  Where he is settling the terms of licences dealing with food and medicines he must do it in such a way that the prices are kept as low as possible consistent with the patentors deriving a reasonable advantage from their patents.  He is involved there in the matter of what the research cost and what was involved in obtaining the patent and so on.  I fail to see the Minister's or Deputy Kelly's point on that issue.  If it is in order for the controller to do it in that context, it seems to me it would be in order for him to do in this context.  We should be at pains here to ensure that prices are kept to a minimum.  That is really what is involved.  That is the directive of 65 (2), and it is admirable that it should be so, particularly admirable that it should apply to food and medicine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The striving to keep prices as low as possible does not have to be confined to food and medicines.  There are other essential commodities in everyday use and it would be entirely wrong that they should be kept artifically high as a result of a patentor obtaining an unreasonable advantage from his patent.  That is all I am suggesting in the words of section 65 (2) applicable to food and medicines.  Of course we must encourage research so that inventions will be made and nobody &mdash; certainly not I &mdash; would wish to deny an inventor a reasonable return.  All I say is that it would be inappropriate that he should get an unreasonable return on a particular invention of a particular product that might have widespread consumer use which was produced at very low cost in research by a fortunate accident.  Of course the person must get a reasonable return, but you could have a situation where he would get it for 20 years when it had cost him very little, and the profit he would make from the consumers would be completely out of proportion to <Col N="293" /> what was involved in it.  This fixity here seems unnatural and takes no account of the fact that patents and the research involved could fall into completely different categories.  Some might be discovered at a cost of £500 while others might have cost hundreds of thousands of pounds.  Yet both are given the same duration of 20 years.  The food and medicines provision recognises that differential and the general provision should do the same.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with a totally different matter from section 65. The two cannot be compared.  Section 65 deals with licences, not with patents.  The licence is only a minor thing that has always been controlled by the controller. The patent is a fundamental document conveying all the rights but the licence is temporary, allowing manufacture.  It has been the practice in the past where someone applies for a right to exercise a patent that it is a short-term thing and, naturally, it is done on terms that will be reasonably advantageous to the patent owner.  The licensee has no rights at all and it is perfectly easy for the controller to impose terms on him.  He has not invented it or done anything to facilitate it.  The Deputy is making an error in comparing the two sections because they are about two fundamentally different things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is the controller who is settling the terms and there is nothing there to indicate that it is a short term.  It could be a long term.  There is a fair measure of similarity between the two situations.  The point I am making is that <Col N="294" /> the controller is given the task and the power under section 65 (2) to go into the question of what is a reasonable return for the proprietors of the patent.  The point of the amendment is that that should be a factor in determining the monopoly right of the patentor to use his patent and that that should be curtailed in appropriate cases.</P>

He could supply quite innocent materials. Admittedly, it provides that he has to know whether they are intended for putting those goods to use for the purpose of committing a breach of patent.  Is that not putting a bit much on a third party who had been manufacturing and selling innocent goods?  The responsibility for a breach of patent should rest primarily with the person who is committing the breach and to cast the net to a person further removed, who would be supplying goods which could be used or even if he suspects might be used for committing the breach of patent, is casting the protection to a patentor very wide.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is as wide as the Deputy fears.  Subsection (1) defines the indirect use which is to be prohibited.  In principle, it is an offence to supply or offer to supply goods which are needed to carry out a patented invention except to the patentee or his licensee. However, to avoid interfering with normal business transactions, three limiations are stated.  The goods must relate to an essential element of the invention itself, that is the parts which, when assembled constitute the invention and not just well known tools which are needed for the assembly.  The supplier must know or be reasonably expected to know that the goods are suitable and intended for putting the invention into effect and the third limitation is in subsection (2) which makes clear that the offer or sale in the ordinary course of business of staple commercial products, even if essential to the invention will not be an infringement unless such offer or sale is by way of an inducement to the persons supplied to infringe, for example by furnishing directions for use in the patented manner.</P>

      <P>As I understand it paragraph (c) refers to a compounding operation in a pharmacy where, for example, a doctor gave a prescription, the makeup of which was the equivalent of a patented drug, but for some reason did not wish the patient to buy the patented drug under its trade name but wanted the chemist to make up the prescription.  If the chemist did so he would not be in <Col N="299" /> breach of the patentee's rights.  The 1964 Act did not cover that but then patentees did not seek to enforce their rights.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would inquire at his leisure if there is anything behind it.  The number of drugs which do not come in a form made up by a manufacturing pharmaceutical firm would be very small.  Perhaps there is some kind of calamine lotion for bee stings and so on which an old-fashioned chemist would pound up for himself, but my limited experience would lead me to think that when a modern chemist goes behind the screen what one hears is the glug glug of something being poured from one bottle into another or the rattling of pills into a weighing tray.  The area in which this exemption looks like operating is tiny. Any drug which is simple enough to be compounded behind the screen by an ordinary chemist was probably invented by a man who is long since dead, possibly before the turn of the century.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett, Clare) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett, Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Clare):</i> I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Sixth International Tin Agreement, 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dáil approval of the terms of this agreement is necessary in accordance with Article 29.5.2º of the Constitution which stipulates that &ldquo;the State shall not be bound by an international agreement <Col N="301" /> involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>An explanatory memorandum has been prepared and circulated to Deputies. It outlines the provisions of the agreement and covers the question of the costs of Irish participation.  I shall therefore mention only the essential points. The International Tin Agreement, 1981 was concluded under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) at the United Nations Conference on Tin held in Geneva in June 1981.  Some 54 countries, including Ireland, representing nine exporting countries and 45 importing countries participated in the conference.</P>
    <P>By 30 April 1982 the agreement had been signed by six exporting and 18 importing countries.  By virtue of a Council decision of 22 March 1982, the latter included the ten member states of the European Economic Community and the Community itself.</P>
    <P>The main objectives of the agreement are to alleviate serious difficulties arising from surplus or shortages of tin and to prevent excessive fluctuations in the price of tin and in the export earnings from tin of developing producer member states. To this end, an international buffer stock consisting of 50,000 tonnes of primary tin metal will be established.  A buffer stock manager will offer to buy and sell tin in a manner designed to keep its price within an agreed price range.</P>
    <P>The financing of the buffer stock will be met by direct Government contributions, (shared equally between the exporting and importing members) borrowing and/or by Government guarantees. Each consumer member will meet an apportionment of the cost based on its consumption of primary tin metal as a percentage of total consumption.  At this stage it is not possible to assess accurately Ireland's apportionment of these costs because of variables, such as the number of countries likely to adhere to the agreement. However, it is estimated that, based on our reassessed percentage share (.004 per cent) of consumption within the <Col N="302" /> consumer members group, our financial commitment should not exceed £7,500, over the lifetime of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Should the buffer stock operations prove unsuccessful in stabilising market prices provision has been made within the agreement for the introduction of export controls to be observed by the producers.</P>
    <P>In addition, members, will be required to make an annual contribution to the administrative budget of the International Tin Organisation.  Ireland's contribution will be in proportion to its number of votes in the Council.  The experience of administrative payments to the present Tin Organisation suggests that our annual contribution under this heading will be of the order of £7,000.</P>
    <P>Ireland's direct economic interest in the agreement is modest.  Among consumer countries, we account for only .004 per cent of total consumption.  Our imports of tin and tin alloys were approximately 67 tonnes in 1981.  They consisted largely of semi-processed tin-bearing products for use in soldering activities in the electronics and electroplating areas of industry.  Although the levels of these imports are not high, our dependence on them for certain industrial activities means that we have an interest in preventing excessive price fluctuations and ensuring adequate supplies at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>The International Tin Agreement is, moreover, the oldest agreement between producers and consumers of commodities and has generally been held to be the most successful.  Buffer stocks under previous agreements had been financed mainly by producers, with voluntary contributions only from consumers.  Ireland had not made any voluntary contribution. Only in the recent past have market prices dropped to the point where support buying by the buffer stock has been necessary.</P>
    <P>The present agreement has been renegotiated in the framework of UNCTAD's Integrated Programme for Commodities. The twin pillars of this ambitious programme, which was adopted at Nairobi in 1976, are international jointly-financed agreements between <Col N="303" /> producers and consumers of named commodities and the Common Fund.  I am happy to say that the Common Fund for Commodities Bill, 1981, was signed by the President on 22 May 1982.  Ireland will therefore be in a position to ratify the Common Fund Agreement in the near future.  Three commodity agreements eligible for association with the Common Fund have been negotiated to date.  The International Natural Rubber Agreement, 1979, entered into force definitively on 17 April 1982.  The International Cocoa Agreement, 1980, has been provisionally in force since 1 August 1981.  Provided the required number of countries participate, the present agreement will enter into force provisionally on 1 July 1982.  Despite these achievements, progress in implementing the Integrated Programme for Commodities has been somewhat slow.  For our part, we attach considerable importance to the co-operative venture between producers and consumers which the IPC represents. As a comprehensive attempt to bring about desired changes in the prevailing economic order through a process of negotiations between developed and developing countries, the programme deserves our continued support.  It is in this spirit that I commend the International Tin Agreement, 1981, to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister of State responsible for the Office of Public Works has pointed out, there is supposed to be a comprehensive attempt to bring about changes in the prevailing economic order through a process of negotiations between developed and developing countries. In that context this agreement comes before this House for approval and fits definitely into the category of a development co-operation issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before the House is in the name of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. With no disrespect to the Minister of State opposite, the first question I must pose is: where is the Minister for Foreign Affairs?  Why does he continue to be silent on development co-operation issues?  On behalf of the Opposition, and <Col N="304" /> indeed of all those interested in development co-operation issues, I must raise this issue again.  Two weeks ago there was an important Bill before this House, the International Commodities Bill, when again the Minister for Foreign Affairs declined to grace this House or to give its Members any idea as to what were his views on development co-operation issues.  In that context &mdash; and the fact that today we have yet another such issue before the House when he has not appeared here &mdash; it seems to me that he is treating not just this House but also the whole area of development co-operation with contempt.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the next question. Who in the Government, if anybody, accepts any responsibility for development co-operation issues?  Can it be the elusive Minister who has been remarkably silent on the subject?  As far as we know the area of overseas aid is not to have a Minister of State under the present regime.  We now find this important and growing area with a budget in the current year of the order of £26 million drifting in many directions.  I make those remarks with no disrespect to the Minister of State who is present and is obviously standing in for his own Department but I have to voice my concern at this important area being neglected in this fashion.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the amount of State funds now involved in development co-operation, over £26 million in the current year, and there is the question of the policy issues that have to be decided in this area.  There was the commitment of the last Government to the UN target of .7 per cent before the end of the decade with an annual timetable to reach that and the commitment to produce a White Paper.  On all those issues the Government are completely silent.  I can only say that having this agreement coming before the House on the Order Paper in the name of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and without his presence or his views on this or any other such item, is a further indication, if one were necessary, of the complete disinterest of the Government in this area.</P>
    <P>This side of the House support the agreement.  Let us not in any way consider <Col N="305" /> that it is a major step in the establishment of the new international economic order.  When we discussed the Commodities Bill a few weeks ago it was clear that the Commodity Fund could relate to quite a large list of commodities produced mainly in the developing world but any help, as far as I can gather, under the Commodity Fund arrangements, has to be related to having international agreements for the particular commodities where help is to be given.  It seems clear that the progress in establishing such international agreements is remarkably slow.  So far, there have been only three renegotiations of old agreements since Nairobi in relation to tin, cocoa and rubber.  That is not a record, after six years, which those interested in making progress within the framework of UNCTAD's integrated programme for commodities can be very proud of.  In Nairobi we indicated that we were very attached to the idea of regulating the market in those areas so that the producer countries could have a fairer deal.  We were prominent in associating ourselves with the adoption of the Nairobi resolution long before many other countries of the western world were.  I suppose, being such a small trading nation in global terms, we cannot expect to make any major change in the affairs of the world but we have a moral voice.  It is important that we continue to use that voice in every way we can.  That is all the more reason why the current lack of interest in this area by the Government is so disturbing.</P>
    <P>In regard to the tin agreement it is clear that the prosperity of base metals depends on buoyant industrial production. Of course, in the light of the recession throughout the world over the last few years, the tin producers have been having a pretty rough time, the same as the producers of most basic commodities. Unfortunately, most of these are located in the developing world.  The result is that the economies of some of those Third World countries who are largely dependent on the production of base metals have been seriously affected.  The agreement will provide a small amount of assistance to those countries in that situation.  The provision for the buffer <Col N="306" /> stocks should provide some continuity in the markets.</P>
    <P>There are some questions which still remain open and unanswered.  There are no clauses in this tin agreement to stop the USA from selling tin from its strategic stockpile.  I understand that stockpile is pretty large.  <i>The Economist</i> of 4 April 1981 stated that the amount they are trying to dispose of is 30,000 long tonnes of tin.  Despite this agreement I can see difficulties where there are no restrictions on the disposal of the stockpile from the point of view of maintaining a stable price in world terms.  A figure of 30,000 tonnes may not seem very large, but when it is taken in the context of a total annual non-communist supply of only 200,000 tons it is pretty significant.</P>
    <P>There are questions still unanswered in regard to this agreement.  At the same time the agreement is one which has been renegotiated in the framework of UNCTAD's integrated programme for commodities and in that situation it deserves our support.  I believe the House, while accepting that it is a fairly small step towards the new economic order and while our direct economic interest in the agreement is modest enough, will agree it is important that we be in the forefront of those countries of the western world supporting the agreement.</P>
    <P>There is support from this side of the House for the International Tin Agreement. We would like to see our country playing its part in the months and in the years ahead in helping to ensure that there would be further such commodity agreements, fresh agreements negotiated in areas where no such agreements exist or renegotiation of old ones in the spirit of Nairobi.  We must raise our voice increasingly in regard to these matters, in the UN fora and anywhere that people come together in an effort to achieve a fair system of trading in the world.  We must raise our voice in any place in which groups of people are trying genuinely to make improvements and to overcome objections from countries which perhaps have a strong vested interest in ensuring that the present economic order continues exactly as it is.  This agreement must have our support.  However, I conclude <Col N="307" /> on the point that it represents only one issue in the development co-operation area, but it is one which should have provided the Minister for Foreign Affairs with an opportunity of giving us his views in that area both in regard to his general policy and specifically in regard to the multilateral side of development co-operation. I regret very much that the Minister has not taken that opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party support this agreement, but there are a few brief points I wish to make concerning it. In his speech the Minister referred to the constitutional requirement which provides that an agreement of this kind must be brought before the Dáil and approved by the Dáil.  I tend to derive from the tone of this part of the Minister's speech that the agreement is before the House by way of an obligation to satisfy a constitutional requirement rather than by way of any great urge to discuss the context in which the International Tin Agreement is before us for approval.  I concur with Deputy O'Keeffe in what he has said about the atmosphere in which motions such as these come before the House.  I recall that when the Seanad discussed the UN conference in Nairobi in some detail, we had what was then for us a very rare opportunity of trying to tease out what might be an appropriate development philosophy for this country. On that occasion, speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, I concentrated on the technology transfer aspect of the conference. What did come out of the 1976 Conference was the possibility of the twin principles of a common fund and agreements of this kind.  If, having said that we are bound to bring motions of this kind before the Dáil, and then to say later that our direct economic interest is modest, makes it almost incumbent on us to discuss the philosophy in which the agreement was offered to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret to say that I discern, in an atmosphere in which our domestic economic difficulties are great, a certain erosion of interest in the whole question of what is our appropriate relationship with the developing world.  If we take this <Col N="308" /> motion, for example, in isolation, it becomes almost meaningless.  There are specifics that arise from such omission. One of these has been adverted to but I should like to point to it a little more.  If we take the requirements of this agreement, merely sticking to the agreement, they have meaning only when they are related to the overall commercial strategy of the countries involved.  One knows then whether the agreement represents a shift in philosophy.</P>
    <P>It is important to remind the House that we are speaking about negotiations between signatory countries, between consuming countries and producing countries, in conditions in which many would suggest that the connection within the economic order as between producing and consuming countries is being negotiated in its entirety.  We are in a curious position in that we know very little about what is the official position of the country in relation to the restructuring of the international economic order.</P>
    <P>As one who is interested positively in such matters I would like to know the attitude of the Government on the broad suggestions of the Brandt Report, for example, I should like to know what is the attitude of the Government in the general area of development co-operation but I find it somewhat disappointing that we are told that because of a constitutional requirement the agreement must be brought before us while at the same time we are told that the agreement has little direct economic interest for us.  We should not dispose cursorily of matters such as this.  The agreement is one which deals with only three commodities but it has an importance for us because it focuses on the results of the Nairobi Conference. It recalls that conference and makes it necessary for us to put it in context with its general development philosophy.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of urging on the Minister of State the necessity for the Government to allow us time to debate our economic practices within the broader context of attitude towards the developing world.  The Labour Party note the agreement as representing some small progress, but I would refuse to <Col N="309" /> merely take the agreement, say that we agree with it now and leave it at that. This agreement points to our silence on deep issues of development co-operation, a silence that ill becomes us.  We in the Labour Party have always been quick in regard to these matters of co-operation to indicate our support for any renegotiation of the international economic order, but in addition I request formally that we be given an opportunity of debating the broader issues of which an agreement such as this is but one part.  It is not simply a matter of an agreement that arises from a conference which is of little importance to us.  This agreement expresses the relationship of consuming and producing countries and calls into question the whole philosophy of international trade in terms of production and consumption. These are not broad abstract matters. They are important matters.</P>

It is vital that such a committee should exist in order to monitor this body of external law which is now a part of our national system.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the Joint Committee, as formulated in 1977, give the committee authority to examine <Col N="313" /> Community legislation at three stages in the process of its adoption.  It may examine legislation at the draft stage, it may examine Community Acts, and, finally, it may examine Ministerial regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972, and instruments, made under other statutes, in order to implement our Community obligations.</P>
    <P>The new Joint Committee will consist of 18 members of Dáil Éireann, and eight Members of the Seanad, thus totalling 26 which is the same number as its predecessor. Unfortunately, the most recent Joint Committee did not have the opportunity to meet during the period of the last Dáil and Seanad.  This was because the various steps establishing it took some months to complete.  It is all the more urgent now that the new Joint Committee should be set up without delay.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference before the House today are identical to those agreed by the Oireachtas when in the process of constituting the most recent Joint Committee. I should like to explain again, for the benefit of the House, the additions to the terms of reference which were agreed on the last occasion.  In a report of March 1980, the Joint Committee recommended certain amendments to its Orders of Reference taking cognisance of the fact that the European Assembly is now a directly elected body.  The first of these has been incorporated in the motion before the House, namely that the phrase which provided that: &ldquo;delegates to the Assembly of the European Communities be notified of meetings and be allowed to attend and take part in the proceedings without having a right to vote&rdquo;, be amended to read that: &ldquo;representatives in the European Assembly, who are also Members of either House of the Oireachtas&rdquo; have the privilege set out above.  The effect of this change is merely to formalise an existing state of affairs, namely, that members of European Parliament are no longer appointed by the Dáil, apart from those filling casual vacancies, but are elected by direct universal suffrage.</P>
    <P>The second recommendation concerns the question of membership of the Joint Committee by MEPs.  Before the 1979 <Col N="314" /> European elections, members of the Oireachtas nominated as members of the European Parliament, were <i>ex officio</i> members of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation.  This arrangement was not, in practice, a success, and the terms of reference of the Joint Committee appointed in 1977 expressly stated that members of the European Parliament would be precluded from membership of the Joint Committee.  They would, however, be notified of meetings and be allowed to attend and take part in the proceedings, without having a right to vote.  The Joint Committee also recommended that the phrase which precludes members of the European Parliament from membership of the Joint Committee be deleted.  This suggestion has not been adopted.  Rather, the whole question of the relationship between MEPs and the Dáil and Seanad will be examined by the Joint Committee.  Provision has been made for this by an addition to the terms of reference of the Joint Committee, which gives it a mandate &ldquo;to examine the question of dual membership of the Dáil or Seanad and the European Assembly, and to consider the relations between the Irish Representatives in the European Assembly and the Dáil and Seanad...&rdquo;. The Government consider that the Joint Committee, which has already touched on aspects of this question of the dual mandate, and the overall relationships between the Oireachtas and the European Assembly, is the proper forum for the examination of these questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I note again the absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs from the House although this motion is in his name.  The setting up of the Joint Committee is an important matter and I would like to have heard the Minister's views on the activities of that Joint Committee.  I will leave the matter at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further point which is worth considering.  The motion is framed on the basis that it is expedient that a joint committee of both Houses be established. The matter will go to the Seanad and then come back to this House for the actual establishment of the committee. We have been without this committee for <Col N="315" /> a considerable time and much work has piled up.  I suggest that it is in order at this stage to examine this rather cumbersome procedure whereby joint committees are set up.  Why is it necessary to have the matter on the Order Paper today on an expediency motion, while in due course it must come back again for the establishment of the committee?  We must consider how to make the procedures of this House more effective.  I see no reason why we should not revise our procedures to ensure that the job in this House today could be completed today, then dealt with by the Seanad and the matter put into operation.  That cannot happen under present procedures.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Government have included in the list of guidelines under which the committee will operate the additions suggested by the previous Government regarding examination of the question of dual mandate and relations between MEPs and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I compliment the Government on their adoption of the additions introduced by the previous Government.  It is of prime importance that these issues be examined without delay.  European elections will be held in 1984 and the question of dual mandate must be examined as objectively as possible and suggestions made as to its continuance or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Perhaps more important will be consideration by the committee of the relationship between MEPs and the Oireachtas. If the dual mandate ends there is a possibility that all contact between Leinster House and the European Parliament will be lost and we will lose as a result.  MEPs are involved in a different forum where they are dealing with representatives from countries of the EEC and involved in various committees of the European Parliament.  It is important that we know as much as possible about what is going on and have the benefit of the views of our MEPs, particularly in relation to the position of Ireland in the EEC.  How this is to be achieved I am not sure.  Although constitutional problems may be involved, it might be appropriate for MEPs to have the right of address in this House on <Col N="316" /> European issues.  They would have a lot to offer in such debates and I hope the committee will consider this possibility in detail.</P>
    <P>The motion provides that representatives in the European Assembly who are also Members of either House be notified of meetings and allowed to attend and take part in the proceedings but not allowed to vote.  What about those MEPs who are not Members of the Oireachtas? This provision seems to be discriminatory to some degree.  I understand that this is a joint committee and technically there are reasons for this provision; but it seems highly improper that while, for instance, Deputy Tom O'Donnell might have something to offer to that committee, Mr. T.J. Maher, MEP, would not be in a position to attend.  This whole matter must be examined.</P>
    <P>Since this committee was first established in 1973 it has been traditional for the chairman to be appointed from the ranks of the Opposition and I should like an assurance from the Minister of State that this tradition will be continued.</P>
    <P>As someone who served on this Committee between 1977 and 1981 I wish to put on record my appreciation of the outstanding service given by the staff of the Committee.  I do so on my own behalf and on behalf of others who have served on the committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of this committee.  We need it, and in view of the backlog of work its early establishment is essential.  I served on the committee from its foundation in 1973 until 1977 and it was chaired at that time by Deputy Haughey, the present Taoiseach. I acquired a view about the work of the committee during those four years and came to the opinion that the manner in which they organised their work between 1977 and 1981 by the setting up of sub-committees was a significant improvement in the work of the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My first point concerns the manner in which the proceedings of the committee come before the general Dáil and Seanad for consideration.  It is not satisfactory, and we must consider the most appropriate <Col N="317" /> manner in which the work of the committee can come before the Dáil and Seanad in general session.  I am not sure whether this is a matter for the committee or for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Other parliamentary assemblies in Europe have different strategies for handling the question of secondary legislation.  Questions must be raised in the minds of those who are worried about parliamentary accountability when one looks at our Order Paper with its thousand questions.  Every week we make provision for a large number of questions, many of which are very particular and one must look at the same time at the total amount of Dáil time devoted to considering the impact of legislation.  We have been deficient in allowing time within our existing arrangement for the work of the committee.  All Deputies need to do is to look at the Official Report and see how little space has been given in the printed record to reports of the sittings of the committee.  Yet, the implication of matters discussed by the committee are immense.  That is my first point.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I should like to repeat a point I made in 1973 when I represented the Labour Party on the committee.  In the Minister's speech he referred to the manner in which the committee can examine legislation in three stages: at the draft stage; secondly, it can examine Community Acts; and, thirdly, it can examine ministerial regulations.  In the period between 1973 and 1977 we had a problem as I saw it which arose in relation to the terms of reference of the committee.</P>
    <P>I believed that documents that had been leaked to the level of the Community semi-formally should be put before us and that we should be free to discuss matters of a more general nature before they had arrived at the status of draft laws.  Between 1973 and 1977 there were two views in the committee.  The more general view argued that we should be able to discuss general matters which arose shortly after Ireland became a member of the Community and there was the narrower view that argued we should monitor things closely and narrowly as <Col N="318" /> they came before us.  This second view tended to be reinforced by the vast amount of work that had to be processed. The result was that those of us who considered the more general issues should be discussed felt that at the end of the day we had to accept we would be delaying work and we had to accept that matters should operate very pragmatically and, I felt, very narrowly.</P>
    <P>There are other points in relation to the media.  The general attitude was that there was very little interest in the work of the committee, almost creating a disincentive to the members to put in work on it.  In the four years between 1973 and 1977, honesty compels me to say that there were considerable difficulties on many occasions in getting a quorum.  I felt there was not sufficient public interest in the work of the committee.</P>
    <P>To tie my two points together, I would favour rearrangement of the procedures of this House in which European matters would be discussed on a regular basis rather than in terms of a full report. Secondly, I would prefer media response to the work of the committee that allowed work in Europe to be discussed on a regular basis, particularly in the provincial press.</P>
    <P>On the more general points raised, there is an importance in having people who have a definite experience and they should be facilitated in attending.  At the same time, the committee must contain efficacy in terms of its own operation. When I left the committee in 1977 and looked back on the four years and when I thought of the various groups affected by the regulations and instruments, my impression was one of vast unaccountability. One could say one had formally gone through the motions of examining matters but often at great speed and with little interest on the part of the Dáil or the Seanad.  I recall speeches in the House where people spoke of difficulties with regard to catching planes and the difficulties of travelling from one part of Ireland to another in comparison with travelling from one part of Europe to another, but these were general remarks and had little to do with the precise detailed work of the committee.  I came <Col N="319" /> to the conclusion that if one balanced the peripheral nature of many of the questions on the Order Paper and looked at the impact of much of the work of the committee on the day-to-day life of Ireland, commercially and socially, one might have been better served in having an easier mechanism for the work of the committee to be brought before the Dáil and Seanad in that way encouraging better participation by elected Members in the work of the committee and arousing greater interest in the public with regard to the working of the committee.</P>
    <P>I welcome the formation of the committee and wish it success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Clare):</i> I should like to thank Deputies for their contributions. With regard to the points raised by Deputy Higgins, some reports were debated but they were not many when one considers the number of reports issued.  Out of a total of 90 reports, two were debated in this House and nine were debated in the Seanad.  I suppose it depends on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>The question of the dual mandate was discussed.  I do not know if it was discussed often or extensively in the committee but I do not think any firm proposals or recommendations resulted. That will be a matter for the joint committee when it gets underway.  I do not know any reason why the chairman should not come from the Opposition parties.</P>
      <P>The question was raised about attendance of MEPs.  As we have said, MEPs who are Members of the Oireachtas may attend the committee but it is a committee of Oireachtas Members.  For that reason people like T.J. Maher, MEP, and our own MEPs would not be entitled to attend at the committee as it is at present constituted, but Deputies such as Deputy Tom O'Donnell and others who are Members of the Oireachtas would be able to attend.  That would be a matter for the joint committee to debate and to find out what ideas they may have on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather Deputy Higgins was disappointed at the operation of the committee. <Col N="320" /> Quorums are often a problem with committees of this House.  That has been the case with regard to the Public Accounts Committee.  I was a member of that committee and I know that frequently we had difficulty in getting sufficient members for a quorum.  I should think it depends considerably on when a committee meets; for instance, I should think that it would be more difficult to get members to attend on a Thursday afternoon rather than a Wednesday afternoon.  This kind of difficulty has always prevailed.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions and their co-operation in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is rather unusual in what it does.  It is illustrative of the pattern that is exhibited in this Bill in bending over backwards in favour of people who own patents.  I quite appreciate that they have to have reasonable protection but in a number of respects &mdash; and I referred to one of them earlier &mdash; there is a shift in the normal burden of proof that is applicable to any normal legal situation.  Normally a person bringing a case has to establish that case.  That is the standard practice in all legal proceedings in every kind of case where legal rights have been infringed, contracts, tort or whatever.  But here we find that the burden of proof is shifted and that a person can find himself as a defendant having to establish his own innocence. This, as a principle, is entirely wrong.  It could be illustrated in a situation where a patent was in existence for making, say, ammonia by a particular process and it turns out that another person is making ammonia.  The first person who owns the patent for making ammonia by that particular process then issues legal proceedings. The normal course which is applicable to every single case of civil proceedings that I know of is that the person bringing the claim has to establish the facts.  That often presents difficulties, It is not easy, even if a person has a good claim, to be able to establish a case.  But here this section transfers the burden onto the defendant and he has to explain satisfactorily that he is making his ammonia by a process other than that which is the subject of the patent.  I do not think a key matter, the burden of proof in that kind of situation, is warranted in patent legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a comment which contains an implicit suggestion that it might <Col N="322" /> be amended.  First, the device of reversing the burden of proof is reasonably well known.  I can agree it is not desirable to extend it beyond what is reasonable but here we are dealing with a process which is not scrutable to the patentor, a process being tried out by somebody else, let us say a competitor, in premises which the patentor has no right to enter and who has no right to interrogate the employees. It seems not an entirely unreasonable idea that where the product in question is a new product there should be a <i>prima facie</i> presumption that it has been produced by the up to now only process known for producing this new product. The example given by Deputy Taylor of ammonia seems not particularly in point because ammonia is an old product and can in fact be produced by perfectly natural means without any intervention of human ingenuity, as anybody who has ever changed a baby's nappy will know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

      <P>Again there is a provision here which is rather unusual in terms of normal legal law.  That is subsection (1) (a) which gives the power to the owner of a patent to apply for an injunction restraining a defendant from an apprehended act of infringement.  That is not normal procedure.  Normally one cannot get an injunction to restrain someone from doing something which one apprehends he will do: one has to wait until he does it or commences to do it and one can then get an injunction to restrain him.  That category of injunction, <i>quia timet</i>, is not normal and there seems no particular reason to give such a wide-ranging power as that just because a patentor may have an apprehension that there may be a breach.  Why should he not wait until the breach occurs and then apply for his injunction?</P>

I quite agree with the tenor of the section that it would be inappropriate to award damages, but might it not be reasonable to extend that a little bit further by saying that an innocent person who was not aware that a patent existed should not be <Col N="324" /> condemned on costs either, as that could be quite a heavy burden on its own account even without damages?</P>

      <P>This section provides a remedy for groundless threats of infringement proceedings.  Subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>Unless in any action brought by virtue of this section the defendant proves that the acts in respect of which proceedings were threatened constitute or, if done, would constitute, an infringement of a patent, the plaintiff shall be entitled to the following relief, that is to say,</P>

      <P>(b)  ......</P>
      <P>(c)  ......  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of that under cover of a different kind of action is to force the defendant to make his case at once, notwithstanding the fact that he may not even be <Col N="326" /> the owner of a patent &mdash; not that that is particularly material.  If the object is to force the defendant into bringing the proceedings at once in this form, which is envisaged as merely threatened, it would be better to say so.  If, on the other hand, it is envisaged as a purely interlocutory relief, it is a bit tough to expect the defendant to prove his case.  Would it not be enough for him to be allowed carry on with his threats and advertisements if he were able to show he had reasonable grounds for supposing a patent had been infringed?  I have no strong views about this.  In other words, if the Minister thinks he ought to be put in the position of having to prove that the patent is being infringed and that he should be called on at once to put up or shut up, then perhaps that is not unreasonable; but it is a curiously roundabout way of making him introduce what sounds like a purely interlocutory arrangement.  Then, if the plaintiff fails, the defendant presumably is still faced with the job of getting himself a substance of declaration in form of law in regard to the ownership of the patent. That is a remedy which is not envisaged in these three paragraphs.</P>

      <P>This section provides protection, for example, against the activities of a patentee who coerces the customers of a competitor into ceasing to buy the competitor's goods without being prepared to put his patent and his complaint of infringement to the test of court proceedings.  In such cases the competitor who is aggrieved by such threats may bring proceedings before the court.  Such protection is given by section 61 of the 1964 Act.  That section goes further in that it prevents a patentee giving a clear warning of alleged infringement, to the competitor himself, when he is considered to be making or importing infringing products or using an infringing process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 50 therefore removes the protection given by section 61 of the 1964 Act to primary infringers while retaining it for their customers.  Subsections (1), (2) and (4) reproduce section 61 of the 1964 Act subject to drafting.  Subsection (1) allows any person aggrieved, who need not be the person to whom the <Col N="327" /> threat is addressed, to bring proceedings, under subsection (2) if the threat proves unjustifiable, the patentee is liable for damages and an injunction to restrain further threats.  Subsection (4) makes it clear that it is not a threat merely to notify a person of the existence of a patent. Subsection (3) is new compared with 1964.  It excludes the bringing of a threats action when the alleged infringement is the primary act of making or importing a product or using a process.</P>

      <P>I do not object to this, but the machinery is very peculiarly chosen. Let the Minister put himself in the position of a defendant.  In proceedings under this section the defendant is a person who, by circular, advertisement or otherwise, has threatened somebody else with proceedings for infringement of a patent. He is forced by the proceedings envisaged under this section into a defendant posture, but he cannot avoid being decreed under headings (a), (b) or (c) unless he proves that the acts in respect of which the proceedings were threatened constituted an infringement of the patent.  When he has proved that, he still has not got a declaration to that effect. All he has is a declaration that the threats were unjustifiable, an injunction against their continuance and damages.  He has not got what he would have been entitled to if he were to go ahead and carry out his threats.  In other words, so far as the letter of the law of procedure is concerned, he is back at square one having successfully but expensively defended the proceedings which this section creates. He still has to bring these proceedings to establish something which he cannot avoid being decreed for in the first proceedings unless he proves it.  Perhaps I have not put that very well.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this section, which is carried forward from the 1964 Act, is presumably to stop people threatening competitors by claiming ownership in respect of certain goods the competitor is selling.  The difficulty of such a person under the 1964 Act appears to be greater than it would be under this <Col N="328" /> section because the 1964 Act extended to making and importing as well as selling, and that has been dropped.  I should have thought that, if somebody genuinely felt another party was infringing his patent in terms of the goods the other party was selling, instead of issuing advertisements, circulars and other threats of that nature he should issue proceedings in the ordinary way.  If he does that, none of the onus is on him.</P>

      <P>I have often heard the Minister complain about the legal profession, of which he is himself an ornament, and what he seems to think is their exceptional dedication to making money which distinguishes them unfavourably from every other profession.  If that really is the Minister's belief, surely it was a dreadful mistake to make one clean job of these proceedings which he is forcing on the aggrieved party here.</P>

      <P>I may be wrong about this but it seems, as it stands, that the defendant here has been put to the expense and trouble of actually proving something which the Minister says if he had been more diligent and better advised he might have taken more active steps to prove in the first place.  He now has been put to the expense of proving it and the section as it stands provides no remedy for him. He gets nothing for his proof except that he avoids being decreed any of the forms of relief to the plaintiff.  In other words, he is not even left, at the end of the day, <Col N="330" /> with a declaration that an infringement has taken place.</P>

      <P>The court has not jurisdiction to make any order in his favour.  Its jurisdiction is strictly limited in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Kelly's point is well taken.  In that kind of situation, he would be entitled to raise a counterclaim, claiming an injunction for infringement of his patent, if he had one.  The court would be in a position to deal with that on a counterclaim.  In any case, there is nothing to stop him from bringing his own proceedings.  If he is claiming that a patent is being infringed and has issued threats to that effect it is a matter for him to bring his own proceeding and follow it up.  He could deal with it on a counterclaim.</P>

      <P>A successful defendant in these circumstances is probably likely to be looked on as a bit of a crank in some respects because he went about the thing in the way envisaged by the section. It may be that back in the past this practice was more prevalent than one would imagine it is now.  I doubt if it is very prevalent now.  Deputy Kelly is right that the successful defendant in these circumstances does not get a declaration in respect of his patent.  He can, however, either do what Deputy Taylor said, counterclaim in the same proceedings, or start separate ones.  If he cannot do either of those things, we will certainly see whether a case can be made for adding a subsection or just a paragraph to that effect.</P>

      <P>The basis of this amendment is that the individual concerned under subsection (2) (a) (i) (I) is given a fairly wide power to deal with his right.  He has the right to assign the right to it, or to transmit such right on death.  In subsection (3), for some reason which is not quite clear to me, he is not given the right to issue a licence in respect of it.  I can see no basis for drawing a distinction there.  Rights to assign it or transmit it on death are quite wide rights, and particularly the right of assignment.  If he is given the right to assign it, quite properly, should he not also logically have the right to grant a licence in respect of it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal in subsection (3) is felt to be fair, and no reason is seen to extend the rights of subsection (2) so as to grant a licence to do the acts protected.  The new rights in subsection (2) are considerable and it is felt they should not be extended further.  Section 52 generally introduces a new right into Irish patent law.  Prior to the 1964 Act a person who had been using an invention privately could obtain revocation of a later patent granted to someone else. This ground of revocation was abolished in the 1964 Act.  As things now stand, non-public use of an invention is vulnerable to an infringement action by a later patentee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite follow the reasoning.  It is not a question of subsection (3) granting a higher right than that granted by subsection (2).  Really the situation is the reverse.  The right of assignment granted in subsection (2) is a major right.  That is cut back in subsection (3) for some reason which seems to me illogical. The individual is given the right to assign the right.  In other words he can say: &ldquo;I own this right to do this process, or whatever&rdquo;, and he is quite at liberty to sell, assign or transfer that for all time to another person.  That is the right of assignment given to him.</P>
      <P>The right to grant a licence in respect of it would be a lesser thing than that.  He would say: &ldquo;I am not selling you this whole thing, but I am giving you permission by licence to use it for two or three years&rdquo;.  At the end of that period it would revert back and remain with that person. That is a lesser thing for him to do than to transfer the entire right absolutely by assignment for all time.  I agree that is an alteration of the law and a very valuable and welcome one.  If he is given the right of assignment why not allow him to grant a licence of it for a couple of years if it is suitable to him to do that?  He might not be in a position to exploit it himself, and he might want to get some money out of it by granting a licence for a year or two.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The right conveyed by the section is a right to continue a user begun before the date of filing or of priority. <Col N="334" /> It is thought that it would be going too far, as against the subsequent patentee, if a person who had that right of continuance of user for his own personal private use or advantage were to be allowed to license it out to others as against the interests of the patentee.  I am sure if the Deputy reflects on that he will agree.  It is fortuitous that a prior user will no longer be forbidden from a continuing use of the process where he had begun to use it beforehand, and as of today he is in breach of the patent.  To allow him to continue to use it for his own private use is one thing.  To seek to confer on him a right to license it out to others is very much another thing, and would be unfair to the genuine legal holder of the patent.</P>

    <P>What is involved here is merely the transfer of section 126 (6) to section 53 where it appears to be more appropriate.  The subsection now in section 53 provides that the date from which provisional protection under the section is put on is the earliest date on which any potential infringer would be able to examine the application in an official language of the State as a result of its publication by the Patent Co-Operation Treaty in English or its being made available here in translation.

      <P>The time period specified is three years.  Would the Minister consider reducing that?  This is applicable in cases where a patent either is not being used at all or is being under-used.  Utilisation of patents under those circumstances obviously could provide employment and generate economic activity. Perhaps three years is a bit too long to have to wait for utilisation of the process that would be controlled by it.  Perhaps the Minister would consider a period of two years as more appropriate in our present difficult economic circumstances?</P>

      <P>The unemployment situation is probably quite different now from what it was in 1883.  We should avail of every opportunity for providing employment.  There could be a situation where a patent was either not being used or was being under-used and it could be a source of employment.  Somebody could come along to get a compulsory licence as provided for this very purpose in the Bill and he may be stalled off for an extra year.  In the present strained economic circumstances it might be considered that two years would be sufficient to enable the owner of a patent to utilise it adequately.  Perhaps the Minister would consider the point.</P>

      <P>On the other hand, it was much quicker to get into production in 1883 than it is in 1982.  There must be <Col N="341" /> patents which it would be humanly, physically impossible to put into production in three years.  Take, for example, patents in industrial diamonds and look at how long people like De Beers and GE take to implement those because of the enormity of the investment.</P>

      <P>Then they are going to be caught out anyway if that is the case, because three years is what is provided for in the Bill.  If it is going to take four years it is not going to be provided in any case.  Most of these processes could be brought into production and employment provided within a year or so as there are plenty of factories available by the IDA to do so.  If two years go by from the date and nothing realistic has happened and if some Irish person is prepared to avail of this patent, provide employment and set something up, two years might cover most cases.  I will not labour the point any further.</P>

I am not sure that the expression &ldquo;discretionary power&rdquo; is clearly understood in Irish law.  It seems to me to be a rather porous expression which might not be far from being arbitrary.  I gave instances earlier of powers which are genuinely discretionary and the Minister cannot be called to account when he exercises them &mdash; appointments to boards and so on.  Powers to exercise statutory functions are not discretionary and I do not think they could be described properly as discretionary.  They are exercised with the specific purpose of achieving the objects of the Act.  I will not hold the House up but I am not entirely happy with the way the section has been drafted and perhaps the Minister would ask the Attorney General's Office to have a look at it to see if, after having it drawn to their attention, they still think it is appropriate to describe thus the kind of function of the controller when he makes a disposition which might affect somebody prejudicially.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The section provides that the High Court or Supreme Court hearing a dispute in connection with a patent may call in the assistance of an assessor. It provides that the expenses of the assessor, which could be substantial, will be fixed by the court and will be paid as part of the expenses incurred by the Minister, in other words, the taxpayer.  It seems to me that the expenses of the assessor should be paid by the unsuccessful party to the proceedings.  Such proceedings represent very high-powered business, multinational millionaire firms arguing about patent infringements or revocations, and it seems rather hard on the taxpayer that he should be involved to meet the cost of the assessor who would have been called in.  It would seem more appropriate that either of the parties, or both jointly, who are having the benefit of the assessor, would bear the cost.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to look at the use of the word &ldquo;directions&rdquo; in line 50, at the end of page 53.  I am not sure of the precise legal meaning of the word.  In context with the words &ldquo;Attorney General&rdquo; it may have been used instead of &ldquo;advice&rdquo;.  However, I suggest it would be out of the question for the controller in the exercise of his quasijudicial responsibilities to be bound by directions given to him by the Attorney General or by any other lawyer.  He might listen to their advice but I do not think the Attorney General can tell him what to do.</P>

I do not remember the facts of the case but it was about the entitlement to a pension or status of an official who worked in the Chief State Solicitor's office.  What happened was a deciding officer had been given a direction by the Minister for Social Welfare, which presumably went back to the Attorney General's office ultimately, as to the status of the man and the judge said that this could not be done.  The deciding officer, albeit a member of the Department himself, was there to decide according to his own best judgement what the entitlement of the official was.</P>

The Minister will appreciate that the mere publication of the fact that at first instance the controller had decided to erase someone's name from the register could be extremely, perhaps finally, damaging to a patent agent.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal in this section represents a very undesirable trend which has come into our legislation in recent times and that is to grant immunities <Col N="351" /> to Ministers and civil servants of various grades from being sued by members of the public.  This is becoming all too prevalent and is undesirable.  We had it recently in the Fire Services Bill where the Minister and his officials were given complete immunity from suit.  As a result, a citizen can be damaged or injured as a result of some negligence or carelessness on the part of the Minister or one of his officials or agents and that person is debarred by the legislation from getting damages for the loss he suffers.  It could arise in all kinds of ways under this Bill. For example, an applicant for a patent may have a very expensive piece of apparatus which would be with the examiner for the purpose of examination.  It could be damaged and he would have no claim. The whole principle as the margin note says &mdash; immunity of Minister, controller and officers as regards official acts &mdash; is a retrograde step and could be unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>I refer to some comments made by two Supreme Court judges in the case of Byrne v Ireland.  Mr. Justice Walsh said at page 218 of the Irish Reports:</P>
      <P>In my view the whole tenor of our Constitution is to the effect that there is no power, institution or person in the land free of the law save where such immunity is expressed or provided for in the Constitution itself. </P>
      <P>At page 229 Mr. Justice Budd said:</P>
      <P>From what is to be deduced in the main from an analysis of the foregoing provisions of the Constitution in so far as they affect the immunity of the State from suit, it would seem correct to say that the Constitution is not imbued with futile conceptions of privilege and exemptions but rather with modern conceptions of the duty of the State and the recognition by it of the human rights and needs of those who are citizens of the State. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of hedging the State with privileges and immunities the general trend is to place obligations on the State.  We have an example of a Bill putting in a section to hedge the Minister and his <Col N="352" /> officials with immunity.  That is a throw-back to the old days of the King can do no wrong and the State can do no wrong. I thought that in recent times we were moving away from that kind of trend.</P>
    <P>If there is an act of carelessness or negligence on the part of a Minister or his agents and as a result a citizen suffers loss or damage, under the Constitution and in common sense that person should have a right of recourse to the courts and be compensated by the State for that wrong.  If the concept of immunity is not highlighted it could become quite common in all legislation and the responsibilities of every Minister could be hedged with these immunities.  In the debate on the earlier Bill, the Minister was right in pointing out on amendment of mine that no special position ought to attach to a Government agency.  The same argument applies here.  The point was made by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that my amendment could represent a charge on the State and was being disallowed.  It could be argued that the reverse is true and if the measure is found unconstitutional quite a substantial charge could result on the State as a result of leaving it in.  If a person was injured and felt his constitutional rights were refused, he could take that matter to the High Court or Supreme Court and be successful.  In that situation the cost of the proceedings, which would be substantial, would become a charge on the State.  I would ask the Minister to consider what I have been saying in connection with that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Taylor is perfectly right; I had made the very same note in the margin of my own Bill.  In addition to the considerations based on Byrne against Ireland mentioned by Deputy Taylor and considerations about the Royal prerogative, I would ask the Minister to look at it under Article 40.1 of the Constitution which speaks about the equality of citizens before the law.  While it is true that it speaks about citizens and that it does qualify in the next section the generality of that by talking about differences of function, they have got to be relevant differences of function.  The Minister would take a long time to persuade <Col N="353" /> me that there was anything relevant in the difference of the function of the controller or himself and the function of an ordinary citizen so as to permit the differentiation between them, which this section would purport to allow, to the extent that one would be liable for a negligent performance of some duty imposed on him by statute and the other would not.  Of course there are obvious differences of social function between the controller on the one hand and ordinary citizens on the other.  But there is no nexus between the difference of social function and the desirability, if it exists, of freeing the Minister or the controller from the ordinary liability to the ordinary law the rest of us have to endure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would take a look at subsection (1) (c).  I understood that the effect of ordaining that judicial notice was to be taken of something was that parties were dispensed of the need to prove it, so that judicial notice of certain notorious facts, such as the crude outline of world geography, the phases of the moon or the seasons of the year did not require proof.  It may be just that I have forgotten but I am not sure that one correctly speaks about taking judicial notice of things like decisions of, or expressions of opinion pursuant to, the European Patent Convention by a composite authority on any question arising under or in connection with that convention. That seems to me to be an extremely wise expression.  If what is meant is that the controller is to take judicial notice merely of the fact that some court in some other State party to the convention other than ours has given an interpretation of this, that or the other, there could be no objection to it, assuming that the expression &ldquo;judicial notice&rdquo; is correct.  If what is intended is that the controller is to regard himself as bound by it or is to regard it as in some way binding on him, then &ldquo;judicial notice&rdquo; is the wrong expression and I would think also the principle of the thing objectionable.  Perhaps the Minister would look at it if it is simply to extend the dispensability of proof.</P>

      <P>Permission has been given to Deputy Connaughton to raise on the Adjournment the question of the peat briquette factory at Ballyforan.  The Deputy has a maximum of 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, if it is in line with the ruling of the Chair, to give ten minutes of my 20 minutes to my colleague, Deputy Naughten.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter this evening.  The question surrounding the commencement of the Ballyforan peat briquette factory on the border between Galway and Roscommon is causing concern to a great number of people in that area at the moment.  I want to give the background to why this has arisen.</P>
      <P>During the general election campaign in February the Fine Gael Party and I let it be known that the Coalition Government in the 1982 Public Capital Programme made the following inventory.  I want to quote exactly what we said about Bord na Móna on that occasion.  We said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall Bord na Móna capital estimate for 1982 is £34.5 million which is mainly for the continuation of bog <Col N="360" /> development work under the board's third bog development programme. Significant provisions include £8.4 million for the proposed briquette factory at Ballyforan, £6.3 million for railways, £5.3 million for machines, £4.7 million for drainage and £3.4 million for buildings. </P>
    <P>On that occasion Fianna Fáil were saying that the Coalition Government did not allocate any money to this project at Ballyforan. I have in my hand absolute proof that that is not the case.  I want to counter any arguments that have been made to the contrary.</P>
    <P>One Deputy actually saw fit to go to a local newspaper and inform them that the Coalition Government did not have the money available and they did not intend to start this briquette factory.  It is also significant that Fianna Fáil canvassers were declaring that if they were elected the peat briquette factory would start within a week or two of them taking over.  It is now three months later and this has not happened.  I was present in the House today when the Minister for Defence, on behalf of the Minister for Energy, answered a question tabled by Deputy Naughten which indicated to me that there was no clear-cut decision that this factory would start next week or the week after.  I am delighted to see the Minister in the House to answer this question this evening.</P>
    <P>I believe the workers and everybody concerned with the project at Ballyforan deserve to know what exactly their future is and where they stand.  The people concerned with this project are well aware that a significant number of the people employed there at the moment have very little work to do and it is obvious they are waiting for a directive from the Government or the board of Bord na Móna about the money coming for this particular project.  It is important to allay the fears those people have.  I hope the Minister will do so when he is replying.  As far as this project is concerned, there never was a project, from an industrial point of view, as relevant as this one is to this area.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government of the early <Col N="361" /> seventies decided that a power station would be built at Ballyforan but when Fianna Fáil come into power they decided that that particular project should be phased in with another one at Shannonbridge and a briquette factory should be built in its place.  So long as the bogs are being utilised and so long as it creates employment everybody will be happy with that.  There is no more relevant industry than a peat briquette factory for that area because there are extensive boglands which are very suitable to this project.  The raw materials are available and do not have to be imported.  The most important thing about this is that the end products, briquettes, are in great demand on the Irish market.  I believe we are importing a lot of such fuel.  When we are trying to conserve energy it is very good sense to go ahead with this project.</P>
    <P>Ballyforan on the Galway-Roscommon border is a black spot for employment and has been so for many years. We believe that the general area of north Galway and south Roscommon is a very deprived area and nothing should be allowed to come in the way of this hard earned employment.  I do not make any secret of the fact that it was the bogs of south Roscommon and north Galway which kept that area poor over the years. It is now an ideal opportunity for the same raw material to play its share in helping the families in that area to make a decent living.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of other things I would like to say about this matter but the clock would beat me.  A number of projects, which have been undertaken by Fianna Fáil recently, like Knock airport and the Clondalkin Paper Mills, do not stand up in the same light as this factory at Ballyforan. I believe the necessary skills are there.  I know there are hundreds of people who have their names in with Bord na Móna for employment and who are only too willing to take the work if it is provided.  The problem now seems to be that after a certain amount of money is used on site development and that kind of work there appears to be a go slow.  I am very anxious to have the Minister inform the House that the necessary money is now available and that work on <Col N="362" /> this factory will commence.  The level of staffing there at the moment cannot be maintained if there is not a suitable increase in the activity on the site.  It appears to me that if the money is available there is no reason why this worth-while project should not start.</P>
    <P>I have a number of questions which I would like the Minister to answer.  When will the project commence?  We were told three months ago that if Fianna Fáil got back into power it would start within a fortnight.  There is no sign of the project starting three months later.  Will the present number of employees be retained? How many extra staff will be taken on? Is the money actually there for this project? If it is not there from where does the Minister intend to get it?  Another important question, which many people in the Ballyforan area, particularly the various committees who are so interested in the future of this factory, would like answered is will the IDA be involved and what type of grant assistance will they put into this project?  It has been said that if a foreign industrialist thought of an idea like this everybody would be doing everything possible to ensure that he got everything that was going.  I assume the IDA will be involved.  I should like to hear the Minister refer to that and to give sone indication of the level of grants that this factory at Ballyforan may expect to receive.  This is a project that is all-embracing in so far as rural Ireland is concerned.  It is very important to the local people in particular in terms of employment.  In these circumstances we must have no more dilly-dallying so far as the factory is concerned.  I hope that after this debate this evening everybody concerned will know where they stand.  It is not good for people to have this sort of cloud over them, as it were.</P>
    <P>By way of conclusion I wish to put an end to the lie that seems to have been doing the rounds since the last general election campaign and to point out that as the public capital programme shows, £8.4 million was made available by the Coalition for this project.  I want the Minister to tell us what has happened to that money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of speaking this evening because of the importance of the subject in question.  Not only is the building of the briquette factory at Ballyforan of great importance to the people of the area but the people of the entire area of mid- and south-Roscommon and east-Galway. When Deputy Barry, as Minister for Transport and Power, announced that Bord na Móna were to begin a major development programme on Derryfadda bog, there was new life and hope for the people of the area of a kind that had not existed before.  The farmers co-operated with Bord na Móna and sold bog at a very low price.  They did this in the belief that the project would be of major advantage not only in terms of employment for the local community but for the nation by way of the provision of an additional form of energy.</P>
      <P>It is uncertain now whether this development will go ahead but we must dispel that uncertainty and that is why I call on the Minister to state clearly when the project will begin.  Bord na Móna have commenced major drainage work on the bog but this development work is coming to a standstill because of the uncertainty that surrounds the building of the factory. In anticipation of the project going ahead Roscommon County Council provided sites for houses in the area and the rural housing organisation have moved in to build houses for the workers.  Water and sewerage schemes have commenced but the whole project is in jeopardy now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Conaghan has pointed out the Coalition provided £8.4 million specifically for the building of this briquette factory.  It is regrettable to say the least that this money is not being utilised and that the very necessary employment in the area is not being created.  There is a major unemployment problem in the area as a result of Roscommon and Galway County Councils having had to lay off substantial numbers of men.  They were forced to do this because of the insufficiency of the moneys provided by the Government to the local authorities to maintain roads.  A briquette factory at Ballyforan would employ directly 200 <Col N="364" /> men and in addition 400 extra jobs would be created on the bogs.  What we are talking about is a major industry and if it cannot go ahead the effect on the local community will be devastating.</P>
    <P>I want to hear the Minister state clearly that it is Government policy to build this factory and to let us know also the date on which we can expect the work to begin.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to state, as he stated in reply to a question today, that this project depends on the development programme being considered by Bord na Móna for 1982.  That was not the policy of this party while in Government.  We stated clearly that the project would go ahead.  This was reiterated by the Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs while speaking in the area.  However, I regret to note that neither of the Deputies from the Roscommon constituency is here for this important debate this evening.</P>
    <P>There are projects being financed despite the fact that their effect would be much less beneficial than the one we are discussing.  For instance, money is being provided for the building of an airport at Knock.  Should we not give priority to developing a natural resource which apart from the employment aspect would provide a very necessary form of fuel and would reduce the massive national bill for coal and other fuels?</P>
    <P>It is difficult to express adequately the anger and disappointment of the people of the Ballyforan area and of that part of the country generally at the delay on the part of the Government in honouring a pledge that was given unequivocally prior to the general election to go ahead with this project.  It is estimated that two-and-a-half years would be the time span between the beginning of the building of the factory and the production stage.  My information is that Bord na Móna on starting development work at Ballyforan were planning on having the factory in operation by 1984.  The earliest date by which it could be in operation now is 1985.  In effect this means that production work on those bogs must stop.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the employees who were taken on there on a seasonal basis no <Col N="365" /> longer will have the opportunity of working during summer.  It is most unsatisfactory that there is such an air of uncertainty about the whole project.  This uncertainty puts people in a very awkward position in terms of getting loans for houses in that they do not know whether they will have jobs in from six to 12 months time.  I appeal to the Minister to tell the House when work on this project will begin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for sharing his time with Deputy Callanan and myself.  I tried to raise this matter on the Adjournment on 26 November last and the Tánaiste, Deputy Michael O'Leary, would not come to the House to answer my question.  I am glad the Minister for Industry and Energy has seen fit to attend to answer any questions put to him and I have no doubt that I will be pleased with his replies.  Like the people of south Roscommon and north Galway, I was glad on 31 May 1979 when the Fianna Fáil Government gave approval for the erection of this peat briquette factory.  A lot has happened since then.  The farm mentioned closed down and the workers went to work on the bog development programme at Derryfada on a farm taken over by Bord na Móna.  All politicians were anxious that the briquette factory commence operations.  I am glad that £8.4 million is in the capital programme and the only matter I have questioned is why Bórd na Móna were not told about the allocation. I hope that when the price structuring problem that Bórd na Móna has is sorted out that they will be given the go-ahead for the first stage of the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware that there is not an economic argument against the construction of the factory, which will utilise natural resources.  This is a deprived area of <Col N="366" /> the west and the provision of 600 jobs would prove a major boost.  The jobs which Bórd na Móna will provide in the factory are vital in the area.  I hope the seasonal jobs that have been available in the area in the past will continue to be available, particularly for part-time farmers. When I was first elected to this House in 1975 following a by-election I called for the construction of this factory in Ballyforan.  I am confident that the Minister will see to it that that factory is erected so that vital jobs will be provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for giving me some of his time.  The erection of a factory in Ballyforan is of vital importance and I have no doubt that the Minister will not disappoint us.  We kept our promise in relation to Tuam and we will do it in relation to Ballyforan.  I did not make any political propaganda about this matter and I did not mention the prospect of a briquette factory at Ballyforan in the course of my election campaign but we were all interested in it.  Such a factory will avail of the natural resources in the area.  I understand, rightly or wrongly, that we will have two factories in Ballyforan, one to be built shortly to produce 140,000 tons of briquettes.  I understand that the second factory will produce a similar amount of briquettes.  Deputy Connaughton referred to IDA grants.  In my view it is scandalous if such a project which utilises natural resources does not qualify for such a grant.  We are all agreed on the necessity for such a factory in that area and I am confident that the Minister will deliver the goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that this matter has been raised on the Adjournment because if those who are expressing concern about it now were as concerned some months ago they would have approached Members of their own party who were in Government.  Had they been told true facts then, there would not have been any need to raise this.  Approval for the erection of a briquette factory by Bórd na Móna at Ballyforan, County Galway, was first given by Government <Col N="367" /> in May 1979.  The factory was to be located about one mile southwest of the village and was to be built in two phases. It was planned to bring phase one into operation during 1985 and phase two during 1988.  Total cost at current prices would be £36.8 million and the total projected capacity was 260,000 tonnes of turf briquettes.  The factory would be serviced from the Derryfadda group of bogs, and would employ about 600 persons in the bog development work and in the factory.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna recently carried out a re-examination of their bog development programme in the light of the board's projected capital needs in 1982.  Arising from this examination I understand that the board are considering a change in detail in regard to the briquette factory at Ballyforan whereby the original plan for the project to be executed in two phases will be replaced by a plan which would allow the project to be carried out on the basis of two separate developments. A new factory will comprise a single unit with a production capacity of 140,000 tonnes, per annum with employment for 110 persons.  The estimated cost at current rates for this part of the development would be £20 million.  Work on the bog area to service the factory is proceeding.</P>
      <P>At the same time I have carried out a full review of the bog development currently being carried out by Bórd na Móna.  I have had particular regard to the financial resources which the board must derive, in the absence of Exchequer funds, from earnings on the sale of its products to enable the work to be carried forward.  I am satisfied that the result of this review will avoid any delay in getting work commenced on the briquette factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked why there has been a go-slow and a number of delays.  I have heard Deputies refer to the fact that Exchequer capital was provided.  I should like to tell the House &mdash; I am sure the Deputies opposite are not unaware of this &mdash; that the capital they said was provided in the capital programme was non-voted capital, no more than an insertion <Col N="368" /> into a capital programme to allow Bord na Móna to go out &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is non-voted capital. The Coalition Government were aware of the financial situation and the obligations their decision put on Bord na Móna to borrow the money.  Bord na Móna sent a memorandum to the Government and I know what the Coalition Government did with it.  I know that they took the easy way out.  They did not have any regard as to how Bord na Móna would finance this development and, obviously, could not care less.  That is the reality of the situation. The Coalition Government did not give Bord na Móna any Exchequer money to start that factory.  They said they would write it into a non-voted situation and could borrow the money if they were able to.  Now Members of Fine Gael have the hard neck to come to the House questioning the delay in the project. I am surprised to hear two Deputies from the west running down an instrument of regional development in the west, the Knock airport project, and refer to honouring pledges.  We know of another pledge they gave, to put a £20 million sports complex there and they reneged on that.</P>

They have little interest in the development of the west of Ireland, they are still a Dublin based party, will always remain so and that is what will keep them in Opposition.  The Deputies opposite know that the non-voted capital did not mean anything.  It had to be borrowed by Bord na Móna who were not given the wherewithal to finance it.  As far as Fianna Fáil are concerned we honour our commitments and <Col N="369" /> will always do so, especially in relation to the development of natural resources.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a tax-free allowance certificate for 1982-83 was issued to the taxpayer on 19 May 1982 and a copy sent to his employer.  The delay in issuing the certificate of tax-free allowances arose because details of the taxpayer's previous employments were not supplied.  Any tax which has been overdeducted from the taxpayer's earnings since 6 April 1982 is <Col N="103" /> refundable by his employer when that certificate is operated.</P>
      <P>The inspector of taxes is writing to the taxpayer for the details necessary to review his 1981-82 tax liability and, on receipt of those details, the review will be made and any tax found to have been overdeducted from his pay in that year will be refunded to the taxpayer by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a number of reasons, however, which are set out below the figures in Account No. XXVII of the Finance Accounts are not necessarily the same as those in the annual reports of the semi-State bodies.  The financial year of some semi-State bodies does not coincide with the calendar year.  A small number of shares in some bodies is held by directors and other persons, for example, privately or by departmental representatives.  In a few cases, there are differences, mainly for technical reasons, for example, a transaction may have been initiated during one financial year and completed in the following year; it may, therefore, be taken into account in the accounts of the semi-State body, but not in the Finance Accounts until the following year, or <i>vice versa.</i>  In the case of the Electricity Supply Board, the figure should have read £44,892,572 (at 31 December 1979) and £43,448,162 (at 31 December 1980).  The difference in respect of 1979 arose from a clerical error and that for 1980 from a misclassification of repayments which is being corrected in the 1981 Finance Accounts.  In the case of Bord Fáilte Éireann there are no repayable advances outstanding: the figures <Col N="104" /> shown (£72,083) arose out of a misclassification and will also be deleted from the 1981 accounts.  In one case (the British &amp; Irish Steampacket Co. Ltd.) a payment for goodwill, when the company was acquired, accounts for the difference between the issued share capital in the company's accounts and the entry in the Finance Accounts.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the reason an instalment under the dairy herd conversion scheme, which has been due since December 1981, has not been paid to a person (details supplied) in County Meath; if instalments have been paid to any other people under this scheme in respect of the payment date of December 1981; when the payment will be made to that person; when all outstanding payments will be made to all other applicants in respect of December 1981; and the total sum outstanding in payments which have been due since December 1981.</P>

      <P>The person named joined the EEC Scheme of Premiums for Non-Marketing of Milk and Milk Products and opted for payment of the premium in five equal annual instalments.  He has already received two of these and the third will be due for payment before 30 August next, when he will complete his third year of participation in the scheme.  An inspection in his case was, however, carried out last week and it is expected that payment <Col N="124" /> of the third annual instalment will be made shortly.</P>
      <P>There are nine other applicants awaiting payment of instalments since December 1981 and the total amount due is £21,872.98.  One will be paid in the very near future and in the remaining eight cases payment has been held up because of doubts about the applicants complying with the terms and conditions of the scheme.  Investigations in these cases are continuing.</P>

      <P>The off-farm income limit for determining eligibility for headage payments in the disadvantaged areas was introduced in 1979 so that the limited resources available could be used to give <Col N="125" /> maximum benefit to full-time farmers and those with low off-farm incomes rather than those who did not depend mainly on farming for their livelihood. The limit set is based on the national average industrial wage.  The reasons for introducing the limit still exist and consequently there are no plans to revoke it.</P>

    <P>For 1981 councils were asked to give priority to farm road projects so as to attract maximum possible EEC aid.  In the current year councils have been asked to devote specified minimum amounts from their allocations to farm road projects eligible for EEC aid.  The sums involved are set out in column 3 of Table 2.</P>
    <P>The measures outlined, which have the approval of the EEC authorities, are designed to ensure that the £15 million approximately in aid available for local and farm roads over a ten year period will be fully taken up.</P>

      <P>In reply to a similar question on 6 February 1975, the then Minister for the Public Service stated:</P>
      <P>Because of the number and variety of questions asked and the fact that the time spent in preparing replies is not recorded, it is not possible to give an estimate of average cost.  Some replies would cost relatively little.  Others would be quite expensive as they can entail a great deal of work in the collection, collation and analysis of material. Any cost would have to cover a large representative sample and would have to be carried out at the time of preparation of the reply. </P>
      <P>However, I am now arranging to have a costing carried out on a representative sample of questions and, if the Deputy would put down the question again in the next session I could let him have the information.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 775 and 777 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For pension purposes there are two categories of employees in CIE namely the salaried officers and clerks and the regular wages staff.  The superannuation provisions for the salaried officers and clerks are in line with those in operation in the public sector generally.  The regular wages staff, pending the introduction of <Col N="144" /> a similar type scheme to cover them, have been covered by interim schemes designed to give pensions which when combined with social welfare benefits would equate to about two-thirds of retiring pay.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are in progress between CIE and the unions for the drawing up, in respect of the regular wages staff of CIE, of a definitive scheme on similar lines to those in operation in the public sector generally.  The questions of the level of contribution and provision within the draft scheme for retired members of the existing scheme are being covered in these negotiations.</P>
    <P>I re-affirm my commitment to approval of a definitive scheme within public sector norms, at the earliest possible opportunity subject to prevailing financial structures.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the increasing incidence of drug abuse among young people and I have taken steps to alert and educate <Col N="175" /> parents, teachers, youth leaders and young people themselves to the dangers inherent for them in the whole area of substance abuse.  I recently allocated an additional £¼ million to the Health Education Bureau to undertake an urgent national programme on substance abuse. In addition, the Eastern Health Board have established a special task force to co-ordinate the provision of drug treatment facilities in their area.</P>
      <P>The additional funding allows the bureau to expand its programme of training for teachers, doctors, pharmacists, career guidance counsellors, health board personnel, gardaí and clergy to enable them to act as drug educators. These people are available to act extensively throughout the community and particularly in schools.  This aspect of the programme is aimed primarily at parents to inform them as to the nature and extent of the problem, equip them to guide their children away from becoming involved with drugs and train them to react appropriately, organising treatment and support if their child has a drug problem.</P>
      <P>The Health Education Bureau, with the full support and co-operation of the Department of Education, is arranging for the preparation of educational materials on all forms of substance abuse for second level school children.  This is being piloted in selected schools at present and will be extended to all schools from September 1982.</P>
      <P>In the Dún Laoghaire area, seminars and courses are organised regularly for parents of adolescents by the Eastern Health Board's health education coordinator for the area.  The overall theme is the management of the adolescent and aspects of the programmes include education in relation to drug abuse, alcohol, sexuality and use of leisure.  The lecturers are experts in their own fields who cooperate with the health board and the Health Education Bureau in providing these educational programmes.</P>
      <P>In the last six months, four of these programmes have been held.  Each one was attended by over 150 parents and other concerned adults.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit in respect of an incapacity which he attributed to an accident at work on 13 November 1981. Before a decision could be given on his entitlement to payment it was necessary to make inquiries as to the nature and origin of the incapacity.  On completion of the inquiries, which were protracted, it was accepted that the incapacity was due to an accident at work and the claim was allowed.  Payment of injury benefit for the period from 13 November 1981, date of accident to 5 December 1981, after which date he was certified fit to resume work, was made on 20 May 1982.</P>

      <P>The qualifying conditions for old age contributory pension are as follows: (i) entry into insurance before reaching the prescribed age.  For a person born after 1 October 1922 the prescribed age is 56 years; For a person born earlier it ranges from 57 to 60 years; (ii) a total of 156 paid contributions since entry into insurance, and (iii) a yearly average of 48 contributions, paid or credited, since 1953 or from entry into insurance, whichever is later, for a maximum rate of pension, with phased reduced rates for persons with yearly averages down to 20 contributions paid or credited.</P>
      <P>If necessary, in order to fulfil conditions (i) and (ii) a person's insurance prior to 5 January 1953 may be taken into account: (a) where re-entry into insurance under the Social Welfare Acts occurred after the claimant had attained the prescribed age, or; (b) where the claimant had less than 156 paid contributions recorded to his credit from 5 January 1953.  Insurance prior to 1953 may not, however, be taken into account for the purpose of satisfying the third condition of the yearly average test.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of a widow's non-contributory pension from June 1964 to November 1979.  She was awarded a widow's contributory pension from 7 November 1979.</P>
      <P>The change from non-contributory to contributory pension was made following the receipt of notification from the United Kingdom Department of Health and Social Security that she had been in receipt of United Kingdom widow's contributory pension and had claimed retirement pension from them on 4 February 1980 following the attainment of pension age on 6 November 1979.  On the basis of the information supplied by the United Kingdom authorities her claim for pension from them was, in accordance with EEC Regulations, treated as a claim for pension in this country also.</P>
      <P>She was therefore deemed to have made a claim from this Department also and it was on this basis that her pension was reviewed and a contributory widow's pension awarded.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, pension can only be awarded from a date three months prior to the receipt of the claim. In the case under consideration the relevant date was the date the claim was made to the United Kingdom Department in February 1980 and pension was accordingly awarded by this Department from November 1979, three months earlier. There is no provision in the Social Welfare Acts whereby any further payments can be made having regard to the date on which the claim was deemed to have been made as explained in the preceding paragraph.</P>

      <P>Payment in respect of the period 29 April to 5 May 1982 was included in a cheque which issued to the claimant on 14 May 1982.  The claimant has now been transferred to the payment system whereby payment issues weekly and medical evidence is required at monthly intervals only.</P>

      <P>The person concerned made a <Col N="198" /> repeat claim to unemployment benefit on 5 October 1981 and was allowed at the weekly rate of £66.65.  This was the rate appropriate to a married man with six qualified children who had exhausted 156 days' benefit and who did not satisfy the condition of having 280 contributions paid in the seven years before his claim. His weekly rate of payment was increased to £81.25 from 6 April 1982 in accordance with the general rates increases.</P>
      <P>The person concerned exhausted his entitlement to 390 days unemployment benefit on 13 May 1982 and from 14 May 1982 was allowed unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £80.00.

      <P>Payment of benefit was not authorised on the first three claims as, according to the records of my Department, he had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions, paid or credited, in 1978, 1979 or 1980, the contribution years governing his claims.

      <P>The person concerned attained age 65 years on 19 June 1977 and claimed retirement pension from my Department. He was originally awarded retirement pension at the maximum personal <Col N="201" /> rate but this pension was withdrawn in August 1980 when it was discovered that the insurance number quoted by him on the claim form referred to another person of the same name.  His insurance record under the correct number shows that he had a yearly average of only ten contributions from 5 January 1953 to 31 December 1976 and he thus failed to satisfy the condition which requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 24 contributions in order to qualify for retirement pension.  Similarly he does not qualify for a contributory old age pension for which a yearly average of at least 20 contributions from 5 January 1953 to 31 December 1977 is required.</P>
      <P>While the claimant would have been entitled to a <i>pro rata</i> rate retirement pension from my Department under EEC regulations payment of such pension was withheld as he was awarded a non-contributory old age pension at a higher rate with effect from 23 June 1978.  He is also in receipt of a <i>pro rata</i> retirement pension from the British Department of Health and Social Security.</P>

Payment was disallowed after that date following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work. He was notified of the disallowance of benefit on 26 April 1982 and advised of his right to appeal against the decision but no reply has been received to date.</P>

    <P>The Deputy's inquiry has been taken as an appeal in this case and arrangements <Col N="212" /> have now been made to have him again examined on 7 June 1982 by a different medical referee.  His entitlement to benefit will be reviewed when the report of the medical referee is received.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Ryan</b> asked the Minister for Industry and Energy if he will review the policy of Bord na Móna in relation to sale of turf briquettes, so that fuel merchants who have commenced operations since May 1976 receive an allocation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The growth in demand for briquettes has been such that for some time the production capacity of Board na <Col N="215" /> Móna's three briquette factories, estimated at 441,000 tonnes for this year, has been insufficient to cope with the demand.  Because of this Bord na Móna had to introduce a rationing scheme whereby their customers are limited to quantities related to the amounts they purchased within the last year of unrestricted sales, viz. the year ended October 1976.</P>
      <P>I understand that the board are not in a position to take on new customers since, to do so, would mean a further reduction in the already insufficient allocation to existing customers.  I recognise that this is not a satisfactory situation for new entrants to the fuel trade but one can understand the board's concern to maintain supplies for their long standing customers.  Given the substantial demand for a product in limited supply it is difficult to see what, in the short-term at least, could be done to satisfy all interested parties.</P>
      <P>The board's current development programme does, however, provide for additional briquette production to improve the supply situation in the future.  In the meantime, until the position improves, the present system of allocation appears to be the most equitable form of distribution which can be devised.</P>

      <P>Tenders and loan applications for the extensions of the Rosses regional water supply scheme to Burtonport and Brinaleck have been submitted to my Department by Donegal County Council and are under consideration at present.  The local authority's proposals must be considered in the context of the amount of capital available for water and sewerage schemes and the number of such schemes in progress or getting to construction.  I cannot say at this stage when I will be in a position to issue approval to the acceptance of tenders for the Rosses regional water supply scheme extensions to Burtonport and Brinaleck. The question of finance will not arise until approval has issued to the acceptance of tenders for the proposed extensions.</P>

      <P>Statutory authority already exists for payment of the loan and subsidy which are part of the scheme of assistance currently available to voluntary housing associations providing self-contained housing accommodation for special categories of persons in need of rehousing.  There is also statutory authority for payment of the grant available for housing accommodation provided for elderly persons.  I propose to introduce legislation in the near future which will, <i>inter alia</i>, provide the necessary <Col N="232" /> statutory authority for payment of the grants for houses provided for the other special categories of need.</P>
      <P>Inter-Aid have now been informed that it has been recognised by me, as Minister, as an approved body for the purpose of qualifying for the scheme of financial assistance provided for in the housing package, 1981.  There is no record in my Department of the receipt of an application from Shelter Referral for approved body status for this purpose.</P>
