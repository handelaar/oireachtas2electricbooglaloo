      <P>asked the Minister for Finance his intentions, if any, in regard to having the coinage re-designed in respect of pattern, dimension and denomination; and whether he will consult An Chomhairle Ealaíon on how best to secure a satisfactory new coinage from the aesthetic point of view.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> As the Minister proposes to announce during his speech on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill in the Seanad today, he has requested the Central Bank to undertake detailed studies, in consultation with the Department of Finance, into the introduction of a 20p or 25p coin, the possible introduction at a later date of a £1 coin and, in the longer term, changing the existing cupro-nickel coins &mdash; that is the 5p, 10p and 50p pieces &mdash; to provide a relatively less heavy coinage. Also, the views of representative bodies closely concerned with these matters <Col N="2006" /> will be sought by the Department of Finance before firm proposals for changes in the coinage are put forward for Government approval and presentation to the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to consult An Chomhairle Ealaíon on the design aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am delighted to hear that for once An Chomhairle Ealaíon will be brought into this matter, which was a clear case for its intervention, what is the objection to consulting them straight away?  It is not something they can give their views on or get advice about overnight.  If, as the Minister says, his plans are to some extent long term ones, what is the objection to asking them for their advice straight away, at least on the aesthetic dimensions of the coinage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the size of the existing set of coins, would the Minister think there is something to be said for bringing forward this part of the plans to something more proximate than the &ldquo;longer term&rdquo;, inasmuch as the Irish 10p piece is the same size, for example, as the German five mark piece, but in order to buy a German five mark piece you would want 13 of our 10p gems and one's pocket is literally torn to pieces by the weight of almost worthless coinage clashing around in it.  Would the Minister think that there is a strong case for bringing this forward to the near term and not into the long term?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Clare) Mr. Barrett (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> Yes, I mentioned in my reply relatively less heavy coinage which would also mean, I presume, that a change of size will be examined.  I agree with the Deputy that the coins are far too heavy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interim, because a large part of my concern with this over the years has been that it is a most conspicuous, easily accessible example of our mindless copying of the English, could <Col N="2007" /> the Minister give us a positive assurance today that we will not get a 20p piece identical in every way except pattern with the English 20p piece, which recently was issued?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the measures that have been taken to ensure that casual traders pay VAT on sales and deduct PAYE and PRSI from the salaries of their employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> The Deputy will, no doubt, be aware of the Casual Trading Act, 1980, which came into operation in February 1981.  The main purpose of this Act, was to provide for the control and regulation of casual trading and to ensure <Col N="2008" /> better compliance by casual traders with their statutory obligations, including those relating to tax.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the activities of commercially organised casual traders in a substantial way of business are kept under constant examination in order to ensure compulsory VAT registration of new entrants to the trade and compliance with the requirements of that tax and also of PAYE and PRSI by those already registered. In the case of other casual traders, continuous action is taken in the form of monitoring their sources of supply with a view to ensuring the due payment of VAT on their purchases.  Such persons are normally self-employed and the question of registration for PAYE and PRSI does not arise.  The VAT registration limit for casual traders selling goods is £30,000 annual turnover.</P>

Details of licensed holders, the numbers of people issued with licences are given to the Revenue Commissioners each year, but I do not have the numbers at present registered.  That would be those with over £30,000 turnover.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but how many? Would the Minister agree with me that in order to judge the effectiveness of the measures he has outlined one would need to know how many people have registered for VAT as a result of these measures? If that number is very small the reply the Minister has just given is simply so many words.</P>

I might say that, while it is very difficult to have a completely satisfactory system with regard to this, the Revenue Commissioners feel that there is a high level of compliance with the requirements.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in the preparation of the economic plan at present being constructed, he intends to state specific targets for (a) the progressive reduction of the current budget deficit and the national debt over the next five years and <Col N="2010" /> (b) the control of numbers employed in the public service.</P>

        <i>(Clare):</i> It would not be appropriate to anticipate the contents of the Government's economic plan at this stage.  I can say, however, that it will set out the Government's intentions for the progressive reduction of the current budget deficit and for Exchequer borrowing in general.  It will also indicate their intentions in relation to public expenditure and employment in the public service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally I would expect it would do these things, but the reason for my question was to ask whether the plan would state &ldquo;specific targets&rdquo;.  They were the central words in my question, by which I wished to elicit a commitment from the Government that targets, in numbers of millions as appropriate, or hundreds of thousands in the case of the public service, would be expressed so that the public and the Dáil will be able to check the progress of this or any Government towards achievement of the plan year by year.  Will there be specific numbered targets of that kind in these two areas?  It is no use saying that we intend to phase this out or keep an eye on that. We have been hearing that all our lives. Will there be specific numbered targets, that will enable us to say that this year they are on target, last year they were not, or <i>vice versa</i>?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> On the question of the Government indicating targets, the Government recognise the value of targets in clarifying the objectives and measures required to achieve them.  International developments can offset significantly the performance of the Irish economy and must be allowed for in setting planned objectives.  Also on the question of the effects of domestic developments you cannot determine targets in any way accurately.  However, the Government would favour including medium-term public finance targets in the plan to the extent that these would be meaningful and helpful to the future development of the economy.  The difficulty <Col N="2011" /> of setting targets must be emphasised because of the changing economic situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody acknowledges that and unforseen things happen, but would the Minister acknowledge that in order for the plan to be of any use &mdash; unlike the unnumbered plans which have come and gone and which no one now remembers &mdash; to this House, the public, economists in the press or the universities or research institutes outside, it would need to show what is intended so far as it can be done?  Nobody expects to have planning-on-the-nail achievement of targets three years from now, but will it not need to show at least approximately targets measured in millions or billions of pounds or what we are now dealing in, megabillions, since we now have a national debt of £10,000 million for the first time under the ministry of Deputy MacSharry? Would he not agree that some form of target, however tentative and however subject to the obvious qualification that we cannot forsee conditions in the future, ought to be in this plan, because otherwise it will not differ in any useful respect from the seven or eight such plans that I have seen come and go in this House in the time that I have been here?</P>

The assistant chief engineer was employed in July and the appointment of the two grade I engineers was tied up with the embargo that was introduced in July.  I should like to tell the Deputy that £100,000 was made available in the Estimate but there was no provision made for the extra staff required to carry out this study.

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works authorised the reverend chairman of the board of management of Cashel national school, County Tipperary, on 21 May 1982 to accept a tender for the erection of a new central school.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not detain the Minister but I would like some information about the provision of capital by the State for bodies such as An Bord Gáis. The Devlin Report specifically recommended, and the recommendations were accepted by the then Government in 1969 and have remained accepted by all Governments since then, that all State agencies spending public funds should have clearly stated objectives divided into two categories: (1) those which were clearly economic and therefore should be implemented without any interference at all by the State and (2) companies whose goals or objectives were not solely economic but which had a social or other implication and, in respect of which the body should be the subject of more certain scrutiny by the Department concerned. I am anxious to know if An Bord Gáis, to which we are making available this additional sum, have objectives of this character which would conform with the recommendations on the Devlin Report and, secondly, if these objectives are clearly sub-divided as between those which are economic and, therefore, in the interests of efficient public sector enterprise <Col N="2202" /> carried out and without any interference by the Minister, except such as would be normal in the matter of private sector concerns in the same area, and other objectives in respect of which interference by him would be legitimate.  Has he such a sub-division and would he indicate the precise objectives the board have and how they relate to this sub-division.</P>
      <P>I would also like to know the method whereby An Bord Gáis propose to raise the money authorised by this legislation. As the Minister and the House will be aware from the replies given to questions put by Deputy L'Estrange today, there has been a very considerable growth in foreign borrowing by State companies. The growth has exceeded that of the State itself.  If we are to know the overall vulnerability of the State in regard to changes &mdash; for instance, in the valuation of currencies &mdash; which would naturally increase the amount that would have to be repaid over and above the amount actually borrowed if the foreign currency in whose denomination we have borrowed money increases in value relative to ours, there should be a central system for monitoring foreign borrowing by State companies where such foreign borrowings are accompanied by a State guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as borrowing will be undertaken by An Bord Gáis in pursuance of the powers vested in them by this Bill, will any direction or guidance be given to them either by the Minister for Industry and Energy or the Minister for Finance as to the extent, if any, to which An Bord Gáis may borrow abroad and as to the currencies in which they may borrow? Perhaps the Minister would state whether any arrangements will be made to carry or transfer to the Exchequer the responsibility for any exchange risk that may attend borrowings undertaken by An Bord Gáis.  Will such exchange risks be carried entirely by An Bord Gáis or will the State have a share?  If An Bord Gáis by borrowing foreign can do so with the benefit of an exchange risk guarantee from the Government, there is a very clear obligation on the Government to minimise the likelihood of such exchange <Col N="2203" /> risk guarantees having to be called upon by giving clear directions to An Bord Gáis as to borrowing policy.  What arrangements will be made in regard to that matter?</P>
    <P>I should be grateful if the Minister would inform us whether the report of An Bord Gáis, in so far as that document is obliged to give us a clear statement of the upcoming liabilities of that body, is in every particular in conformity with the recommendations of the Department of Finance in regard to format of State company reports and whether it is fully informative in regard to the liabilities undertaken by this company.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also indicate the background to the announcement made by him regarding the bringing of natural gas to Dublin.  I should like to know if the Minister made this announcement before the board of An Bord Gáis had deliberated on the technical feasibility of this matter.  Is there any truth in the suggestion that the board had not completed their technical inquiries but were informed that the Minister had decided that natural gas would be brought to Dublin, thereby short-circuiting the value of appointing reputable people to the board?  If their deliberations are to be pre-empted by ministerial decision there would appear to be little point in having a body such as An Bord Gáis.  The Minister might comment on this.</P>
    <P>I would also welcome an indication by the Minister of the likely life, given present commitments, of this gas find.  It is important that we should know the length of time that this source of relatively inexpensive energy will be available.  It would be unwise to encourage any very substantial capital investment to avail of a source of energy which would be of relatively short duration.  Perhaps the Minister would give some information on this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate.  Some very interesting observations were made and it was only to be expected when dealing with the bringing of natural gas to Dublin <Col N="2204" /> and the first steps in the creation of a national grid that some Deputies raised the same questions.  I will attempt to reply in as much detail as possible.</P>
      <P>Most Deputies spoke about the pricing of gas and Deputy Barry advocated either that cheap gas should be given to the ESB and the benefits passed on to industry in the form of cheaper electricity charges or that gas should be supplied direct to industry as a cheap fuel.  Deputy Barry Desmond favoured a full energy-related price, as did Deputy Eddie Collins. Deputy Desmond suggested that the increased surplus accruing to BGE from such a policy should go to the Exchequer and that a controlled aid open subsidisation of organisations such as the ESB and NET could be implemented where appropriate.</P>
      <P>I believe that the ideal objective is to displace the largest volume of high cost oil, that is, gas oil, thereby maximising savings on costly oil imports.  Because the premium markets, mainly cooking and heating, are relatively small at present, a large volume of gas will be available for the generation of electricity and for industrial use for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>It should be borne in mind that the price of gas to the ESB has resulted already in substantial savings in fuel costs.  Were it not for these savings ESB prices to the consumer would be 10 per cent higher.  The most recent price increase to the ESB was 5 per cent, the lowest price increase for quite a long time.  As a general approach, the price of gas to the ESB will be related to the heavy fuel oil price, with a justifiable reduction.  The price of gas to industry will be on favourable terms to attract large industrial users of heavy fuel oil.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that a comprehensive study of all aspects of the NET operation is awaited by me.  I will bear in mind Deputy Desmond's concern about subsidy when considering the report on that study.  The price for NET gas was negotiated direct before BGE were formed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barry said that the policy was a pragmatic one and basically that is a fair description.  Until the quantities for each segment of the market were identified <Col N="2205" /> and quantified it is fair to say that a pragmatic policy was being pursued but a more cohesive policy is now being undertaken.  When we have identified the quantities required for the premium markets and for the ESB there will be a cohesive policy in regard to the use of natural gas in industry.  I appreciate that new industries and industries planning for the alternative use of energy need to know their position and for what period they can be assured of supplies of natural gas.</P>
    <P>On funding of capital projects and the applications of BGE's surplus, Deputy Barry sought clarification of the funding of the pipeline project.  The position is that 70 per cent of the cost will be raised by borrowings.  These will consist mainly of EIB loans but there will be some domestic borrowings also.  The remaining 30 per cent will come from BGE's internal resources.</P>
    <P>It may have been a little difficult to understand what I said on Second Stage. To clarify, 70 per cent is from borrowing and 30 per cent from internal reserves. Of the 70 per cent there will be some domestic borrowings also.  I anticipate that this will set the pattern for future investment by BGE in capital projects.  It is the intention that surpluses accruing to the board which are not required for capital expenditure will be transferred to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>On the question of State investment in gas companies raised by Deputy Barry, one of the main elements in the agreement between BGE and Dublin Gas is that the State will have an equity participation in the company and representation on the board.  For its part the State, through BGE, will contribute most of the cost of the conversion to natural gas and a large proportion of the cost of the market development.  The Deputy raised the interesting point as to whether I was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time in relation to the advertisements by Dublin Gas that appeared.  He asked me to confirm to the House that I have not had my finger in the pie for want of a better description, or any part whatsoever in that operation.  I clearly and <Col N="2206" /> categorically state that I had absolutely nothing to do with the placing of those advertisements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The same point was made by Deputy Bruton and myself.  I also referred to the fact that the advertisements appeared on the following night.  I accept that the Minister had no part in the placing of the advertisements. The point made by Deputy Bruton and myself was that the announcement was made on the 9 o'clock news on the Friday night and the following morning the newspapers said that negotiations had been completed in the early hours of the morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

      <P>Deputies, we should be careful not to anticipate Committee Stage.  There should be no interruptions while the Minister is concluding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Dublin Gas advertisements in the newspapers, these are a matter for the company.  It is part of a marketing development strategy. How else would anyone reasonably expect the company to sell gas or advertise their wares?  It is a common marketing strategy in business today.</P>
      <P>Deputies will appreciate that the negotiated packet has yet to be presented to the stockholders in Dublin Gas for consideration. While there is no rigid policy of share participation in return for a supply of gas, circumstances may make this approach appropriate in other cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock raised the question of <Col N="2207" /> using natural gas for feedstock for the petrochemical industry.  This has been examined, but there are no immediate prospects of use of natural gas for these purposes.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of employment on the project.  At present, almost 500 people are employed.  This number is expected to increase quite considerably as work on the project intensifies. In addition, many other jobs are being created as a result of sub-contracting to Irish manufacturers.  As I said in my speech, the overall number of jobs arising from the project will be in the region of 700 to 800.</P>
    <P>On the question of spur lines, off the main pipeline, referred to by Deputy Sherlock, I have already made it clear that the pipeline to Dublin is the main priority aimed at the Dublin market, which is the largest in the country.  Second phase development will consider proposals for other towns, initially those with existing gas supplies, for a supply of natural gas.  Supplies to industries and co-operatives within a convenient distance of a pipeline will also be examined. Now that the main project is well advanced, I have asked BGE to look immediately into these further developments. As I have already indicated, BGE have completed preliminary routing studies and possible spur lines to Limerick and Waterford.  Studies on the feasibility of using natural gas have been submitted to my Department by Clonmel and Limerick Gas Companies and these are being examined.  A preliminary study undertaken for Waterford Gas has also been lodged and I expect that report to be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kemmy mentioned the serious plight of the Limerick Gas Company.  In recognition of the financial difficulties being experienced by this company, in January last the Government implemented a package of measures to alleviate their problems.  The package included low interest loans by means of the transfer of portion of the company's existing loans to the local loans fund and the taking over of certain of the company's debts.  Limerick Gas also achieved <Col N="2208" /> significant savings through an arrangement for a supply of naphtha from the INPC.  I agree with the Deputy that Limerick Gas has little future without an early lay-on of natural gas.</P>
    <P>Regarding contracts between the State and Northern Ireland which were negotiated recently, Deputies referred to these negotiations for the supply of gas to Northern Ireland and suggested that the details be disclosed.  The Deputies will appreciate that while agreement was reached on the main terms on which gas could be supplied, these remained to be approved by the two Governments concerned. In such circumstances, the House will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to reveal the terms at this time.  However, when approval has been given by the respective Governments I see no reason why the terms should not be disclosed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry referred to the supply of gas by pipeline to this country via Northern Ireland and Scotland.  Our efforts are being directed at developing premium markets for Kinsale gas, to exploit fully our present gas resources.  It would seem more practical to see connection to a United Kingdom gas grid as a long-term issue to be considered in detail when markets here have been developed and particularly if no further commercial discoveries of natural gas are made to supplement those off Kinsale Head.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Barry in complimenting the IFA and ICMSA concerning their contribution to the success of the pipeline project, especially with regard to the acquisition of wayleaves.  They helped the farming community, in particular, to have a greater understanding of the safety and benefits of the pipeline project.  I was particularly struck by the Deputy's comment that agreements were abided by to the letter by the farmers where lands were affected.  This was a display of civic spirit which is a credit to the two organisations and worthy of the highest praise from all.  Through BGE, I have asked the contractors to cause as little inconvenience as possible to the farming community and to leave the lands as they found them, where that is <Col N="2209" /> at all possible.  This is a clear demonstration by the two farming organisations of what can be done when civic spirit is to the forefront, especially in trying to get underway a major national project like this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the objectives of An Bord Gáis.  These are laid down under Section 8 of the Gas Act of 1976.  Those objectives are being adhered to.  In relation to the life expectancy of the present gas find at Kinsale, it is certainly envisaged to go to the end of this century, if not somewhat beyond.  That does not take into account the possibility of further gas finds.  Statistically, we would be the odd State out if Kinsale were our only real gas find.  This is unlikely to be in isolation.  Where a major find such as Kinsale has been made, one can be cautiously optimistic that there will be more gas around.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that an assumption which the Minister is using in his planning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is fair comment by the technical people concerned that it is most unlikely that this find would be in isolation and that there would be no further gas finds in time around the coast.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  One could not make investment decisions on that type of assumption.  I am only commenting on the fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  If one wants to go into the whole investment programme of BGE which has been gone into in detail, as a former Minister for Finance the Deputy would know the input of the Department of Finance into all these financial arrangements. Arrangements must be worked out with the consent of the Department of Finance, so it is not a question of the <Col N="2210" /> Minister for Industry and Energy working off his own bat outside the ambit of the Department of Finance.  That is not the way it works.  The investment decisions of BGE have been fully investigated and the Department of Finance have been fully involved in them.</P>

      <P>In reply to the point I made about this Government or An Bord Gáis offering to fund the connection between Scotland and the North of Ireland, the Minister said he did not think it was appropriate at this stage because we intended to develop our own grid.  He <Col N="2211" /> also said there was a substantial field off Kinsale.  It is not a substantial one but quite a small one of 180,000,000 cubic feet a day for 20 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In our terms it is substantial but in international terms it is small.

Are the objectives, either privately or publicly in the Minister's Department, divided between those which are economic and those which are not just economic?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give it to the Deputy.  The functions at (a), (b) and (c) of the Deputy's question are taken into account in policy formulation and the working relationship between my Department and the State agencies under my aegis.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the functions of the Department were substantially altered in the last year or so and certain consequential aspects have still to be settled.  Implementation on a formalised basis of proposals referred to will be considered when circumstances permit.  The Deputy is well aware that a section of industry was taken out of one Department and put into another.  He is also fully aware, and I am sure appreciates, that to comply fully with Devlin at this point is not possible.  We are going along those lines.  A large section was taken out of one Department and put into another and this upset the formation of policy which was taking place to comply <Col N="2213" /> with the Devlin report which the Deputy was talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not.  The formulation of policy setting out the two criteria of objectives which the Deputy is talking about was pursued in the Department of Energy until such time as a large section of industry was taken from one Department and put into another.  I am sure the Deputy appreciates the complications that were involved.  When certain consequential matters arising out of the transfer have been ironed out we will proceed to formulate policy along the lines suggested by the Deputy which are contained in the Devlin report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that. Would the Minister agree that it is not very desirable but is a sad commentary on all involved &mdash; I include the former Government in this &mdash; to cite transfer of functions as an excuse for not taking decisions?  We, as politicians, would be better off leaving things alone if changing Departments around is a means of avoiding making decisions.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the cost of building the pipeline from Cork to Dublin would be about £60 million. I presume BGE have already borrowed <Col N="2214" /> for the cost of the pipeline from Inch to Cork.  Given that they have, they will soon reach the ceiling of £80 million. The Minister will have to come back to the House to increase the borrowing level.  Is it intended that, in future, BGE should have internal reserves and, out of that, fund the building of the pipeline from Dublin to Belfast if that is the next spur to be built or will there be further borrowings?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to tie down the policy the Government are pursuing. If the Government expect BGE to internally finance some capital undertakings and at the same time are taking funds out of it to contribute towards balancing the budget, this House should know.  Someone should be able to state what the Government's policy is to what looks like <Col N="2215" /> being the biggest money spinner from the point of view of a State company in the history of the State.</P>
      <P>Enormous profits are involved in this and we should know the Government's policy in regard to these.  Do they intend to take an annual basis of some 50 per cent of BGE profits and use them for ordinary day-to-day revenue or do they intend not to take any more?  Was this year's £28 million a once-off or do they intend to take some higher percentage in future years?  What is their policy in regard to that?  Having established that, if the Government intend to use BGE as a contributor to day-to-day financing of the State, then we come back to the point I was making of how much BGE should charge individual users for gas.  When I said there was a pragmatic approach to it my meaning was clear, but the Minister did not quite answer the question as to what is to happen in the future.  He talks about a cohesive policy for the pricing of gas for industry, and he repeated the word &ldquo;industry&rdquo; twice in his reply here today.  If industry are to be the one taker of natural gas who are to be charged an energy-related price, there is a possibility that industry may choose not to use natural gas as an energy source.  They may use it as a feedstock for different things, but not as an energy source.  If the Dublin Gas Company, the Cork Gas Company and the ESB are getting gas at a below energy-related price, forming the hidden subsidy which I was advocating, then industry may decide to use either gas through the Dublin Gas Company or electricity as their energy source because in terms of one of their costs it comes cheaper as an energy source than buying it directly from BGE.  When the Minister talks about a cohesive policy what precisely does he mean in that regard?</P>

      <P>On the question of financing the capital projects it has been set broadly as a 70-30 basis, 70 per cent to be borrowed and 30 per cent to be self-financing to BGE.  That is to be broadly set, not specific, and it is anticipated that this will continue for some time to come.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for any others as well.  It is broadly set in that pattern and we expect that this will be the pattern for the future.  In relation to what I mean about gas for industry, the Deputy will appreciate that up to now there has been what could be described as a rather restrictive policy towards industrial use of natural gas until the question of the pipeline has been got under way and until you could quantify the amount of gas that would be needed in the premium market which we all want to see gas turned into in the first instance to maximise the value of Kinsale Head.</P>
      <P>On the question of the quantities to be determined in relation to the ESB and the North of Ireland, when all those quantities are set it becomes clear that one can work out a cohesive policy for industrial use.  That is precisely what we are doing and we hope to have it out to industrialists as soon as possible.  There are industries which are ideally suited for the use of natural gas and they have been sitting back and waiting for a policy on it to see how they can plan their future. There are many such industries and we need not identify them here.  The Deputy will be aware of some of them.  That is what I mean by saying to industry that here is the situation in relation to natural gas, here is the price at which it will be. We can then let the company do their own planning from there on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not quite getting the point I am making.  Industry could have two possible uses for natural gas, either as a feedstock as in the case of NET or as an energy source.  We must differentiate between these.  We can leave feedstocks aside because the negotiated price would depend on the market conditions and the price which can be got for the finished product for which the gas is used as a feedstock.  Regarding the use as an energy source, there is a danger of a policy being adopted by the Government which might mean that you are planning a pipeline now and, even though <Col N="2217" /> not specifically identifying industries which may take gas as an energy source at its root or its destination, the ESB are getting that below the market value. Those industries which are now being counted on to take gas as an energy source and which will be charged an energy-related price would not take the gas as an energy source if they could get another form of energy at a subsidised price through the ESB.  From that point of view it could interfere with planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the point, seeing the price at which NET are getting gas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they are an example, but there are others in that situation. I am not talking about NET specifically. The price about which industrialists have been talking was an indicated price which was very high and would not be attractive to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>As an energy source. Indications were given six or eight months ago which would not entice anybody to think about it, but that could be described purely as a protective measure in relation to the overall quantity of gas, how it was to be divided up and who was to get it.  That is the type of study that is going on at the moment.  I intend to rationalise the price to industry.  A link-up cost must be kept in mind because you cannot disrupt the balance in relation to the ESB as an energy source and natural gas as an energy source.  It would be premature for me to go any further on it now until we have got to grips more with the various price mechanisms that have to be introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as wise as I was.  I will go back to the other point which the Minister has not answered yet.  Have the Government decided how they will deal with the profits being generated by BGE? <Col N="2218" /> Will they take some of these profits on an annual basis to finance revenue?  If so, what will be the percentage, or is it to be a fixed amount annually?  I think £28 million is the figure this year.  Will it be £28 million or £28 million plus next year?  Will sufficient funds be left to BGE to do the internal financing of pipelines and any other capital involvements they may have in the future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  The Deputy must appreciate that the usage will quantify three or four times over so that the level of profits will be substantially higher than the level we are talking about in present-day circumstances.  The situation is totally different at this point in time.  The Deputy is asking that BGE be left without funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>At this point in time the gas costs X amount.  The cost of transmitting it to Dublin costs Y amount so that we now have an X+Y cost factor. The point is that if the Government are to take profits from the board for day-to-day revenue the charge will have to be X+Y+Z.  Is the Z factor to be constant for all customers or will it be Z for one, A for another and B for another?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The board have been set up and designed to make a profit and it will be for them to analyse the situation as they find it.  We have set out general policy guidelines for them.  The Deputy is hardly suggesting that the gas be given away for nothing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that except to the extent of my earlier suggestion, that is, that there is something to be said for a policy that will allow a subsidy to industry by way of charging a price to the ESB that would allow them to sell cheap electricity to industry.  However, the point I am trying to make is that if <Col N="2220" /> the Government have committed themselves to taking profits each year from BGE, there must be adopted some policy regarding the charging for that gas so that it will generate those profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the board are set up to make profits.  Is anybody suggesting the situation should be otherwise? On the question of the subsidisation of energy to industry, there are many sides to that argument.  We could go on discussing at length how the gas can be of most benefit to the economy as a whole.  We could ask whether it would be best to take all the gas in and redistribute it or whether various aspects of the economy are considered in the context of how they could be helped by reason of this gas supply.  The Deputy will appreciate that the ESB prices would not be at their present levels if it were not for the fact that the ESB are profiting from the availability of natural gas.  Consequently, that benefit is available to industry.  The fact that the recent increase in charges did not apply to the heavy night users is due to the availability of natural gas. Broadly speaking what I have said here is that at all times the board will be left with enough finance to ensure that they are self-financing.  The Exchequer will take the excess profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the price is not an energy-related nor an oil-related price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is energy-related and also oil-related.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like if the Minister would ask the board to state specifically in their annual reports the basis of their assumptions about the life span of the present sources of gas.  These assumptions are of importance in assessing the wisdom or otherwise of investment in distribution systems.  Clearly, distribution systems will only pay for themselves if they are in use for a fixed length of time.  If, for instance, the distribution system is becoming overextended <i>vis-à-vis</i> the assumed availability of the gas, many of the new distribution <Col N="2221" /> arrangements being made would be uneconomic.</P>
      <P>The Minister will say that it is not possible to say how much gas is available.  I appreciate that.  But if, for example, we are to reach a conclusion as to whether a particular extension of the natural gas pipeline is viable, we must know the assumptions the board are using as to the availability of the gas.  If, for instance, there were 40 years' gas available for the existing grid it might be sensible to make the gas available to Navan, thereby increasing the usage and reducing the timespan to perhaps 38 years. If, on the other hand, there is only a 20-year supply of gas available and if the extension to Navan would reduce that to 17 or 18 years, it might not be such an economically sensible proposition to engage in the extra cost of extending the pipeline to that town.  Therefore, it is important that there be an explicit statement each year from the board as to the assumptions they are using in determining the availability of the gas and I am suggesting that that statement be incorporated in the annual reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage I raised a question which the Minister did not get around to dealing with in his reply.  I refer to the breakdown of borrowing by the board as between foreign and domestic borrowing. I should like to know if any guidance is being given either by the Minister or by the Minister for Finance to the board as to the extent to which they should borrow abroad.  I should like to hear also whether the Minister would agree that the annual report of the board should state the basis of their borrowing policy in so far as they are borrowing abroad. My third question is to ask the Minister to indicate how long in his view the authority given by section 1 for additional borrowing will suffice.  In other words, how soon, based on present trends continuing, would he expect to have to seek an increase of the figure?  I realise that there are many imponderables in this question.  One would need to know the rate of inflation, the rate of cost increases and so on.  I am not asking the Minister to speculate about any of those matters <Col N="2222" /> but I should like him to tell us what is the assumption on which he is working in regard to the durability of this piece of legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The length of time that we expect section 1 to be sufficient to look after the borrowing powers of the board is approximately two years.  If, however, the Northern Ireland project should not succeed, the timespan would be longer.  I agree that more information should be available in the annual reports of the company and I will communicate that view to the board.</P>
      <P>On the foreign borrowing, the Deputy can be assured that the advice from the Department of Finance is relayed to the board through our Department in relation to the various currencies.  I presume that the Deputy is referring to the question of finding the best basket in terms of borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the board receiving advice from the Department of Finance in regard to the currencies in which they should borrow abroad but what I am asking the Minister is to tell us what advice the board are getting as to whether they should borrow abroad or as to the extent to which they should borrow abroad compared with borrowing at home.  That is a different question from the technical one of, once the decision is made to borrow abroad, in what currencies should the money be borrowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision has been made to borrow abroad on the basis of what I have said already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>But in what proportion of the total borrowings have the board been advised to borrow abroad?  Are they to borrow any of the money at home?  If they borrow abroad, do they have any control in regard to the currencies in which they borrow, given that the EIB decide what they are going to lend?  I would have thought they make the decision as to whether the borrowing is by way of deutschemark loan or guilder loan or whatever.  Therefore, perhaps the Minister will say what is the relevance of <Col N="2223" /> the Department of Finance's advice in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is hardly suggesting that the Department of Finance have no relevance as to advice on borrowing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to foreign borrowing, it has been said that most of the borrowing will be through the EIB. There will be some, but not very much, at home.  I am sure the Deputy appreciates that the more pressure one puts on domestic borrowing at present the more it aggravates an already difficult area in relation to interest rates and that a decision has been taken in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister a further question?  Given the fact that it is notoriously difficult to get legislation through this House &mdash; I am not talking now about the position politically but about the time factor &mdash; does the Minister think it wise to have an authority for additional borrowing by An Bord Gáis which, let us all agree, is necessary but which lasts for two years only?  Has the Minister considered that?  For instance, would he not have thought it wiser to have looked for an authority which would be sufficient to carry An Bord Gáis forward for, say, four years, thereby avoiding uncertainty and possibly even good terms not being taken up because legislation has not yet been enacted to enable further borrowing to be undertaken, they being already at their borrowing limit? We do not want a situation occurring in which An Bord Gáis would actually exceed their statutory limit &mdash; that would be a grave serious matter &mdash; but, if that is the case, we want to be sure that the limit is adequate.  I would be worried at what the Minister has said about just two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I share part of the Deputy's point of view.  But Deputy Barry made the point also &mdash; and I am inclined to agree with him &mdash; that one <Col N="2224" /> should not come here and legislate for a level of borrowing that could keep a semi-State company out of debate in relation to this situation.  He is more inclined to the view &mdash; and I am inclined to agree with him &mdash; that there is nothing wrong with keeping it on the short term, so that the House can scrutinise what is happening.  Many mistakes have been made in the past when one remembers what has happened in some semi-State areas.  Therefore there is nothing wrong in coming back to the House that quickly. Irrespective of what Government may be in power I do not think the House would unnecessarily hold up any Bill which was in the best interests of the economy, whether it be in relation to An Bord Gáis or any other project which it was in the national interest to go ahead with.  I do not think that would be reflected in the performance of any party in this House. On that basis there is nothing wrong with having it for a shorter period than heretofore. I appreciate the point made by Deputy Bruton in relation to the possibility of changes in interest rates but I do not think it is something one would have to worry about because I think the House would accommodate short legislation to increase the borrowing powers if such a situation arose.  By and large that has been the record in the past.</P>

On Committee Stage we are confined to what is sought in the particular section.  While in the original legislation reference was made to the annual report, in this section there is no such reference.

Standing Orders, and the precedent is there, specify that discussion on matter which is not provided for in the amending legislation has not been accepted except in passing.  Perhaps the Chair has been culpable.  I have been giving a mildly deaf ear to the questions and answers between Deputies and <Col N="2226" /> the Minister, but, insofar as we seem now to be moving into a completely new area not provided for, I am drawing the attention of the House to that fact.</P>

      <P>Section 1 authorised the body to borrow.  This section authorises the Minister for Finance to guarantee these borrowings.  I should like to know the extent to which it is absolutely necessary for An Bord Gáis to have a State guarantee for all their borrowings.  There may be a tendency in legislation to assume that every borrowing by a State company must also have a State guarantee. That would not be necessary if An Bord Gáis themselves had substantial assets against which they would be capable of borrowing anyway regardless of a State guarantee.  The necessity for a State guarantee arises only where the body in question do not have assets commensurate with their borrowings and, therefore, need some other form of collateral security which is provided by way of State guarantee. I would like to know: what assets have An Bord Gáis?  What is the value <Col N="2227" /> of those assets?  Are those assets being used in any sense as security for borrowing by An Bord Gáis?  If they are being so used, does this not mean that a State guarantee is not necessary for the full extent of the borrowings by An Bord Gáis and that An Bord Gáis could be entitled to borrow only with State guarantee to the extent to which their assets were insufficient to meet their total borrowing requirements in terms of being collateral for such borrowing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I am continuing providing for the ability to guarantee if such guarantee is required.  As regards the other question he asked in relation to the assets of An Bord Gáis, I would say that as of now I have not got a full valuation of An Bord Gáis assets.  I accept that they are fairly substantial.  But what we are providing for here is really a continuance of what has been done &mdash; to have the facility available to them, if required &mdash; and I agree that it should not be used unless absolutely required.</P>

If An Bord Gáis have assets of a substantial quantity and value they do not need a State guarantee to the extent of those assets so far as their borrowings are concerned.  They should be able to substract the value of their assets from their total borrowings and the residual should be the extent that requires the State guarantee.  They do not require a State guarantee for their total borrowings, only for their total borrowing minus their assets.  I know a practice has grown up in all borrowing authorisations before us to give a State guarantee for the entire borrowing regardless of the value of the assets of the company.  I do not think that is necessary.  We need to question more than we do the wisdom of giving State guarantees all around the place as if they did not count and would never have to be called upon anyway.  We should make a distinction bearing in mind the value of assets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to update some important aspects of the legislation concerning town gas companies. Over the years the existing legislation has served an essential purpose.  It established and developed the fundamental obligations and rights of gas companies taking account of their specific obligation to provide gas as a service to the public. Stagnation in the town gas industry in more recent times, and lack of incentive for development and capital investment, meant that no strain was put on this rather antique legislative framework.  But that is now in course of change.  The supply of natural gas to Dublin and Cork and the possibilities of supplying natural gas to other existing town gas companies, where practicable, calls for legislative change.  There is an urgent need to remedy at least the more serious deficiencies in present legislation to prepare for the new situation.</P>
      <P>Gas companies need more modern laws to put them on a footing somewhat similar to the modern company.  The longer-term solution will be to repeal all previous Acts and Orders and to have a single piece of legislation dealing with all gas companies.  But in the meantime, the purpose of the proposals in the present Bill is to deal with those deficiencies which are seen as a hindrance to gas companies, such as Dublin and Cork. These companies have to take immediate measures to raise capital and borrowings and to take other appropriate steps for the distribution of natural gas.</P>
      <P>The major features of this Bill, which I will deal with in more detail later, can be summarised as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  the introduction of the option for gas companies to have a memorandum <Col N="2232" /> and articles of association like any other modern company.  This will remove the necessity for ministerial orders requiring Oireachtas approval for routine management matters while still retaining the more critical provisions of existing legislation.  When a gas company does not opt to adopt a memorandum and articles this Bill will still dispense with the need for ministerial orders in specified routine matters</P>
    <P>(2)  the application to gas companies of provisions of the Companies Act in such matters as issue of a prospectus and allotment and issue of shares or stocks.  The existing legislation either does not cover these events or is seriously deficient in relation to them.</P>
    <P>The updating measures will allow gas utilities to operate in a modern, commercial company law framework consistent with the needs for any major developments related to the lay-on of natural gas.</P>
    <P>Deputies will know that there are eight operational town gas companies.  These are in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Clonmel, Kilkenny, Dundalk and Wexford.  None of these is a company incorporated under the Companies Acts. With the exception of Clonmel and Limerick, which are part of their respective local authorities, all other town gas companies are privately owned.  The gas companies were established about the middle of the last century.  Each is subject to its own separate regime of special Acts of Parliament from which it derives its initial constitution, powers and duties.</P>
    <P>For example, the present Alliance and Dublin Consumers Gas Company was incorporated for the purpose of supplying gas under the Alliance and Dublin Gas Act, 1866.  The Act also defined the company's area of operation and regulated its capital and borrowing powers.  Seven other special Acts concerning this company were subsequently enacted, the last one being the Alliance and Dublin Gas Act, 1909.  A pattern of Special Acts for each of the other town gas companies developed in a similar, independent way.</P>
    <P>The independent evolution of special <Col N="2233" /> Acts for individual gas companies resulted in a certain lack of cohesion in the law on such companies.  It became obvious that there was a need for legislation which could have a common application and which could supplement the special Acts.  Thus various Acts, suited to gas companies in general, were also enacted.  For example, the Companies Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, as amended and supplemented in a minor way by other Acts, contains comprehensive provisions for the internal regulation and management of public utilities such as gas companies.  The provisions in these Acts are largely the forerunners of a kind which would be found in the articles of association of a modern company.  Many of these Acts are deficient and outmoded in many respects.</P>
    <P>The Gasworks Clauses Acts, 1847 and 1871, gave gas companies the right to open up public streets to lay, replace and repair gas mains.  They contain provisions obliging a gas company to supply gas to a person located near a gas mains.  They also contain provisions concerning use of meters and testing quality of gas.  The Gas and Waterworks Facilities Acts, 1870 and 1873, were enacted to enable a gas company to construct gasworks and raise capital for that purpose; to amalgamate with another gas company and to do various other things.  Various Acts which have application to gas companies were enacted over the years.  The more important of these are listed in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Gas Regulation Act, 1920, deserves special mention.  Prior to that Act gas companies were, as I have outlined, almost totally locked into a regime of Acts which extensively controlled their operation and regulation even in matters of a routine nature.  Change, even minor change, could be achieved in most instances only by an amending Act.  The significance of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, was that it enabled a variety of changes to be made by ministerial order. In particular an order could be made to modify or amend the provisions of any special Act or other provision relating to a gas company which would help the company to operate more efficiently.  It was <Col N="2234" /> a substantial improvement because it opened the way for some flexibility in effecting change.  The need for a more flexible approach is reflected in the numerous orders which, at the request of individual gas companies, have been made in the intervening years.  Most of these orders are still in force.  They deal with a wide variety of things, such as increasing the number of directorships, determining the frequency of general meetings and evaluating stockholders' funds.</P>
    <P>The 1920 Act did not, however, give gas companies the degree of flexibility which today's circumstances require. Before an order is made the draft must be laid before, and approved by resolution of, both Houses of the Oireachtas even though the draft order might relate only to some fairly simple aspect of day-to-day administration.  In the case of an ordinary company such matters could be dealt with by resolution of the company. I think Deputies will agree that the procedures for making an order which I have described can therefore be regarded as unnecessarily cumbersome in many cases.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned a few of the more important enactments to give Deputies some idea of the complex web of legislation which has become woven around gas companies over the years.  This interweaving of special Acts, generally applicable Acts and various statutory orders made from time to time, has created a situation where functions and constitution of any gas company are contained in a confused statutory framework which is unnecessarily inflexible, outmoded in many respects and inadequate for an expanding gas industry.</P>
    <P>The case of Dublin Gas Company is a prime example.  Some 37 Acts, orders and amending orders have been made in relation to this company.  Most, if not all, are still in operation.  They interact with each other in a complex way which makes it extremely difficult to understand the constitution and laws of the company.  It is for these reasons that I propose the measures contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill gives gas companies the option of adopting a memorandum <Col N="2235" /> and articles of association.  This will enable them to adopt a modern constitution generally.  In particular it will provide a flexible framework for raising the level of capital and borrowings required and for altering those levels to meet changing needs.  In general a company which adopts a memorandum and articles will have a more modern alternative to the provisions enshrined, for example, in the Companies Clauses Acts which I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>However, existing laws will be replaced only to the extent of the provisions of the memorandum and articles. In particular, those enactments or parts of enactments which give a gas company its fundamental powers and obligations as a gas utility will not be capable of dilution in the memorandum or articles. There is a safeguard against this in a provision in section 2 which provides that a memorandum and articles or any amendment must be confirmed by me as Minister.  Of course, I have the option to waive the need for confirmation in appropriate circumstances and I will give maximum flexibility to gas companies in this respect.</P>
    <P>Section 3 applies to gas companies, with necessary modifications, the provisions of the Companies Act, 1963, regarding the issue of a prospectus and related matters concerning the allotment and issue of shares or stock.  The present laws on gas companies contain no provisions about a prospectus and are seriously deficient in other related matters.  Section 4 gives a gas company general borrowing powers subject to the provisions of its memorandum.</P>
    <P>Section 5 applies the provisions of the Companies Act, 1963, regarding appointment of auditors.  This means in particular that an auditing firm may be appointed as auditor.  Under present legislation at least some gas companies must appoint individuals.</P>
    <P>Under sections 6, 7, 8, and 9 provisions similar to the Companies Act, 1963, are being introduced regarding the creation and registration of charges on the property of a gas company, appointment of a receiver over its property, security for <Col N="2236" /> debts and priority of debts.  Existing creditors will not be prejudiced by these provisions.</P>
    <P>Present legislation on gas companies does not cope adequately with such matters. Gas companies need to be on the same footing as ordinary companies when securing borrowings for the capital investment which will be necessary for the changeover to natural gas.  The proposals in this Bill to apply provisions of the Companies Act could possibly give rise to doubts and difficulties about the scope and extent of the application of company law.  Section 12 enables such difficulties to be resolved by order.</P>
    <P>A town gas enterprise which is part of its local authority does not have a company structure.  Local authority borrowings and other affairs are controlled by the Department of the Environment.  It would not be appropriate to apply to a local authority which supplies town gas the provisions of sections 2 to 9 aforementioned. The effect would be to give the appearance of diluting the necessary controls which are the responsibility of the appropriate authorities.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 and 11 replace subsection (2) of section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, the repeal of which is provided for under section 15 of the Bill.  The effect of section 10 is to empower the Minister to allow gas companies to do certain things of an administrative nature, such as giving a separate supply of gas for industrial purposes, which under section 10 (2) of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, would have to be done by order.  Section 11 retains the order procedure for important matters such as reduction of capital and alteration of the authorised limits of supply.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, these are interim measures.  A more comprehensive Act to deal with all gas companies is planned. Such legislation will have to take account of an appropriate procedure for the incorporation of new gas companies.  No such procedure is provided for in the present gas laws and it may be needed as the gas grid is extended.  Preparation of new legislation will afford the opportunity not only to replace out-of-date provisions on the constitution, financing and <Col N="2237" /> management of gas undertakings but also to provide a broad framework within which expansion of the natural gas network can take place with due regard to commercial, technical and safety considerations appropriate to modern circumstances. I have instructed my Department to prepare as quickly as possible proposals for a comprehensive Act.</P>
    <P>It has been considered necessary to have this Bill enacted during the present session because it will facilitate certain measures which must be taken by the Dublin Gas Company within the next couple of months in preparation for the receipt of natural gas around the end of this year.  The Bill will also provide similar flexibility for Cork Gas Company in case special measures are needed by that company in the near future.  As Deputies will know, the essential elements of the contract between BGE and the Dublin company have only recently been approved.  Since then, a great deal of consultation, at administrative and legal levels, has been necessary in the course of drafting the Bill.  In order to meet parliamentary deadlines, the text of the Bill was circulated while certain legal drafting points were still under review. This process has been completed and I am advised that a number of minor amendments are desirable, mainly in the interests of greater legal precision and clarity.  I have circulated these amendments and I will deal with them at the appropriate stage.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical Bill. It is doubtful whether it should be sponsored by the Minister for Industry and Energy.  It is perhaps more appropriate to the Minister for Justice.  But I am interested to see it come before this House because I remember saying in 1975 or 1976 in relation to some Act that went through the House at that time that some updating of the gas regulations was urgently needed and that I was proposing to have a Bill drafted to bring us into the seventies because all the various Acts were constraining the expansion and development of the Dublin Gas Company <Col N="2238" /> at this time.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see this measure before the House.  But I am pretty certain that the Minister will be back here before Christmas looking for another amendment to this Bill because we are dealing with regulations and orders that are in operation since the middle of the last century.  That is a pity.  That it is a difficult piece of legislation to draft is shown by the fact that the Minister circulated a number of amendments to the Bill this morning even before it reached the floor of the House.  So we can expect other deficiencies in the Bill which will show soon after it becomes law or when it is taken to pieces by the solicitors and lawyers acting as advisers not just to the Government and the Minister's Department but to the gas undertakings themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I spoke on the Second Stage of the previous Bill I suggested that BGE should consider taking equity in the companies responsible for the final distributors of natural gas.  By that I meant the Dublin Gas Company and any other privately owned or quoted company in the State.  The Minister said today that the decision had been made to do just that. I may be wrong but, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first time that this has been announced.  That is the correct decision.  When we are dealing with a national resource such as this we should see that the end uses of the product are controlled as much as possible.  I am not an advocate of State participation in things.  I think the further the State stays away from private enterprise the better chance private enterprise has of progressing and providing the jobs that are so necessary in this country.  But I would make an exception in relation to this.  I was a bit surprised to hear the Minister saying this so badly here today.  But if this becomes public knowledge, I hope the Minister will ensure by regulations or whatever is necessary that a killing is not made on the stock market by people who fortuitously hold shares in the Dublin Gas Company.  I would not like to see such people benefiting by a huge jump in the value of those shares purely because the Government were going to step in <Col N="2239" /> and take equity in the company.  Some safeguard must be brought in to ensure that that does not happen.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Government underwrote some of the borrowings of the Dublin Gas Company in exchange for which they had the right to nominate members to the board of the Dublin Gas Company.  That board may even be fully controlled by ministerial appointees at the moment.  What is the present position with regard to the State's involvement in the Dublin Gas Company?  If, as the Minister said when replying to the Second Stage of the previous Bill, the Gas (Amendment) Bill, 1982, An Bord Gáis Eireann or the Government intend to take a stake in the Dublin Gas Company, does that apply to the other listed private companies in the State, one of which has already got natural gas?  Cork has a supply of natural gas.  It is proposed that Dublin be given some in the very near future, and then Limerick, Waterford, Clonmel, Kilkenny, Dundalk and Wexford. Clonmel and Waterford Gas Companies are owned by the local authorities, but the others, Waterford, Kilkenny, Dundalk and Wexford are still in private hands.  I would like to know what the Government's attitude to these companies is and if it is the intention of the Government to extend their interest to those companies.</P>
    <P>At the end of his speech the Minister said that the preparation of new legislation would afford the opportunity not only to replace out-of-date provisions of the past on the constitution, financing and management of gas undertakings, but to provide a broad framework within which an expansion of the natural gas network could take place with due regard to commercial, technical and safety considerations appropriate to modern circumstances and that he would be instructing his Department to prepare proposals for a comprehensive Act as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if all those considerations, safety, technical and commercial, should be incorporated in the same Act. I would think that the safety consideration would deserve a separate Act dealing <Col N="2240" /> with safety in the handling of natural gas, town gas or liquid gas, when being moved by lorry or container or, as may well be in the future, by ships, or gas pipelines as I was suggesting earlier, tied into a European grid.  The safety aspect of that would be more suitably contained in a separate Act.  I am not sure what technical means in this regard or how it is separated from safety.  The commercial theme should be left separate by an up-dating of the Gas Regulations Bill, 1982.  Given the nature of what the Minister is trying to do in this Bill it is almost inevitable loopholes will be found and we will be back here again discussing amendments to this before next Christmas.  I hope that will not be so but the possibility is there that it will be so.</P>
    <P>This Bill is necessary.  Indeed, this legislation was overdue and I myself may be culpable in not doing something when I had the opportunity.  Indeed, this legislation was necessary right from the foundation of the State and comprehensive legislation should have been introduced in the twenties rather than 60 years later, legislation governing the sale and distribution of gas to bring it into line with modern concepts rather than continue what had been inherited from the last century.</P>
    <P>Another point is the regulations controlling the sale of the product by certain undertakings.  In the comprehensive legislation to be introduced later is it proposed to change these areas or wipe them out altogether?  These undertakings are strictly controlled geographically.  The Cork Gas Company has some problem because the area of development does not necessarily coincide with the area in which the company is allowed to sell gas. I cannot remember exactly where the divergence comes in their permitted area of activity.  I think Little Island may be outside the area in which they are allowed to operate with the result that they were deprived of customers in the industrial estate there.  Again many of the areas which might be described as satellites may be outside the area.  I refer to areas like Blarney, Carrigaline and Ballincollig. These are outside the area served by the Cork Gas Company.  They may have <Col N="2241" /> no wish to serve these areas or the people in them may not be willing to pay the price, but I would like to know whether it is proposed to make any changes in these areas which were probably drawn up for each gas undertaking as and when it was formed and have probably not been changed since then.  They do not necessarily bear any relationship now to the contiguous areas which have developed since.  Would the Minister indicate whether he will allow any change or whether the existing areas will be wiped out by this Bill?</P>

This measure will facilitate the Government in dealing with the companies concerned and we regard it as a useful measure at this juncture.</P>

      <P>I understand this Bill is subject to the list of items contained in the Schedule.  The Schedule lists a number of Acts and there is nothing in any of the memoranda made under this Bill which can dilute any of the provisions of those Acts.  Does this Bill involve a blanket repeal of all legislation other than the Acts specifically mentioned?  All that is done under the heading of repeal in section 15 is one subsection of a section of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920.  I ask partly out of interest but also from the point of view that one does not want a conflict of interpretation &mdash; does the fact that this is the most recent legislation implicitly repeal all previous legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also be interested to know if it would be appropriate to put in this or subsequent legislation provisions which would facilitate profit sharing by the employees and also perhaps involve the possibility of employees becoming shareholders on a preferential basis.  Furthermore, will the legislation contain provisions to enable employees to get legitimate information about the way in <Col N="2242" /> which the company is operated and their job prospects?  I am not very familiar with the debate going on between the trade unions and various Ministers but I know there is some dispute because employees feel they should be given more information about the way in which companies operate since certain operations might be to their detriment.  To what extent has the Minister considered this aspect of general company law in relation to the operation of the Gas Company?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contribution to this debate.  It is a very complicated exercise.  This is an interim measure to deal with a specific situation.  Work is starting on the consolidation of legislation dealing with gas supplies.  Various points were raised relating to safety aspects and I agree that this matter must be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry asked whether it is intended to change under this or subsequent legislation the existing scope for the development of gas companies to cover satellite towns.  As the market develops it may be necessary from time to time to change limits of supply but this can be done by order under section 5 (11).  Such development is not now envisaged but I agree that it may have to be considered in view of the expansion of satellite towns in the Dublin and Cork areas.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry asked when the announcement was made concerning the Government's taking an interest in the Dublin Gas Company.  This was announced on 21 May but I cannot remember the extent of coverage.  I believe this is the right course of action in the re-organisation of the Dublin Gas Company.  There was reference also to the elements of that agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter must go <Col N="2243" /> before the stockholders as this is a private company in which the Government do not have shares.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton raised the matter of profit sharing.  This Bill is neutral in respect of profit sharing by employees and it is a matter for the company.  I welcome the idea, although it is not new. There is provision under the existing Companies Act for specific types of shares which can be distributed to employees on a profit-sharing basis.  It is a progressive move on the part of companies to enable employees to share in profits and the Dublin Gas Company might consider this idea.  Probably motivation could be increased by such a step.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in this Bill to change the duty on gas companies to supply gas and nothing that can be done in their memorandum and articles of association can override that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton asked whether the Acts listed in the Schedule will remain in force.  They will, except in so far as they are amended by the memorandum and articles of association.  The basic obligations of a gas company remain and cannot be changed by the memorandum.</P>
      <P>I repeat that this is an interim measure. There is a need for consolidation and the need for this legislation arises from the supply of natural gas to Cork and its expected arrival in Dublin by the end of the year.  I agree that this is a very difficult legal area, as shown by amendments to be introduced later.  The job had to be tackled and a start has been made.</P>

      <P>It would seem that the undertaker is entitled to borrow in such a manner as he shall think fit so long as that is in conformity with the memorandum and articles of association.  While I would not be inclined to go back to the very restrictive terms of the previous legislation &mdash; one-and-a-half times the prescribed share capital &mdash; I can see the point of having a more restrictive regime in regard to borrowing in respect of a public utility than in respect of a normal company. If a normal company go bankrupt there is no problem about another company coming in and trying to provide the same service so long as they are not a monopoly.  However, if a public utility &mdash; for example a gas company &mdash; go bankrupt because of an unwise borrowing policy there is a greater risk of that public service breaking down.  Is the Minister satisfied that he has not gone too far in <Col N="2252" /> simply saying they should be entitled to borrow as they think fit?  Would he not see some case for having some ratio &mdash; if 1.5 is too narrow, let us say five times subscribed share capital, or something reasonably generous &mdash; to limit their borrowings to reflect the fact that they are a public utility?</P>

In the course of asking a question about Tullira Castle in which my concern was, as it has been in many other questions over the past month or so, to demonstrate what seems to me to be an unwarranted assumption by the Taoiseach personally of power which belongs to the Government as a collective authority, I appear to have said in the cut and thrust of question and answer something to the effect that he was personally interested in this purchase. That is how the notetaker had it although I do not recall using those words.  I meant to convey that he was taking over what appeared to me to be a Government function on deciding on acquisition.  Of course, I wish to disclaim absolutely any insinuation which I did not intend of some idea which I would have absolutely no reason to entertain, that there was anything of personal interest in the matter in any other sense.</P>

    <Title>Fuels (Control of Supplies) Bill, 1982: Second Stage</Title>
    <Col N="2254" />
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Act, 1971 to ensure that a mandatory regime for disposal of the production of the Whitegate refinery can be established under the Act, as amended.  The Bill also includes an amendment removing a legal doubt as to the applicability of the Act to stocks of oil in retailers' premises.</P>
      <P>The Fuels (Control of Supplies) Act, 1971, is a measure enabling the Minister for Industry and Energy to control the supply and distribution of fuels.  Whenever the Government declare by order under section 2 that the exigencies of the common good so require, the Minister may by order under section 3 provide for the regulation and control of the supply and distribution of fuels and for the control, regulation, restriction or prohibition of the import or export of fuels.  An order made by the Minister may empower him to issue such authorisations, licences or directions as he considers necessary for giving full effect to any provisions of the order.</P>
      <P>The Act was introduced at a time when energy demand in Ireland and in the Western world generally was steadily increasing.  With this increase in oil demand and the potential upheavals which were apparent in the world, particularly in the Middle East, at that time, it became imperative for oil importing countries to prepare to deal with any supply disruptions or other developments in the energy situation.  This proved to be a prudent preparation as later events including the Middle East conflict in 1973-74 and the Iran revolution in 1979 showed.  The Fuels (Control of Supplies) Act, 1971 was invoked by the Government to control the supply and distribution of oil during the shortage in Ireland's oil supply which followed these events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today, oil still accounts for the major proportion of Ireland's energy requirements, although the impact of Kinsale gas and increased use of coal have <Col N="2255" /> reduced this proportion from 75 per cent in 1978 to 63 per cent in 1981.  A major element of the Government's energy policy is to further reduce this considerable dependence on imported fuel to a reasonable level.  As this reduction must take place in a manner which will least disturb the economy of the country, it is a medium term goal.  Until that goal is achieved oil will continue to be the major energy source.</P>
    <P>Given the constant risk that oil supplies may be seriously disrupted it is important that our requirements are made as secure as possible.  There are three main elements to a proper policy on oil supply security.  These are (1) diversification of sources and channels of supply; (2) maintenance of adequate stocks of oil; and (3) availability of oil refining capacity.</P>
    <P>Until 1979, Ireland's oil requirements were supplied by the Irish subsidiaries of the international oil companies and by small home-based independent importers. These supplies originated from the international companies' procurement systems, from supply contracts with other oil companies or from the product spot markets.  In 1979, the Government set up the Irish National Petroleum Corporation to take advantage of the growing preference on the part of oil producing states to by-pass the international oil companies and trade directly with the oil consuming countries.  In this way our sources and channels of supply are supplemented and diversified.  The corporation have concluded supply contracts with oil producers, and disposal of the products refined from this oil is carried out through the country's existing distribution system.  I intend to introduce legislation in the near future to provide a statutory basis for the capital structure, organisation and functions of the corporation.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as a member of the EEC and of the International Energy Agency, maintains, as required, a minimum of 90 days' stocks of oil.  Ten days' supply is held at the Whiddy oil terminal on behalf of the government and the remainder is held at Whitegate refinery and at the <Col N="2256" /> terminals and depots of the oil companies and or large oil consumers.  I am concerned, however, that about a quarter of these stocks are held abroad even though they are held under completed or pending agreements with the four states concerned, all of whom are member states of the EEC.  As I stated in the Dáil recently, I have this matter under examination.</P>
    <P>The third element of a policy on oil supply security is the availability of operating oil refining capacity.  A country with such capacity has greater freedom to negotiate supplies of crude oil from whatever source than if it had none.  Furthermore, it reduces dependence on foreign refineries and provides an alternative channel of supply.  In the absence of refining capacity an alternative is to have storage capacity for oil products capable of maintaining at the very minimum 90 days' stocks of oil in the national territory.  The capital cost of building storage facilities and filling them with oil to meet our national requirements would, it is estimated, be of the order of £2.5 million per day.  Therefore, if we wished to have an extra 25 days' stocks on Irish soil it would cost at least £60 million.  The companies are understandably reluctant to incur such costs, and retention of operating refining capacity partly reduces the scale of such stocks and the urgency of providing them in full.</P>
    <P>Ireland's only oil refinery is at Whitegate, County Cork.  It commenced operations in 1959 under the joint ownership of Esso, Shell, Texaco and BP.  It operated for several years from start-up under an element of protective duty.  Total refining capacity is 2.77 million tonnes per annum which, at current consumption rates, represents more than 50 per cent of the Irish oil market.  In May 1981 the four companies advised the Minister for Industry and Energy of a decision by their principals to suspend refining at Whitegate.  Their decision was on the ground that the operation of the refinery was resulting in substantial costs as compared with a situation where they would be free to import all of their requirements. Processing at Whitegate ceased in June 1981.  The owners confirmed in August 1981 that their decision was to <Col N="2257" /> close the refinery permanently and that the bulk of the workforce would be laid off in due course.  They envisaged retaining the tank farm at the refinery as a storage depot to meet stock obligations and as an operating terminal for the south and west of the country.  This would require the retention of a relatively small number of personnel.  There were about 155 direct employees of the refining company and an additional 150 employed in ancillary services such as tug-boats, fire watching, pilotage and a coastal shipping company which was substantially dependent on the refinery.</P>
    <P>As the absence of operating oil-refining capacity is considered unacceptable on strategic and other grounds, discussions with the refining companies pursued the possibilities that some mechanism be found to meet the dis-economies whichh they saw in continuing to operate Whitegate.  It became quite clear that the companies' decision to abandon refining at Whitegate was irrevocable and that, if the Government's objective of retaining a minimum strategic refining capability were to be preserved, the State would have to acquire and operate the refinery. The subsequent events in this matter have been widely publicised and I do not think it is necessary for me to say more than that the previous Government, shortly before going out of office, took a decision in principle to purchase the refinery.  Final negotiations were concluded with the owners of the refinery and the present Government, on assuming office, confirmed the decision to purchase.</P>
    <P>On 1 April last the House approved a Supplementary Estimate for the sum of £10 million to cover the purchase price, refurbishing costs and other costs arising up to the start-up date.  The planned date for resumption of production is early August and, as is known, the refinery is being owned and operated on behalf of the Government by the Irish National Petroleum Corporation.</P>
    <P>When it became clear that the four oil companies which jointly owned Whitegate were not prepared, and could not be persuaded or induced, to continue operating the refinery, and that the only basis <Col N="2258" /> for continuing operations would be under the aegis of the State, consideration was given to the manner in which off-take of products from a State-owned refinery could be disposed of.  This matter was discussed at considerable length with the companies marketing oil in Ireland with a view to finding out whether a system of voluntary off-take of products would command general support.</P>
    <P>It was, of course, recognised by the industry that it would be unacceptable, both in operating and economic terms, to envisage a system whereby the State would operate the refinery but would have no assurances that the products would be taken into the Irish market.  If that extremely risky course were adopted, products from Whitegate would have to be offered for sale at prices which would be competitive with the lowest prices prevailing on the international spot market.  Notwithstanding that the marketing companies themselves, for the security of their own supplies, would have to rely on term contracts rather than the spot market for the larger share of their supplies, no assurance emerged in the discussions that the companies would off-take from Whitegate on a basis other than as marginal supplies; indeed, bearing in mind the relationship between the Irish marketing companies and their UK supply companies, there could be no guarantee of off-take from INPC ex Whitegate at any price.  In times of glut, such as we experienced recently, spot prices for products could be lower than the official price of crude oil being put through the refinery.  Such a situation would be totally incompatible with an operation designed to provide the Irish economy with a minimum level of refining capacity in the interests of national security.</P>
    <P>While there was some recognition of this position by the oil marketing companies, they expressed strong concern that any off-take arrangements introduced should operate equitably across the board so that there would be no question of some companies having freedom to opt out while others might be disposed to co-operate.  It was clear that the criteria of general application of off-take <Col N="2259" /> obligations and equitable operation of the arrangements involved, could not be achieved unless there was a statutory backing to the arrangements.  The companies which formerly owned the refinery and the other oil marketers were, therefore, aware that a decision by the Government to purchase the refinery would entail a system of equitable off-take of Whitegate products, backed by legislation.</P>
    <P>The mandatory off-take concept has been considered at length by the Attorney General both in relation to Irish law and EEC obligations.  There have been also a number of detailed discussions with various divisions of the EEC Commission. The best advice available to the Government is that, taking due account of the position in domestic legislation and of our obligations in the EEC context, the Government are entitled, in the interests of national security, to take steps provided for in the Bill now before the House.  In relation to the Treaty of Rome, Article 36 clearly entitles a member Government to take exceptional measures to protect essential aspects of national security.  The House will be well aware that, in the decision of both the previous and present Governments to acquire the refinery, this criterion of national security was very much in mind. International events of recent occurrence have, I need hardly say, strongly underlined the importance of having within our jurisdiction refining facilities to meet at least our basic national oil requirements in an acute emergency.</P>
    <P>Deputies will naturally be concerned about the legal basis of the Bill, and they may be asking me to provide categoric assurances that this cannot be challenged. The Bill and, indeed, the 1971 Act are largely enabling measures.  The provisions of the Act have been invoked a number of times over the years and the changes proposed in the Bill do not alter the essential nature of the legislation.  In the circumstances, there appear to me to be no grounds whatever for reservations about the Bill in relation to domestic law or EEC requirements.  If any substantive legal issue arises it would appear to relate <Col N="2260" /> to the action proposed to be taken under the Bill.  In this regard since both national and supra-national Courts have jurisdiction, nobody can provide castiron guarantees. However, I repeat that the best advice available to me and to the Government is that the measures proposed are in accord with relevant law and EEC obligations.  An off-take regime is an essential element of the totally legitimate objective of maintaining an operating refinery to cater for our minimum emergency oil needs.  The purchase and operation of the refinery and a satisfactory system of equitable off-take of products are not separate concepts but are interdependent elements of one strategy.  It would be inconsistent for Deputies on either side of the House to say that they support the purchase of the refinery on grounds of national security but object to the arrangements for which the Bill provides.</P>
    <P>I had considered an alternative approach if it became necessary of making a wider Order under Section 3 (2) of this Act, as amended, under which companies would be required to submit a supply plan, for their supply proposals to the Irish market, for each period of 12 months, ahead.  Part of this supply plan would embrace the requirement that the proportionate level of product, as proposed above, would be drawn from the Irish refinery; secondly, that broad information would be given on the sourcing of the remainder of their supplies being imported, on the balance between term contract and spot supply in the latter, on the guarantees lying behind any overdependencies on supply from one country or one company in one country, on the acceptability of any restrictive agreements compelling supplies to be drawn from particular foreign companies and on the arrangements for stock holding.  It could be a feature of such a plan, under statutory order, that a marketing licence would be required and that the grant of such marketing licence would be conditional on observance of the requirements of the approved supply plan.</P>
    <P>I am aware that at least one other European country has felt it necessary to adopt measures of this kind in the interests <Col N="2261" /> of ensuring central control over security of supply.  The approach has merits and I would not rule it out as something we may wish to consider in certain circumstances. However, my present view is that, in prevailing conditions, such measures might be considered as going beyond what was essential.  I have, therefore, opted for the more limited approach which I have outlined because it is my opinion, and I am sure the oil industry would agree, that intervention in the operation of the market should be confined to the minimum necessary to achieve the limited objectives which State acquisition of the refinery is intended to safeguard.</P>
    <P>Measures introduced by Governments in various parts of the world to cushion their populations against the ever present risk of a serious disruption of supplies on the international oil market, frequently go beyond what would be considered normal commercial criteria.  Perhaps the most widely-known measures are obligatory oil storage obligations to which I referred earlier which operate in almost all oil-importing countries, including those in the EEC and the more widely representative International Energy Agency.  Under these storage regulations, oil trading companies are required to make arrangements, which involve costs of various kinds, to maintain stocks of oil to meet at least 90 days' requirements and these measures need not take account of whether or not the stocking levels and locations of the stocks would be considered by the companies to be necessary or desirable on strictly commercial grounds.  Both the previous and present Governments have concluded that, like strategic stocks, a minimum capacity for domestic refining is important on grounds of national security.  I have no doubt that most Governments in Europe, or indeed elsewhere, if faced with closure of 100 per cent of their national refining capacity, would take a similar view even though continental countries would not have the additional risk factor which applies in our case as an island economy.  I would emphasise, however, that I am committed to ensuring that the entire off-take regime, both <Col N="2262" /> as regards quantities and applicable prices, will be operated with the greatest degree of fairness and equity that will be humanly possible in administrative terms.  If there is a limited burden, in terms of diseconomics of refining at Whitegate or of inconvenience, to be borne by the oil industry to maintain a minimum limited strategic refining capacity, I will make every effort to ensure that this is fairly shared by all concerned.</P>
    <P>The diseconomics of operating at Whitegate, as compared with importation of oil products on the most favourable terms available on the open market, arise for a number of reasons.  Firstly, there are physical limitations.  The maximum size of ships which can gain entrance to Cork Harbour, and therefore Whitegate, is such that transfer of oil from larger crude carriers at sea to smaller vessel is necessary. In addition, Whitegate is further from the main markets in the Dublin area than are certain refineries owned independently by the major oil companies at Pembroke and Milford Haven.  The major factor which contributes to the dis-economies of Whitegate is the technical nature of the refinery which yields between 45 per cent and 55 per cent of its output in heavy fuel oil, compared with less than 30 per cent in refineries with more modern technology.  Fuel oil is a relatively low-value product and the present market for it is vulnerable as a result of the switch to coal for electricity generation and heavy industry and the effects of conservation measures.</P>
    <P>There are certain investments which can be considered to upgrade the facilities at Whitegate so as to produce a better yield of the higher-value refined products.  There are certain stages of upgrading which can be considered and which vary substantially in cost and there are technical options within some of these stages.  At the moment, the efforts of the INPC are being concentrated on getting the refinery back into efficient operation on the basis of its present technical capability. I can assure Deputies that, in association with the INPC, I will be examining urgently and critically the technical advantages and economic feasibility of all the options available for upgrading.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2263" /> While I am not, at this time, putting forward specific proposals for upgrading, I can say that arrangements are being made to reduce the lead content of petrol produced at Whitegate so that Ireland will be in a position to comply fully with the terms of the EEC Directive on the lead content of petrol without having to continue to depend upon our derogation from that directive.</P>
    <P>Given that there are diseconomies associated with operation of the refinery, the question arises as to how they should be treated.  The decision of the previous Government in this regard has been confirmed by the present Government, that is, to have the refinery operated on a cost-recovery basis.  This approach of cost-carrying by oil users is seen as more appropriate than one involving a direct subsidy.  The prices proposed to be charged by the INPC to its customers will therefore recover capital, crude oil acquisition, shipment and storage costs and, of course, the operating costs of the refinery. At first, the cost disadvantages as compared with the present 100 per cent importation of products may be of the order of one or two pence per gallon on all oil products sold in the country.  I am not in a position, at this time, to suggest what effect this may have on the price of particular products, such as petrol or diesel. It will be appreciated by Deputies that this will depend on a number of factors some of which are related to on-going discussions with the trade on the off-take regime.  One such provision may inter-play of competition in particular market sectors will affect the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must, indeed, emphasise that any calculation of the diseconomies involved is only valid at the time it is made because of the volatility of conditions in the oil market.  There is a reasonable expectation that, in time, the diseconomy can be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current oil market surplus, with depressed market prices, which has caused losses even on the part of modern refineries, is beginning to diminish and already market prices have begun to rise. In these circumstances the gap between the Whitegate prices and the prices of imported refined products is reduced. Another factor which may help to reduce the diseconomy is price of the crude oil being processed at the refinery.  The Irish National Petroleum Corporation will have at least three separate sources of crude oil.  Two of these sources have already been arranged, namely Saudi Arabia and British North Sea Oil.  At first <Col N="2266" /> there will be a high proportion of Saudi Arabian crude oil processed at the refinery. In the current oil market situation this crude is relatively expensive but in time the corporation will be expecting to achieve some economies in their crude oil procurement, having reasonable regard to the objective of supply security.</P>
    <P>The proposed off-take regime will operate on the following lines.  All oil importers, including undertakings which import directly for their own consumption, will be obliged to purchase a proportion of their oil product requirements from the refinery.  For two major reasons an upper limit on this obligatory proportion will be set.  This upper limit, roughly matching the minimum operating level of the refinery and representing about 35 per cent of the Irish market, will minimise the burden on the economy generally and on the oil companies, while any diseconomy exists.  Secondly, in discussions with representatives of the EEC on the compatability of the proposed regime with the Treaty of Rome, it was suggested that such a limit was desirable as indicative of the minimum strategic national requirements in an acute emergency situation. There may be scope for operating the refinery with improved economy at higher levels of throughput without adversely impinging on the mandatory offtake arrangements and this will be fully explored by the INPC.</P>
    <P>The INPC are currently engaged in discussions with the oil industry on the methodology of implementing the off-take arrangements.  In general, it is intended that the amounts of Whitegate oil products to be taken for each quarter will be based upon data provided by the companies in respect of their sales or requirements in the preceding 12 months. I have emphasised to the INPC that the arrangements should be agreed as far as possible and should be as flexible as possible, consistent with an equitable operation of the scheme.  It should be possible to agree arrangements to cover such situations as where the allocated quantity of a product might be unrepresentative of the importers' anticipated requirements or where the lifting of an entire <Col N="2267" /> allocation of any product in a particular quarter might create special difficulties.</P>
    <P>Apart from the trading companies, there are certain major oil users who import their requirements directly and in bulk, mainly supplies of heavy fuel oil. There may be about a dozen of these large oil consumers and it would be necessary to make appropriate arrangements for these within the general scheme. Because of the effects of oil prices on the costs and competitiveness of Irish industry, the price to be charged for the Whitegate proportion of their heavy fuel oil requirements will be an important consideration. Although final prices will not be known until the arrangements are further advanced, I will be concerned to ensure that the heavy fuel oil price will be pitched at a level which would not give rise to significant difficulties for Irish industry, both those who have direct import facilities and those supplied through the national distribution network.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the major provisions in the text of the Bill.  As I have indicated, following consultations with the Attorney General and with the EC Commission it emerged that a mandatory purchase obligation on oil importers could be consistent with the provisions of the Treaty of Rome on the grounds that the measure was essential in the interests of the common good and public security and in pursuance of public policy.  The Attorney General has advised that the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Act, 1971, is an appropriate instrument on which to base the regime, subject to certain amendments of that Act.  This Bill incorporates these amendments.</P>
    <P>The 1971 Act enables the Minister for Industry and Energy to control the supply and distribution of fuels whenever the Government are of the opinion and declare that the exigencies of the common good so require.  The legal opinion is that the words &ldquo;supply and distribution&rdquo; must be read together.  This description therefore is unsuitable for the off-take regime as it is not proposed to control the actual distribution of oil.  The <Col N="2268" /> Bill therefore provides for the amendment of that description where it appears in the Act to read &ldquo;acquisition, supply, distribution or marketing&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;acquisition&rdquo; is inserted in order to make certain that the purchase obligation is comprehended in the Minister's powers. The word &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; is also inserted since it is a relevant aspect of the operations involved in getting Whitegate products into distribution.</P>
    <P>With the inclusion of these amendments the Minister will, while a Government order under section 2 is in force, be in a position to make an order under section 3 applying the Whitegate purchase obligation to oil importers.  Such a Government order, made in 1979, has been kept in force by continuance orders in view of the instability of the oil market since then.</P>
    <P>Included in the amendment of section 2 of the Act is an extension of the maximum periods of operation of Government orders and of continuance orders from six to twelve months in each case. A period of six months is considered inadequate for oil supply planning, particularly in relation to the disposal of products from Whitegate refinery.  The Bill also includes new provisions which may be of assistance in administering the off-take arrangements, and, of course, the enable the Minister to require a person to furnish relevant information to him in order to enable him to implement an order.  There is also provision for the authorisation of officers to inspect premises, obtain information, examine and take copies of documents and so on.  The other provisions of the Bill are the updating of the construction of the penalty provisions and an amendment of the definition of petroleum oils in order to ensure that stocks of oil in retailers' premises are included.  There has been a legal doubt as to whether such stocks are covered in the existing definition.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.  I emphasise again that it is an essential consequence of the decision to retain refining operations at Whitegate.  I believe that Deputies on all sides will concur in the view of successive Governments that every prudent step must be <Col N="2269" /> taken to maintain and improve our ability to safeguard the public and the economy against the worst effects of an acute oil supply emergency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Although we do not intend to oppose the Bill, it is not with any great enthusiasm that we welcome it because anyone who has studied the effects of the purchase of this refinery could not welcome the legislation with enthusiasm.</P>
      <P>In my time in Government the decision to purchase Whitegate was one of the most agonising and least clear actions that had to be taken.  From a commercial point of view I do not believe anybody would have made the investment the State had to make.  What tipped the balance in favour of the purchase was the strategic objective, because the size of the refinery, the nature of its plant and equipment and the position of refining capacity all over Europe as well as the ownership of the refinery all were factors that would not have encouraged anyone in the commercial sector to purchase it. What brought the balance above the 50-50 point was the strategic objective.</P>
      <P>The State has now undertaken to purchase the refinery, and its management in future will be the Irish National Petroleum Corporation which were set up in 1975.  The State is taking into ownership a refinery containing costly equipment without any legislation to back up the acquisition of the refinery.  But worse than that, it will be operated by a company which has no statutory backing.  It is two steps removed from parliamentary, and therefore taxpayer, control.  We hope, of course, that the necessary statutory provisions will soon be enacted. In reply to a question some time ago, the Minister assured me that there would be legislation to supervise the control of INPC.  The sum of £100 million to be invested is a huge amount but there is no machinery yet under which the INPC can be brought before the House.  I hope such legislation will be before us during the October to Christmas session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disturbed by the provision which brings in a mechanism devised to ensure that the output of Whitegate will be purchased <Col N="2270" /> and used within this country.  The Fuel Bill of 1971 was introduced to meet an emergency situation, though not a war situation.  That legislation was used twice for such situations.  There were the tanker drivers' strike and the 1973 oil crisis.  The Minister has told us he has advice from the Attorney General that this is the appropriate piece of legislation.  I am sure the new legislation will be different from the 1971 Act which this Act proposes to amend, but the problem attached to the 1971 Act is that it did not insist on controlling output.</P>
    <P>I have doubts about the appropriateness of this legislation to insist on the purchase of 35 per cent of the output from the 1982 Whitegate refinery.  If, as the Minister has indicated, he proposes to start the refinery next August, some legislation had to be devised to enable him to sell the product of the refinery immediately production began.  I was pleased to see that the petrol to be produced at Whitegate will conform to EEC standards, because we have been neglecting this &mdash; we are the only country in the EEC which has 0.64 milligrammes of lead, and that is unacceptable in any other European country, the content being 0.40 millilitres.  Even that will be unacceptable in the near future because in this and other countries there is much greater awareness of the health hazards from lead poisoning, particularly for young children.  Petrol has been bearing the brunt of the blame but as we all know there are other sources of lead poisoning and it is only fair that that should be emphasised.</P>
    <P>The CII have many reservations about the position of industry in regard to the purchase of the refinery and the ability of the refinery to stand on its own legs. There is concern that the produce will be sold at such a price that it will recoup Government investment in the refinery. We must all share that concern.  Already industry here finds itself labouring under competitive constraints that are costing us exports and will cost us jobs.  Indeed our entire competitive position can be and should be looked at from the point of view of how competitively we can produce here, because we will not maintain <Col N="2271" /> the jobs we have, never mind create new jobs, if we do not ensure that the goods we produce are produced at competitive prices.  One of the factors that has been making the task of industry more difficult in the last few years has been the cost of the energy inputs for industry.  This has been particularly so since the 1980 budget that added so savagely to the tax on fuel oils.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the cost effects of the purchase of the refinery will be about 1p to 2p per gallon and is not willing to say at this stage how this will be divided across the range of products that will be produced at Whitegate.  I am not sure whether he means that this cost would only affect the 35 per cent which the present users of petroleum products will now be required to take from Whitegate or that it will affect everything across the entire market and that everything will be put up by 1p or 2p.  It is probably the only practical thing to do, because the identification of the products coming out of Whitegate might be quite difficult unless it is the intention not to preserve Whitegate at its present breakdown but to move it away from its over-production of heavy fuel oil and move it up the market into the lighter oils, petroleums and aviation fuels that are more profitable for the refinery and more acceptable to the market because they command higher prices.  But it will be breaking a long tradition and will cause tremendous head-scratching and telephone call-making to various Ministers and people of influence.  There is one very obvious customer on the back door of the Whitegate oil refinery for heavy crude oil.  That is the ESB, who have previously resisted any attempts made to have them purchase the heavy fuel oil from Whitegate because they, reasonably enough, say that in the interests of the consumers of their product they must be free to buy abroad in the cheapest market and the location of that cheap market varies almost daily and certainly on a regular basis throughout the year and they take advantage of the cheapest areas to buy in the heavy crude oil.  They will naturally be resentful of the order which the Minister <Col N="2272" /> will have to give them now that they must purchase 35 per cent of their heavy fuel oil from the Whitegate oil refinery. As against that it could perhaps be sold to them at a very much cheaper price because of the location of their generating plant, which is only about a quarter of a mile from the refinery so that it could be piped from the refinery into the station. As the Minister probably already knows there will be an outcry from the ESB who will see this as a further encroachment on their freedom to purchase what they like, where they like, at the best possible price.  In fairness to them, I must say they have been extremely successful for over 50 years now in getting oil at the cheapest possible price even in the days of the rocketing of oil prices in 1973-74 when nobody was quite sure what was happening.  The ESB's record at that time was shown to have been more successful than many of their competitors on the continent and in other parts of the world in ensuring supplies at prices that were exhorbitant but were less exorbitant, if there is such an expression, than many of the other electricity generating stations based on oil and heavy crude oil throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>The benefits of the purchase of this refinery for the people of this island are very difficult to quantify.  The life of this refinery may be quite short; it may be only as much as five, six, seven or, at a maximum, eight years.  To cover us for an eventuality that may never arise we are loading our economy with a price differential over what would be possible if we were to operate, as we do in so many other spheres, a completely open economy in the case of petroleum products.  I hope the wisdom of the purchase of this refinery will never be proven, because that would mean that the economies of the world have become so influenced by decisions made in the oil-producing countries, of the Middle East particularly, that they will affect supply and affect the supply to the western world.  We have all grown up here and in Europe in an era of cheap energy from the Middle East, fuelling our own economies and building up until we came to the shock of the 1973 oil crisis.  It is only since then that we have <Col N="2273" /> been appreciating how overly dependent we are on the Middle East.  But if there is turmoil there, if the world comes out of recession and moves back into growth again, if the demand for oil products goes up and if the OPEC countries have a more successful meeting in two years' time than they had this week, we may have done the right thing in purchasing that refinery.  But it is a very fine line and I was not happy to be part of the decision making process for this.  As I said when I started off, it could not be justified as a commercial investment.  The only thing that brings it up to even the 50/50 level of decision making to purchase is the possible strategic importance of it in the event of some catastrophe arising in future years.  I hope, in that sense, that we will never be proven to have been right in purchasing this refinery.</P>

      <P>The harbour of my native county is developing an enormous propensity to rearing white elephants. Perhaps this elephant will be about the same size in length and in cost of the Exchequer as NET and Irish Steel.  The three of them rank in about that order. In regard to the NET operation we find ourselves today talking in terms of £180 million; in regard to Irish Steel it is £80 million and, were it not for the fact that we gave £25 million a few weeks ago, it would be £105 million.  We are talking now in terms of an oil refinery with annual operational losses of up to £20 million and the country ultimately being left with a piece of totally obsolete technology with about five or six years to run even if it were opened tomorrow morning, producing petrol which is contrary to EEC regulations because of its lead content and which would require, if we were to be serious about having a modern refinery in the harbour, an expenditure of about £60 million or £70 million and which, in terms of replacement, would cost us not less than £150 million.  That is why I use the term &ldquo;white elephant&rdquo;.  I propose to examine that white elephant tomorrow night from the tail to the tusks and I think that we will find in it a particular lumbering giant, admittedly by virtue of a decision of the previous Government <Col N="2274" /> but concurred in by the present Government, which is going to be a burden around the Exchequer's neck.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for the Environment to introduce a statutory House Construction Bonded Fund to provide basic protection for all purchasers of new dwellings in respect of their booking deposits, contract deposits and payments made during the course of construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion in my name and the names of other Members of the Labour Party, including your good self, sir, is an attempt by the Labour Party to obtain something which is now absolutely essential but which existing house purchasers and prospective house purchasers do not have.  I refer to security for their deposits, the moneys they save and any interim payments they make during the course of the construction of their homes under the existing regulation of the building industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective is very clear.  This is an attempt by the Labour Party to get the Oireachtas to introduce consumer orientated legislation designed to protect people trying to buy their own homes. This legislation is long overdue and, sad to relate&mdash;and this has been the case in many other instances of reform legislation&mdash;it has been prompted by direct representations made to me by people who have actually lost their deposits owing to certain building companies going into liquidation because they could not financially continue to operate. Depositors had no legal redress of any kind and could not recover their hard earned savings.  In a sense this is without parallel relative to other commercial operations.  Having regard to the importance of the Bill to the economy generally <Col N="2275" /> and the consensus of all parties regarding the desirability of home ownership, this is a situation we should clearly eliminate and, in its elimination, establish proper protection.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we will divide on this service, there is a general commitment to achieve the objective highlighted by the Labour Party.  There will, of course be some discussion as to the most effective way in which this objective can be achieved.  In achieving this objective perhaps industry in general&mdash;I am addressing my remarks to industry &mdash; would have regard to the small number in terms of volume of those who have lost their deposits and who, in consequence unless the industry responds, have lost for all time any prospect of buying a house.  I have in my correspondence particulars received in regard to one particular woman who saved £7,000 to buy a flat.  That deposit was lost and with it years of foregoing expenditure and consumption and she has now no realistic prospect of being able to save that kind of money again.</P>
    <P>The average industrial wage at the moment is £7,500 per annum or £140 per week.  The median income ranges from £7,500 to about £10,000 per year and, having regard to the punitive levels of taxation on those who do not have the benefit of a mortgage to offset against their personal income tax allowance, increasing inflation around 20 per cent per annum the saving of a sum in the region of £3,000 to £5,000 is an extremely difficult task.  It may perhaps be within the bounds of one wage earner's capability to do it once but it would certainly not be possible for him to do it twice.</P>
    <P>The objective is clearly stated.  There must be consumer protection for people purchasing new dwellings in regard to their booking deposits, contract deposits and payments made during the course of construction.  The need has been represented to me but regrettably the statistics are not easy to establish.  I have asked people if they can corroborate their own assessment of the statistics of other people's experiences, but it is not the kind of thing that people highlight and <Col N="2276" /> the correspondence I have received would certainly indicate that you cannot base any statistical argument on it.  Having admitted that, however, it in no way invalidates the principle of the argument that there is need for such protection and there is a vehicle through which that protection can be provided.  I shall return to that later.</P>
    <P>The House should look at the complex in which we are debating this Bill.  House completions for the year gone out for other houses in the four quarters of 1981 were respectively 6,000 odd, 4,000 odd, 5,000 odd and 6,000 odd, making a total of around 24,000 houses.  It is quite clear from the present policy of the Government and indeed the previous Government that something in the region of 80 per cent of all new housing will be provided by the non-local authority sector. I use the phrase &ldquo;non-local authority&rdquo;, which is a kind of negative phraseology because the other sector, and it is referred to here as the other sector, will consist of estate house building contractors, one-off individual houses and houses people build themselves.  I would guesstimate that something in the region of 40 per cent of all house completions will fall into the category of houses completed by building contractors for the purpose of sale.</P>
    <P>A significant development has taken place in housing statistics.  Again, it is not easy to establish these, but in contrast to the housing sector prior to the slump of 1973-74 it is my clear impression that the role of the large house builder was a dominant role and therefore the would-be house purchaser was dealing with a company of substance and the disappearance of a deposit or the collapse of a company was not something the purchaser would readily encounter relative to the market situation today.</P>
    <P>The joint housing conference held in October of last year, sponsored by the Institute of Architects and the Minister's Department, confirmed this impression. One of the speakers from the private sector indicated that the major private housing construction companies had scaled down the extent of their exposure &mdash; I think that was the precise phrase he <Col N="2277" /> used &mdash; and preferred to develop sites and off-load them to a number of small builders, and this for a variety of reasons, not least of which was to be flexible because of the very uncertain market place.  That very uncertain market place put at risk, in our view, the security of the deposit the first time house purchaser in particular has when he enters into the housing market.  There is no indication to show that this Government's policy or, indeed, that of any subsequent Government, unless there is a radical shift in politics, will move dramatically from the 20 per cent 80 per cent split.  Therefore, for the foreseeable future, for the next 10 years at least, we will be relying on the private commercial house builder to produce something in the region of 50 per cent of new dwellings.  The legal position is that if that house builder is not properly bonded &mdash; I shall come back to this later in the context of the world of housing co-operatives &mdash; or insured, or the company are not so bonded, then the deposit paid by the would-be purchaser is totally exposed and totally at risk.</P>
    <P>That is a magic gap in consumer legislation, and it would be fair to say that if the activities of the building industry came within the ambit of the EEC this gross neglect of consumer protection would have ended many years ago.  The gap exists and we in the Labour Party are moving to close it, regrettably after the stable has been vacated by a number of unfortunate builders who collapsed, taking with them the deposits of first-time purchasers.  I would make a formal appeal to the building industry, particularly the CIF, to accommodate these people in some way, perhaps in a manner similar to that adopted by the travel trade in relation to some of those who were disappointed due to the collapse of one or two travel operators.  Perhaps this is not the most fruitful time to talk to the building industry, but they present themselves as being socially responsible and this is a unique opportunity for them to give substantial and tangible evidence of their commitment to the consumer side of the industry.</P>
    <P>I refer now to the increase in house costs.  The increase in new house prices <Col N="2278" /> is, according to the Department's statistics, in excess of the increase in inflation, building costs or income increases.  The Quarterly Bulletin of Housing Statistics for the quarter ending 31 March 1982 is based on the index of 100 for the year 1973 and states that consumer prices have risen from that base to 370, house building costs to 454, average earnings of adult workers to 428, while new private house prices have increased from the base of 100 to 496.  There has been an absolute increase in new house prices and consequently in the cost of a deposit.</P>
    <P>The actual increase in house prices is quite dramatic, but I will resist any temptation to play party politics.  These prices are an extraordinary indication of the disastrous effects of inflation.  In 1977 the average gross price of new houses for which loans were approved by building societies, insurance companies, local authorities and associated banks was £14,770 but at the beginning of 1982 that figure had risen to £33,960.  That is an extraordinary jump.  Taking into account all the other factors such as the increase in incomes, I would suggest that it is becoming more difficult to purchase a house and more difficult to accumulate the funds for a deposit.  In 1980 the average cost was £27,000, in 1981 it was £31,000 and at the end of that year it was £33,000.  The increase is quite substantial.</P>
    <P>The deposit varies from 10 per cent to 25 per cent of the purchase price, depending on the way the property is marketed. Even at its lowest amount the deposit would represent about £3,500, though most people would agree that it is far more substantial, and purchasers are also expected to make phased payments to the builder before the loan is payable.</P>
    <P>The outlay of money by a would-be purchaser is fairly substantial and, irrespective of the unfortunate cases of people losing their deposit, there is a clear argument for some form of consumer protection.  I do not think that anybody within the building industry would in conscience reject that argument. I might add that as an architect I regard myself as part of the building industry.  If there is consensus in the House as to the desirability of achieving <Col N="2279" /> this objective, we should consider the most effective way of doing so.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put down an amendment which effectively agrees in substance with the objective but disagrees with the method of achieving it.  He has backed away from a statutory house construction bonded fund and the amendment calls upon the Minister for the Environment to ensure that a scheme is available to provide what we are seeking. We are looking for something of substance which will stand up to the test of claims by consumers who have been the victims of an unfortunate collapse within the industry.  The nature of the industry is such that it is subject to very rapid changes in demand.  At times the Government throw out money in the hope of creating jobs in the industry but they whip it back again.  The building industry does not lend itself to being used as an accelerator for the economy but frequently it is used in such a way, with much damage to the social fabric, labour relations and training programmes within the industry.</P>
    <P>The argument stands for some established legally contained and secure house construction bonded fund in order to secure purchasers.  Why I say that is that, having regard to the changes in the structure of private house building and the industry as I understand it, in all possibility we will see more small house builders building a small number of houses a year for sale, as against an increase in the large house construction company with a large volume of house construction of 200 to 400 houses a year, with a large land bank and all the carrying costs implicit in that.  The trend in the industry appears to be towards the small builder and towards large companies spreading their eggs amongst a large number of baskets, and, by implication, smaller construction companies, which frequently comprises a building tradesman who turns into a house builder.  To make his books stand up he probably must count his own wages as profit in order to make the operation look viable to the bank manager or anybody else.  That kind of operator in the market economy which we operate will <Col N="2280" /> find it extremely difficult to get adequate insurance bonding from our insurance community.  Indeed, our insurance community as far as bonding is concerned leaves a great deal to be desired.</P>
    <P>My experience with Dublin Corporation's housing authority was of small, unknown builders during the recession of 1973 to 1976 trying to compete and competing fairly effectively against a number of larger household names who had come in out of the cold to take up the slack by way of local authority house building. These small builders who, on the surface, were more competitive with the lowest tenders found it impossible to get bonding even for comparatively small contracts. The same will tend to apply now if the onus is put on the builder to bond himself or herself.  We will accept the Government's amendment in the interests of goodwill towards the Minister in question and in the interests of arriving at a solution because this, as far as we are concerned, is not a party-partisan affair. We are genuinely trying to achieve an agreed scheme which will not become a political football and will not be abolished, reduced, or simply ignored when there is a change of Government.  I would not like it to suffer the fate of the Housing Finance Agency.  Let us get a consensus on this in the first instance because there are lessons for all of us from that type of experience.  I am tempted to say more, but I am in a good mood at the moment.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in trying to cast around for an available scheme, should take the model which presents itself as originally agreed between his Department, the CIF and Housebuilders' Federation within it, in the National Guarantee Scheme.  Contained within the operation of that scheme is the basis for extending its scope and encompassing the protection which we have in mind. The industry should pay for this itself in the manner in which it has always paid for it, by upping the price which the consumer pays.  There is a slogan relating to another aspect of the Department which <Col N="2281" /> says that the polluter must pay for the pollution.</P>
      <P>In the history of market economies it is quite clear that every initial increase in social expenditure on a commodity which enters into the market ultimately finds its way back to the price mechanism at the far end and society pays a higher price for a better product.  That is why labour costs in the developed western economy are so much higher than those of Brazil or Argentina.  There are very good reasons for this, including the survival, in health and political terms, of those who work in factories in western Europe, as against their counterparts in Brazil or Argentina.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not naive in saying that.  We are recognising that a very small levy on all would-be house purchases will provide adequate security for the unfortunate small number who will have the experience of seeing their hard-earned savings disappear, by virtue of the unstructured or erratic nature of the market, or the mismanagement of the particular companies.  When one accepts, as we do in principle, that it is the logical outcome of saying that the building industry should regulate itself, I am also admitting that the Minister's Department have a substantial role in the industry.  The Department are probably the largest single generators of demand within the industry.  Because of that fact alone, plus the very good relations maintained on a personal basis between the director of the CIF and whoever happens to be unfortunate enough to be Minister for the Environment is sufficient evidence to demonstrate just how interdependent one is with the other.  When I use the phrase &ldquo;the industry&rdquo; I include in that the financial role of the Department and, in objective economic terms, the market role of the Department of the Environment. For example, the bonding scheme should be administered by the industry itself, similar to the way in which the guarantee scheme goes.  It could possibly form the basis for something that could be talked about tomorrow on Second Stage on planning development, but that we will ultimately be speaking about at some length &mdash; the whole question of how <Col N="2282" /> one administers, supervises and oversees quality control standards in the building industry itself.  I do not believe that is the role of the civil service inspectorate.  If they make a mistake one cannot sue them, and asking question in the Dáil simply gets one column inches in the newspapers and sometimes an indirect hit on the relevant incumbent Minister of the day, but invariable no effective action.  That kind of game playing does not benefit the victims of any kind of market economy, having regard to the way in which we organise our public service, where no public servant will lose his job because of incompetence in the inspectorate area.  The threat of job loss does not exist, as it would in other areas, because it is a reality of the success of civil service trade union negotiation over the years; it is a fact of life.  This is one major argument against that type of inspectorate.  It is an argument which I would use in preference to the argument of the more dominant Deputy John Kelly of the implicit cost of the inspectorate.</P>
    <P>The building council, with the role of the building industry, through the Department, through the private sector, through local authorities, could be the body through which this kind of bonded scheme could operate.  In accepting the spirit of the Minister's amendment, I am putting forward to him a proposal to which he might perhaps respond when moving the amendment, that there is the genesis of a guarantee scheme, the extension of which could become available to cover this.  The National Guarantee Scheme at present is financed by the house purchaser in any event, so the principle has been established.</P>
    <P>To conclude, the need, in objective terms, is undoubtedly there as far as we are concerned 80 per cent of all houses now built in the Republic are built by agencies other than local authorities, in the main for purchase.  There is at present no consumer protection for people who place their hard-earned savings with a small individual builder or, for that matter, a large one.  Their rights, as against those of creditors, debenture holders, or banks, are very minimal and they have a long wait in the queue.  Their real prospects <Col N="2283" /> of retrieving any money at the end of the day are virtually nil.  It is a clear gap in the consumer protection legislation that should be closed.  The response of the Government has been constructive. They now recognise the argument, but dispute the means by which it can be achieved.  In recognising that the Labour Party have won the argument, we are prepared, graciously, without rancour or division of any kind, to accept the amendment from the Government and to make some tentative suggestions as to how the scheme could become available within the existing operations of the building industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for the Environment to ensure that a scheme is available which provides basic protection for all purchasers of new dwellings in respect of their booking deposit, contract deposits and payments made during the course of construction.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In proposing that amendment, I want to make it quite clear that I am not opposed to the main sentiments expressed in the Labour Party motion. Every Member would agree that everything should be done to provide the fullest possible protection to house purchasers. We all know that buying a house is normally the biggest single transaction people undertake in their life, and there are enough problems without them having to worry about the possible loss of their money in circumstances over which they generally have no control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reservation about the motion is based on my conviction that the establishment of an additional structure to deal with what is undoubtedly a problem is neither necessary nor desirable.  We should be thinking about whether structures already in existence to provide security for new house purchasers against <Col N="2284" /> financial loss can be extended or modified to cover the issues which are the subject of the motion.  I am glad to hear that the proposer of the motion will not press for a statutory solution if it can be shown that there is an alternative.</P>
    <P>Due to the importance of house purchase, my Department at all times endeavour to protect and assist purchasers directly and indirectly.  The system of new house grants and subsidies provides first time owner occupiers with up to £4,000 in the early years of occupation when mortgage repayments bear heaviest and money is hard to come by.  The standards laid down by the Department in regard to methods of construction, materials, insulation, floor area and so on which must be complied with for grant and mortgage subsidy purposes are designed to ensure that purchasers will live in well designed and well built houses.  The Department's inspectors at various stages try to ensure that any departure from standards or any defects are brought to the attention of both builders and purchasers so that remedial action can be taken.  The inspectors are willing to advise grant subsidy applicants, as are the administrative staff, on any aspect of their applications where help is required. While on the subject of advisory services, I should mention the Department's booklet entitled <i>A Home of Your Own</i> which is highly valued by house purchasers.  It is updated from time to time to include new developments, such as new forms of statutory assistance.  A new edition is being prepared at present.  As a final example of the Department's endeavours to see that house purchasers get good value for money, I refer the House to the system of house price control operated in my Department through the issue of certificates of reasonable value.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, every new house offered for sale must be the subject of a CRV.  Without it the purchaser will not qualify for £1,000 grant, £3,000 mortgage subsidy and exemption from stamp duty.  Lending agencies will not advance a house purchase loan for a new house offered for sale if there is no CRV. Despite criticisms of the system from time to time, CRVs protect purchasers to <Col N="2285" /> the extent that they know if they pay the approved price or a lower one they are getting good value for their financial investment.</P>
    <P>As can be seen, my Department are already providing a substantial degree of support and protection to new house purchasers &mdash; support by way of direct financial assistance and protection by way of measures designed to ensure the house is well built and represents good value.  This leads me to the important element of protection provided to purchasers through the structural guarantee scheme operated by the National House Building Guarantee Company, a subsidiary of the Construction Industry Federation, in conjunction with my Department.  This scheme was introduced in 1978 to protect purchasers from the legal and financial burdens which a major structural defect would in most cases entail.  These are difficult to remedy and are generally beyond the resources of most purchasers, whose means are fully stretched in buying their houses and repaying loans.  Without a guarantee certificate they might have to pursue claims through the courts against builders at considerable cost and uncertainty of outcome.  Obviously builders would also be involved in major expense in remedying structural defects as well as costly legal expenses.  This is why most builders welcome the scheme.  To date 1,600 builders have been accepted as members and approximately 34,000 houses have been registered.  While the scheme is controlled by the guarantee company, officials of my Department attend meetings of the company and in that capacity monitor the operations of the scheme.  The inspections at foundation, roofing and completion stages are carried out by the Department's inspectors. The cost of this inspection service is recouped by my Department from the company.</P>
    <P>Even though the scheme has only been in operation for four-and-a-half years it has not remained static.  While the protection provided still covers only major structural defects the value of the scheme has been enhanced through the co-operation of the lending agencies, which will not make loans in respect of houses not <Col N="2286" /> registered with the guarantee company. The company now employ qualified technical staff to assess the technical capabilities of builders who apply for membership and to provide an advisory service to them.  The technical staff of the company and the Department co-operate through joint inspections where desirable and a sharing of information.  The scheme is not hide bound and is capable of taking other matters within its ambit from time to time.</P>
    <P>It is in the interest of the purchasers, builders, the guarantee company and my Department that structural defects are kept to a minimum.  Builders who seek registration in the scheme are subject to detailed financial vetting to complete the construction of houses and honour their obligations to their clients.  Consequently anyone buying a house from a builder who has been accepted for membership has the satisfaction and comfort of knowing that the construction of his house is in good hands.  When a person buys a house which is not registered it will not qualify for the £4,000 grant subsidy.  Of course, no form of financial vetting can be 100 per cent foolproof nor can it ensure that builders who are financially sound at the time of application will not go bankrupt at a later stage.  Builders can become bankrupt for many reasons. However, every possible precaution is taken by the guarantee company to protect house purchasers against financial loss.  I am informed by the company that they are not aware of any cases where the purchaser of a registered house lost a deposit as a result of a builder becoming bankrupt or for any other reason.  This indicates that the system of vetting of builders has worked well so far.  This is not surprising, as in my experience the majority of builders do a good job in their own interests as well as in the interests of prospective customers.</P>
    <P>Naturally there are exceptions, but no more so than in any other walk of life. Membership of the scheme is voluntary. If certain people decide to buy houses from builders who are not members that is their right.  There are people who do not need to take house purchase loans, for example, where they are buying a <Col N="2287" /> new house out of their own resources or from the sale of an existing house.  There are people who are not eligible for the £4,000 subsidy.  If they choose to do business with a non-registered builder who may not be able to honour his commitments no one can stop them from doing so.  The question arises as to whether the State should step in and protect them, as Deputy Quinn's motion envisages. Would the problem be better dealt with by an extension of the protection afforded by the guarantee scheme?  I was glad to hear the Deputy say that this line of approach would find favour with him. It is the approach I favour.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn will recall that last month he put down a question asking if I was aware that prospective house purchasers who had placed deposits with builders had lost them when the builders went bankrupt and if I would enter into discussions with the Construction Industry Federation with a view to extending the structural guarantee scheme to include full insurance cover and provide full repayment for prospective purchasers so affected.  In my reply of 17 June I indicated that I was not aware that any purchasers of houses registered under the structural guarantee scheme had lost their deposits because the builders had gone bankrupt.  I indicated that while the extension of the scheme was primarily a matter for the guarantee company I had instructed my officials to act as observers of the company to pursue the question of protection of deposits and report to me in due course.</P>
    <P>The motion does not specifically mention the guarantee company but it can be reasonably inferred from its terms and from Deputy Quinn's questions that that is what the proposer had in mind.  The Department is actively pursuing the question of extending the cover with the guarantee company but it is too early yet to have it resolved.  In any event, the scheme will not, nor can it be expected to, provide a blanket cover for every purchaser. I have already explained the problems of providing against every risk involved in house purchase.  I understand that even where cover is provided in similar circumstances <Col N="2288" /> in other countries it is generally of a limited degree.  It may reasonably be asked then why cover, even if it is limited, is not provided under the guarantee scheme in Ireland.  The main reason is that the scheme is in operation for only a short period.  Experience in other countries has shown that caution must be exercised in the early years of a guarantee company so that sufficient funds can be accumulated to meet cases of major structural defects that arise.  Experience has also shown that claims under the heading are more likely to arise when the period of guarantee is coming to an end rather than in the earlier years of occupation. This is understandable, as occupiers can become worried over every minor defect turning into a major structural defect.  It is likely, therefore, that the company will be presented with an increasing number of claims from now on as years go by.  Also a major structural defect which might affect an entire scheme, unlikely though this is, could involve major expenditure.</P>
    <P>Purchasers who lose money during the course of construction of their houses by way of deposit or other payments can seek redress through legal means, but, depending on the circumstances, the chances of redress might be poor when there are no funds to meet claims, as in bankruptcy cases or where they are low on the list of creditors.  However, another side of the story must be borne in mind. Disputes over money arise from time to time between purchasers and builders which have nothing to do with the insolvency of the builders.  These disputes relate to matters such as breach of contract and certain standards of construction for which a builder could not be expected to accept liability and which he may defend in the courts.  I assume that the protection sought for in the motion is not intended to cover such issues.  Basic protection is, however, clearly desirable, as my amendment states.</P>
    <P>I see no point in setting up a further State or semi-State bureaucracy to provide the protection envisaged in the statutory form mentioned in the motion. The best way of dealing with the issue is to have the problem dealt with by an <Col N="2289" /> extension of the existing cover provided by the guarantee company, and it is along these lines that discussions are going with the guarantee company at this stage.  This extension may add to the costs of the guarantee scheme and necessitate an amendment to the existing rules, which do not provide for anything other than protection against major structural defects.  At the same time, some economies in cost may be possible under the existing scheme, and I am pressing the guarantee company to have a solution found for this as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn rightly pointed to cases which have arisen, as he put it, closing the barn door after the horse has bolted. Some of these may have arisen recently, and I have had discussions with regard to the people involved in the recent cases. Talks are going on already with regard to some security for the deposits that were paid and legitimate fears with regard to their loss may arise.  The way forward &mdash; I am glad that Deputy Quinn referred to it himself &mdash; is through the extension of the guarantee company cover, as the amendment says and as in a way Deputy Quinn's motion says, to ensure that a scheme is available which provides basic protection for all purchasers of new dwellings in respect of their booking deposits, contract documents and payments made during the course of construction. Everybody in this House should be in favour of that, and as Minister I intend to see that it will be done through an extension of the guarantee scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The introduction of this motion calling for protection for house purchasers against loss of their booking deposits, contract deposits and payment on account during the course of the building operation is very opportune.  I will go a bit further and say that the introduction of this motion and of an indemnity fund of some sort or other is much overdue.  I suppose it takes a calamity of one sort or another to draw our attention to the necessity for protection like this, just as in the last couple of years it took a frightful fire with consequent loss of life in <Col N="2290" /> more than one place in this country to put the spotlight on the necessity for updating fire protection and fire prevention provisions and the introduction of new building regulations which have been on the shelf for quite a long time.  I am not saying that in any carping or critical manner, but it is a fact that until some disaster or calamity befalls people in one area or another, many danger points are overlooked.</P>
      <P>It is true to say what is frequently said from time to time and might be regarded as a cliche, that the purchasing of a house is by far the biggest commercial, monetary or material enterprise that most people will ever undertake in the course of their lives.  If that was true in years gone by, it is more true now than ever it was with the price of houses having rocketed to, at the very cheapest, £25,000.  I have not looked at figures for this debate, but listening to a programme on the radio yesterday evening on my way from the west.  I was reminded that the cheapest house available in and around this city costs £25,000 and the average cost of a house is more than that.  Therefore, when you see the amount of money that people of moderate means invest in order to provide themselves with a house, it is wrong that they should have to take any risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most prople who are paid in advance or act as bailees or hold deposits of other people's money, such as solicitors and auctioneers, have for some time past been obliged to provide a bond to indemnify those who may suffer a loss through the failure of the agents concerned to honour their obligations.  Indeed, hardly a year goes past but the necessity for such a bond is seen in regard to the legal profession, unfortunately, and in regard to the auctioneers' profession.  In recent times one of the leading building contractors of the whole country went into liquidation, and not alone is it feared that some people will suffer a loss, but is has created very considerable confusion regarding the value of the deeds of certain houses for security purposes.  The Incorporated Law Society have found it necessary to advise solicitors about closing sales where houses built by either the <Col N="2291" /> company or subsidiaries of that company are concerned, because it might well turn out that if they do so on bridging finance the principal lenders, the building societies and others, might not accept the deeds of these houses as security for the amount of money agreed to be advanced, which is £20,000 and upwards.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, many people enter into these contracts in the early stages without mature consideration or advice or without independent legal advice and find themselves bound to pay substantial sums of money before the house is completed. If the builders go into liquidation or are declared bankrupt, these purchasers are left at a very considerable loss.  The need for an indemnity fund of the type suggested is obvious.  There does not seem to be any great difference in this regard between the motion introduced by the Labour Party and the amendment proposed by the Minister.  In other words, there is a common case on the necessity for an indemnity, or the need to protect people against losses which occur by reason of bankruptcy or liquidation, situations that arise without there being any criminal or gross negligence on the part of the people concerned.  Most building contractors are honourable and responsible people who do a good job and give good value for money.  There are the exceptions, but apart from any such exceptions it is easy for firms or individuals to drift into trouble.  The only difference between the proposers of the motion and the Minister on the question of an indemnity is whether it should be provided by the State or by way of an agency that would be set up by the building contractors.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the question of the solicitors' and auctioneers' professions in this context.  Auctioneers are obliged to give a bond and that is operated through the licensing process provided for in the Auctioneers' Act.  A licence will not be granted unless an insurance company bond is produced, or failing that, unless there is a very substantial deposit in the High Court.  On the other hand, the solicitors' profession operate their indemnity scheme by way of annual payment by <Col N="2292" /> each solicitor at the time of the granting of his licence.  Therefore, it can be said that both of these professions provide their own indemnity schemes and operate them without involving the State in any cost.  It is possible to operate the indemnity in the case of the solicitors' profession by reason of their having to be licensed and the licensing authority are the Incorporated Law Society.  It is convenient for them to collect the subscription at the time of issuing the annual licence.  A solicitor will not be able to obtain a licence unless he pays his contribution to the indemnity fund.</P>
    <P>The same procedure is adopted by the auctioneers' profession, but they must apply to the courts for their annual licence. Again, a licence will not be granted unless the auctioneer provides evidence of having taken out an indemnity bond. I suppose one could regard road traffic insurance as a similar type of protection in that road-users are obliged to have insurance before getting a licence to use motor vehicles on the roads, though we know that many motorists endeavour to evade that.</P>
    <P>Regardless of whether the Minister decides in favour of what I would call the statutory form of indemnity or a form of indemnity operated by the builders themselves, there is necessity for immediate protection.  I say this because there is always some risk that purchasers of houses in the course of construction are at some risk but at a time of recession that risk is always greater than it would be at a time of economic growth when there are bound to be more bankruptcies and liquidations.  Therefore, there is a certain urgency about the legislation in this area.  Indeed, the legislation is long overdue.  There have been cases in the past in which if the State had not intervened and organised relief with the help of other insurance companies, many people who suffered injuries and loss in road accidents or who had premises destroyed by fire would have suffered very severe losses in cases in which insurance companies went into liquidation. Regardless of whether a statutory scheme is to be introduced or of whether we are to have a voluntary scheme introduced <Col N="2293" /> by the building contractors, there will be delays.  The latter would be a voluntary scheme though it might even be a compulsory scheme for which legislation would be necessary.  Because of such delays, big losses may be suffered and that is why I suggest that there be an <i>ad hoc</i> scheme introduced and put into effect in the event of an emergency arising. There is precedent for this in the case of insurance companies that collapsed in the past.</P>
    <P>It would not be good enough just to get this motion out of the House this evening, have the House go into recess and nothing done about it for a couple of years.  In the meantime builders would be getting into trouble, people would suffer financial loss or indeed ruination.  The Minister should get his Department thinking about this.  One does not have to make any announcements naming any people, as was done recently in regard to another undertaking.  Rather simply say that one is having thoughts about rescue operations for anybody who may go bust. But, within the secrecy of the Department, Deputy Connolly, the Minister of State or somebody else should be thinking about this, about having some fire brigade operation ready to come to the rescue of any company in trouble.  I want to emphasise that a recessionary period is a dangerous one.  Very few people manage their business so badly, build houses so cheaply, or have not a protection clause but it must be remembered that in a recessionary period there is always that inherent danger.</P>
    <P>I do not want to stand in the way of a couple of other speakers who want to make a contribution.  It was agreed that this would be a short debate and there is no real dispute about it.  However, I want to make another appeal to the Minister, and here I do not think I am out of order because the Minister spoke about it.  The Minister spoke about all the grants that are available and all that his Department are doing to help housebuilders.  I appeal to him now to have delays abolished. Even with regard to the new house grant of £1,000 I receive representations every <Col N="2294" /> week about delays in inspections and in having that grant paid.  People tell me they have been living in houses for up to 12 months and yet the grant has not been paid.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that a grant of £1,000 means a lot to a person building a house.  Even today I was on the telephone endeavouring to sort out finance <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Housing Finance Agency.  I understand it has been decided to borrow money in advance of the bonds being purchased to get the scheme going.  I put down a Private Notice Question about this today but I was ruled out of order for some reason or another.  I am not quarelling with that.  But I know of people who have entered into commitments to buy houses who, unless they produce evidence quickly that they are in funds to complete that purchase, will lose their deposit and will not be able to purchase those houses.  Also in this connection I understand there is some trouble being experienced with the staffs of some of the law agents &mdash; I do not imagine that they are law agents who are operating on a bill of costs basis.</P>

I make no apology for so saying.  I am not saying it is dishonesty but it is large scale messing which has robbed hundreds if not thousands of people of grants of £600, grants to which they are entitled for rendering their houses watertight.  They have been robbed of those grants through messing <Col N="2296" /> in the Minister's Department, perhaps before his time, perhaps in the time of the second last Government, and the last Government were unable to do anything about it.  The Minister does not seem to be doing anything about it.  But for God's sake let us not pontificate here about building contractors.  Deputy Quinn was right to bring in this motion.  I said, in his absence, that not alone was it opportune but was long overdue.  We should not be shouting about them while tolerating a state of affairs in which the Department of the Environment write week after week to people telling them there is no file belonging to them, when everybody knows that there is, that their file cannot be traced, that their application was not lodged in time, because those people should be paid.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Fitzpatrick I want to congratulate Deputy Quinn on having introduced this motion. I regret very much there are not a greater number of Members present, either in the Chamber itself or adjoining rooms, to hear what is taking place here.  Of course most of the Fine Gael Party are actively canvassing in East Galway.  They have not made an appearance here today. I suppose that is their prerogative when in Opposition when they know the chips are down.  But I want to congratulate Deputy Quinn on introducing this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume if the Deputy is introducing a motion it would be unlikely that he would go to Galway; it would be rather embarrassing were he not present, if I may say so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree fully with the Minister's amendment. It is a reasonable one and goes a long way to meeting Deputy Quinn's proposal, or that of the Labour Party. Deputy Quinn is probably one of the most serious Members of the Labour Party in this House, a man who takes his job seriously, who has made very important contributions to the business of the House over the years.  Consequently <Col N="2297" /> anything he puts before the House should be seriously and favourably considered.</P>
    <P>Over the years we have all learned of the difficulties purchasers experience when firms in the building sector go bankrupt. At a time of deep recession, such as we are experiencing at present, builders and others who provide such services are likely to find themselves in difficulty. Consequently, it is reasonable for purchasers to look for guarantees when entering into an agreement to buy a house.  I have no doubt that Members on all sides of the House will be favourably disposed to the suggestions made by Deputy Quinn.  The Government, and the Minister are anxious to protect people who find themselves in such a situation when buying a house.</P>
    <P>In most cases the purchase of a house is the biggest transaction undertaken by many people in their lifetime.  The price of a house has spiralled out of all proportions in recent years mainly due to inflation. The cost of an average type house is now £35,000 and one does not get a mansion or a castle for that sum but a modest type of home.  The average type worker, those working in the industrial sector or other businesses, must pay an enormous percentage of their income by way of mortgage repayments.  It is crippling in many cases and that is one of the reasons why there are so many difficulties in the housing construction area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred correctly to the constant and unbearable delay experienced by those purchasing houses in connection with grants from the Department of the Environment.  As a Member on the Government side I have no hesitation in supporting Deputy Fitzpatrick in his plea to the Department to ensure that grants that are due are paid without delay.  People should be told within a reasonable time that they are not entitled to them or that they will be paid within a specified period.  People should not have to go to their local representative with a plea to contact the Department in regard to grants.  There are interminable delays and many letters before applications are dealt with.  In many cases Deputies find it difficult to get a response <Col N="2298" /> from the Department.  I do not intend that as a criticism of the Minister, or his Department, but I should like to urge officials in the Department to do everything possible to speed up the payment of grants.</P>
    <P>Public servants are being subjected to a great deal of criticism at present and in my belief it is unfair because we have some of the finest brains in the country in charge of that service.  I have no doubt that if many of those people were in private industry they would be earning a great deal more money than they are paid in the public service.  Nonetheless, because of their dedication and patriotism they have chosen to remain in the public service.  It is very hard to acknowledge the service they provide by way of monetary compensation.  However, applications for grants should be dealt with without delay.  If the money is not available the Minister should announce in the House that he does not have it but that he will be in a position to pay the grants within a specified period.  I am not blaming the public servants, but people are entitled to a greater response from them on these matters.  We must remember that a grant of £1,000 or £3,000 is an enormous amount of money when one considers the cost of housing and the difficulty young people have in buying their own home.  I urge the Minister and the Department to act more decisively in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made a suggestion that we should prepare an <i>ad hoc</i> scheme. That amused me.  What is an <i>ad hoc</i> scheme?  Is it a mickey mouse scheme of some type?  Is it not difficult enough with all the schemes that have been established and the many bureaucratic systems that exist without frustrating the people more by introducing an <i>ad hoc</i> scheme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>In the few minutes available to me I should like to refer to the type of person who has not been mentioned in the House, a person who has had a house built for him by a man who has progressed from being a tradesman to a builder in a small way.  It is fair to say that most of those builders are hard working and that they do their best for people in rural areas, people who would not have any opportunity of getting a big contractor to build for them.  However, I know several people who advanced money to such builders before the work commenced and lost it before long. Those builders could not be included in the house guarantee scheme.  I know people who engaged such builders and lost their life savings because they failed to complete their house.  That failure may not have been the fault of the builder.  It may have been due to a lack of knowledge on the builder's part in submitting the estimate.  Decent people advanced money to them, money they borrowed in the form of a bridging loan, but lost everything because such builders failed to complete the building.  Such contractors can never be included in the scheme that has been mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be either a statutory scheme or an insurance system for the assistance of people who are getting houses built or for small builders who are <Col N="2300" /> forced into such a situation.  This is a serious business, as the Minister is well aware, because no one will come in voluntarily, particularly if he is a small builder.  Unless there is some sort of scheme of the kind I have suggested those people will continue to get into trouble.</P>
    <P>I support what has been said about delays in paying grants.  Files have been getting lost.  I do not know what has gone wrong in the Department but there is something seriously wrong when files belonging to people who have applied for grants cannot be found.  A very brief notice was published by the Department saying that grant applications would no longer be accepted, but 90 per cent of the people concerned did not know anything about that.  Reconstruction grants and new house grants have been refused.  This is fair enough if the Department have not got the money, but we should have been told that and the country should have been told, but the Department had been saying that they were about to improve the scheme.  Many people were conned by that quick advertisement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  Allegations have been made in the House in regard to officials of my Department concerning loss of files and people being robbed of their money. They are very serious allegations and I refute them completely.  When they go outside the House such allegations are open to all sorts of misconstruction, though they are not true.  To the best of my ability I have been attempting, with the help of my officials, to get the grant schemes running efficiently; that is my plan and that is what I should like to see happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that there is no shortage of money for the payment of these grants &mdash; I have the money to pay them.  The volume of applications has been large, and since the new scheme covering the fabric of the house was introduced the Department have been receiving at least 600 applications per week. That alone shows that the scheme has taken off quite well.  I suppose in every Department and every organisation <Col N="2301" /> everything cannot be perfect and can be improved.  I assure the House that since I arrived in the Department I have done my best but I have been taking a lot of kick and a lot of stick.  I do not mind that if it is fair comment and if it is put forward in a proper manner, but I cannot allow to go by allegations that files were burned and that people were robbed of their money.  I want to say on behalf of the Minister and me that if the applications are in order and the regulations are complied with, I will make sure payments will be made, and if any Deputy across the political divide has any problem which he thinks should be looked into I will be only too glad to have it sorted out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say files were burned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister refuted the allegations of robbery and the burning of files, which could have been damaging to the integrity of the officials about which I have no doubt whatsoever. The Minister was correct in doing what he has done in that respect.  We all realise the administrative difficulties that have contronted the system, and the charges made against the officials were unfortunate, to say the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to respond to comments made by the Minister for the Environment in relation to the Bill and particularly to the amendment.  I make a final appeal to the CIF, to the Department, to the Government and to the House which, I think, is agreed that there should be an extension of the guarantee in regard to the National House Building Agency. We are agreed that to date the agency have been very successful in a number of different ways.  Deputy Bermingham emphasised the very exposed position of a sector of the house market <i>vis-à-vis</i> the overall position in the housing market. Therefore, some provision must be found to incorporate the weak section into any new scheme that will emerge.  We used the word &ldquo;statutory&rdquo; to underline that there should be some State guarantee. At the moment there is not a State guarantee, and I suggest that the Minister and <Col N="2302" /> the Department, in discussions they will have, indeed may be having, with the CIF will have particular regard to giving some kind of statutory basis to whatever bonding system will emerge through the National House Building Agency.  That will be the first point to consider.</P>
    <P>The second point is that some provision should be made in principle to accommodate the small once-off house builder who is in a very vulnerable position &mdash; Deputy Bermingham has referred to it and I am sure the Minister comes across it in his constituency.  It is not the type of situation one would encounter in Ringsend or Ballsbridge.  Housing statistics show that a large volume of house completions, by implication, is done by this type of small builder.  The industry desperately needs this type of person who I would not like to see squeezed out. Neither would I like to see them being unable to give the kind of consumer protection we are asking the industry to provide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> That is the only danger I see in the suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party have never been in the business of squeezing people out of the market or jobs from the economy.  However, we are trying to reconcile two things that are reconcilable, consumer protection and job security. Therefore, and I ask the press to take a note of this, there has been lack of consumer protection to date and there have been victims of it.  The industry is aware that there have been victims, and I make a formal appeal to the CIF &mdash; there are some excellent, conscientious members in the CIF, to make a tangible response to those victims who had the misfortune to lose their deposits through no fault of their own.  I refer to deposits lost through the collapse or the disappearance of builders.  I am not talking about legal disputes or other such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to solicitors and auctioneers who accept implicit responsibility.  Embodied in the National House Building Agency is a principle of collective responsibility inside the industry. <Col N="2303" /> We are now trying to close the door after the horse has bolted and I am suggesting, in fairness to the industry, that we take them at their word, and as a member of the industry I suggest this is a golden opportunity to which they can respond in some tangible form.  I leave it as open as that &mdash; I am not in any way trying to be specific.</P>
    <P>I will conclude in this way.  The House will accept the amended Bill put forward by the Labour Party.  The Minister has indicated that already he is having discussions with the industry.  I now give notice to the Minister and to the House that we will be policing these discussions and looking for progress before the end of this year.  That is a reasonable timetable. We will be expecting some kind of <Col N="2304" /> performance in six months.  Otherwise the kind of motion we will put on the Order Paper in January will be much more substantial, with more stick in it for the Minister.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that mature students studying for vocational degree courses in UCD and other institutes of third-level education are not eligible for grants from his Department which are administered by the local authority if their admission to that institute has not involved them meeting its points requirements and that as a consequence they are suffering financial hardship by being technically debarred from consideration for such grants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Higher education grants are made available under schemes <Col N="2046" /> administered by county council and county borough councils.  These schemes provide that in order to qualify for a higher education grant, an applicant must, <i>inter alia,</i> have obtained prescribed successes at the leaving certificate examination.  Where an applicant who obtains such successes is admitted to a course in a university college he may be paid a grant, subject to compliance with the terms of the scheme, irrespective of whether or not he was admitted to the course by way of competition based on the points system.  The question of devising some scheme of financial assistance appropriate to the circumstances of mature students is under examination in my Department.</P>

      <P>Applicants for grants under the European Social Fund Training Grants Scheme for the purpose of the Middle Level Technician Programme must be first time job seekers and must not be more than 25 years of age.  While no means test applies in connection with the scheme, it is unlikely that many mature students would be able to satisfy the other conditions.  It should also be pointed out that university courses are not eligible for the ESF grants.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that it is necessary to specify minimum academic standards for those courses which are eligible (in RTCs and Colleges of Technology) and that the standards which are specified at present are appropriate and reasonable.</P>

    <P>(1)  The Labour Force Survey involves a number of differences in methodology and in definition which affect the measurement of the labour force and the survey results are not therefore strictly comparable to census-based figures.</P>
    <P>(2)  When detailed results become available from the 1981 Census of Population an attempt will be made to assess the effects of the differences in methodology and definition between the census and labour force surveys.  At that stage a table will be prepared containing the main Labour Force aggregates for the 1971-1981 period.</P>

      <P>The Department of Finance is a central Department with overall responsibility for advising the Government in economic and financial matters.  Its functions consist largely of policy formulation, coordination and control and are not appropriate for transfer to executive units.  No such units have been established within the Department.  Of course other offices for which I am responsible such as the Revenue Commissioners, the Office of Public Works and the Stationery Office are already organised along the lines of executive units.</P>

      <P>As regards the question of amending the tax law in this matter, it is not considered desirable to make special provision relating to marriage in the Income Tax Acts.  Any provision relating to the status of persons who go through a marriage ceremony must be contained in the general law relating to marriage.  Those provisions would then automatically apply for tax purposes.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer's agents were notified in February 1982 that a sub-contractor's certificate for 1982-83 would not be issued to their client as financial accounts of his business activities <Col N="2062" /> for each of the two years to 31 March 1981 had not been submitted.  Figures showing the make-up of trading profits for these two years were subsequently forwarded but some of the information disclosed was not in accordance with information available to the inspector from other sources.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware from previous replies to questions, the Irish and British Governments have agreed to refer the delimitation of the continental shelf to <i>ad hoc</i> arbitration.

      <P>The convention confirms many rules of customary international law, establishes new laws and gives precision to jurisdictional claims over the seas.  It enhances the prospects of international order in the seas by giving certainty to the rules and reduces the areas of potential conflict resulting from unilateral interpretation of the existing law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The coastal state has total sovereignty over its territorial sea subject to innocent passage for the ships of all states in accordance with existing customary international law but the breadth thereto may under the convention be extended to 12 nautical miles.  Innocent passage means continuous and expeditious transit for the <Col N="2083" /> purpose of transversing the territorial sea or entering internal waters and which is not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal state.  Submarines are required to navigate on the surface.  The coastal state may not hamper the innocent passage of foreign ships. The coastal state has the exclusive right to regulate marine scientific research.  We may, as a result, if we consider it desirable extend our territorial sea to 12 nautical miles.</P>
    <P>The coastal state may claim a contiguous zone of 24 nautical miles in which it may exercise control to prevent infringement of its customs, fiscal immigration and sanitary laws.  We have never claimed a contiguous zone but may now if we wish create jurisdiction in this area.</P>
    <P>The coastal state may claim an exclusive economic zone of 200 nautical miles in which it has sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring, exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources whether living or non-living. This right of the coastal state is subject to the high seas freedoms of navigation, overflight and the right to lay submarine cables and pipelines.  The coastal state may determine the total allowable catch and ensure maintenance of fish stocks by avoiding over-exploitation.  It may determine its own capacity to harvest but must give access to the surplus to landlocked and geographically disadvantaged states in the region and particularly the developing countries among them.  The coastal state has the right to regulate marine scientific research but shall in normal circumstances grant consent for projects by other states.  It has exclusive jurisdiction in relation to the establishment of artificial islands and installations and enforcement powers in relation to pollution caused by dumping or from vessels. Ireland, which has established a 200 nautical mile exclusive fishing zone, will be entitled to establish an exclusive economic zone.</P>
    <P>The advantages of such extension continue, as for the existing fishery zone, to be subject to the right of access of fishermen from other EEC countries and to the Community fishery policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2084" /> The State in whose rivers salmon originate has primary responsibility for such stocks and may establish the total allowable catch.  Salmon may only be caught inside the exclusive economic zone or, in consultation with the states concerned, outside that area.  The provisions will help to protect Ireland's investment in this resource.</P>
    <P>The article on coastal state continental shelf jurisdiction is satisfactory in that it would give Ireland jurisdiction over by far the greatest part of the geological continental margin (comprising not only the shelf but also the slope and the rise).</P>
    <P>Acceptance of this by the conference was made possible by (a) meeting fears of uncertainty as to limits and of exaggerated claims, by acceptance of methods for identification of limits which would sacrifice some of the outer part of the rise; and (b) meeting the preoccupations of those who regarded national jurisdiction beyond 200 miles as encroachment of the international area, by provision for contribution by the coastal state to the international authority of a small percentage of the revenue from resources recovered from the part of the shelf beyond 200 miles.</P>
    <P>The articles on delimitation of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone between neighbouring states leave the solution of delimitation to the applicable international law and do not set out a substantive rule.</P>
    <P>High seas freedoms are maintained which include the right of all states to freedom of navigation, overflight, the laying of cables and pipelines and for marine scientific research.  These provisions, of even greater importance for island states, ensure freedom of intercourse between nations.</P>
    <P>All states have an obligation to preserve the marine environment and to reduce and control pollution.  They must minimise the release of harmful substances from landbased sources or by dumping and pollution from vessels or installations used in exploitation.  The coastal state has control over dumping in its territorial sea, exclusive economic zone and continental shelf and may adopt laws for prevention of pollution from vessels. <Col N="2085" /> These provisions will enable Ireland to protect the marine environment around its coasts.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on all states to settle any disputes between them concerning application or interpretation of the convention by peaceful means.  There is a choice of procedure which includes the new International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the International Court of Justice or special arbitration procedures. These provisions ensure that, in accordance with Ireland's objectives, the rule of law should prevail.</P>
    <P>The newest element in the convention is the establishment of a new international body (the International Seabed Authority) to administer the exploitation of the deep seabed&mdash;i.e. the area beyond the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf.  A preparatory commission of which signatory states will be members is to be set up to begin preparations for the establishment of this organisation. The organisation will be funded, <i>inter alia</i>, by contributions made by states parties assessed in accordance with the scale used for the regular budget of the UN. Ireland has as yet no sea-bed mining technology and it is not anticipated that we would be involved in sea-bed mining in the foreseeable future but availability of supplies of minerals from the sea-bed&mdash; nickel, copper, cobalt, manganese &mdash; should increase.</P>
    <P>Ireland intends to be in a position to sign the convention when it is opened for signature in December this year and is encouraging other countries to give favourable consideration to signature at an early date.</P>
    <P>The Irish delegation worked particularly hard with other interested delegations at the last session to try to bridge the gap which remained between the industrialised and developing countries.</P>
    <P>It was a disappointment that the convention, which is a major step towards a comprehensive and universally acceptable regime for the oceans, could not be adopted by consensus but we were encouraged by the fact that 130 states voted in favour of its adoption while only <Col N="2086" /> four opposed it.  Ireland, of course, voted for its adoption.</P>
    <P>Ireland's decision to vote in favour of the convention was influenced by the fact that the convention confirms many rules of customary international law, establishes new laws and gives precision to jurisdictional claims over the seas.  It enhances the prospects of international order in the seas by giving certainty to the rules and thus reduces the areas of potential conflict resulting from unilateral interpretations of the existing law.</P>
    <P>The convention covers many areas of direct national interest since we are a coastal state.  The provision relating to the territorial sea, innocent passage, exclusive economic zone and continental shelf are of particular importance.  High seas freedoms are maintained in the provisions of the convention thus ensuring freedom of intercourse between nations. Of concern to us is the protection of the marine environment and again the convention is a considerable step forward in this regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of Government employment policy is to provide sufficient permanent full-time jobs to cater for all those seeking work, including young people.  Creating suitable economic conditions for employment-giving activity is an important objective of the Government's forthcoming National Economic Plan.</P>
      <P>Preparation of the plan is at an advanced stage and, when finalised, it will provide a coherent framework for economic development over the next three to four years.  It will put forward policies to achieve the maximum increase in sustainable employment, a reduction in the rate of inflation, a reduction in our internal budget deficit and external payments deficit and an improvement in social equity, especially in the area of taxation.</P>
      <P>The Government policies and programmes directed towards providing employment for our people include:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;general economic and budgetary measures <Col N="2090" /> which have, <i>inter alia</i>, the objective of generating employment.  For instance, provision was made in the budget this year for an additional investment of £50 million in building and construction projects which will contribute to a net improvement in the employment situation.</P>
    <P>&mdash;grants and incentives provided by development bodies such as the Industrial Development Authority, SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>In addition to the main job creation measures a wide range of ancillary schemes and measures exist which are aimed either solely at young people and/or which benefit mainly young people.  The employment incentive scheme operated by the Department of Labour has as its objective expansion of employment through the payment of premiums to employers to encourage them to recruit additional unemployed workers and young persons into full-time permanent employment.  The Youth Employment Agency established in March of this year has been charged with responsibility for integrating and radically extending the youth employment and training schemes which exist at present under the separate auspices of a number of State agencies.  The agency has set a target of involving up to 40,000 young people who are without employment for six months, in one or other of the following:</P>
    <P>&mdash;training in AnCO and CERT;</P>
    <P>&mdash;participation in the work experience programme;</P>
    <P>&mdash;employment in environmental improvement schemes;</P>
    <P>&mdash;employment in community and youth work;</P>
    <P>&mdash;employment by voluntary, social or community organisations.</P>
    <P>In addition the agency will undertake or sponsor a number of other activities to assist youth employment and enterprise. An Exchequer allocation of £41 million has been provided for these operations in 1982.  The yield from the youth employment <Col N="2091" /> levy in 1983 will be substantially higher.  These developments, viewed in conjunction with the introduction and expansion of pre-employment courses within the educational system and the placement and guidance services provided by the National Manpower Service, constitute a sizeable effort to assist school leavers and enhance their job prospects.</P>

      <P>The proposals of the working party in the Appendix I to the report of the Public Services Organisation Review Group on administrative tribunals and judicial review were for an administrative system of appeals with a Commissioner for Administrative Justice at its apex.  The all-Party Informal Committee of the Oireachtas on Administrative Justice felt that there was a danger that an extremely complicated and expensive system of appellate tribunals would result and, indeed, feared that the constitutionality of the proposed arrangement might be questioned.  The all-Party Committee, therefore, recommended instead the institution of an Ombudsman responsible to the Oireachtas. Legislation giving effect to that recommendation has been enacted.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Public Service acts in a central staff capacity, advising the Government on the management of the public service as far as organisation, personnel and remuneration are concerned.

The Department does not itself provide services of the kind which were envisaged in that report as appropriate to executive units and no such units have, therefore, been established within the Department.</P>

      <P>The all-Party Informal Committee of the Oireachtas on Administrative Justice felt that the proposal to establish a Commissioner for Administrative Justice paid too little attention to the requirements of the Oireachtas and recommended instead the appointment of an Ombudsman who would report to the Oireachtas.  Legislation giving effect to that recommendation has been enacted.

      <P>My Department have been in communication with representatives of the owners of the <i>Ranga</i> with a view to their having this vessel removed.  At the same time, as I indicated on 23 June last, I am examining the general question of whether the enactment of additional legislation relating to the removal and disposal of such wrecks might not be necessary.</P>
      <P>The matter of pollution is one for the Kerry County Council.  I understand that this body are at present considering the most effective means of obviating any risks which may exist of sea and beach pollution by this vessel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport (a) the number of recommendations of the Whiddy Tribunal which have been implemented to-date; (b) the recommendations which have not been implemented so far; and (c) when the outstanding recommendations will be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Whiddy Tribunal made 45 recommendations which in the main are concerned with matters of a technical nature relating to the operation of tankers and oil jetties.  These recommendations can be divided into three categories, namely:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) recommendations whose implementation is dependent on action <Col N="2106" /> taken by authorities in other states (the Whiddy Tribunal Report in page 337 recognised this fact).  These recommendations are Nos. 2-8, 10-13, 23;</P>
    <P>(ii) recommendations which either relate to questions of navigational safety at the berth at Whiddy in the event of the terminal being rebuilt or relate to Irish oil terminals generally. These recommendations are Nos. 18-22, 24-43;</P>
    <P>(iii) recommendations for implementation by my Department and by other Departments.  These recommendations are recommendations Nos. 1, 9, 14, 44 and 45.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recommendations listed in category (i), the Government have taken the necessary steps to involve the appropriate international organisations with a view to seeking their support and co-operation in implementing the recommendations.  These organisations have indicated their willingness to cooperate and are engaged in specialised study of specific recommendations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recommendations in category (ii), implementation of recommendations 18 and 19 will only arise in the event of the Whiddy Terminal being re-opened.  The remainder of the recommendations in this category are given effect to by requirements included in the Dangerous Substances (Oil Jetties) Regulations, 1979, although implementation in some cases would only arise in the event of the Whiddy Terminal being re-opened.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the recommendations in category (iii) is as follows:</P>
    <P>Recommendation No 1: Legislation to allow Ireland to ratify the SOLAS, 1974 Convention and the 1978 Protocol thereto has been enacted.  It is hoped that ratification will be effected shortly.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 9: A Ministerial Order was made in 1981 requiring masters of tankers to complete a tanker check-list before the tanker is allowed to berth.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 14: Provision <Col N="2107" /> was made in the legislation referred to under Recommendation No. 1 for penalties of up to £50,000 when a substandard and unsafe vessel is found within the territory of the State.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 44: The Department of Labour have been designated as the Department primarily responsible, under the Oil Jetties Regulation, for the licensing and inspection of oil jetties but without prejudice to the powers and responsibilities of other Departments and public bodies.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 45: The recently enacted Fire Services Act empowers a fire brigade to operate outside its own functional area.</P>
    <P>All of the recommendations in the Whiddy Tribunal Report have been brought to the attention of harbour authorities, oil companies and other oil importers, for implementation by them as appropriate.</P>

The brief which encompasses a 30-bed obstetric unit, a 10-bed gynaecology unit, a 10-bed special care baby unit and the necessary support services has now been completed and is at present being examined by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next stage of the development involves the appointment of a design <Col N="2131" /> team to prepare a development control plan.  The capital allocation for my Department in the current year did not make any provision for the cost of this stage of the development and in the present financial climate I am unable to say when I will be in a position to allow the planning process of this maternity unit to proceed.</P>
    <P>I will however keep the situation under review.</P>

      <P>Arrears of widow's contributory pension due to the person concerned for the period 12 March to 27 May 1982 have been paid to her by payable order after deduction of the amount of unemployment assistance payments which she received for six weeks after her husband's death.</P>
      <P>He had been in receipt of unemployment assistance at the time of his death, on 10 March 1982, but as the rate of widow's pension awarded to her was higher than the unemployment assistance payment he was getting, and which she received for the six weeks in question, the widow's pension became payable from 12 March 1982 (the Friday following her husband's death) and the unemployment assistance already paid to her was offset against the widow's pension due.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit in September 1981 in respect of an incapacity which commenced in June 1978.  He was not entitled to payment as he had not the required minimum of 26 paid or credited contributions in the contribution year 1979-80 which governed his claim.  In fact he has no paid contributions to his credit since 1962 and it is understood that he had been self-employed from that date up to the commencement of his present illness.

      <P>The claimant's entitlement to pay-related benefit is based on his reckonable earnings in the income tax year 1978-79. At the date of his claim, details of these earnings were not available but following inquiries it was ascertained that his average weekly earnings in that year were £46.08.  As his rate of disability benefit from 14 October 1980 was £39.65 he was precluded by regulations from receiving more than £6.47 a week pay-related benefit. Payment at this rate from 10 October 1980, thirteenth day of incapacity, to 4 April 1981 was included in the cheque for £163.91 which was issued to him on 9 July 1982.  He was not entitled to pay-related benefit from 6 April 1981 as the rate of disability benefit payable in his case exceeds his average weekly earnings in the relevant tax year 1978-79.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of retirement pension requires a person to have at least 156 contributions in respect of insurable employment.

Pending inquiries as to the nature and origin of the incapacity he was paid disability benefit on an interim basis from 28 January 1982, fourth day of incapacity. Pay-related benefit was authorised from 8 February 1982, 13th day of incapacity. The injury benefit claim was authorised on 9 March 1982 and an adjustment payment issued to him on 10 March 1982.</P>
      <P>Cheques issue to the claimant on receipt of medical evidence of incapacity but there appears to be a delay by him in submitting the certificates.  He has been advised to submit certificates at weekly intervals so that payments can issue at regular weekly intervals.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was last insured in the United Kingdom prior to the commencement of his illness.  In accordance with EEC regulations his claim to benefit is, therefore, the responsibility of the Department fo Health and Social Security, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne. He had been paid invalidity pension by a local office of that Department while resident in the United Kingdom.  The Department of Social Welfare has been advised by the UK authorities that, since the claimant's transfer of residence to Ireland, there has been a delay on his part in the submission of medical evidence about which DHSS have written to him.</P>
      <P>The UK authorities have also indicated that a decision will be made on the claim as soon as a reply is received.</P>
      <P>In the event of an invalidity pension being awarded by the DHSS it will be paid directly to the claimant and not through the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been awarded a contributory widow's pension at the maximum rate appropriate to a widow with three qualified children, with effect from 7 May 1982, the Friday following her husband's death.</P>
      <P>Pension books containing orders from 18 June 1982 were issued on 9 July 1982 to the designated post office for collection by her and she was notified accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrears of pension due from 7 May <Col N="2162" /> to 17 June 1982 have been paid direct to the widow by payable order after adjustment for the amount of unemployment assistance which she received during that period.</P>
    <P>There was no undue delay in paying pension in this case.  The widow claimed contributory pension on 13 May 1982 and before an award could be made it was necessary to establish the insurance record of her husband.  The widow, in her application, had quoted an incorrect insurance number and it was necessary to make enquiries to establish the correct number.</P>

      <P>Following an oral hearing of an appeal regarding the entitlement of the person concerned to a non-contributory old age pension an appeals officer decided on 13 May 1981 that he was not entitled to any pension as his means consisting of capital, the disposal of which was not accepted for old age pension purposes, exceeded the statutory limit. The claimant re-applied for an old age pension on 31 December 1981.  The claim was disallowed by the local pension committee on 6 May 1982 on the grounds that the claimant did not satisfy the statutory condition as to means.  No appeal has been lodged against the pension committee's decision of 6 May 1982.</P>

      <P>A scheme of grant assistance to encourage the development of privately owned bogs was brought into effect in June 1981 by the Turf Development Act, 1981.  The scheme is being administered by Bord na Móna.  Applications for grant assistance will be considered from owners (or lessees) of bogs, or holders of turbary rights, towards the cost of access roads, bog drainage (including outfall drainage) and the purchase, lease or hire of turf development equipment to be used for or in connection with the bog development.</P>
      <P>The scheme provides for a grant of up to 60 per cent in the case of development by a qualified society or a qualified group. A qualified society means a society which is registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893, while a qualified group means an informal and unregistered group of not fewer than three persons who have entered into an agreement to develop a bog for the production of turf or turf products for fuel. In any other case, the amount of the grant will not exceed 45 per cent.  Contractors, as distinct from owners or lessees of bogs or holders of turbary rights, may be given the same level of grants but only in respect of machinery designed or intended by its manufacturer to be used exclusively or principally for the extraction of turf for fuel.  Grant application forms are available from Bord na Móna and, when completed, should be returned directly to the head office of Bord na Móna, 76, Lower Baggot Street, Dublin 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated previously, I am satisfied that the competitive disadvantages under which Quigley Magnesite have been operating for some time were such that there was no realistic alternative to discontinuing their manufacturing operations.  I understand that the company proposes to maintain the plant on a &ldquo;care and maintenance&rdquo; basis for some time while they are reviewing developments.  The company, in conjunction with the Industrial Development Authority, are also examining the possibility of securing a takeover of the plant. No proposals for a takeover have yet emerged.</P>
      <P>The closure of the plant will increase imports of magnesite from their current level of about £2 million per annum to about £3 million per annum.  The information available to me is that it would take a subsidy of the order of £10 million over a two-year period to keep the company in operation.  In all the circumstances, I cannot see a sustainable economic basis for maintenance of the operations.</P>

The Housing Finance Agency Act, 1981, under which the Housing Finance Agency was established in February 1982 provides that the agency should be self-financing.</P>

      <P>The present intention is to use Cork prison as a committal prison when modernisation work on the north wing is completed later in the year.  There will be about 80 cells whose normal use would be for one prisoner at a time and about ten larger cells. The precise number of remand prisoners will vary but it is thought that about 20 at a time would be a typical number.  Staff numbers are kept under constant review and the increased number of prisoners in Cork will be taken into account in that regard.  I hope that it will not be necessary to have a special area in the prison reserved for difficult prisoners but that is a matter that will be kept under review also.</P>

      <P>Work on Cork Prison, which commenced in 1972, has involved the conversion of an old and scarcely serviced military detention cell-block, unsuited to present day requirements, to secure, serviced, modern custodial accommodation for about 100 civilian prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A whole new range of equipped buildings for administration, visiting, catering, <Col N="2193" /> health, education, work-training and recreation, as well as perimetering and engineering services, had also to be provided, to enable the new prison to function appropriately.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, while all this work was in progress, circumstances made it necessary to keep the prison in operation and the safe custody of prisoners there had to be maintained.</P>
    <P>Work is likely to be completed this year.  Other construction projects, where operational custody and security are not factors and where the structural and engineering levels essential to reliable custody do not apply, are not really valid comparisons.</P>
    <P>Contracts for major works such as the reconstruction of a prison are arranged by the Office of Public Works and I am not in a position to say how long any such work ought to take.  Down the years my Department has been urging that the work be completed at the earliest possible date.</P>
