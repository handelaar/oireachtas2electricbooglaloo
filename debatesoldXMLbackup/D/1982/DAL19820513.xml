      <P>Would the Taoiseach comment on the statements made in Cork last evening by the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, about financial allocations for Cork city?  The Minister had been on a two-day visit and everybody in Cork expected an announcement of major financial allocations to the city. When the Taoiseach was in Cork a month ago he said Cork would be given serious consideration, but last night we had a statement from the Minister of State in which he seriously misrepresented the facts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Funds that should have gone to Cork are being ploughed into Dublin West.  I am asking the Taoiseach to make a statement.  In an Adjournment debate last week the Dáil was informed that serious consideration would be given to the allocation of funds for development in Cork.  We are only looking for what Dublin got in the Gregory deal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Opposition are beginning to turn the House into a farce.  On the Order of Business, apparently any Deputy can raise any question he likes and accordingly the Order of Business has become a meaningless procedure and we have no way of conducting our business in the House in an orderly manner.  As far as I can see, every Deputy in the House can raise on the Order of Business any matter he feels like raising.  Therefore, we cannot possibly conduct our business properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a matter yesterday and I understand the Minister for Justice will make a statement at 3.30 on the problem in the District Court in relation to the court clerks.  Can I now ask the Taoiseach if the Minister, when dealing with this matter, will also deal with the problem that has arisen due to his failure to publish rules of court, both District Court and Circuit Court?  It has become virtually impossible for legal practioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>You will have to await the statement at 3.30.  If we were to continue like this I do not see any purpose in having the statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to co-operate with the Chair yesterday, and to be helpful, I indicated that I would ask the Minister to make a statement on this matter. <Col N="1093" /> Now Deputy Shatter proposes to raise another matter.  It seems to me that there is no end to this procedure, and the Government will not be able to conduct their business if we proceed in this manner.</P>

      <P>It has been indicated that the Minister for Justice will make a statement at 3.30.  Deputy Shatter, therefore, may not now proceed to make a statement or to ask a number of questions.  He has been assured a statement will be made and he must abide by that.  He, then, will have an opportunity to make a statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on that.  We are prepared to supply information to the Deputy on the point he raised, in deference to the Chair; but if this is to proceed in the usual way, than I must object to the procedure.  Under the procedure for making statements, the Minister would make a statement, the Opposition party would have an opportunity to make statements arising out of the Minister's statement, but the Minister would not have an opportunity to reply. That is the situation we are not prepared to countenance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem. When rulings appear to be inconsistent Deputies suffer from a sense of grievance unless an explanation is given.  I do not know about this correspondence, but unless in the correspondence you have explained why questions can be put down about the Gregory deal but not about the Blaney deal the Deputy is bound to feel a grave sense of grievance and will want to ventilate it in the House.  The matter has been raised in an orderly way by correspondence and when rulings appear inconsistent the Chair should explain the reason for the distinction so that the Deputy will not have that sense of grievance and will not have to appear to be disorderly in the House.  I suggest that the Chair try to maintain consistency in <Col N="1096" /> rulings and to ensure that the rulings are seen to be just as well as being just.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald, I want to assure you that every question that comes up to me is examined by me in consultation with my advisers.  I do not just casually say no.  I try in every way possible to ensure that a Deputy is satisfied about it.  I have written to Deputies about this telling them that they are entitled to come up and discuss any matter such as this.  You can be assured that they are not just casually rejected.  Far from it; I go to no end of trouble to try to get the questions accepted and a number of your colleagues in your party will know this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but I am suggesting that the problem that has arisen at the moment could now be resolved if in the correspondence with Deputy Harte you had explained the reason for the different treatment as between questions on the Gregory deal and questions on the Blaney deal.  If he had that explanation he would not have to raise it here. Perhaps that could be arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right.  Any Deputy who gets a rejection can write asking why.  We endeavour to give the reason but if it is not satisfactory he is entitled to write asking why and I will certainly facilitate him.  If the Deputy comes up to my office I will explain it to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Clare)</i>: As Deputties are aware, the purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to provide funds for two bodies &mdash; £25 million for Irish Steel Limited and £5¼ million for the National Enterprise Agency.</P>
      <P>Irish Steel Limited have been producing steel at Haulbowline, County Cork, since 1939.  They went into liquidation in 1947, when the State bought it from the liquidator because of the strategic importance of steel and the need to preserve employment in heavy industry.</P>
      <P>The company produce steel for use in the construction industry.  Their products are in the light to medium size range.  Up to 1978 their production capacity was about 150,000 tonnes per year, but by that stage the free trade conditions resulting from accession to the EEC had led to serious losses.  It had become abundantly clear that the old-fashioned systems then in use could never lead to real viability within the European Community.</P>
      <P>The company were aware of the need for a total restructuring of their factory, and had drawn up a plan with the help of a Canadian engineering firm.  Work on implementing this plan began in 1978.</P>
      <P>The old plant was replaced by a modern electric furnace, melting a load of 114 tonnes of scrap in between two and three hours to make 90 tonnes of molten steel. This is then poured into a new casting machine which produces three continuous steel beams.  These are rolled on a unique rolling mill to produce bars which can be round, angular or flanged in cross-section, and can be up to 70 metres long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The project is now essentially complete, <Col N="1099" /> and its final cost is estimated to be £80 million.  Of this, £64 million is the cost of fixed assets and preproduction expenses, and £16 million is the additional working capital requirement.</P>
    <P>The cost of the development itself is only one of the costs incurred by Irish Steel.  They also incurred losses from 1974 to 1980 due to the obsolescence of the old plant; they had to suspend production for 18 months while major items of plant were installed; and losses have been incurred since July 1981 in running-in the new plant and attempting to break into international markets. These factors together have now resulted in borrowings of £84 million.  This level of borrowing is far too high for the company to bear, and corrective measures are therefore necessary.</P>
    <P>The current situation in the world steel market is very poor.  The oil crisis of 1974 severely depressed the steel market, and it has not yet recovered.  At present, the level of overcapacity in steel production in Europe is estimated at 30 million tonnes.</P>
    <P>The traditional European steelmakers are now finding that many of their large, integrated steel plants, built on the assumption of a continuous supply of cheap energy, are no longer competitive. Japanese, Korean and Brazilian plants, for example, of more modern design and maximum efficiency, are now producing steel as cheaply as all but the best European plants.  For this reason, European steel is now striving to stay competitive in the market for heavy products.</P>
    <P>In the lighter range of steel products, such as construction steel, there is also a general shift in favour of Third World countries.  These countries have the natural advantages of a growing domestic market, cheap labour, and cheap energy in many cases.  In Europe, by comparison, the domestic market is fairly static as infrastructure is already developed, labour is extremely expensive, and there is no need for me to comment on energy prices.</P>
    <P>The long-term result of this situation is likely to be that some European steel producers will always be needed, but <Col N="1100" /> these will be only the most efficient and technologically advanced of the present producers.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that one must view the fact that Irish Steel intend to export over 70 per cent of their products to other European countries.  The difficulties involved should not be underestimated but I must, however, place their prospects in the proper perspective.</P>
    <P>Regardless of how objective one tries to be in assessing future prospects, it is inevitable that one's view is coloured by the current situation.  In steel, this situation is now very poor.  But significant improvements in demand are forecast when the present recession ends.  At that point, a far more optimistic view may be possible.  In addition to this general reservation on the pessimistic outlook I have spoken of, there are also, of course, the competitive advantages of the company itself.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel now have one of the most modern plants of its kind in the world.  It has the advantage of being able to produce a far wider range of products, 84 in all, then any other mill of its size in Europe.  This gives it a competitive advantage in dealing with merchants.  In addition, it is fair to say that a small, efficient and flexible producer can always find space in the market however depressed it may be.  Finally, the plant being used by Irish Steel is the only type of steel plant which is now profitable in Europe.  Taking these factors into account, Irish Steel's prospects, though difficult, are reasonably good with the proper approach to sales management and cost control.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the company has taken steps to build up a management team of the highest calibre, both by selective internal promotion and outside recruitment. A total of 20 new management personnel have been recruited since 1978, including a new chief executive and a new sales manager who has considerable experience selling in international markets for the British Steel Corporation. Other important appointments were those of an energy manager and a purchasing manager.</P>
    <P>These appointments reflect the recognition <Col N="1101" /> by the company of the difficulty of the task facing them.  The difficulties of the market, where a general improvement in demand may improve the picture over the next few years, are compounded by two additional difficulties, namely technical delays in reaching full production and the crippling burden of interest charges on the company.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel's current level of debt is £84 million and, in the absence of support, this will rise to over £100 million by mid-1983.  Borrowing of this level, taken together with depreciation, would require a trading profit of the order of £20 million a year before the company could show a net profit.  Given that Irish Steel's sales at full production would not exceed £60 million at 1982 prices, this is clearly an unrealistic goal.  In any case, no company could hope to continue with share capital of £25 million, accumulated losses at 30 June 1981 of £26.3 million and borrowings of the size I have mentioned. Inevitably, losses will result from the delay in reaching full production which I have already discussed and these will further worsen the picture.</P>
    <P>The company is faced with the prospect of borrowing to pay interest on borrowings which, without State intervention, will result in a steep spiral of borrowings leading rapidly to bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Energy and the Government, have given long and careful consideration to the financial problems of Irish Steel.  The present severe budgetary problems and the uncertain future of the steel market in general make it necessary to hold to an absolute minimum the amount of money paid to Irish Steel.  For this reason, the Government have decided only to provide the company with sufficient funds to enable it to continue for the next year. Within that time, it is the Government's intention to study further the prospects of the company in order to determine whether it can be viable in the long term.</P>
    <P>As of now, the company's most pressing need is to repay £25 million in short-term borrowings falling due at the end of May.  This must be provided to allow the <Col N="1102" /> company to survive even in the short term.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Energy intends to discuss in greater detail both the present position of Irish Steel and the measures he proposes for its future when he introduces, at a later date, legislation to increase the authorised share capital of the company from £25 million to £50 million and to increase the limit on loans which he may guarantee from £60 million to £75 million.</P>
    <P>The preparation of legislation takes some time, however, and the company's need to repay their short-term borrowings is most urgent.  I must, therefore, ask the House to approve the immediate provision of a grant of £25 million by way of a Supplementary Estimate to enable Irish Steel to meet their immediate obligations.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Supplementary Estimate for the National Enterprise Agency of £250,000 for administration expenditure under subhead F.F.1 and £5 million for job creating projects under subhead F.F.2 are in respect of a new initiative in the industrial development area.  The House had ample opportunity on 23 and 24 March last of debating the need for the agency in the context of an employment creation motion under Private Members' Business, which was put down by the Opposition and amended by the Government.  In these circumstances, I do not propose to deal again in any significant way with the background surrounding the present Government's decision to reactivate the agency and not to proceed with the proposal of the last Government to establish a National Development Corporation in its place. The reactivated agency has commenced operations again and is in the process of recruiting staff.  Ministerial responsibility for the agency will rest with the Minister for Industry and Energy rather than, as heretofore, with the Minister for Finance.  This should facilitate more effective co-ordination of the work of the various State agencies involved in industrial promotion and development.</P>
    <P>The National Enterprise Agency was established in June 1981 as a private limited liability company with a memorandum <Col N="1103" /> and articles of association reporting to the Minister for Finance.  Its establishment arose from a commitment to the social partners in the 1979 national understanding and its structure embodies the results of extensive consultation between Government, employers and trade unions, all of which are represented on the board of the agency.  However, the change of Government in mid-1981 and their commitment to establish a National Development Corporation in place of the agency meant, in effect, that the agency was largely kept in cold storage until its recent reactivation by the present Government.</P>
    <P>The agency is a venture capital development body with the broad task of providing sustainable employment through the successful commercial exploitation of new business opportunities. In order to achieve their objective, the agency's functions will focus on the commercial exploitation of projects deriving from the work of organisations such as the state research agencies; the development of projects involving the use of natural resources, e.g. downstream value added projects based on agricultural, timber or marine based resources; and projects having a substantial import substitution effect.  They will also have the function of establishing organisational responsibility for commercial exploitation by the public sector of new development opportunities not being exploited by the private sector.</P>
    <P>In carrying out their functions, the agency will have considerable flexibility and may establish ventures on their own or in partnership with other public and/or private sector interests.  The main focus will be on the industrial sector, but will not necessarily be confined to this area.  The international services sector is an expanding area for employment as well as generating valuable income on the balance of payments side.  The agency may set up subsidiary companies to run particular ventures and may sell them off when they become commercially viable, and similarly they may wind up unsuccessful projects.  Unlike their proposed <Col N="1104" /> successor, the National Development Corporation, which never got off the ground despite numerous assurances by the then Minister for Industry and Energy in the last Government, the National Enterprise Agency have been relaunched with all possible speed. Recently, the Minister for Industry and Energy addressed their inaugural meeting. Such action demonstrates the commitment of the present Government to taking effective action to tackle our serious unemployment problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister is anxious that lack of resources should not impede the valuable contribution which the agency can make to job creation and industrial development generally.  Hence, his decision to seek early Dáil approval to provide funds for the agency.  The grant-in-aid of £250,000 sought for 1982 in respect of their administration and general expenses will cover primarily (i) the recruitment of a chief executive and a small core of professional and secretarial support staff and directors' fees, and (ii) expenditure on travel/subsistence, consultancy, promotion and advertising, legal formation expenses and miscellaneous support services.</P>
    <P>The capital grant-in-aid of £5 million for 1982 being sought for the agency will be used for investment in agency-promoted employment-creating projects, particularly in areas of advanced technology, indigenous natural resources and import substitution.  Detailed project investment criteria are being drawn up by the agency and sectors and activities for priority attention will be identified. The agency will assist in developing a stronger indigenous technological based industrial sector, which is essential for our long-term growth.  In their investment policy the agency will apply commercial criteria and the emphasis will be on quality and profitable investments. They will not be a home for lame-duck industries or a vehicle for further recourse by promoters who have exhausted possibilities for State aid elsewhere. The direct employment content, associated with agency investment of £5 million in 1982 and the timing of their actual creation, will depend on such factors <Col N="1105" /> as the mix of projects &mdash; for example, labour and capital intensity &mdash; and the speed at which project proposals can be brought to fruition and implemented. The Minister does not underestimate the formidable task facing the agency in this area.</P>
    <P>The agency will not be involved in areas already adequately served by the private sector.  However, they will actively seek private sector participation in their projects, thus maximising public and private sector interaction and reducing the demands on scarce State financial resources.  They would expect to use joint ventures and licensing with overseas firms as a mechanism to effect the transfer to this country of some advanced technologies and to strengthen linkages between indigenous and foreign-owned firms, where considerable potential for development already exists.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the normal time lag between the assessment, development and implementation of new projects and the fact that the agency are only now getting under way again, the Minister expects that their proposed current and capital allocations will be adequate to meet their running expenses and project investments for 1982.  We recognise that the State will probably have to provide a substantial proportion of the agency's funding requirements in the early stages, but the objective is that they should, in due course when fully operational, derive a large part of their finances from normal commercial sources.  They will, of course, have discretion to realise their investments in profitable undertakings, thereby creating additional funds for re-investment, but it will take quite some time to reach such a position.</P>
    <P>Agency-promoted projects will provide a suitable opportunity for the main financial institutions to participate by way of equity or loan finance in the funding of such projects, and discussions will be initiated with the banks and other major financial interests involved to secure their backing and co-operation.  The agency will work closely with other commercial State enterprises and will have access to the full range of State incentives and advisory services as are available to <Col N="1106" /> industry generally.  There will be close consultative arrangements between themselves and the IDA, which will facilitate the agency's participation and IDA-promoted projects in the private sector and mutually beneficial working relationships.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not foresee any conflict of role arising between these two bodies, particularly as the IDA are a promotional and grant-giving body in contrast to the venture capital / development function of the National Enterprise Agency.  A representative of the Department of Industry and Energy is on the board of both bodies and this should reinforce liaison arrangements between them.</P>
    <P>As currently constituted, the agency are a non-statutory private limited company, with a share capital of £100.  Their objectives and functions and relationship with the responsible Minister are set out in their memorandum and articles of association.  This mechanism was used as an interim one pending enactment of legislation. We propose to put the agency on a statutory basis and the Minister would hope to submit to the Government at an early date the draft heads of a Bill for this purpose.  There are a number of practical reasons why this should be done and, in particular, the fact that state equity may be made available to the agency only under specific enabling legislation. It is also desirable that the Oireachtas should have an opportunity of examining and approving the charter of State-sponsored bodies.  The existing financial arrangements for the agency effectively preclude the development of a realistic equity basis for their operations. At present they are totally dependent on voted Exchequer funds for their capital and non-capital requirements.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that the functions of the agency, that is, the development of new business activities, are very close to those which were envisaged for the corporation.  The fundamental difference arises in so far as the corporation were to have, in addition, an advisory and supervisory role over commercial State manufacturing and energy enterprises. We felt that it would be unwise to <Col N="1107" /> saddle the agency, or corporation, with this additional role in view of the serious financial and trading problems of many of the enterprises involved.  Given the magnitude and nature of the problems confronting some of these enterprises, the energies of the agency would be largely dissipated in coping with their problems and their major job creation role would be considerably restricted, especially in the short to medium term. However, the Government recognise that existing arrangements for the supervision of these commercial State-sponsored bodies need to be considerably strengthened, especially at Government level, and we will be giving particular attention to this important area.</P>
    <P>The Minister is confident that the agency will stimulate enterprise and innovation and contribute in due course in no small way to the expansion of our industrial base, especially in technological and natural resource based industries and related fields.  Venture capital and entrepreneurship are recognised as essential ingredients for economic development and have been a major driving force behind the rapid growth of advanced high technology industries in the USA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous Government were criticised by the then Opposition for taking a pessimistic attitude to life.  We were accused by the present Minister for Finance of preaching gloom and doom and the same Minister said we would now enter into a new phase of &ldquo;boom and bloom&rdquo;&mdash; a wonderful phrase.  He was, of course, referring to our economic well-being or lack of it.</P>
      <P>I could not perceive a more pessimistic contribution than that made this morning by the Minister of State.  In the course of his speech he stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Energy and the Government have given long and careful consideration to the financial problems of Irish Steel. The present severe budgetary problems and the uncertain future of the steel market in general make it necessary to hold to an absolute minimum <Col N="1108" /> the amount of money paid to Irish Steel.  For this reason, the Government have decided only to provide the company with sufficient funds to enable them to continue for the next year. Within that time, it is the Government's intention to study further the prospects of the company in order to determine whether it can be viable in the long term.</P>
    <P>I could not imagine a speech better designed to depress the chairman, directors and personnel of that company and the Minister's contribution must be seen as a warning by the Government that they intend within the next year to decide to close Irish Steel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Clare) Mr. Barrett (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole tone of the Minister's contribution was pessimistic and he has certainly sounded a warning note to that effect.  It is in stark contrast to the comments in the annual report of Irish Steel for the year ended 30 June 1981 where it was stated that the new plant was finally installed at a capital cost of approximately £60 million.  The Minister refers to a figure of £80 million, which relates not only to the fixed capital cost of installing the new rolling plant but also to working capital.  However, the figure of £60 million is quoted in the report, including the cost of construction, site adaptation and acquisition and installation of all new fixed assets.  We should distinguish between the fixed cost and the working capital required.</P>
      <P>Irish Steel are to be congratulated on the manner in which they went about modernising their plant.  They did so on foot of a decision by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Keating, and the Coalition Government approved their development programme. This programme can only be seen to come to fruition over a long period and it will be the middle or late eighties before full production is reached. This is the nature of the development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make a number of comments regarding various aspects of the plant and its workings, the relationship between <Col N="1109" /> Irish Steel and the Government and between the Government and the European Commission.  It is refreshing to see that the annual reports of Irish Steel are published so speedily and other State bodies could well imitate Irish Steel in this respect.  In the annual report for the year ended 30 June 1981 the chairman mentions the serious delays caused by suppliers.  I wish to know whether any legal action has been taken by Irish Steel to recoup the losses caused by breaches of contract.  Obviously delays would not be important if large capital investment were not involved but we are talking about a new rolling mill costing approximately £60 million.  A delay of eight months is mentioned and there is no doubt that Irish Steel should take legal action against the suppliers.  The public are entitled to a full explanation of the action taken by Irish Steel in this regard. The new plant was finally installed in 1981 and will take four years to reach optimum production.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note from the report that there have been good industrial relations within Irish Steel.  This is important because there can be no doubt that the company are operating in a very competitive industry.  Together with Denmark, we are unique in having only one steel manufacturing plant.  There is no latitude for bad industrial relations and it is vital for the survival of the firm that industrial relations should remain excellent and that the workforce and management should co-operate in the introduction of new techniques.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that the profit and loss history of the company is not good and during the past three years there have been increasing losses.  For the year ending June 1979 the net loss was £2.926 million.  That increased in 1980 to £6.614 million and in 1981 to £12.946 million. The loss in 1981 is understandable because of the installation of the unique rolling mill and it should not be taken by anyone as a loss arising from trading.  It arose because of the installation of new plant.</P>
    <P>There are a number of serious problems I want to discuss, such as price levels, weak markets, foreign competition <Col N="1110" /> and the question of reducing dealers quotas.  I am referring to dealers who come under price level arrangements organised at European level.  A vital matter for companies is energy costs.  The Minister neatly side-stepped the issue by saying there was no need for him to discuss that topic.  That was a nice way of pushing aside the issue, but we cannot do so for much longer.  Irish energy costs are the highest in Europe.  In my contacts with industrialists the one item that is constantly mentioned and which is a source of criticism is the level of energy costs to industry.  Something must be done to alleviate this problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention one company in particular where the energy costs are damaging its viability.  I have a parliamentary question tabled regarding the firm of Premier Periglase.  This company is a specialised, export-orientated firm but it is only one company among many who are handicapped because of our energy costs.  The Minister will have to introduce some scheme to help in this matter.  A special effort will have to be made to bring a supply of natural gas to industry.  From my experience in the Department I know that the pricing policy for natural gas is not settled fully yet. I consider Irish Steel to be a particularly suitable industry for the supply of natural gas.  It is relatively near the natural gas centre in Cork and there should be no difficulty in laying on a supply.  Indeed, it might be more profitable to supply that company than to supply another large State body, but I will not go into that matter here.</P>
    <P>The advantage of natural gas is that it is available here, the reserves are good and I think they will be proved to be in excess of the present estimate of 1.35 trillion cubic feet.  It should be a key supply element to our major industries and the Minister will have to make a greater effort to ensure that they get a supply of natural gas.  It is a guaranteed supply and the State can control the price.  While I accept the doctrine that the cost of natural gas to users must be in line with comparable energy sources, at least we can control the cost over a period, and that is important.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> Production of steel in Ireland is minuscule; it is less than .2 per cent of total EEC production.  With Denmark we are unique in that we have only one mini-mill. In negotiating with our partners in the EEC, in the Coal and Steel Community and at commission level, we should align ourselves with Denmark in our negotiating stance to ensure that we have a special arrangement with our EEC partners.  This is important for a number of technical reasons.  When the mini-mill is in full production it will need a minimum production in excess of 250,000 million tons.  This is the minimum level of production that will ensure viability.</P>
    <P>I was very distressed by the pessimism shown by the Minister.  I understand that the present level of prices are 15 per cent cheaper than comparable Japanese and American output, but the steps taken by the Commission to control and to raise prices in the next few years may ensure that the Irish mill will become competitive. To think that the Government are going to decide within the next year to close the mill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Clare) Mr. Barrett (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> I never said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In his speech the Minister said that within one year it is the intention of the Government to study further the prospects of the company in order to determine if it can be viable in the long-term.  Obviously the Minister is sounding a warning note that a decision will be taken within the next year.  That is not the time scale in which to take a decision.  The mill will not be at optimum production until possibly 1986.  How can the Minister make a decision on an investment that is costing the State £80 million, according to the Minister, in such a short time?  We have a modern, potentially viable mini-mill, one that is giving good employment and that will secure our strategic supply of steel, which is vital to our industrial progress and in times of strife such as war will protect the economy from lack of supplies of steel. Accepting that optimum production will be reached in 1986, the Government are being irresponsible in saying they will take a decision on its long-term viability <Col N="1112" /> in 1982 or 1983.  I think that is a wrong attitude.  It is potentially damaging to the spirit of the workforce and to the confidence of the directors.</P>
      <P>It is not that easy to foretell the future for this industry.  The European economies are in depression.  The growth rates are negative: in some cases they are zero and in a few cases they are positive.  What will happen if European economies achieve growth rates of 4 per cent, 8 per cent or even 10 per cent?  The demand for steel will jump substantially.  An economic growth rate of, say, 10 per cent would not result in an increased demand for steel of 10 per cent; it would be very much in excess of that level.  It is not very easy to see what will happen in the mid-eighties.</P>
      <P>It is possible that the steps taken by the Commission to control and increase the price level of steel will succeed and we will have a profitable steel sector in the eighties.  That should be aligned to the fact that there is a rationalisation of steel production within the EEC where there is a conscious decision by some Governments to close down some of their older and inefficient mills.  That could result in a shortage of steel in certain circumstances if there was a sudden surge in demand for steel.  We would then be left out in the cold if we did not have our own steel mill.  This is a complex issue.</P>
      <P>We cannot examine the mill by itself; we must have reference to the European and world situation, that is, the economic climate in the Americas, the position of steel supplies from the eastern countries and the situation in Japan, which is a major steel supplier.  One cannot look at the Irish steel plant in isolation and if we decide to close the mill on the basis of an isolated decision, it will be a wrong national and economic decision and could have adverse consequences for our economy in the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of quotas has arisen at Commission level.  The present quota system is the result of a decision of the Commission made in June 1980 when a declaration that a state of manifest crisis under article 58 of the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty was made. This declaration has resulted in the introduction <Col N="1113" /> of mandatory production quotas for individual producers.  The June 1980 decision has been extended to June 1982. These quotas are implemented on a historic basis.  That raises an interesting problem for Irish Steel because I understand the opinion in the Commission is that these quotas should also apply to Irish steel production.  I submit that since we have a new mini-mill, we do not have a history of sales or production.  We are in a unique position and we must seek to ensure that we will not have to curtail our production because of the quota system. The only way our mill can be successful is if it is allowed to reach its optimum or maximum &mdash; whichever word suits &mdash; production cycle which should be reached by 1985.  We must not be constrained by quotas, although I submit our European competitors should because over-capacity exists on the European mainland, not here.  We should be seen to be in a unique position.</P>
    <P>The second subject I wish to deal with refers to price control.  This is another prong of the Commission's assault on the present ruinous state of competition which has arisen in Europe, primarily because of the 1973 energy crisis which so adversely affected economic progress. We can trace many of our economic ills back to that terrible time when the energy crisis did irreparable damage to European economies from which they have not yet recovered.  In 1980 there was fierce price competition in Europe for steel production.  I understand that in 1981 EEC prices were between 15 per cent and 20 per cent lower than the United States or Japanese prices.  The Commission set out to try to establish a controlled price for steel which would match production to demand.  That is an important criterion in economic matters. They also set out to establish minimum prices.  I understand the Commission's decision applied only to dealers who handle over 12,000 tons of steel per annum. We would seek to have that level lowered to bring smaller dealers under the umbrella of the price control mechanism. It is all very well saying there should be competition, let the cheapest man win, <Col N="1114" /> and competition is good for industry, but we are a special case.</P>
    <P>The amount of resources reserved to the steel industry by all the European countries since the last World War has been enormous and has resulted in over-supply.  It is in the Irish interest to ensure the viability of our own mini-mill &mdash; this is the technical term used &mdash; and its survival.  This is the objective of this House today and should be national policy as well.  We have not succeeded in ensuring a price level that is economically justified, although I understand that at the beginning of this year we saw a price rise of approximately 12 per cent become effective within the Community.  That is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I think we may see an end of the recession this year.  If there is an upturn &mdash; there are some indications that there may be an upturn, particularly in Britain &mdash; we may see greater demand for steel products before the end of this year and early 1983.  That will help to raise demand for steel and will have a beneficial effect on the price of steel.  It should be understood by producers that the end justifies the means.</P>
    <P>Another question which deserves to be commented upon in this House is the question of the social aspects of steel restructuring.  It does not affect Ireland directly, apart from the fact that we contribute towards the payments under this heading.  We should oppose the financing of the social restructuring aspects by direct contributions, rather than allowing a transfer from the Social Fund to the special social aspects fund, so to speak. We get a direct benefit from the Social Fund and we should protect it in its entirety to ensure that we get our full share of it.  If we see a special case for the social aspects of steel restructuring it should be under a separate heading and it should be dealt with as such.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which has serious financial repercussions for the Irish Steel Company has reference to the loans under Article 56 of the European Coal and Steel Community.  It is possible to get cheap loans for industries which reemploy redundant steel workers.  While it does not affect us directly to any great <Col N="1115" /> extent, there have been external effects which directly affect the Irish economy with regard to our inwards investment policy and the policy of the Japanese investing in Ireland.  I am aware of the Sony case in England.  Loans were provided for the plant in Bridgend in Wales which manufactures television tubes.  The level of State aids exceeded the State aids criteria.</P>
    <P>This caused us a problem.  We did not object to it.  I mention it because it is important for us to ensure that this does not become a common practice in the EEC.  If it becomes a common practice that the level of State aids is higher than that allowed in other countries, that will create a problem for our Industrial Development Authority in attracting investment here.  It is an important aspect of this whole affair which should not be ignored by the Minister or the Department.</P>
    <P>While I was in the Department of Industry and Energy I noticed a tendency growing in Europe to flout the level of State aids in European countries.  The relatively recent decision by the French Government to reconquer their home market demonstrates an attitude in Europe which is protective in effect and which is anti-free trade, anti-the spirit of the Rome Treaty and the spirit of the competitive atmosphere within the European Community.  That is something we must resist.  We depend on foreign investment to such an extent that we cannot allow other countries to out-compete us in the race for foreign investment.</P>
    <P>While I may appear to be digressing, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I can assure you that I am not.  I am dealing with the problem in the context of the steel policy of the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Commission. It is vitally important that we should protect our market for foreign investment by ensuring that other countries within the EEC do not circumvent or flout the State aids policy of the Community.  I make that point because it is proper to make it here under this heading.  We have a case stated.</P>
    <P>The State aids are also important in so <Col N="1116" /> far as the equity of Irish Steel is concerned. The effectiveness of the aids code must be seen in its generality.  In the Irish case we must be seen to be an exception to the code.  We must not be subject to its full rigours.  It is important that this is realised and that a strong case is made to the Commission in this regard.  I do not wish to discuss that any further.  I am aware of its implications and I will earmark it for discussion at some future date.</P>
    <P>I readily admit that the position at market level is not good.  The state of the European and American market is depressed.  The Minister would be quite wrong to make a decision on the long-term future of Irish Steel within the next year.  The market profile for the eighties will not be established next year.  We will have to await the optimum production from Irish Steel before making a final decision on their viability.  From a strategic point of view we must argue in favour of keeping Irish Steel open.  In saying that I readily admit that commercial criteria should be adopted in all our State companies.  Where the strategic element comes into it, it should be stated quite clearly that it is separate from the commercial criteria and is seen as such by the Government.</P>
    <P>If we could see in Europe the success of a prices control regime and the success of the quota system, we could see rationality returning to the steel market which would be a good omen for Irish Steel.  I must put in the caveat that I am extremely disappointed about the Minister's references to Irish Steel and their future.  His attitude here today was short-sighted and not justified.  It was not proven on any economic or commercial grounds, especially when one considers the complex market situation in the steel industry. The Minister's contribution will have an adverse and depressing effect on the workers in Irish Steel and on the board of Irish Steel.  His speech today was not justified in its pessimism about the future of the company.</P>
    <P>I am very annoyed that he should have come in here today and more or less announced that a final decision will be made within a year on the viability or <Col N="1117" /> otherwise of Irish Steel.  That decision cannot be made this year or next year, because the economic statistics will not be available in full within that time span. His statement was extremely disappointing for a company who are in the process of re-establishing their own market at home and abroad.  It is very disappointing that the Minister should come into this House with such an attitude.  I suppose the boom and bloom policy of the Government is coming to a halt, perhaps because they realise their own economic and budgetary shortcomings.  In this case there are special considerations to be taken into account.  I am extremely disappointed that the Minister has not realised that there are those special considerations to be taken into account when discussing Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech had many shortcomings. If I may say so, my own contribution is far superior but then I am aware of the situation because of my experience in the Department of the complex situation involved.  I am not blaming the Minister present who delivered the speech because I am aware he is not the Minister responsible.  But the Minister responsible should not have had this script here today and should have been aware of the other complex issues involved.  It was a very narrow speech, in its nature uncomprehending of the affairs of Irish Steel and a bad speech from the point of view of creating optimism within the Irish Steel complex, their board of management, workers and others.  I regard it as a sad speech because it was unjustified in the light of the facts of the case as I know them.  The European situation was more or less ignored in the speech.  The European situation is of a complex nature but yet one which might be beneficial to the survival of Irish Steel and their prosperity.</P>
    <P>I shall say no more than that I am extremely annoyed and saddened by the narrowness of the Minister's speech, by the narrow attitude of the Minister and that his speech is in conflict with the developing situation, with particular reference to the European scene and also to the fact that the steel mill may not be in full production until 1986.  Yet the Minister <Col N="1118" /> is saying now that a final decision will be taken on the viability of Irish Steel within the next 12 months.  That cannot be done.  It is like saying that a horse should be put down even though it is not fully trained; it might not even have run a race.</P>

      <P>The Minister says it could be partially sick but if the horse has never run a race one does not know whether he is good or bad and Irish Steel have not run their race yet, they are going into training only.  The Minister's speech was a very bad one, not justified in the circumstances of Irish Steel and certainly one that should not have been made in this House at present.  The Irish Steel case is only beginning but the Minister seems to be bringing it to an abrupt end without allowing it to prove itself or allowing the action at present taking place within the European Commission to take effect.  Nor is the Minister prepared to await a change in the economic environment in Europe before taking a decision in regard to Irish Steel.  On behalf of my party I deride that attitude and condemn it as being negative.  I condemn the attitude of the Minister as not being founded on the economic facts available to him, perhaps the most serious allegation I can make against him in this House.  I condemn the speech and I refuse to support the Minister along the route he is taking with regard to Irish Steel.  I could not perceive of a speech more ill-timed or calculated to do damage to the environment within Irish Steel at present &mdash; at a time when they are looking forward, beyond themselves, to more prosperous times.  It was a disgraceful speech to deliver in this House at this time and no doubt I shall have reason to return to it at a future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to refer to the other element of the Supplementary Estimate, that which refers to the National Enterprise Agency Limited, their administration and general expenses and indeed also their capital expenditure.  The Minister in the course of his speech said we had debated this on 23 and 24 March in <Col N="1119" /> detail, which we had done.  The attitude of the Government to job creation can be seen from this Supplementary Estimate as being one of a half-hearted effort, or as providing a sop to State involvement in job creation.  That is said and is reflective of Fianna Fáil's attitude to State participation in employment policies.  Our party always have supported the concept of a mixed economy and have always been supportive of private enterprise. Indeed on many occasions we have been called the party of free enterprise.  Certainly we support the role of free enterprise in this country and have always done so whether in Government or Opposition since the foundation of the State.  The role of any Government in supporting free enterprise must be to ensure a healthy environment for both industry and enterprise.  In my opinion, sadly, that environment is now lacking in this country.  It is reflected in the fact that the number of unemployed has gone up from the December 1979 level of 84,900 to the present level of 148,000, over one-quarter of whom are young people. That is a direct reflection of the lack of a healthy environment for industry and, when I say industry, I mean in its broad spectrum, whether it be agriculturally-based, in the service industries or whatever.</P>
    <P>The consequences of that unhealthy environment for industrial progress are to be seen all round us.  As a politician I have had the experience of contesting two general elections in the past year and we are now in the middle of a by-election in Dublin West.  It is very sad for me, as a politician, to witness the sense of deprivation, of defeat, of sadness I have witnessed amongst married couples neither of whom can get employment but perhaps more especially amongst young people, not long left school, who cannot find employment.  It is extremely upsetting and must be for any person in public life to witness this sad plight of people who have lost confidence in us as politicians. They have lost confidence in political parties and, perhaps worst and saddest of all, in the parliament, in Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.  There is a <Col N="1120" /> sense of cynicism about the whole country and we politicians must take the blame for that.  We have failed, as a parliament, to ensure that we bring about a situation in which there is full employment in our country, or a situation in which we can even approach a level of full employment.</P>
    <P>I blame directly successive Governments for failing to face up to the real problems confronting the country, to face the fact that our domestic inflation rate is twice as high or more than our European partners, or that our inflation rate is substantially higher than those countries to which we export our produce.  We are not succeeding because of the failure of successive Governments to control the level of inflation.  We are failing our own people.  We are also failing them because a major part of the causes of inflation has been excessive expenditure on the budget by successive Governments.  I have condemned that level of expenditure since 1972, when it first began as a conscious policy decision by Fianna Fail when Deputy Colley was Minister for Finance. I want to make it quite clear that I blame not only Fianna Fáil but Fine Gael and Labour in Government also.  We have failed to face the fact that our national finances are seriously out of order and until the Government decide to take the hard decision to bring the budget into balance and rectify the balance of payments situation we shall continue to have a very high level of unemployment.  One might think it is a simple problem but it is not.  I doubt very much if the present Government with Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach will have the gumption or the courage to tackle the real problems in our economy.  The young people could very well rise up against us.  I can now foresee a social revolution which would have damaging effects on society as I would like to see it.  I do not mind sounding that word of warning.  I can base it on my experience in the Department.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to set up a National Enterprise Agency has not really great meaning: it is only a sop.  The moneys provided are small &mdash; £250,000 for administration and £5 million for <Col N="1121" /> activities.  It is insufficient, too paltry to have any effect.  The money provided for industrial ventures should be at least £20 million, as we proposed in Government and as I proposed here in Private Members' Time not so long ago.  That was rejected by Fianna Fáil.  People should realise that Fianna Fáil have rejected the idea of earmarking £20 million for industrial development.  That was a conscious decision, a bad decision, a negative decision. It was a political decision because the proposal came from the Opposition. That £20 million would be well spent on industrial ventures.</P>
    <P>The economy has grown as a mixed economy where private enterprise and State involvement have been traditional. We have seen some excellent State involvement, the ESB, the VHI, and Bord na Móna.  Some of them have not worked too well.  At the moment CIE and NET are two State bodies in crisis and hard decisions will have to be made about their future.  We cannot ensure the prosperity of the State without taking some risks and without some failures.  We should not be too upset if we have a failure.  If we have to take hard decisions, well and good; but I think we were right in trying to develop our economy in our own way and to take the risks of that policy.  We must &mdash; and the Minister acknowledges this here &mdash; always adopt financial and commercial criteria for State involvement.  I am not talking about agencies that are social in nature, which provide services on a social basis.  I am talking of State trading companies, whether trading themselves or trading in commodities. As a central theme of State involvement we must always adopt commercial criteria and we should not be afraid to make harsh decisions where necessary. I feel that in relation to some State bodies harsh decisions will have to be taken, and the sooner the better for the economy and the nation.  If you run away from them you only create malaise in society with false affluence.  That would be to the detriment of the long term development of our economy.</P>
    <P>There has been a good partnership between the State and the private sector. <Col N="1122" /> This manifests itself primarily with the IDA involvement since 1947 or 1948 when An Bord Tionscail were established. The IDA have performed well as an industrial instigator.  The Telesis report, I suppose, has already been published in some fashion but not in full and I think the publications that leaked were not justified and did damage to the IDA which was not justified. The sooner the full report is published the better for all, including the IDA.</P>
    <P>It may be that our industrial promotion policy may have to change.  I am concerned at this time about the attitude prevailing in the European Commission regarding industrial promotion policy. We may be losing out at that level in ensuring that we can take every reasonable step open to us to promote industry within the country and seek investment abroad.  We must take greater care at European level to protect our industrial promotion policy than is at present being taken.  The role of the National Enterprise Agency in becoming involved in venture capital is not too dissimilar from that proposed on this side of the House by myself on 23 March.  It lacks teeth because it lacks money, which is the prime mover in industrial promotion. Not enough emphasis is being put by the Minister or the Government on the development of partnership between State bodies and the private sector.  I am convinced that there is a wealth of technical and commercial experience available in the State sector, in State trading companies like Bord na Móna and the ESB.  The ESB have been extremely successful abroad, particularly in the Middle East with their consultancy programme, which is earning revenue for them, giving experience to their staff and enabling them to become involved in developing countries.  The ESB are earning revenue for themselves in this way at times when there is not a great increase in demand for electricity at home.  That is the type of activity I should like to see, but the Government do not seem intent on using the National Enterprise Agency to encourage State bodies such as Bord na Móna and the ESB to become involved <Col N="1123" /> with private enterprise at joint venture level or at consultation level.  I am somewhat worried that our State bodies are not allowed more initiative in the areas in which they can become involved.  The engineering and technical staffs in State bodies who have technical and commercial expertise could be used to a greater extent when the opportunity arises.  I appreciate that they were within the confines of a statute.  Perhaps the National Enterprise Agency provides the mechanism whereby a State body who have a good idea and have the manpower to back this idea up should be allowed to go into partnership in regard to introducing new commercial enterprises into the country or to become involved in the exportation of that enterprise.  Bord na Móna and the ESB are two cases which come to mind.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the commitment of the Government about the operation of the agency or about the extent of their responsibility is genuine.  The emphasis seems to be placed on research and technical improvements but that will take a lot of money.  A sum of £5 million is paltry in that area.  The National Development Corporation proposed by Fine Gael, supported by the Labour Party, had a far wider vision.  It is very disappointing that it was knocked down by Fianna Fáil.  This decision is detrimental to industrial development.  The National Development Corporation would have had a supervisory role with regard to the activities of State bodies and would have moved them along into new areas of development in which they had the expertise.  The National Development Corporation would have had a co-ordinating role which would have been important in relation to the development strategy which could he used by a number of State bodies.  The venture capital would have been positive and would have been of benefit to the private sector and the State sector.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Bill dealing with the agency.  I will wait until I see the Bill before I make a final judgment on the agency as an economic force in our society. It is unfortunate that industrial promotion <Col N="1124" /> policies have not resulted in full employment.  It is recognised by this side of the House that new initiatives must be taken to encourage industrial progress. We accept this Supplementary Estimate but I reserve judgment on the National Enterprise Agency until I see the Bill.  I am very disappointed with the attitude of the Minister with regard to Irish Steel Limited.  With regard to the National Enterprise Agency I consider that the money allocated is merely a fobbing off of some commitment the former Taoiseach gave.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is for £25 million for Irish Steel and £5 million for the National Enterprise Agency, with £250,000 for administration.  We must have a look at the background to Irish Steel before we discuss what the problems are.  In May 1978 the Government approved a new plant there at a cost of £30.8 million.  We realise that the cost has now more than doubled if we take the plant only into account.  The reasons for that have a lot to do with direct Government policies in the budget.  Our rate of inflation is twice that in other European countries and, therfore, costs have escalated during the period from 1978 to 1982.</P>
      <P>The chairman of Irish Steel in his review estimated the cost to be £60 million. The Minister said today that it would be approximately £80 million taking everything into account.  I am not satisfied that something which was projected four years ago to cost £30 million today costs £60 million.  Is the Minister satisfied with those figures?  The new plant will take a number of years to reach full capacity because of the wide range of products which will be developed.  It is impossible to judge the plant on its performance to date.  There has been restricted production during the development of the new plant.  We can hardly judge it on its performance to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Steel made a modest profit during the early seventies.  That was during the period of the old plant.  Losses have been recorded since 1975 and they have escalated over the last three years.  The losses in 1976 were just over £2 million, in 1977 <Col N="1125" /> they were a little less than that and in 1978 they were down to £1 million.  The loss incurred up to mid-1981 was £12 million.  It is fair to say that the large jump in losses was because of the commissioning of the new plant and because of the lack of commercial activity during that period.  The Government injected over £19 million in additional share capital between 1978 and 1981.  In addition the IDA gave grants of £4.8 million.  Due to the heavy losses in 1980 and 1981 the total amount of loans outstanding has risen from just over £21 million in 1980 to £50 million in 1981.  This is a very serious situation and I do not believe anybody would try to minimise it.  All this money is guaranteed by the Minister for Industry and Energy.  If the Government were to decide tomorrow to wind down and close Irish Steel if would cost them about £50 million.</P>
    <P>Any review of the company and of their activities in the coming year must take into account the changing factors in the European steel market and also the potential of the plant.  I am convinced that it has very great potential.  It is one of the most modern plants in Europe and we must consider it in the longer term rather than in the shorter term of merely determining whether it will be viable within the next year.  There is a general expectancy throughout Europe of an increased demand for steel and of the fixing of a minimum price for it.  That would put our people in the position of being able to produce steel in the knowledge that the price would be realistic and would not be brought to an unrealistic level as a result of imports from third countries.  In these circumstances Irish Steel have a place within the Community. I agree that the figures at the moment are not very convincing and I expect that any hard-headed businessman looking at them would be making a judgment without knowing the full facts and without knowing what is the full potential of the plant and might ask why we should throw good money after bad.</P>
    <P>But we must realise that the steel industry in Europe has been through a recessionary period.  The European Coal and Steel Community have made loans <Col N="1126" /> available in that respect.  There has been a deliberate reduction in employment in steel plants in Europe during the modernisation period.  The plan that is being drawn up by the coal and steel industry in Europe is for the purpose of rationalising the structures for the economic production of steel.  There has been a cutback situation in so far as the production of steel is concerned, but then the whole attitude in Europe seems to be to cut back in terms of everything that is produced, whether in the agriculture sphere or otherwise.  I am beginning to wonder whether it is good to be part of such a big conglomeration so far as industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>Competition from such countries as Japan and South Korea have forced closures in the steel industry as well as in other industries in Europe.  In addition, there has been under-utilisation of the capacity in the remaining plants due to the depressed demand for all steel products.  Because we have one of the most modern plants in Europe and having regard to the fact that the EEC are attempting to stabilise steel prices, the industry here should be in a position to make some profit.  I see no reason for our not producing at least whatever steel we need for ourselves.  The chairman of the company has said that great credit is due to everybody working for Irish Steel. There have been excellent industrial relations in the company down through the years.  With that situation, and given the favourable factors I have outlined for the industry generally, we should have no fears in regard to its future.  Until such time as Irish Steel are in a position to operate at maximum production we must give them every encouragement and not merely say that they are in a loss-making situation.  In saying that the company's operations will be reviewed the Minister seemed to give the impression that this might be something final.  I hope that is not so because to take that attitude would be to make a serious mistake at this time. Therefore, I should like the Minister to clarify the position when he is replying.</P>
    <P>There are a few other questions to which I should like to hear the Minister reply also.  Is the Minister satisfied that <Col N="1127" /> the cost is justified?  The estimated cost of £30 million on the date of approval in 1978 has escalated to £64 million in terms of the comparative figure today.  Can he tell us, too, what is the projected date by which the company will be at full production consequent on this legislation? May we have a firm commitment that the matter will not be allowed to drag on while the company continue to operate at only half their capacity until finally they would be wound down without ever reaching full capacity?  It is not possible to assess the full potential of the industry unless it is working at full capacity.</P>
    <P>I know that it is very difficult to arrive at accurate estimations but the Minister should be able to give us some idea of when the company can expect to be in a break-even situation.  Would the Minister agree also that a body such as the National Development Corporation should have a role in the steel industry? I ask the question because, as has been said by the previous speaker, the National Development Corporation were meant to have a supervisory role. Would it be helpful if the agency had a supervisory role to ensure that the maximum output was brought about as soon as possible and that a break-even situation was achieved by the company in the shortest possible time?  I do not wish to go on about Irish Steel but it is apparent that there is some lack of cohesion if it is not possible to project now when that plant will be in full production or if it is not possible to say it will break even or how long it will take before we can say we have a viable national steel industry capable of expansion in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The other part of the Estimate is a token as far as tackling unemployment is concerned.  The National Enterprise Agency were set up as an alternative to the National Development Corporation as proposed by the National Coalition. The objectives of the National Enterprise agency were set out by the Minister, when replying to a Fine Gael motion on 23 March last, as follows:</P>
    <P>to provide commercially viable productive employment by promoting and developing new business opportunities, <Col N="1128" /> specifically through the commercial exploitation of projects deriving from the work of research agencies such as the National Board for Science and Technology, An Foras Talúntais, An Foras Forbartha and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards...</P>
    <P>the agency will act on its own or in joint ventures with other private or public sector agencies...</P>
    <P>the agency will have responsibility for commercial exploitation by the public sector of new development opportunities not being taken up by the private sector.</P>
    <P>The National Coalition proposed to allocate £20 million to the National Development Corporation and the Minister, when he spoke on the Fine Gaael motion in March, outlined a very ambitious programme for his agency; but I do not know how that will be implemented with an allocation of £5 million.  I do not think the Government are serious about those objectives.  I accept that the Minister said that more money will be provided if needed.  I do not think anybody could seriously tackle the programme outlined by the Minister with £5 million, a figure which would hardly cover one project. The £20 million suggested for the National Development Corporation was insufficient.  It may not have been possible to spend that amount in one year, but it was a start.</P>
    <P>I do not think the agency will do very much if they are only given £5 million for grants to industry.  The decision of the Government to cut back in this area is an indication of their commitment towards employment.  They should be ashamed to provide only £5 million for creating employment for our young people.  Like many others, I believe unemployment is the most serious problem we have to face. It will not go away and there is no safety valve such as emigration as we had some years ago.  Our young people will not put up with the messing about that the Government have gone on with.  The amount proposed in the Estimate is an insult to those young people who cannot find work.  The Government should not be pretending that £5 million will find <Col N="1129" /> employment.  The Minister must face up to this problem and he is responsible for the consequences of the lack of jobs.  He cannot wriggle out from that.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Education was in charge of the Department of Economic Planning and Development he told me in this House that if his Government did not produce full employment in the time span of that Dáil &mdash; that Government were in power for four years &mdash; he would adopt my suggestion.  Full employment was not produced and, in fact, it was nearer to full unemployment.  Unemployment figures doubled and at that time we heard talk about the expansion of a private sector, relieving that sector of taxation so that jobs could be provided.  Fianna Fáil relieved the taxation but put the country in debt by borrowing since then in order to pay for the tax-free concessions they gave to private enterprise.  However, jobs were not produced.  In fact, jobs were lost left right and centre under that system.</P>
    <P>An attempt is being made to produce something which would even help private enterprise to create jobs, but it is taken out of the budget and one quarter of the amount substituted.  If that is the Fianna Fáil attitude to unemployment, our most serious problem, they have every reason to be ashamed of themselves.  If we do not seriously tackle this problem of unemployment, if we continue offering Mickey Mouse solutions like this, setting up a laughing stock of an agency with capital input of £5 million, let us be honest and say that we can do nothing about that unemployment.  I have not heard a single idea from the Government on the creation of employment.  If we do not create jobs and do something about increased redundancies and rising unemployment, we are reducing our tax base, as well as everything else.  If we continue along this path, our young people will not put up with it&mdash;and I will say no more than that.</P>
    <P>It is fair to ask the Minister if he seriously believes that this will do anything at all, or is it simply a pious exercise of telling the people that £5 million is available? How many jobs does he hope to create under this National Enterprise <Col N="1130" /> Agency.  How many enterprises has he processed, and will he spend the £5 million at all?  Will any job be created under this agency?  Will one person be taken off the live register, or one redundancy prevented because of this £5 million?  I do not believe so.  On the heads of this Government be the results of the serious consequences of not making an attempt to provide employment for our young people and, indeed, for our older people too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate was preceded six weeks ago by a debate on a Private Member's motion put down by my party to which, for reasons of form, Deputy Collins's and my name were signed.  In the course of that debate, two Fianna Fáil speakers, the Minister, Deputy Reynolds and another Deputy whom I have forgotten, hauled out of the ashes of the general election either an interview or a discussion &mdash; I cannot remember which &mdash; in which I had taken part in February, and in which I had expressed reserves about the concept of a National Development Corporation.  They thought this was a useful stick with which to beat Deputy Collins, who was in charge of the debate on behalf of our party.</P>
      <P>I had said then that if the National Development Corporation which we originally had proposed was not going to provide productive employment, or be engaged in productive enterprise, in the long run it would be a very expensive millstone and one which we would be far better without.  That is still what I believe. What I have to say, in hypothesis, about the National Development Corporation I am now going to say in the concrete about the employment agency which the Minister of State has produced here this morning.  If the thing produces sensible work which could be understood, on commercial criteria, from which, at the end of the process, a product would emerge for which people would pay real money, then one could defend either an enterprise agency like this, or the National Development Corporation, but not otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having heard Deputy Barrett, Minister of State, this morning and listened to <Col N="1131" /> that part of his speech which dealt with the National Enterprise Agency, I am completely in the dark.  As Deputy Bermingham asked a few moments ago, has the Minister one single idea in his head about what this agency will actually do on the ground?  That is what I want to know.  It is easy to create a limited, non-statutory company, an <i>ad hoc</i> agency like this and it is easy &mdash; though, of course, it costs money because everything like this costs money &mdash; to give it a statutory basis. That is no problem.  However, what I am still waiting to hear from the Government &mdash; and let me say with due respect to Deputy Bermingham, what I am still waiting to hear from his party, even when they shared government with us &mdash; was, what kind of actual, concrete, economic operation this agency, or the development corporation were going to engage in.  I am glad to hear Deputy Bermingham express puzzlement, because I do not think that the obscurity in which this agency is shrouded was any less when we were in government, or any less before that when the Labour Party in opposition were recommending the institution of a development corporation.</P>
    <P>If we can find finances from which the private sector have no good reason to stay away, in which the private sector might have made money, from which a product, or a process, or a service would have resulted for which ordinary people in ordinary commerce, not constrained by scrounging for votes, would have paid money, then by all means let us have a State corporation to carry out that function. I am not an ideologue against State intervention at all.  I quite accept that there is such a thing as a stick-in-the-mud private sector, that there are parts of the private sector and of private industry which are stick-in-the-mud.  Perhaps there are and perhaps it is up to the State to try to identify these areas and supplement private initiative in the way that Article 45 of the Constitution envisages in its Declaration of General Principles of Social Policy.  Supplement private initiative, if we have stick-in-the-mud industrials and namby-pambies who are afraid to venture 6p, but I am still waiting to <Col N="1132" /> hear which these sectors are.  I am perfectly open to conviction about that, and have no ideological objection in the wide world to an enterprise agency, development corporation, or ten of them.  I want to know what are their functions in terms of what procucts will be turned out, what economic operations will be engaged in which will justify this House in taking £5 million out of the pockets of our people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham described the £5 million as an insult.  I hope I do not do his argument an injustice when I say that if £5 million is an insult and £20 million more respectable, I would like to stand that on its head.  If money is going to be thrown away through this agency or corporation, I would far sooner the Minister threw away £5 million than £20 million. If we are in doubt as to what the agency is going to do, I would far sooner that the £5 million went down the drain while they were making up their minds about that, than that £20 million went down the drain.</P>
    <P>All I hoped was that the Minister this morning, having signalled this enterprise agency, would tell us what it is going to do.  Having listened to his speech and re-read it, I find that there is not a single clue in it.  No businessman in the wide world would lend him 6p on the intentions and waffle and flummery &mdash; I say that with respect to his Department, whose officials have no option but to follow political directions which are given, even though they may not believe in them &mdash; there is not a businessman or private concern in the world unless constrained politically &mdash; and that is what is bringing us down &mdash; by the necessity to keep alive by scrounging votes off people and swindling them out of them, who would advance 6p on the security of the promises and proposals made by the Minister this morning.  They would not know what they were.  It is not simply a pig in a poke, because at least while you cannot see the pig, you can see there is something wiggling in there.  This is a poke with nothing in it but air, so far as one can judge.  There is no sign of life at all in it.</P>
    <P>I suppose I have long enough experienced this sort of thing from both <Col N="1133" /> sides of the House to say that I very nearly could have written this speech of the Minister myself.  I very nearly could have predicted what he was going to produce this morning and certainly would have predicted that the speech here this morning would include the fact that this would be the only concrete operation to be funded out of the £5 million &mdash; the recruitment of a chief executive and of staff.  He might have added premises, auditors and cute little graphic designers to do the annual report cover.  I have no doubt at all about the State's capacity to throw money away on these things.  First get your chief executive, set him up with a suite, wall to wall bureaucracy, a stainless steel plate on the front with cute little logograms of the National Enterprise Agency and someone to translate it into Irish.  That is the primrose path down which hundreds of millions of hard-earned Irish pounds have marched over the last decades.  That is the only concrete project so far that we are getting for the £5 million which the Minister mentioned here this morning &mdash; to recruit a chief executive.  I have no doubt the headhunters are doing it at this minute; they will also want their pound of flesh.  When they have the stock and the premises it is only then they will think of something to do.</P>
    <P>The chief executive's first idea will be to hire a firm of outside consultants for them to tell him what to do.  They will also want their pound of flesh.  If I am doing the Minister an injustice, he will be able to reply here today &mdash; although I hope he will not take it as a discourtesy if I am not there to hear him as I have to go very shortly when I conclude my speech.  I will be reading, with great interest, what he says in reply.  If I am doing the Minister an injustice and if he has got up his sleeve some details of the concrete projects that this agency will be either itself initiating, collaborating in or supporting, please let us have the details, not just to satisfy the Opposition but to discharge our duty as that House of the Oireachtas which controls the disbursement of public funds.  Our duty to the people is not to spend their money and put it into the hands of a Minister who <Col N="1134" /> can do what he likes with it without knowing what it is going to be spent on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power, Minister for Defence, seemed to be reading over the speech for his own Estimate, which now looks as though it will not be reached for a while. I have no doubt that Deputy Power's Estimate for the Department of Defence will contain details of engines of destruction and warlike stores of all kinds which he wants us to invest in.  I have no doubt there will be details in it of salaries, renewal of barracks and grandiose infernal machines of all kinds which he wants us to lay in a stock of.  Whether one disagrees with that or whatever one's view of neutrality, whether it is of the old kind or of the kind we have heard enunciated for the first time in the history of the civilized world the other day, does not really matter.  At least one would be able to see in one's mind's eye the range of hardware, extra salaries or extra barrack accommodation which this money is going to be spent on.  It may perhaps be a fishery protection vessel, I do not know. Perhaps I should have read the Estimate. But we have no idea what this £5 million will be spent on or &mdash; I will stake my solemn oath on it &mdash; the Minister opposite has not got a clue either.  I also say with the greatest respect to the officials who serve him, and I know they do it loyally and well, that not one of them has an idea either.  They are going through the motions because they have to, under political orders of producing a speech and an ostensible excuse for spending £5 million. I do not blame them for that, but we already have a very complete apparatus of State bodies for doing all kinds of functions with an economic purpose, many of which are commercial enterprises of a sort in which there is a saleable end product.  I can well see that a man might be put to the pin of his collar to see what else was left for an agency of this kind to do, if there was some serious project that it could undertake I do not want it defined in terms of &ldquo;co-ordinating&rdquo; this and &ldquo;liaising with&rdquo; that.  I want to know if it is going to turn out bricks or mortar or both?  Is it going to turn out tin cans or the labels for tin cans?  The Minister will have a chance to tell us that.  I <Col N="1135" /> hope we will not be told that he is afraid of having his thunder stolen by the private sector.  I hope we will not be told that there is up the sleeves of the IIRS, the NBST or An Foras Talúntais some project for extracting wealth from some new process or exploiting some new form of natural resource which the private sector does not yet know about and which, if it did, would be falling over itself to get into.  That is the duty and the job of the IIRS or the NBST or An Foras Talúntais, not to be keeping secrets up their sleeves because they too are funded by public money and subscribed for by the taxpayer. If they have suddenly thought up some process or some possible product which is worth something or which somebody not constrained by public necessity would pay good money for, they have a duty to let it out to the world and let the private sector get into it if need be.  Let the people of Ireland avoid the millstone of risk which the super-imposition on this process of a bureaucratic machine inevitably will bring with it.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not make himself ludicrous by telling us that he has commercial secrets up his sleeve which he did not want to tell the House about for fear they would be stolen by somebody else.  I do not know Deputy Barrett all that well but I always felt he was a serious man and I do not believe he would do himself the discredit of advancing an argument like that to the House.  It cannot be that I am asking him to divulge any commercial or trade secrets or of trying to prevent the private sector from stealing something.  I repeat that I would like to know what he or his Department envisage this thing doing on the ground. I make the House a free gift of this fact: I was not able to understand and not able to find out, during the eight months I was a member of the Government, what was proposed by the National Development Corporation either.</P>
    <P>I started out without any ideological prejudice against the agency, had the Minister been able to point to some process, product or function which it could usefully do.  But, since he has not done so, I am within my rights in regarding it <Col N="1136" /> as the twenty-fifth wheel of the State coach.  It is superfluous, redundant, expensive and was thrown out as an idea in the middle of an election campaign to scoop in a few votes, and that is all.  This country has a very complete battery, as complete as all the hardware that Deputy Power will be looking for money for, of State agencies with all kinds of functions. What is there in the powers of the Industrial Development Authority which disables it from engaging in the kind of thing which was foreseen for this agency?  Can it be that its statutory powers, the lengthy legislation on the Industrial Development Authority, are missing a couple of clauses which would enable it to engage in the functions, vague though they are, which the Minister outlined here this morning?  If so, why not amend that legislation? If the IDA are bursting to be let loose, except for the fact that subsection 3 (g) of section 14 of the Act inhibits them from doing so because of the Attorney General's reading of the clause, if they are bursting to get involved along with the private sector in something or other, why not bring a simple Bill in here to give them that power?  Are we to go through the entire pantomime of setting up a special State body with a budget and a chief executive and a chief executive's car, rather than simply amending and extending the existing legislation under which the IDA function?  Might the same not be said of the Industrial Credit Company on a more moderate or a less high profile level?</P>
    <P>At page 9 of his script the Minister referred to the development of projects &ldquo;involving the use of natural resources, for example, downstream value added projects based on agricultural, timber or marine based resources&rdquo;.  Where is the lack in our battery of semi-State agencies which prompts us to suppose that we need this agency merely to develop natural resources in downstream value-added industrial production?  Suppose that some new saleable product becomes identified as being capable of being produced from turf.  Have not Bord na Móna already got adequate statutory power to engage in that process?  It does not <Col N="1137" /> involve milled peat for electricity production, or anything like that.  They already turn out stuff for gardening, and God knows what else, and why cannot they keep on doing that?  What is to stop us from further developing that natural resource by the statutory agency that already exists?</P>
    <P>Was the Minister thinking of something in the food processing line?  Have not the Sugar Company got all the powers they need to engage in that, although not with very notable success to date?  Have not An Bord Bainne got powers of that kind?  Does the Minister want the agency to get into biomass production, for example? That can be a very valuable crop, I am told, on marginal land.  Have not Bord na Móna already got power to do that?  Not much longer than a year ago I saw the only biomass experiment of any size in the country being conducted on Bord na Móna land by Bord na Móna workers.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister want to get into early flowers for competition with the Scilly Islands, or orchids or other exotic blooms?  The ESB have already done that: They have been doing it on an experimental basis for years but I do not know if they have ever got beyond that point.  They have done it, very sensibly using the waste heat from their generating stations.</P>
    <P>Is it fish farming he wants to get into? The ESB do that too and have the power to do more of it, again using the surplus heat which, though it sounds very unappetising, is said to encourage the growth of fat fish.  It is a form of exploitation of peat and fish biology which is economically interesting.  Is it something to do with sea fish?  We have An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to do it.  Does he want to get alcohol from potatoes, as has been frequently suggested, or out of some other easily grown root crop, perhaps to produce some sort of fuel on which cars or other machinery might be driven?  We have Ceimicí Teoranta to do that for us. They were set up originally to do nothing else but that.</P>
    <P>I want to know what kind of projects involving natural resources the Minister <Col N="1138" /> has got in mind and why is the apparatus of this agency necessary to exploit them?</P>
    <P>On page 9 the Minister referred to &ldquo;projects having a substantial import substitution effect&rdquo;.  We have all been into import substitution for years.  Ever since I became an Opposition spokesman I have been asking questions about it, hearing about it, reading and writing scripts about it.  The IDA have been concentrating highly on this.  They circularise on it.  They have programmes in which they try to identify products now imported which could be manufactured here.  They may not have a whole section of their operations devoted to that but they have an element of their operations specifically oriented to encouraging industrual development based on import substitution.  What more can this agency do?</P>
    <P>The Minister does not need me to emphasise further what I have been saying. Having listened to his speech, I am sceptical.  I had hoped I would get an answer which I did not get when we were in Government.  I have not got an answer. I am sceptical about this thing, about pouring money down the drain, putting a sum of money which, contemptible though it may seem to Deputy Bermingham, I regard as a large sum of money, at the disposal of an agency which, to use a trendy word, will have no &ldquo;remit&rdquo; that I have been able to see in terms which would enable me to assess what the end product the agency are to take an interest in will be.</P>
    <P>On page 8 of the Minister's speech he paints on a broad canvass the object of the agency.  He told us this should facilitate more effective &ldquo;co-ordination&rdquo; of the work of the various State agencies involved in industrial promotion and development.  I would associate with that a reference from page 13 in which the Minister mentioned the IDA in connection with the National Enterprise Agency.  He said a representative of the Department of Industry and Energy is on the board of both bodies and this should reinforce &ldquo;liaison&rdquo; arrangements between them.</P>
    <P>Could we lay aside our party uniforms for a moment and would the Minister <Col N="1139" /> imagine that he and I are in the bar having a drink or out having a walk in the country, and could the two of us just sit back and have a good laugh at the idea of a country of this size, barely three million people, having so many barriers and distances between the various elements of the State aparatus that their activities have to be &ldquo;co-ordinated&rdquo;, that there has to be &ldquo;liaison&rdquo; between them, if you please?</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;liaison&rdquo; in modern usage &mdash; I am only saying this from the top of my head &mdash; goes back to the First World War when, because of ethnic and cultural differences, the Serbian Army had to have a liaison officer with the Belgians, or the Germans with the Bulgarians, or something of that sort.  There is every excuse for liaison there because people might have come to blows otherwise. Here we are talking about a limited number of officials, the important ones of whom all know each other by their first names.  They are well able to lift a phone and talk to one another.  They read the newspapers.  They all know what the others are doing and they are not so prodigal of the State's resources or so neglectful of their duties as to be deliberately going in for something that would wastefully duplicate what other agencies are doing.</P>
    <P>These scripts I see every other day from Ministers &mdash; the same was true of us &mdash; includes such things as &ldquo;to co-ordinate this&rdquo; or &ldquo;to identify that&rdquo;, to &ldquo;monitor&rdquo;, to &ldquo;evaluate&rdquo;, or &ldquo;to promote&rdquo;. This is all aimed at stringing out inordinately a series of simple intellectual functions which are natural to anybody engaged in ordinary business.  For instance, a shoemaker naturally co-ordinates this and that: he actually liaises with this and that, naturally identifies opportunities. It would never occur to him to put big words on them because they are natural, instinctive, an intuitive part of every business project and of every administrative project if it is being conducted properly.  It is ridiculous that we are to have a special agency of this kind to co-ordinate and set up a liaison, if you please, between Pat this and Tom that, both of whom were at school together <Col N="1140" /> and have known each other for 30 or 40 years, live in the same suburb, play golf with one another and, if they are not on friendly terms, they are well able to phone one another.  They are not at the same distance as the Bulgarians or the Serbians in 1914 or 1915.  We do not need an agency for liaison.  We are all in the same boat together and it has been springing many a leak, and if the boat sinks we will all go down.  We are all keen not to waste the State's money.  We are all keen to get value for what we put into projects.  That goes just as much, if not more in my experience, for public officials as it does for the rest of us, and they do not need a special agency to co-ordinate or liaise them.  If they are doing their job properly that would happen automatically.</P>
    <P>I want to end by putting to the Minister my suggestions for spending the £5 million, since he seems to have it to spend. I do not know where it is coming from. This is a Supplementary Estimate so I can only take it that we are going to be borrowing this £5 million.  It is not envisaged in the original Estimate; it is not envisaged in the budget arithmetic. Therefore it must be taken as topping up our deficit and must be coming from abroad.</P>
    <P>If we are going to borrow £5 million and we want to spend it productively I have a few ideas that do not involve any shiny new stainless steel authority or anything of that type.  I would put more money than I was able to put into the marketing effort of Coras Tráchtála.  I would enlarge the scheme, which I do not take personal credit for because it was not my idea but was given to me by somebody else and I was lucky enough to be able to pick up the ball and run with it, of temporary subsidisation of Irish firms that are not yet in the export marketing business, to enable them to recruit executives who are based abroad permanently or most of the time.  This time last year only about 30 Irish firms had full-time marketing executives abroad. Coras Tráchtála believe, and I believe with them, that that figure is disgracefully small.  If it were multiplied we would see <Col N="1141" /> a multipyling of Irish exports and consequently an increase in the employment dimension of Irish industrial production.</P>
    <P>I would use some of that £5 million to subsidise technical training in the directions here in which there are still many vacancies because people cannot be got to do the jobs as there are not enough people with the necessary training.  To go back to marketing for a moment, I would use it also to subsidise language training because we simply cannot expect to be able to sell products in countries through the medium of the language which we ourselves speak, a form of English.  It is true that it is foolishly said that in Germany or in Holland they all speak English.  Most of the people engaged in business there do speak it, after a fashion. But anyone speaking a foreign language, no matter how well he speaks it, is operating under a certain mental constraint in that he has to concentrate on the form of what he is saying as well as on the content. He is not as accessible to persuasion or taking an interest in something as he would be if the thing were made easy for him.  For an Irish firm to sell something abroad when it has not got a single member of the firm who is able to put ten words together in the language of the customer is crazy.  The Japanese do not behave like that; the Germans do not behave like that; the Dutch do not behave like that.  We are very backward in that regard for historical reasons.  It is not the Minister's fault or his party's fault, and it is not our fault.  The reasons lie back in the development of the patterns of middle class convent secondary schools, religious-run education in the nineteenth century.  I have no doubt that there are other factors as well.  But we are very backward here and I believe that money put into this &mdash; and it would not need to be a lot of money &mdash; would produce enormous dividends in terms of the force of the Irish marketing effort which is very much under-estimated.</P>
    <P>My other suggestion &mdash; and this is a pet theme of mine which I have mentioned before in the House &mdash; is to put some of that £5 million into trying to develop in an arbitrarily selected small number of pilot communities a total economic cooperative. <Col N="1142" /> Again it would not need to be a lot of money.  This is my own idea in which I have never been able to get anyone else to take much interest.  Although I tried very hard during the months we were in Government to do so I could never get a serious response quite along the lines I had in mind.  It is to try to find some way of selecting a very small number of pilot communities and provide a staff of advisers picked from the various specialised agencies we have, a tourist authority, an industrial development authority, a fishing authority and so forth, to go and live in these communities for a year or two and try to examine every aspect and dimension of the community's resources and try to bring it, by a combination of very small sums of subsidy and of ordinary human leadership, to the optimum condition that the few hundred or thousand people inhabiting that little bit of land are capable of bringing it.  That would operate as a kind of a flagship or beacon or token to the rest of the country of what could be done.  I do not disparage or decry the efforts and all the valuable and very important things that have been done by State agencies, but they are too widespread.  The little we have is too thinly spread and they are undermined even further by the Irish psychology which is poisoned by the atmosphere of competitive politics here whereby people are encouraged to look to the State to do everything and to themselves to do the minimum.</P>
    <P>That is what I would do if I had £5 million to spend.  There were things I could have done during the time we were in Government with a very small fraction of that money and I was not able to get it.  The Minister now has £5 million to play with and I would strongly advise him to put the money into modest unpretentious schemes of the kind I have been outlining and forget about an agency for which he has no concrete plans.  I want to give him a friendly warning, from man to man, that if he does not do that and if he presses ahead with his empty, vacuous agency, it is going to join the list of State-sponsored spooks of which we saw a few in the 1977-81 period.  It is going to belong to the same select, ignoble little <Col N="1143" /> group of which the founder members were the &ldquo;Employment Action Team&rdquo; which was disbanded within a matter of months, and the &ldquo;Sean Lemass-style Industrial Development Consortium&rdquo;, which we were promised in the 1977 manifesto but which, as I often said before, never had an address, never had premises, never had staff, never had a budget, never had even an office cat.  It did not even have a telephone number although there were conditions in the country then that might have explained that.  It existed only as a wraith in the building across in Kildare Street.  I called it the spook of Schoolhouse Lane.  That is what it was, the &ldquo;Seán Lemass-type Industrial Development Consortium&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not do this with any pleasure because we are all in this together and I feel we have had enough competitive politics where no serious ideology divides the sides, but I want to warn the Minister in a friendly sense and advise him that if he does not want to find himself with his tail between his legs in a years' time defending the waste of £5 million, he should remember those examples that have gone before, the &ldquo;Employment Action Team&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Sean Lemass-type Industrial Development Consortium&rdquo;. Slán beó leis an Industrial Development Consortium agus leis an Employment Action Team.  Why did they fail? Why did they amount to nothing?  They amounted to nothing because there were no plans for them and there was nothing serious they could do.  There was no product or project which was ever envisaged for them for which anybody would have paid a penny.  So too will this £5 million be wasted unless the Minister can think up a useful, concrete project for this agency or unless he devotes the money to humbler, more modest projects of the kind I have suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to be here today speaking on this Estimate but having read the Minister's speech I felt I had to forego my canvassing in Ballyfermot to come in here to make some comments. I referred in previous contributions to the unemployment problems in <Col N="1144" /> the greater Cork area.  There are serious doubts as to the future of one of the biggest employers in the Cork region.  I have studied with interest the activities of Irish Steel over the last number of years.  I looked with admiration at their efforts to become more competitive, particularly the modernisation programme they undertook.  This was initiated by the Coalition Government of 1973-77 when they committed themselves to a modernisation programme which would ensure continued production in Irish Steel.  That modernisation programme took place at great inconvenience to the staff.  Some of them were laid off.  We had been looking forward to their being re-employed in the near future. Some have already gone back and others are poised for re-employment.  It was hoped that production in the company would improve the unemployment situation in the Cork area.</P>
      <P>Unemployment in Cork has got out of control over the last few months.  The latest figure given by the Minister yesterday shows that 7,900 people are unemployed. In January the figure was 7,000 which means there has been a 13 per cent increase in unemployment in the first five months of this year.  That is a serious matter.  There is no point in stating the obvious if we do not have any solutions. The programmes embarked upon by the Government have done nothing to improve the situation in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Order of Business this morning, I asked the Taoiseach if funds would be provided for Cork which are badly needed to provide infrastructure and attract new industry to Cork.  If we do not get these funds we in Cork will be doomed to further years of unemployment. I was shocked by the Minister's speech which put a major question mark over the future of Irish Steel.  No matter how one reads it, it is obvious that the Government are providing an interim payment of £25 million to offset interest on loan charges.  This is a major drawback to the policies pursued by the Coalition in 1973-77.  It is contrary to statements made by spokesmen for the present administration during the last general election campaign in February.  We <Col N="1145" /> endured a vicious smear campaign regarding our unemployment record then and the present administration committed themselves to tackling this problem in Cork.  However, their record in office has not so far lived up to their promises.</P>

      <P>The activities of Irish Steel are just as important to the country as is Whitegate.  Doubts about the future of Irish Steel will have to be fought in the House.  I will watch the Minister very closely over the next few months on this issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech will have a demoralising effect on the staff involved who have endured uncertainty over the years.  The chairman's report for the year ended June 1981 praised the staff for their labour relations.  The company have undertaken a re-training programme. Now a new question mark hangs over their future.  I admit that output from the plant will not reach its maximum until four years after it has started.  However, this is an inopportune time to cast doubts on the future of the company.  I should like clarification from the Minister regarding the future of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett, Clare) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett, Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Clare)</i>: I thank Deputies who made contributions and showed concern for the company.  I was accused of spreading pessimism and creating a lack of confidence.  Is it not better to spell out the facts in the House as they exist regarding the concern of the board in Irish Steel and the employees about their future?  It would be dishonest to cover that up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A commitment was given in the early seventies regarding the setting up of a new plant but that did not get under way until 1978.  We are now in a situation in which we have a modern plant which compares favourably with the best in western Europe.  Had this not been done, no option would have been open to any Government but to close down the plant. Irish Steel would not have been able to compete in the market.  The new plant is <Col N="1146" /> capable of producing 84 different products if required and if the market is there for them.  This will give some idea of the scale and scope of the plant.</P>
    <P>The £25 million will be used to meet the company's immediate obligations and pay bills which must be paid before the end of May.  Marketing is the key to all the trouble.  The company's have difficulty in competing.  We hope that with the new executives and marketing personnel, one of whom has been marketing abroad for some time for British Steel, we will get a greater share of the market.  We depend on the export market.  Apart from our European colleagues who have modern type plants we must compete abroad with the Japanese, Koreans and Brazilians whose plants are not obsolete but are quite modern.  That is a measure of the competition we will face.</P>
    <P>The people who are putting up the £25 million, the taxpayers, should know exactly what they are paying for.  The same applies to people in the surrounding area, whether they are employees or executives.  They already know they are facing a tough fight.  That does not rule out the possibility of succeeding, equipped as they are now, and with the possibility of an improving market as the recession recedes, or as we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  There is a distinct possibility that the company will become viable, and that is why they will be reviewed again at the end of the year with a view to assessing viability.</P>
    <P>I said I hoped legislation will be introduced during this session which will give Irish Steel the capacity to increase their borrowing and equity.  By no means are we awaiting the fateful day.  We are taking steps to give the company a chance to become viable and build themselves into a proper position, and take back some of the people mentioned by Deputy Allen who were laid off and are hoping to get back again.  They are getting assistance and, in assisting them, surely we are giving them encouragement.  They now have more qualified people in the marketing field than they had in the past perhaps.  I do not know who they were.  Marketing is the key to success.</P>
    <P>A number of points were raised during <Col N="1147" /> the debate.  I have dealt with the depressing approach in my speech mentioned by Deputy Collins.  My speech was a factual statement.  The people of this nation are entitled to have the facts spelled out for them when we are spending £25 million as we are here.  On the question of the delays which led to increased costs of £8 million or thereabouts, in one firm there was an industrial dispute which lasted for eight months.  Irish Steel sought legal advice on suing or getting compensation for the delay.  The end result was that the firm invoked <i>force majeure</i> in their contract and there was no question of the company getting compensation.</P>

        <i>(Clare):</i> It was there.  Perhaps it would not have been as easy to get supplies if it was not in the contract. Perhaps that had a bearing on the other side.  Energy costs became a major problem in 1973-74 because of the rapidly increasing price of fuel.  Deputy Collins said it seemed to cost industry more here than in other countries.  We were over 80 per cent dependent on oil when the energy crisis came.  Many of our colleagues in the EEC were not as dependent as we were on it.  Some of them in north-western Europe already had natural gas, and other ways of providing energy.  We were forced into a corner.  In the past many of us spoke about the energy crisis between 1973 and 1977 so I need not go into that again.  Everyone is aware of it, including Deputy Collins, who was responsible for energy in the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Collins talked about using natural gas.  Already Irish Steel are using natural gas.  They are having consultations and discussion with An Bord Gáis about better terms.  On the question of aligning ourselves with Denmark, we have done this in the past when it was to <Col N="1148" /> our advantage.  As I said already, there is no question of the Government having said or implied that we were closing Irish Steel in a year.  The position will be reviewed and assessed properly in the light of prevailing conditions.  With regard to the other item in this Supplementary Estimate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It will apply most likely to those with annual turnovers of 6,000 tons of steel as against 12,000 tons.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> We are coming down halfway from 12,000 tons.  It looks as if the figure will be 6,000 tons in the near future.  The National Enterprise Agency is the other item for which we are seeking £250,000.  This was the cost of setting it up and recruiting certain people.  We are also seeking £5 million for capital investment in this enterprise agency.  For the development corporation, which was the proposed predecessor, a figure of £20 million was included in the previous Government's estimates. That £20 million could not have been spent by this corporation because it could not have got under way before mid-summer. The £5 million we are now providing to get the National Enterprise Agency on its feet, we believe, will be adequate for this year.  I said in my introductory remarks that if this amount was found to be inadequate we would give immediate consideration to the provision of more money for the agency.  Therefore, the question of skimping in the amount of £5 million does not arise if the other remarks I made about the agency are noted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I have not covered all of the points raised by Deputies I shall correspond with them.  The functions of the National Enterprise Agency were dwelt on by Deputy Kelly.  Those functions were spelled out in my speech this morning.  I might add that details of specific projects in which the agency will be involved are at present being worked out.  Of course I should say that the agency was left in cold storage during the period of office of the previous Government.  It is now being revived with all haste to endeavour to have the function for which it was intended originally fulfilled &mdash; mainly job creation.  The emphasis is on job creation with regard to this agency rather than <Col N="1150" /> them becoming involved in a supervisory role which would be much too time-consuming and might well affect the real possibilities of job creation.  There are already sufficient bodies in this country with a supervisory capacity.  Neither is there any question of a clash between their functions and those of the Industrial Development Authority because the IDA are a grant-giving development agency for new industry.</P>
    <P>I said specifically this morning that this new agency would involve themselves in joint ventures.  I might reiterate that, apart from the £5 million now being provided for the National Enterprise Agency and the promise of additional moneys being made available by the Government, if required, it is possible that funds will accrue to them by way of investment or from commercial profits in the course of their existence.  Deputy Kelly seemed to think it was a laugh to think that any private investor would invest in any project being undertaken or assisted by this agency.  I disagree with him there because I know of some of the most conservative people, farmers and others who have money to invest and who are seeking openings for such investment in the industrial area.  I would say that farmers are probably more conservative than are most industrialists.  Therefore there are people who will invest in such projects when they realise their potential.  I would not be as pessimistic as is Deputy Kelly.</P>
    <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate on this Supplementary Estimate.  It was introduced under two headings, Irish Steel and the National Enterprise Agency, which is being established in an additional effort to tackle the unemployment situation with which we are confronted and which it is the wish of all Members of this House should be tackled successfully.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £204,113,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1982, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including certain services administered by that Office; for the pay and expenses of the Defence Forces; and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Estimate for the year ending 31 December 1982, is for a net sum of £204,113,000 of which the sum of £146,813,000, or almost 72 per cent, is provided for pay and allowances.  The total provision for 1981 amounted to £171,976,000.  This Estimate, therefore, shows a net increase of £32,137,000 on the provision for last year.  Increased pay and allowances account for the sum of £4,975,000 and increased provisions for stores and equipment account for <Col N="1152" /> £21,215,000.  The balance of £5,947,000 is attributable to reduced receipts under Subhead Z &mdash; Appropriations in Aid &mdash; compared with 1981.  The Estimate provides for an average strength of 1,500 officers, 10 cadets and 13,600 other ranks &mdash; a total of 15,210 &mdash; in the Permanent Defence Force.  This Estimate does not provide for increases in pay under the recent agreement on pay in the Public Service.  Provision for the estimated cost of these increases of £13,946,000 will be made under the Vote for Remuneration.</P>
    <P>This is the first occasion on which I have come before the House to introduce the Estimates for Defence and Army Pensions following my appointment as Minister for Defence.  My regard for the Defence Forces will be known to many Members here and, of course, the largest military complex in the country &mdash; the Curragh Camp &mdash; lies within my constituency, which also houses Dún Mhig Aoidh Barracks in Kildare town and Devoy Barracks in Naas.</P>
    <P>I have already visited a number of barracks and posts and it is my intention to visit as many military installations as possible with a view to getting first-hand knowledge of the Forces including their tasks, the conditions under which they serve and their accommodation.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware very great demands have been made on the officers and men of the Defence Forces for many years past and their duties have been both heavy and varied.  As well as security duties, the Defence Forces have given community service in many ways &mdash; notably in search and rescue missions made by Air Corps aircraft and in the provision and maintenance of the air ambulance service conveying seriously injured persons to the hospitals most suited to their needs.</P>
    <P>In the blizzard conditions earlier this year, the Defence Forces provided the following services: (i) Air ambulance missions; (ii) Evacuation of civilians from snowbound areas; (iii) Delivery of food and medicines by air to isolated homes and communities; (iv) Back-up ambulance service with four-wheel-drive trucks; (v) Delivery of essential commodities such as oxygen and fuel to hospitals; <Col N="1153" /> (vi) Delivery of fodder to stranded livestock, and (vii) Road and street clearance.</P>
    <P>While the primary role of the Defence Forces is the defence of the State against external aggression, Deputies will be aware that over the past 13 years the Army have been heavily committed to aiding the civil power, which means, in effect, the rendering of assistance, when requested, to the Garda Síochána who have the primary responsibility for the maintenance or restoration of the public peace and for internal security.  This has involved the Defence Forces in patrolling, with the Garda, in the road network along the Border area; in the provision of military assistance at joint Garda/Army checkpoints; in the provision of escorts for explosives and blasting operations and in the provision of specialist personnel to deal with requests for bomb disposal.</P>
    <P>In addition, vital non-military installations have the protection of military guards or patrols, whilst the Defence Forces also supply military parties to escort civilian prisoners, cash in transit and to help in searches for arms or explosives.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, I am sure, join with me in congratulating all members of the forces including the First Line Reserve, FCA and Slua Muirí for the manner in which they have carried out their many tasks during the past year.</P>
    <P>The welfare, including pay and conditions of service, of the Defence Forces is the special care of Government.  It will be our constant concern that these conditions should adequately compensate those personnel who are bearing the brunt of the onerous responsibilities assigned to the Defence Forces.  All allowances, including those payable for duties of a security nature, are kept under review to ensure their adequacy.</P>
    <P>The terms of the first and second phases of the agreement on pay in the public service have been applied to the pay of all Defence Forces' personnel.  The first phase provided for an increase of 2 per cent, subject to a minimum of £4 per <Col N="1154" /> week, from 1 December 1981, while the increase under the second phase was 6 per cent from 1 March.  The third phase of the agreement will be due from 1 October next.</P>
    <P>The pay of a recruit is now £96.17 a week rising after about 14 weeks' basic training to £111.80.  On advancement to private three star, gross pay rises to £115.37 while, after three years' service, the gross pay of a private is over £125. The current rate of security duty allowance is £6.50 per day on which such duty is performed.  There is provision for an enhanced payment of £13 for duties undertaken on a Sunday or Army holiday. The rates of allowance for service in the Border area are £15.40 a week for officers and £13.30 a week for men.</P>
    <P>The strength of the Permanent Defence Force is almost 15,000 &mdash; its highest level since the demobilisation in 1946 following the Emergency.  This welcome development has eased considerably the burden of duties which lay heavily on the men when the strength of the force was lower.</P>
    <P>Because of this buoyancy in Permanent Defence Force strengths the necessity for the continued employment of FCA personnel on full-time security duties has been under review by my Department for some time.  Deputies will appreciate that the level of security duties to be undertaken and the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at any given time have a bearing on the extent to which the full-time employment of FCA personnel is necessary.  Because of the reduced requirement for the full-time services of FCA personnel additional members have not been called out on security duties for some time past and those who are released at their own request from such duties are not being replaced.  While this matter will, of necessity, be kept under review, I wish to emphasise that at present there are no proposals to release personnel currently employed on these duties other than at their own request. Indeed, the contribution of FCA members to the various tasks on which the Defence Forces have been engaged has been invaluable in recent years.</P>
    <P>As regards the recruitment of women <Col N="1155" /> into the Permanent Defence Force six cadetships were awarded to female personnel from the annual competition for cadetships held last year.  To date 11 female cadets have been commissioned and in addition three female officers have been appointed to fill vacancies in the Medical Corps.</P>
    <P>A total of 38 women who were enlisted for general service in June 1981 qualified as three star privates in October and were posted to appointments such as clerks, drivers and military police in the four commands.  Six women have been promoted to the rank of corporal in the Military Police Corps and a further three who are now undergoing the basic Military Police course will also be promoted on satisfactory completion of the course and the usual period of probation.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Permanent Defence Force make a significant contribution to the cause of international peace by participation in various United Nations forces.  Ireland's record of military support of United Nations peacekeeping operations goes back to 1958 when Irish officers first took up duty as observers in Lebanon.  We now have military personnel serving in three peacekeeping missions, which are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East (UNTSO) and the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). The strength of the contingent which has recently taken up duty in Lebanon is about 720 all ranks comprising the 51st Infantry Battalion, a Camp Command at UNIFIL headquarters and some personnel filling staff appointments at UNIFIL headquarters.  The strength of 720 all ranks represents an increase of 70 men on the previous contingent. This increase, as Deputies are probably aware, was provided at the request of the United Nations.  We can be very proud of the significant contribution that the Irish contingent is making, often in difficult and hazardous circumstances, to the cause of peace in Lebanon.</P>
    <P>Tragically, two Irish soldiers died <Col N="1156" /> during the past year or so while in service with the United Nations in Lebanon.  One died as a result of an accident and the other was killed at an observation post in April 1981 in a shooting incident with an unknown party of armed men.  A further soldier at the observation post has been missing since the incident and despite the best efforts of the United Nations he has not been located.  The search for him is continuing under the direction of the force commander.</P>
    <P>At present an Irish officer, Lieutenant-General William Callaghan, is the Force Commander of UNIFIL. This top military appointment was a compliment to the officer himself who has had long experience in United Nations service and was also an indication of the high standing of the Irish Defence Forces on United Nations missions.</P>
    <P>Twenty-one Irish officers are serving with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East while two officers and four non-commissioned officers are serving in staff appointments with the United Nations Force in Cyprus.  They are doing praiseworthy work in the cause of international peace and are a credit to their country.</P>
    <P>The many exacting demands on the Defence Forces render it imperative that personnel are trained to a high degree of efficiency.  A total of 81 officers are presently undergoing various full-time courses at third level educational institutions. The practice of assigning officers to such courses will be continued in 1982 to meet the requirements of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made to train executive branch cadets of the Naval Service in Ireland in future.  Heretofore such cadets have had to be assigned to courses abroad.  This training will be undertaken initially at the Cadet School in the Curragh but mainly at the naval base and on board Naval Service vessels. In addition it is planned to avail of certain specialist training at the Cork Regional Technical College.</P>
    <P>In 1978 a cadet scheme was introduced for the purpose of providing the Naval Service with qualified marine engineer officers.  Nine officers have been commissioned <Col N="1157" /> under the scheme to date and four of these will be fully qualified as marine engineers on completion of a course of training abroad later this year.  The remaining five officers will qualify in 1983.  In addition a further eight cadets appointed under the scheme in 1980 and 1981 are undergoing training; two of these will be commissioned this year and six in 1983.</P>
    <P>Members of the Permanent Defence Force who, in their own time, may attend approved second level and third level courses of education &mdash; for example intermediate and leaving certificate and degree courses &mdash; may be refunded and tuition and examination fees involved and, in certain circumstances, travelling expenses.</P>
    <P>Competitions for the award of apprenticeships in the Army, where there are 60 vacancies, and in the Air Corps, where there are 50 vacancies, are in progress at present.  The successful candidates will commence training in September 1982.</P>
    <P>As scheme exists whereby service personnel are registered with AnCO as apprentices in various trades such as fitter, motor mechanic, sheet metal worker, bricklayer, plasterer and painter-decorator. These personnel attend either full-time off-the-job training courses, day-release courses or block-release courses.</P>
    <P>In order that the level of knowledge and expertise may be kept in line with modern developments in other armies, and to provide for the efficient maintenance and operation of many sophisticated equipments in use in the Defence Forces, it is the practice to assign a number of personnel to courses of training in foreign military and civil establishments. It is anticipated that such courses will be undertaken in Britain, Holland, France and the United States during 1982.</P>
    <P>A potential officers course for selected non-commissioned personnel commenced at the Infantry School, Military College, last October.  Twenty-five non-commissioned officers drawn from each of the four commands and from the Air Corps and Naval Service were selected to undergo the course.  The course is of 12 <Col N="1158" /> months duration and the successful participants will be commissioned as officers later this year.  This course is one of the most heart-warming happenings in the Defence Forces and I am sure it will give as much personal satisfaction to the officers concerned as it gives to us.</P>
    <P>In addition three non-commissioned officers have been appointed to commissioned rank in the last year to fill specialist and technical appointments, two in the Naval Service and one in the Army School of Music.</P>
    <P>Competitions for the award of cadetships in the Army and in the executive branches of the Naval Service were conducted as usual in 1981.</P>
    <P>The numbers of cadetships awarded as a result of these competitions are as follows: Army, 52 including 6 women; Naval Service Executive Branch, 6; Naval Service Engineering Branch, 6; The successful candidates commenced training in November 1981.</P>
    <P>A new cadetship scheme is proposed leading to the appointment of riding officers in the Army Equitation School.  It is hoped to advertise the first competition under this scheme in the near future.</P>
    <P>Further competitions for Army, Air Corps and Naval Service cadetships will be held this year.  It is expected that the competition will be advertised in the near future.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the recruitment of suitable personnel at cadet and apprentice levels who will be trained to fill appointments in the Naval Service.  Apart from these, persons who already have the necessary qualifications are recruited where necessary.  In this regard competitions are held from time to time for engineer officers and executive branch officers.  A competition for engine room artificers, electrical artificers and shipwrights is at present in progress.</P>
    <P>With the expansion of the Naval Service in recent years the need has arisen to employ an increased number of civilians to look after the maintenance of the additional vessels purchased.  Difficulty had been experienced in recruiting suitable craftsmen with the special skills required in the naval dockyard.  In order to overcome this and to provide job <Col N="1159" /> opportunities for school leavers the Department introduced a civilian apprenticeship scheme under the auspices of AnCO.  To date 15 apprenticeships have been awarded.  This scheme will help keep alive and develop the traditional dockyard skills in the Cork Harbour area.</P>
    <P>The measures being taken will ensure that sufficient numbers of personnel will be available to permit the efficient operation of the expanding Naval Service.</P>
    <P>For some years past there has been a continuing and sustained improvement in the equipment and transport of the Defence Forces.  It is my intention that this trend should continue.  This year the provision for defensive equipment is £10,750,000.  Purchases include normal maintenance and replacement items and supplies of ammunition and also certain new up-to-date equipments which will enhance the capability of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Five armoured personnel carriers have been manufactured and supplied by Adtec Teoranta, Gibbstown, Co. Meath and a contract for five further personnel carriers was placed with the firm in June 1981.  These will incorporate certain modifications on the earlier design in the light of developments by the firm and of current military requirements.  A number of light tanks including four recently delivered are now held by the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The provision for mechanical transport is £3,180,000.  A steady programme of renewal of various types of vehicles &mdash; trucks, landrovers, station wagons, motorcycles, saloon cars, tipper trucks &mdash; has improved the transport situation considerably in recent years.  This year's Estimate provides for the purchase of further quantities of a variety of vehicles.</P>
    <P>Under subhead O.2 &mdash; Aircraft &mdash; provision is made for down-payments in respect of replacements for Alouette helicopters. In addition, provision is made for the purchase and installation of precision approach radar at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, to enable landings to be made there in conditions of poor visibility.  This is part of a programme to modernise the airport facilities <Col N="1160" /> at Baldonnel.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service is an integral part of the Defence Forces and in recent times a large expansion of the fleet and of the manpower of the service has been necessary.</P>
    <P>The new vessels provided, which were constructed in this country, were designed for all-weather fishery protection. With the resources at their disposal our naval personnel are doing a very good job in protecting the much enlarged exclusive fisheries area which the State has enjoyed since 1 January 1977.</P>
    <P>The capacity of the Naval Service to fulfil their role will be enhanced by the acquisition of a further fishery patrol vessel. This vessel which is new in concept and design will be constructed by Verolme Cork Dockyard with whom the contract was placed in April 1982.  The vessel will be delivered in 1984.  Provision of £9 million is made for this vessel in 1982 to meet the progress payments arising during the year.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention also that this new vessel will be capable of carrying and operating a helicopter.  In this connection it is proposed to purchase two twin-engined ship-borne helicopters which are capable of being stowed aboard the vessel. A sum of £1 million is being provided this year as a down-payment on these helicopters.  I take this opportunity to refer also to the valuable assistance being rendered by the Air Corps in the protection of our fisheries.  This is one of their many tasks and represents an important contribution to the protection service.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for the purchase of a small launch, a down-payment on a harbour passenger vessel and modifications of the patent slipway in the Naval Base, Haulbowline.  This slipway is used to enable work on the underwater portion of small vessels to be undertaken by the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>Given the many and increased tasks of the various arms of the Defence Forces it is essential that they be provided with the necessary supplies and equipment. The stores subheads of the Estimate reflect this need and it is the intention of the Government to ensure that, within the available resources, the stores and <Col N="1161" /> equipment essential for the proper development of the forces will be made available.</P>
    <P>A high priority will continue to be given to improving accommodation and facilities for the Defence Forces.  It is the intention to continue to replace unsuitable married quarters for non-commissioned officers and privates by modern housing and £575,000 is included this year for new quarters.  A scheme of 12 flats at Cathal Brugha Barracks, the first phase in the replacement of old married quarters at that barracks, is well under way. It is hoped to commence work this year on a further 37 houses at the Curragh Camp and planning is in hand also for the erection of new married quarters at Cathal Brugha Barracks and Collins Barracks, Cork.</P>
    <P>As regards the living accommodation of the single soldier a new billet building for 90 female soldiers has recently been completed at Ceannt Barracks, Curragh Camp, and a billet for 70 naval personnel has been completed at Haulbowline.  In other locations, existing billets continue to be improved, where practicable, by dividing large rooms into cubicles, the provision of individual bedhead lighting, installation of central heating and improvements to sanitary and ablution facilities.</P>
    <P>Extensive building works are planned for Casement Aerodrome to cater for the increased needs of the Air Corps.  Work is well advanced on an extension to the apprentices' hostel and it is anticipated that a contract for a new technical stores will be placed this year.  As with the Air Corps, the continuing development of the Naval Service will require extensive additional buildings and facilities.  Space for any future building at Haulbowline is, however, very limited.  Accordingly, a feasibility study was commissioned on the linking of Haulbowline and Spike Island by way of a new bridge.  The consultants' report has been received and site investigations are now proceeding as a necessary preliminary to completion of a detailed design.</P>
    <P>Building works in progress elsewhere include a cookhouse and dining hall at Finner Camp, a garage for motor transport <Col N="1162" /> at the apprentice school, Devoy Barracks Naas, and a new FCA headquarters at Portlaoise.  Work is expected to commence on a new sports pavilion in the Phoenix Park, Dublin and on the modernisation of the swimming pool at the Curragh Camp.  A number of other works projects are at the planning stage and will be advanced as quickly as possible.</P>

    <P>The Equitation School had a very successful year in 1981.  Army riders and horses competed in 18 international shows.  They won 12 first places, 13 second places, 17 third and 16 fourth places with a total of 122 places in international shows.  In addition, 45 provincial horse shows and gymkhanas were attended at home.  The total prize money won in 1981 was £43,000.  The world showjumping championships are being held in Dublin <Col N="1163" /> next month and I am hopeful that Army riders and horses will compete successfully in these championships.</P>
    <P>As regards the role and responsibilities of the Civil Defence organisation, this body &mdash; which is maintained at a very modest cost &mdash; is comprised largely of volunteer personnel who give of their own time and energies to further the objectives of Civil Defence.  Essentially these objectives are to generate and maintain an acceptable degree of protection and preparedness for the population at large in the broader context of national defence.  The development of Civil Defence to what it is today is due in large measure to the commitment and dedication of the volunteers and to the interest and support of the local authorities who are responsible for the organisation of the service at local level.  While Civil Defence activities are not such as to attract media headlines in the normal course of events, in times of emergency and crisis the volunteers perform with outstanding dedication and selflessness in the alleviation of distress.  Indeed, they did so quite recently, during the blizzard conditions last January, when they helped to meet the needs of people in difficulty in severely affected areas.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in subhead G for a net sum of £1.5 million for Civil Defence in 1982.  Amongst other things the provision will permit a modest advance in one area which needs urgent attention, namely, the commencement of a programme to replace stocks of obsolete radiation monitoring equipment.  As Civil Defence is the only organisation with a capability to warn and protect the population in the event of a radioactive fallout situation, whether caused by war or accidentally in peacetime, the desirability of this programme is self-evident.</P>
    <P>Civil Defence continues to enjoy the active and whole-hearted co-operation of the Irish Red Cross Society, the Order of Malta and the St. John Ambulance Brigade. I also express my appreciation of the contributions these voluntary aid societies have made and continue to make.</P>
    <P>The sail training vessel <i>Asgard II</i> which <Col N="1164" /> was commissioned in March 1981 completed a full programme of cruises for the 1981 season despite encountering a number of teething troubles which were inevitable with a new ship.  The vessel covered a total of 7,355 miles and visited many different ports and harbours in Ireland and abroad &mdash; 249 adults, 150 boys and 58 girls went to sea on the vessel.  There was a waiting list for cruises during the summer months.  The highlight of the season was the participation of <i>Asgard II</i> in her first international tall ships race organised by the Sail Training Association in July last.  The race was from Great Yarmouth to Ostend.  <i>Asgard II</i> was the winner in her class and was also declared the overall winner.  This was a tremendous achievement in the vessel's first season and is a great tribute to her builders, Messrs. John Tyrrell and Sons Ltd. of Arklow, and to the dedication and commitment of her crew.  The young people on board played their full part in securing this splendid victory.  <i>Asgard II</i> is carrying out another full programme of cruises this year and will be competing in an international race of sail training vessels from Vigo in Northern Spain to Southampton in August next.</P>
    <P>In the short period since I have assumed responsibility for the Department of Defence I have come to realise that very important changes and improvements have been achieved in the Defence Forces over the past decade. While the developments affecting all aspects of the forces &mdash; manpower, including the introduction of women to military life, equipment, transport, aircraft, Naval Service vessels and accommodation &mdash; have been significant, much remains to be done.  I intend to establish what the priorities should now be.  It is clear that accommodation presents a major task and this is to be expected considering that many of the barracks and posts are very old.  I would welcome the views of the House on all things impinging on the Defence Forces and for my part I will be prepared to give full and detailed consideration to any views expressed when it comes to formulating plans in the future.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Army Pensions Estimate <Col N="1165" /> which for the year ending 31 December 1982 is for a net sum of £31,111,000.  The net figure for the year ended 31 December 1981, including a Supplementary Estimate of £1,090,000, was £26,690,000.  The net increase for 1982 is therefore £4,421,000.</P>
    <P>The increase in the Estimate arises mainly from increases in pensions granted during 1981.  Most of these increases were effective from 1 July 1981 and applied to the latter half of that year. They apply, of course, to the full year 1982.  The Estimate does not, however, reflect increases arising from the current agreement on pay in the public service, nor does it include the cost of the further benefits in respect of veterans of the War of Independence announced in the 1982 Budget Statement.  The total cost of these additions, which is estimated at £1,984,000 will be provided for in the global Vote for Remuneration.</P>
    <P>The main increases in the Estimate are: £1,332,000 in subhead C - allowances and gratuities to dependants, etc; £250,000 in subhead D - military service pensions; £2,310,000 in subhead E.1 - Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes; £108,000 in subhead G - special allowances; £249,200 in Subhead L - grants in respect of the provision of free travel, free electricity, free television and free telephone rental allowance for certain veterans of the War of Independence, etc.</P>
    <P>The larger increases in terms of cost occur in subhead C - allowances and gratuities to dependents, etc., and in subhead E.1 - Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes.  In both of these subheads, the numbers of persons involved are rising. In the case of subhead C there is an increase in the number of widows of veterans of the War of Independence who are in receipt of allowances and in the case of subhead E.1 there is an increase in the number of ex-members of the Defence Forces of retired pay and on pension.  There is also a substantial increase in subhead L - grants in respect of the provision of free travel, free electricity, free television and free telephone rental allowance for certain veterans of the War of Independence, and so on. <Col N="1166" /> This reflects the rising costs to my Department of these concessions.</P>
    <P>As regards subheads D and G, the number of military service pensioners on pay is now somewhat less than 2,200 and there are about 4,600 veterans in receipt of special allowances, representing a fall of about 350 and 600, respectively, in numbers over the past 12 months. Despite the fall in numbers, however, the provisions under both subheads show rises which reflect the increases granted in these pensions and allowances.</P>
    <P>I commend both Estimates to the favourable consideration of the House. If Deputies require more information on any point I shall be glad to supply it when replying to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, at the outset, to avail of the opportunity of congratulating the Minister on his appointment as Minister for Defence and wish him every success in his term of Office, whether it be long or short.  I sincerely hope that some items mentioned in his Estimate speech today will be handled with the vigour, determination and dedication necessary for a Minister in Government. On behalf of my party and myself I pay tribute to the Defence Forces at home and abroad.  Firstly, I pay tribute to those playing an international role, the most important, most difficult, most dangerous, and most hazardous task with which they are confronted in maintaining world peace.  Very often the role which they have played in this important sphere is not altogether appreciated by Governments and the public as a whole.  We have recently seen tragedies in the Lebanon and elsewhere and watched the contribution our forces have made towards keeping world powers apart and maintaining world peace.  This is a very noble cause and no words of mine would be sufficient adequately to pay tribute to them in that very important role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer equally to our forces at home, particularly in regard to recent years.  The tasks which they have been asked to perform have been very far beyond the call of duty.  Over the past few years they have been described in this House as binmen, postmen and bank men.  They <Col N="1167" /> have ensured the protection of the security of the State.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling abroad and amongst politicians that the Minister of Defence, no matter who he may be, occupies the last post in the Cabinet before one becomes redundant, or passes on to the backbenches.  That was particularly headlined in the media when the Minister's predecessor and his party colleagues were appointed.  I say, not because I have been Defence spokesman for some time, that it is a very important post, a very important Ministry.  For that reason, it should be so treated.</P>
    <P>During my term as spokesman for Defence for the Fine Gael Party I had reason to thank the then Minister and officials in the Department for the great co-operation and courtesy extended to me in that time, for any required assistance given and replies received in great detail to any questions which I put down. I have not troubled the Department that much over the last few months because I had a responsibility elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is only right to claim that the previous Government took a part in the provision of the framework for this Estimate. It is very interesting to note that in the Estimate for 1980, as the Minister has mentioned, the total was £144 million.  In 1981 the Estimate produced by Fianna Fáil under the January budget was completely underestimated and the Coalition Government had to introduce a Supplementary Estimate later in the year, to the tune of £28 million.  As is known now, none of the Estimates was adequately provided for in that January budget, particularly in relation to Defence where there was a shortfall of £28 million for that year.  The details were very adequately described by the then Minister for Defence, Mr. Tully, who is no longer a Member of this House.  The present Estimate of £204 million means a 19 per cent increase over that Estimate, including the Supplementary Estimate which had to be introduced, as I have said.  This is an improvement and makes proper, honest and adequate provision for the Estimates for the current year.  I welcome this improved Estimate and commend it <Col N="1168" /> to the House.  It is, of course, necessary to make the financial resources available to this Department, but that is not the only factor.  The Minister must have determination and there must be a demand from within his Government for a share for his Department of the available capital, to ensure that the problems which he has mentioned are tackled and that there will be no let-up until such time as those problems are resolved.</P>
    <P>In following the Minister's speech line by line, I could say that I have heard it all before from Ministers introducing Estimates and replying to questions in this House.  Reading that Estimate <i>in toto</i>, one could say that we are on the right road.  However, I would refer the Minister back to 1979, when a Minister in his Department, Deputy Molloy, introduced an Estimate here.  He spoke about accommodation and married quarters in some of our military barracks and said he was going to demolish all the houses that were there and start immediately, with particular reference to Cathal Brugha barracks, to provide proper housing accommodation.  To date not even a sod has been turned.</P>

      <P>Every application for assistance under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme is dealt with on its merits, having regard to the circumstances of the person concerned.

      <P>An appeals officer recently decided that the person concerned is entitled to pension at the rate of £47.05 per week.

An increase of pension is not payable in respect of a son who is over 18 years of age.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reasons for the undue delay in granting occupational injuries benefit to a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit in respect of an accident at work on 9 November 1981.  Normally in such cases payment of disability benefit is made pending inquiries as to the nature and origin of the incapacity.  In this case, however, the claimant had no RSI number and it was necessary to contact his employer so that the contributions paid in respect of him could be identified and credited to him.  On completion of the inquiries, payment of disability benefit was made from 13 November 1981, fourth day of incapacity.</P>
      <P>It has also been accepted that the incapacity arose out of and in the course of his employment and payment of injury benefit has been allowed in respect of the period from 9 November 1981 to 8 May 1982, when his entitlement to injury benefit ceased on the expiration of 26 weeks from the date of the accident.  An adjusting payment, representing the difference between the rate of injury benefit to which he was entitled and the amount advanced by way of disability benefit, has now been made.  Further payments will be made on receipt of medical evidence of incapacity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that from November 1981 to the present time, when payment was made, was an inordinately long time for any married man with a wife and dependent children to wait for payment of benefit to which he was entitled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. The reason was that the person concerned did not have an RSI number and, technically, was not qualified to receive any benefit.  He would have qualified for supplementary welfare benefit.  The Department investigated the claim and ultimately discovered that the employer, without specifying the employee, &mdash; in other words, on an emergency basis &mdash; had paid in contributions in the meantime. Obviously there is some problem there.  When the Department were satisfied that these payments had been made, they then had to set up an RSI number for him.  He has now got an RSI number and has been given credits for the payments which, up to that time, had not been received by the Department in respect of him.  It is a complicated case where, in effect, there was a defect, but it should not have taken as long as it did.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will grant a contributory old age pension to a person (details supplied) in County Dublin; and why no such pension has been granted and paid to the applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned attained age 66 years on 26 March 1982 and claimed old age contributory pension from my Department.  One of the conditions for the receipt of old age contributory pension requires a person to have a yearly average of not less than 20 contributions in order to qualify.  The yearly average is calculated over the period from 5 January 1953 or year of entry into insurance, if later, to the end of the contribution year immediately preceding the one in which he attains pension age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1172" /> My Department's records show that the person concerned had contributions paid in respect of his employment in 1953 and, therefore, his yearly average must be calculated from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1981.  In that period he had a total of 375 contributions which is equal to a yearly average of 13 contributions. Accordingly, he is not qualified for an old age contributory pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I have the exact number but that is the nature of the problem.  The small number paid over that period while he was out of insurance cover is the cause of the difficulty and this is the position as the law stands at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, could I draw his attention to the fact that the sole reason this applicant was regarded as in insurable employment in 1953 was because he obtained a retrospective award of wages and that the Department regarded that award as applying purely to the period from March 1953.  Could the Minister confirm that, if no insurance contributions had been made by this applicant in 1953, he would qualify for a contributory pension on the basis of all the contributions made since 1974?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to get the exact number of contributions in that period, but from what the Deputy says that seems to be correct.  In March 1953 his salary was increased to £638 with effect from 1 September 1952.  At about that time a test case regarding retrospective awards of salaries to non-manual workers was decided by the chief appeals officer.  After consultation it was decided that these cases were included as income and, consequently, it was included at that <Col N="1173" /> time.  In effect, there were only ten in the period from 1953 until he re-entered in 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that it is totally unjust that because ten contributions were paid in 1953 this man has been deprived of old age contributory pension, when if no contributions had been paid in 1953 he would be entitled to a non-contributory pension? Would the Minister confirm that the ruling he referred to by a deciding officer away back in 1953 in fact has no legal standing under the Social Welfare Acts, that it was purely an administrative decision? Would the Minister indicate the legal position under the old Act of 1952 or under the Consolidation Act?  I want clarification.  I am not trying to be antagonistic or unhelpful but a gross injustice has been done to this man not because of the Minister but because of an administrative problem.  The point I am making is that in 1953 when neither the Minister nor I was in the House &mdash; we were not very long in the world &mdash; a ministerial decision was made which resulted in this man having to make ten social welfare contributions.  It was an administrative matter uncontested by him.  Until 1974 he was not regarded as being in insurable employment.  From 1974 when the legislation was changed, he was in insurable employment and he paid contributions. If it had not been for the ten contributions which the Department made him liable for in 1953 he would now automatically qualify for pension.  In the light of legislation, I contend he should not have been required to make ten contributions in 1953.  Because of that, would the Minister review the position and in the light of the justice of the case take the necessary steps to provide this man with a pension?</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 27 January 1982 to 1 March 1982 after which date he resumed work, and has been paid all benefit due in respect of this period at the maximum appropriate rate.</P>
      <P>The delay in payment was due mainly to the fact that the medical certificates were submitted by the claimant at irregular intervals.  For instance, the three certificates dated 3, 10 and 11 February were received together on 15 February and payment thereon was made on 17 February 1982.  The certificates dated 17, 24 February and 3 March were received together on 9 March 1982 and payment was issued on 18 March.  In addition, the claim form giving details of his wife and children were received on 22 February, and the adjusting payments due were issued on 1 March and 2 March 1982.  The final adjusting payment, however, did not issue until 4 May 1982 after inquiries regarding the nature and origin of his incapacity had been completed.</P>

However, if the certificates come in at irregular intervals, in groups of three covering a period &mdash; in the first instance it was not stated clearly on the certificate that dependants were involved &mdash; it is made difficult for the Department to get all the payments made specifically and exactly.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit in respect of an accident at work on 18 January 1982.  Normally, in such cases payment of disability benefit is allowed pending inquiries as to the nature and origin of the accident but as the claimant had fewer than the required minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited in the 1980-81 contribution year she was not qualified for such payment.</P>
      <P>On completion of the inquiries regarding the occupational injury, payment of injury benefit was authorised from 18 January 1982 and arrears of injury benefit due, less an amount refunded to the South-Eastern Health Board in respect of supplementary welfare allowance advanced, was issued to the claimant on 21 April 1982.  Payment of injury benefit has continued and all benefit due to 6 May 1982 has been paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, the written reply procedure would cover that situation.  The problem in this case is that there are no contribution conditions for occupational injury whereas there are for disability benefit and the only alternative was to provide supplementary allowances. I accept that that can be slightly confusing when it occurs because it is not normal.  But if one does not have contributions in for disability one does not get disability benefit.  That was the case here. But one can be entitled to occupational injury benefit without any contribution conditions.  The fact that one is working and has an accident at work means one can get occupational injury benefit. There is a different process of establishing that there was an injury and that it happened at work.  In that sense it is a slightly unusual situation and the only other remedy was supplementary welfare in the interim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether in view of (i) the ESRI report authored by Mr. Gerald Hughes and published earlier this year, (ii) the report by Dr. Andrew Rynne, published on 16 April 1982 in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> and (iii) the views expressed by the Federated Union of Employers and the Construction Industry Federtion that the social welfare system was being abused and was in certain cases a major disincentive to work, he considers that steps should be taken to eliminate any such disincentives; if so, the steps, if any, he proposes to take; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the reports referred to and of the views expressed regarding abuse of the social welfare system and the alleged disincentive effects of certain benefits.  The disability and unemployment benefit schemes are designed to afford a reasonable degree of income replacement on the occurrence of sickness or unemployment.  These necessary social provisions can only operate <Col N="1178" /> fully effectively when they are treated in a responsible way by workers, employers and the medical profession alike.  I am concerned that the system should not be abused and I have taken a number of positive steps to prevent possible abuse. I believe that the best way to combat abuse is through better management of the system and more effective operation of the controls which the system contains.</P>
      <P>I had a meeting recently with representatives of the Federated Union of Employers and the Construction Industry Federation at which views were put forward in relation to these matters. These views, together with the reports referred to by the Deputy, are under examination in my Department with a view to seeing what further action in this area might be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that he proposed to take certain specific steps.  What are they?  Is the Minister satisfied that there is some truth in the allegations made, particularly in Dr. Rynne's report, because if there is not they should be denied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Dr. Rynne's allegations were denied on the day by some of the very senior medical people who are quite experienced in the area.  So there is a slight difference of opinion even at the medical level.  In regard to steps to be taken, I said I had taken some steps and am considering further steps.  Some of the steps involved the setting up of a special investigating unit on unemployment benefit.  It has been working since a predecessor of mine, the present Taoiseach, set it up in 1978 and we are reviewing the operation of its work to ensure that if it is necessary further staff will be provided in the unit.  We have increased the liaison with the National Manpower Service to match vacancies with unemployment benefit claims.  That is another aspect of the unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was here previously I increased the medical referees from nine to 15 and I had the intention and the clearance to appoint further medical referees.  The effect of that was to reduce disability benefit claims by 4,000 a week consistently <Col N="1179" /> over a period.  At different times of the year there is a different pattern but the reduction was consistent.  Consequently on that basis we are at present appointing a further four medical referees. These have been agreed notwithstanding the embargo and so on because in relation to points made by Dr. Rynne and others the only way to deal with them is through the medical referee system. Employers, various commentators and Dáil Deputies may have views but it is a medical matter as to whether somebody is sick or not and we have found that the medical referee system has worked well and we are increasing that at the moment.</P>
    <P>A number of other steps were taken in regard to the three waiting days.  There were previously three waiting days for each claim and there are things called link claims which mean that one does not lose three days if one has another claim within 13 weeks.  Very positive steps have been taken in terms of good management and trying to improve the management. I am prepared to take steps that are practical in that respect provided it is accepted that it is my duty to provide the beneficiary with the benefits&mdash;and Deputies will query me on these anyway if they are not provided in time&mdash;and it is the beneficiary's right to have the benefits. As long as that is accepted I am prepared to look at abuses outside that and to take measures that are practical within that context.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the report by Gerald Hughes.  There is a difference of opinion between Gerald Hughes and Dr. Andrew Rynne.  The whole area is one about which we are concerned.  I accept the urgency and importance of providing further remedies provided it is accepted that these are benefits and we are looking for abuses rather than trying to affect the normal worker's benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me first assure the Minister that I accept the point he makes that nobody is trying to deny someone who is entitled to the benefit.  This is the important thing.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the heavy burden of PRSI that people are complaining about at <Col N="1180" /> present.  Would the Minister regard the provision of an additional four referee doctors as sufficient given the recommendation by Dr. Rynne that 50 additional referee doctors be provided, at least for a couple or years to get the situation under control?  Are the 15 referee doctors who now exist full-time or part-time?  In view of the considerable level of abuse does the Minister consider that, as Dr. Andrew Rynne recommended, as the ESRI recommended and as previous Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance recommended, consideration should be given to the proposals to tax or allow to be considered for tax, income from short-term social welfare benefits as income from long-term social welfare benefits are subject to tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance I want to be clear that I do not believe that there is the widescale abuse that is suggested by some of the correspondents, including Dr. Rynne.  In terms of the increase of four, at the moment that will be adequate and we will keep the matter under review.  On the other hand, the ESRI report tentatively estimated that the level of unjustified claims for disability benefit was about 9 per cent.  That differs very much from Dr. Rynne's estimate.  The ESRI report concluded that the evidence available on the operation of the social certification and referral scheme indicated that the great majority of claimants are genuinely ill and that malingerers can be identified and prevented from getting benefits to which they are not entitled. So I certainly find that report somewhat closer to the actual position.  The great majority of claimants are genuinely ill. Many of these make claims which do not recur for a long time.  That is what the scheme is about and that is why it is there. It is in that context that the measures should be taken.</P>
      <P>On the question of the medical referees generally we have a permanent scheme. In fact, while I was here previously I introduced a proper salary scale, the lack of which was a reason we could not get medical referees.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>These posts are open to be full-time.  I would have to go into each one.  There are not always medical people available immediately to fill all those posts on a full-time basis and the whole purpose of getting a full salary scale was that it would then be possible to have people on a full-time basis in full-time posts which are properly remunerated. Because of the historical nature of these posts, some may still be occupied on a part-time basis but the way is clear for the full-time filling of those posts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that in view of the fact that in the years 1976-79 only 46 prosecutions took place against those employees who are alleged to be defrauding the Department of Social Welfare that in relation to the number of people in receipt of social welfare benefits that would indicate that a very tiny percentage of people are involved?  Could the Minister also indicate what steps he proposes to take against employers who are defrauding the Department by withholding payments of contributions which they had taken from their employees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The point the Deputy makes is a fair one.  We have had considerable difficulty with employers in relation to the receipt of contributions. That came very much to light with the introduction of PRSI.  From January 1981 the governing contribution year was the first year of paying PRSI to the Revenue Commissioners.  A substantial number of employers were found not to be making returns.  The system, through PRSI, has ensured that there is better liaison and there is some assurance of employers making contributions.  I agree that the number prosecuted is very small, relative to the number of workers.  Amounts of money can be more substantial than the numbers prosecuted would indicate.  For a prosecution there must be a cast iron case with technical evidence and so on. The number of people who return money is much greater.  Investigations produce <Col N="1182" /> people who receive money they are not entitled to but who have returned it.  I agree that the numbers are small.  There are other aspects which have a general effect.  For instance, if one is on unemployment benefit one may have reimbursements of tax and so on, and this can make it somewhat less attractive to go back to work immediately.  That is a problem.  The Deputy raised the question of taxation.  I was opposed to the taxation procedure put forward.  It was against the principle I enunciated earlier that a person has a right to benefit.  It meant deducting 20 per cent from the benefit before one got it and then one had to go to the Revenue Commissioners to see if one could claim it back.</P>

      <P>As regards the second question asked by the Deputy, I also regret that it is not possible to make arrangements on the lines suggested by him.  It is however the intention of my Department to provide a new employment exchange in the proposed new Tallaght Town Centre.  As this may take some time, arrangements are being made as a matter of urgency to secure premises on a temporary basis in Tallaght for use as an employment exchange until long-term arrangements are completed.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>I agree, but the Deputy seems to have misheard my reply.  There are no funds in my Department for such allocations.  The Department of Social Welfare do not deal with that matter.  It comes under the Department of Health. I agree that the Tallaght Welfare Society are doing excellent work and that this should be encouraged within the community. The National Social Services Board, I understand, have given a grant of £1,600 to the welfare society towards their annual operating costs, which, I appreciate, are substantially greater. There are many community organisations and if money was given through the Department of Social Welfare there would be a situation where the Department of Health would deal with it on one hand and the Department of Social Welfare would deal with it on the other.  I hope to bring a Bill for a National Community Development Agency before the House shortly.  It is from this source I envisage more money being made available for groups such as the Tallaght Welfare Society.  They should not have any great difficulty in that respect since they are already funded under the National Social Services Board.</P>

Is the Minister aware that there is a major problem in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in the processing of these types of complaints?  I have been told that there are delays of between five and six months.  Will the Minister have discussions with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs with a view to eliminating this unnecessary stress which is caused to people such as old age pensioners in particular?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We do that normally.  We have done in this case.  We have stressed the general problem which arises.  Previously I did something about delays in the delivery of non-contributory old age pensions to farmers whose land had been transferred.  All the practical details had been gone through, but the legal stamping did not come through for 18 months or two years and there were long delays. I recognised that, if there was agreement, in 99.9 per cent of the cases nothing would be lost to the State by changing the procedure, which we did at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a disability benefit cheque was lost or stolen, the person had to wait until the Fraud Squad investigated it.  I introduced a scheme whereby the person could sign a document saying he had not received it and that to his knowledge no one in his house had received it, and on that basis the person could be paid after a week. That has worked satisfactorily.  That is the way I intend to approach this matter &mdash; to arrange that the same kind of procedure would apply where there was a loss in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs <Col N="1187" /> or the Department of Social Welfare. I think that would meet the Deputy's requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Power) Patrick Power">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department indicated to the Department of the Environment prior to the public announcement regarding the project that they had no objection in principle to the project subject to the satisfactory resolution of certain technical matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <P>Could I ask the Minister what these technical matters are?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department are concerned that a protected area order could possibly be made to effect the control of any building activity or to impose conditions in the case of buildings which were being constructed in the vicinity of Baldonnel Aerodrome.  We have Aer Rianta as consultants on that matter.  Our only consideration is about planning applications which might affect the use of the aerodrome in the approach area.  It was felt that on this site no building should be erected in the approach area which would affect the use of the aerodrome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Minister is aware that the proposed waste disposal centre, as it is described, will involve buildings.  Toxic materials will be coming and going on a constant basis to and from this toxic waste centre.  Some of these materials could be potentially dangerous and potentially gaseous.  In the event of an accident this might possibly have an effect on the installations at Baldonnel. Has the Minister considered that aspect of the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department are solely concerned with the use of the aerodrome as an aerodrome.  We were concerned about the projected centre for industrial <Col N="1188" /> waste.  The conditions we looked for were: the location of the buildings on the site &mdash; the site is a pretty large one &mdash; that no buildings would be erected on certain portions of the site; the height of the buildings; the provision of aeronautical obstruction lights on the tallest building on the site; and the control of emission of smoke, and so on, from any chimney stacks.  Having weighed up all those things, we would not be involved in the activities on the site, apart from how they would affect the use of the aerodrome.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister tell me if there was a demand for a change in the system of promotion?  Prior to a couple of years ago, promotion was based on seniority.  Due to the fact that there is actual concern in the Army, would it not be advisable to return to the system of promotion which applied previously in the Army?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>In his question the Deputy used the words &ldquo;dismay and concern&rdquo; about promotion.  I am sure there is always disappointment when someone is not promoted.  Everybody who enlists in the Army will not get to the top.  While seniority and length of service are important factors in determining promotion, other matters such as suitability would enter into it too.  I assure the Deputy that seniority and length of service weight quite heavily in any promotion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that none of the female members of the armed forces will have the necessary length of service or seniority, would the Minister consider introducing an outlet whereby female members of the forces could reach the top ranks?  At the <Col N="1189" /> moment, if we are to depend on seniority and length of service, we have no hope of seeing a woman general or a woman colonel, and I do not see why we should not have them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it was only recently female members came into the forces.  The question of their seniority or promotion would not have arisen as yet.  I will have a special look at what the Deputy said.  I am positive that, by the time it becomes a problem, a framework will have been set up which will allow for promotion for female members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if an order was issued by the Chief of Staff to members of the Defence Forces not to contact Deputies on any matter; and, if this is the case, the reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>On 5 February 1982 a directive was issued by the military authorities to the effect that all units should promulgate the contents of paragraph 27 of General Routine Orders 43 of 1955, which forbids members of the Defence Forces communicating with, <i>inter alia</i>, Members of Dáil Éireann in relation to service matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this directive issued by the Chief of Staff is being interpreted by certain members of the armed forces as meaning, for instance, that a soldier living in bad housing accommodation could not contact a Member of Dáil Éireann and ask him to intervene with the housing authority? Have the Army something to hide if they do not want to allow ordinary soldiers to contact Dáil Deputies, their elected representatives, with complaints about bad housing and other matters unrelated to military or State secrets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is probably aware that in a case of bad housing the normal procedure used is that the wife of the soldier approaches a Dáil Deputy <Col N="1190" /> seeking redress.  The matters involved in this directive related specifically to the Army, including promotions, transfers, service abroad and so on.  There is redress for matters relating to married quarters or bad accomodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Army are not unionised and have not got a representative body to speak for them about their complaints, would the Minister not agree that they should be able to talk to their elected representatives? Is it not time to review that rule?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have a look at what the Deputy said.  As Army regulations stand at the moment, and since discipline, promotion and other matters are involved, to change a system which has worked pretty well since the foundation of the State could present difficulties and allow for considerable abuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that we are now living in the 20th century, and the fact the armed forces have not got a trade union movement to represent their interests, surely the Minister would agree that an aggrieved member of the armed forces should have the right to contact his public representative to intervene for him without being militarily reprimanded?  On one occasion in my experience a soldier had not been paid wages for three weeks simply because somebody did not want to process it.  Of course, it was subsequently sorted out with the Department of Defence.  Would the Minister not agree that, in matters like that, a member of the armed forces should have the right to contact a public representative?  In view of the fact that the Minister is the member of the Government of this State responsible for those armed forces, I am asking him to direct the Chief of Staff to withdraw or certainly to modify that directive in the areas I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The system has existed under which any member of the Defence Forces who feels he has been wronged in any way can have his wrongs redressed. As Minister for Defence, I would be very <Col N="1191" /> conscious of the need to ensure that every person, from the rank of private upwards, should have some method available to him to have his problems resolved.  I shall deal with that.  I shall bring what the Deputy has said to the notice of the Chief of Staff and discuss the matter with him.  If the Deputy feels he would like to contact me in connection with such matters as, for instance, somebody not having been paid for three weeks, perhaps he would come into my office and we can have a chat about it.</P>

      <P>While the Minister is doing that &mdash; and I am grateful for the Minister's last assurance &mdash; would he also ask the Chief of Staff to define somewhat more clearly than has been done to date just what matters are subject to the order he has just read out, because it appears in a number of cases that members of the armed forces interpret the rules communicated to them as being a blanket ban on any contact with elected representatives? Would the Minister also ensure that matters which are not strictly within the province of military discipline and military secrecy are specifically identified as being matters in respect of which members of the armed forces have a right to contact their public representatives&mdash;for example, that matters such as the participation of serving members in training or educational courses would be clearly set out as matters on which they would enjoy the same rights of representation and the same access to public representatives as every other citizen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the reason the facilities afforded to members of the Defence Forces in relation to the free supply of drugs on medical prescription cannot be availed of in ordinary retail pharmacies but can only be dispensed at designated pharmacies in Army barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>When a member of the Permanent Defence Force living a long distance from a military post is attended to by a civilian doctor, medicines prescribed by the doctor may be obtained at any retail pharmacy.</P>
      <P>In the case of long-term continuing treatment or repeat prescriptions, the member is expected, in the interests of economy, to obtain his medication from Army sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister regard as being a long distance from a post?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume members of the <Col N="1196" /> Defence Forces would normally report sick in barracks.  If their home is in the neighbourhood of a barracks they are attended to by Army medical officers. Where the officers concerned consider that that distance is beyond their capacity to give them personal attention, sick members would then deal with a civilian doctor.  I suppose it differs from place to place.  Probably something like 20 miles &mdash;but that is just a throwaway figure that might differ from place to place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so much the question of the doctors with which I am concerned as the requirement for members of the forces to go to the post pharmacy. Would the Minister agree that there are many cases &mdash; particularly where a member of the Defence Forces may be unable to travel and whose wife or husband must then go to the pharmacy to get the medication required &mdash; where this constitutes an imposition on those members not imposed on other members of the public? Would the Minister agree further that where a prescription is issued in the normal course of events and vouched for by the medical doctor at the post, that could be accepted in the same way as an ordinary health service prescription by an ordinary chemist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy's worries are dealt with here: where the member is a distance away so that the ordinary military doctor cannot deal with his problem, then he can be attended by a civilian doctor and the medicines prescribed can be obtained in the local retail pharmacy. But when his problem requires a prescription and long-term treatment, at that stage the member is expected to obtain his medication from Army sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Minister but he does not appear to have the information in regard to what is regarded as being a long distance.  Perhaps the Minister would come back to me on that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second question which arises is in relation to the supply of drugs for members of the Defence Forces who suffer from long-term illnesses and who may <Col N="1197" /> from time to time be unable to travel to the post because of that very long-term illness.  Would the Minister not agree that there is a case in circumstances like that for allowing them to apply to the local pharmacy for medicines instead of allowing them to go to the post?  Would the Minister indicate what economy is being secured by this particular provision?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The economies are pretty considerable.  In 1981 medicines supplied to the Defence Forces by retail pharmacies amounted to £12,200.  A sum of £11,600 was in direct payment to chemists and £600 of that was in refunds to personnel. Because of the Department's capacity to bulk buy and also because of the fact that a retail pharmacist is entitled to charge a dispensing fee there are price differences and buying of medicines from Army stocks is much more feasible than getting them from retail pharmacists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Chair will forgive me if I say I am sceptical about that reply.  If the economies exist would the Minister undertake to inform his colleague the Minister for Health of the advantages of bulk buying in this respect so that we can get those kind of economies in the general medical service?</P>

        <i>(Clare)</i>: I would like to point out that before this action was taken regarding changing over to cheque payments legal considerations were taken into account.  We did not make this change by our own choice.  It was on the strongest possible advice from the Garda authorities that life would be endangered if we continued to take large amounts of cash to different centres throughout the city and paid it out.  I would also like to point out that the unions responsible for the people paying out the cash and holding it were advised by the Garda Síochána that they should not be put in jeopardy in this manner.  We decided, because of these two factors, to pay by cheque.  The deadline set by the unions and the associations representing the people who pay the cash gave us the deadline of 30 April last.  We complied with the wishes of the Garda Síochána and the employees paying out the cash.  I also wish to point out that out of a total of 3,000 industrial employees employed by the Office of Public Works 2,700 have accepted payment by cheque.  I would further point out that we made arrangements last week in our own office to cash the cheques for them.  We will still do this if we are required to do so.</P>

        <i>(Waterford):</i> How long does the Minister of State anticipate that those arrangements will last?  Is he not aware that previous arrangements were made with other sectors of the public service regarding the payment of cheques and whilst arrangements were made with the various Departments to pay out the money, several weeks afterwards that arrangement was discontinued.  We find a situation where employees of the Office of Public Works who live in the suburbs are granted three-quarters of an hour in which to go to a particular bank to change those cheques but, in effect, what is happening is that they are being referred to the branch of the bank in their own localities. The requisite time, therefore, is not allowed to them to change their cheques.</P>

      <P>I can understand the concern of the Minister of State and also of the Garda authorities.  Is he aware that according to one authoritative source the Department may not only be acting illegally in paying by cheque but may well be acting unwisely, in so far as, even though those people are paid by cheque, under the Trucking Act it could be held they are not properly paid and the employees could look for payment a second time in cash?  I have been advised by one solicitor that that could be the case. Is the Minister of State aware that many of those employees are encountering difficulty at banks by being referred to the assistant manager to have the cheques initialled and going through various humiliating procedures?  Would the Minister of State not agree that he should have gone through the proper trade union procedures in having this thing established?  Would he not now have the matter referred to arbitration and in the meantime return to the normal procedure?</P>

We have indicated that we will reply to those proposals tomorrow.  The unions are involved in this, particularly the unions representing the people who are responsible for holding and paying the cash.  They gave us a deadline with regard to the changeover.  On the question of the difficulty in cashing cheques, I would remind the House that payment is by cheque throughout the entire public service.  In order to facilitate further the employees concerned we are prepared to give them official identity cards which should lessen any difficulty they may experience in cashing cheques.  This should also lessen the difficulty to which the Deputy referred, that is, the referring of these people to the banks in their own <Col N="1202" /> areas.  That would not be likely to happen in the event of their using official indentity cards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I wish to make a statement on the negotiations that have taken place between my Department and the Civil Service Executive Union in the matter of the operation of the Courts Act, 1981.</P>
      <P>May I begin by saying that, to the best of my knowledge, the matters at issue have now been resolved to the satisfaction of both sides but it may be that, because of an unavoidable time-lag in communication between the union leadership and all the members, there may still be some difficulties in some areas.  If so, I hope and expect that they will be ironed out very shortly.</P>
      <P>By way of background, may I say that the staff claims which were very substantial in financial terms, related not only to the Courts Act, 1981 but also to a number of other enactments already in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matters at issue were referred to a joint committee consisting of representatives of the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and representatives of the Minister for the Public Service established under the current public service pay agreement.  As a result, agreement was reached, as an interim measure, for the upgrading of some posts, the creation of one additional post and a resumption of negotiations on the union's claim as soon as a work survey already in progress has been completed, which will be by 30 September.  It was further agreed that, in the event of those negotiations not resulting in agreement by 30 November 1982, the matter would <Col N="1258" /> again be referred to the joint committee for a recommendation as to the procedure that should then be adopted to resolve it.</P>
    <P>Following a meeting of the Executive Committee of the union on the evening of Tuesday 11 May, my Department were informed that the Executive Committee had decided to instruct their members in the Circuit and District Courts to process claims made under the provisions of all the relevant Acts including the Courts Act, 1981.  My information is that the executive officers of the union set out immediately to communicate orally to the union's members concerned the decision of the executive and that written confirmation of the decision was issued by post yesterday to all those members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has dealt only partly with the matters I asked him to refer to.  First, I raised the problem of the dispute that had arisen and which was in existence yesterday and which so far as I know still exists in the context of the District Court clerks refusing to co-operate in the implementation of the provisions of the Courts Act, 1981.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister to comment also on the fact that there have been no rules of court published by him to deal with various areas of concern that arise out of change of court jurisdictions effected by the Courts Act, 1981.  This Act extends greatly the civil jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts.  It enables the District Court to determine civil actions involving sums of money up to £2,500.  Up to 12 May this year that court was limited to determining such claims up to a monetary value of £250.  The Circuit Court is now empowered under the 1981 Act to determine claims involving sums of money up to £15,000.  It was previously limited to determining claims worth no more than £2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of family law the Act not only increases the financial jurisdiction of the courts but also introduces other far more fundamental changes.  It effectively removes from the High Court its powers to determine custody disputes between parents or parties to a broken marriage and transfers these powers to the District <Col N="1259" /> Court and Circuit Court.  It also removes from the High Court much of its remaining matrimonial jurisdiction and transfers it to the Circuit Court.  While the general increase in the financial jurisdiction of both the District and Circuit Court is in principle a welcome reform, it is generally acknowledged by all those involved in the area of family law that the District and Circuit Courts as presently constituted are totally unsuited to deal with the vast areas of family law litigation now transferred to them.  The physical structure of the buildings out of which district courts operate throughout the country alone renders them unsuitable forums for dealing with the emotional and sensitive issues that arise in custody cases.  The same can be said of many of the buildings in which circuit courts operate.</P>
    <P>In an Adjournment Debate on 1 April last I raised the various difficulties that would arise in the area of family law on the coming into force of the 1981 Act.  In asking the Minister to introduce amending legislation I pointed out that although our courts have little experience in the area of matrimonial law and that while the District Court had some experience in this area the Circuit Court had almost none.  I pointed out that in practice both the District and the Circuit Court had no real experience in the area of custody disputes.  Replying on behalf of the Minister for Justice, the Minister for the Gaeltacht informed the House and assured me that his colleague, the Minister for Justice was fully aware of his responsibilities in dealing with these matters. However, from a reply received by me to a question on 5 May last it became clear that not only was the Minister not prepared to introduce amending legislation but that he and the Department had made no preparations of any nature for the coming into force of this legislation. It became clear that no additional court facilities would be made available on 12 May and that no additional staff had been recruited by the Department to assist the staff in the District and Circuit Court offices with the enormous increase in work resulting from the implementation of the provisions in the 1981 Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> Even more extraordinary, however, is the failure of the Minister to publish rules of court laying down the basic procedures to be used in issuing proceedings in District and Circuit Courts to enable these courts to determine disputes arising out of the new jurisdictions transferred to them, not only in the area of family law but in all areas of civil litigation.  This totally unprecedented failure of the Minister, a failure that has not been explained by him in the House today, casts grave doubts on his ability to properly exercise his responsibilities.  In the light of the Minister's failure it is not surprising that the overworked and dedicated District Court staff are now engaged in a form of industrial action.  That action is now coming to an end to enable further discussions to take place, but that is not a compliment to the Minister but an indication of the level of concern of the staff employed in District Court and Circuit Court offices.</P>
    <P>Not only have no rules of court been published but no coherent and detailed instructions have been given by the Minister or his Department to the staff in either the Circuit Court or District Court offices around the country as to what administrative steps they should take to implement the new procedures.  The Minister's failure to act is leading to total and utter confusion within the legal profession and is rendering it virtually impossible for lawyers to properly advise clients as to how to process claims before the courts.  In the area of family law this will have particularly serious consequences. For many of those who look to the courts to resolve their difficulties, as matters now stand the High Court cannot deal with the vast majority of problems in the area of family law and no effective procedures have been introduced by the Minister by way of providing enabling rules of court to enable the lower courts to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>There are four actions I should like the Minister to take.  The Minister should immediately publish the necessary rules of court.  He should give an explanation to the House as to why no such rules have been published.  It is necessary, and I believe he will be told this by his officials &mdash; and I am sure he has been told it <Col N="1261" /> already by the unions representing the staff in the District and Circuit Courts &mdash; to recruit additional staff to enable the courts to service the great increase in litigation they will now have to deal with. There is a need for additional court facilities. District Courts throughout the country are not suited and cannot cope with the great increase in jurisdiction that is going to descend on them.  In the area of family law it will create additional traumas and problems for many litigants who come before our courts.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to recognise the fact that this Act, in so far as it relates to the area of family law is defective.  I ask the Minister to consider reviewing the jurisdiction that the High Court possesses in these areas.  I ask the Minister to introduce legislation here as rapidly as possible to do that.  If he does so I can assure him that he will have the support and assistance of Members on this side of the House.  In the interests of ensuring the proper administration of justice I hope the Minister is given leave to reply to the one question that is of great immediate and urgent concern, when will the rules of court be published so that lawyers and court staff will know how to deal with all the new jurisdictions the lower courts now find vested in them?</P>

      <P>Basically, the Labour Party would regard the 1981 Act as welcome legislation in that without doubt the inroads of inflation necessitated an increase in the jurisdictions of the District and Circuit Courts.  That cannot be denied.  Those jurisdictions have remained unchanged for many years. However, it would follow that such a drastic alteration in the jurisdictions of the courts would require, and should have necessitated, a considerable degree of forethought and prior preparation on the part of the Minister for Justice and his staff.  Clearly no preparation, or very little preparation or forethought, was given as to what the consequences would be of so drastic a measure in the administration of justice as was involved in the alterations in the jurisdictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Shatter pointed out, rules of court covering the new situation have not as yet been published or prepared notwithstanding the fact that the Act is now in operation.  That throws a question mark over the effective operation of the new machinery.  Costs, for example, are not provided for under the existing rules of the court.  As a matter of obvious comment I would say that the rules of the court should have been published and been put into operation simultaneously with the coming into operation of the Act.  Had it not been possible for technical reasons in the Minister's Department &mdash; one can understand that &mdash; to have the rules available and published contemporaneously with the coming into operation of the Act, the Minister should have acceded to the requests made to him to defer the implementation of the Act until such time as it was possible to conduct the administration of justice of the <Col N="1263" /> country in an orderly and proper manner. Likewise, there was no forethought or consideration given to the fact that there will be a tremendous increase in the workload of the District Court and the Circuit Court, whose jurisdiction is being substantially increased.</P>
    <P>We have no information that a commensurate increase in the staff servicing those courts &mdash; judges, county registrars and office staff &mdash; have been provided and likewise in the District Court.  I believe it to be the case that no additional courthouse accommodation has been provided for the Circuit Court or District Court, within which the very substantially increased number of cases, which can quite readily be foreseen, will be heard.  This will give rise to a very serious situation, not only for practitioners but for members of the public.  Far from making provision for increasing accommodation, particularly in the District Court, as has been pointed out many times both here and at local authority meetings, the existing facilities of the District Court in Dublin and around the country are already utterly inadequate and incapable of handling the volume of business which they transact.  These courts, to give dignity to the administration of justice, require, adequate premises and such facilities are not available.  Here we find that, without any forethought, a huge additional workload will be imposed on these courts without any attention being given to the necessity for these facilities.</P>
    <P>The increased workload for the District Court, for example, will very likely be quadrupled as a result of the increase in jurisdiction.  I very much fear that, unless immediate action is taken, there will be a breakdown in the administration of justice.  It may well be that, as an interim measure, the existing initial problems to which the Minister referred have been resolved.  But I can well foresee that, unless urgent steps are taken, there will be even greater stresses building up in the District Court staffs, registrars and district justices as a result of which there will be a further breakdown unless that situation is tackled now.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> This Act became law 12 months ago, but the actual implication of most sections of the Act was deferred for 12 months and consequently came into effect on 12 May.  The self-evident purpose of this deferment was to enable the Government and the Department of Justice to make adequate provision for the enormously increased jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts.  To our mind the increased jurisdiction necessitated, firstly, increased staffing and training of District Court staff.  Staff could not be expected to take on an increased workload without adequate increases in pay and improvement in staffing conditions; secondly, an increase in the number of district justices to handle the increased volume of cases, in particular family law cases.  A complex body of law in relation to guardianship has been built up by the High Court in recent years and many of these decisions are unreported.  Steps should have been taken to familiarise district justices with the complex law in the important area of guardianship.  Thirdly, the provision of adequate support staff &mdash; for example, welfare officials, to enable the courts to come to rational decisions based on an adequate appraisal of the facts; fourthly, improvements in the physical facilities available in the District Court to enable consultation to take place in civilised surroundings. The present conditions of District Court premises are deplorable and totally unsuitable, as we all well know; fifthly, provision to be made for new proceedings embodying the rules of court to facilitate the implementation of the new jurisdictions; sixthly, the extending of the civil legal aid scheme beyond the existing centres, to enable persons to realise the remedies now available to them locally under the Act, in keeping with the principle embodied in the Act, of decentralisation of access to courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State have had over 12 months to make these arrangements and their total failure to do so is a sign of gross irresponsibility <Col N="1265" /> and negligence.  This has led directly to the present impasse which will effectively render the Act unworkable &mdash; this is quite on the cards &mdash; to the detriment of litigants seeking urgent relief.  My party call on the Government to make the necessary arrangements which we have outlined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time, I was about to deal with some of the problems mentioned in the Minister's Estimate concerning our Defence Forces. Also, in relation to housing, I quoted a former Minister for Defence in relation to housing at Cathal Brugha Barracks.  I am aware that is an erroneous statement and I want to apologise for it.  I understand the last administration started a block of flats, but that is only a drop in the ocean in relation to the problem to be solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main problems I wish to deal with in detail are the general poor level of accommodation and, particularly, slum housing.  Members of the Defence Forces to whom I have spoken have expressed dissatisfaction with the conditions of employment, unsocial hours and, to a lesser extent, poor pay, even though I accept that pay in itself is not the major factor.  The grave shortage of technical personnel, including pilots, engineers, doctors and so on, is also a factor.  There is also the lack of a proper welfare service to look after the increasing social problems in the Defence Forces and a shortage of vital equipment, helicopters, radio and electronic equipment.  Some require political solutions, others require financial contributions, but they all need the <Col N="1270" /> will and determination of the Minister of the day to vigorously tackle those problems.</P>
    <P>I would also like to comment on the state of the Defence Forces at present because it is very relevant to this debate. The strength of the Defence Forces now stands at 14,983 as mentioned in the Minister's speech, which is 83 per cent of its establishment strength of 18,020.  This is only a marginal improvement since 1977, when we had 14,776.  The disturbing aspect of this &mdash; and herein lies the serious problem &mdash; is that since 1977 we have recruited 10,400 to the Defence Forces. In other words, since that time we have lost almost 10,200 men.  This is a frightening figure.  They have not left without some reason and it is the duty of the Minister of the day to find out what the reasons are.  I contend the reasons which I have mentioned are the main causes of people leaving.  Something must be done or the Defence Forces will bleed to death. Their best people are being lost to private industry, although when our Government were in office we had a net increase of 700 men and women to the forces, a 5 per cent increase.  The Minister's party have allowed a decline of 1,200 from 1977 to 1981.  Increasing sums of money have been provided for pay and that is mentioned again in the Estimate.  However, the question of allowances must be examined for the unsocial hours and hazardous duties they have to face.  Their allowances are very poor when compared to those of members of the Garda Síochána.  I am not in any way saying that the members of the Garda Síochána are too well treated, but there is a connection between them and the Defence Forces. They do a similar type of duty and work in harmony with one another.  They are involved in the security of the State and the Army are involved in aiding the civil power which is the Garda Sióchána and, because of that, you can make comparisons between them.  This is a complex and difficult area which is perhaps outside the scope of this debate.</P>
    <P>I am grateful that the Minister has decided to examine the rule which prevents members of the Defence Forces from discussing their problems and grievances. <Col N="1271" /> It may not necessarily be associated with any military obligation and the Minister would do well to examine that rule and perhaps change it.  I have been advocating for some time that a commission of inquiry should be set up to inquire into the problems of the Defence Forces. It could be on the lines of the Conroy Commission which was set up to inquire into the problems of the Garda Sióchána. The Minister may say we should have done this while we were in office.  I had discussions with Deputy Barrett when he was Minister for Defence on that matter and also with his immediate successor, Deputy Tully.  I know it is a complex matter, that there are technical and administrative difficulties and that it would require legislation to do it but the Minister should set up such a commission. He must critically examine the role and duties of the Defence Forces.  We have a unique situation here in comparison to other EEC member states in that our Defence Forces are called upon to do work far outside the call of duty, to assist the civil power, and to help the garda and prison officers.  They are also used as a cheap form of security when they provide protection for various semi-State bodies and the banking institutions.  These duties are the cause of many of the problems and they create a dreadful strain on members of the Defence Forces.  The Minister should ensure that the natural agencies for this task should be geared to deal with this problem or that new agencies should be created.  If the Minister has the will, determination and necessary support from the Government he can provide a task force to deal with this.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces should not be abused because they have no representation or clout except from their public representatives and I sincerely hope that will not be interfered with.  In relation to recruiting, I think the Easter parade should again be established.  This should be regarded as a national showpiece for our Defence Forces and, rather than spend thousands on advertising through the media in a recruitment drive, if we can display to the young people something like an Easter parade it would be <Col N="1272" /> better than all the advertising and publicity we have had in the past.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the problem of housing.  I have visited some of the houses occupied by members of the Defence Forces and I have been shocked at what I found.  The Minister will have to do something positive about this and seriously consider changing the old policy in relation to housing.  The problem is not being tackled.  The Minister will provide some houses and the local authority will also provide them.  I maintain that the members of the Defence Forces are falling between two stools because the Minister &mdash; any Minister &mdash; will say it is a matter for the local authority.  I have been a member of a local authority and I have a feeling that some local authorities will say it is a matter for the Department of Defence.  It is a problem which must be resolved, and I recommend seriously to the Minister that if he cannot provide from his Department's resources the wherewithal, he should make a special allocation from the Central Fund to local authorities in whose areas there are military barracks.  Such funds should be earmarked to provide Army accommodation. Something positive must be done instead of paying lip service in the House and going down to attend passing out parades.</P>
    <P>Army housing provision does not at all compare with the provision made for the Garda Siochána.  I will refer to figures given in <i>The Irish Press</i> on 17 December 1980.  The figures were given in a report of a Dublin Corporation meeting.  They expose a disgraceful situation.  We speak at home and abroad about the wonderful Army we have but we fail to provide accommodation for them.  The report I have referred to deals with an official inspection of three Dublin barracks, Cathal Brugha, Griffith and Arbour Hill. The inspection revealed that 186 of the 201 housing units were substandard.  At Griffith Barracks all 24 units were not fit for habitation.  Only one out of 88 was habitable at Arbour Hill.  If that is not an indictment of successive Ministers and Governments I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>I will now give the Minister some other information, and it is not to anybody's <Col N="1273" /> credit.  I will again compare Garda accommodation with that provided for the Army.  Of Garda houses in this State, 10 per cent had been built prior to 1920, but 69 per cent of Army housing units were built prior to 1920.  I am trying to point out the seriousness of the situation in regard to Defence Forces accommodation. As I have said, 69 per cent of the housing units in which Defence Force personnel are accommodated were inherited from an alien force.  There is a trend in this problem.  In the case of Garda Síochána accommodation 29 per cent of the units were built between 1920 and 1960.  Thirteen per cent of Army houses were built in that period.  From 1960 to 1980, 61 per cent of Garda accommodation was built, but in that period only 18 per cent of Army houses were built.  That clearly highlights the serious position in regard to Army housing.</P>
    <P>I am not making a political point here. The position has been fairly accurately described on television and in the newspapers. It has been discussed by Dublin Corporation.  I am not being disrespectful, but when I read the Minister's speech today I said to myself: &ldquo;I have heard it all before but I have not seen the necessary action being taken.&rdquo;  I sincerely hope the Minister will treat Army accommodation as a top priority.  Quite a lot of the amount provided in the Estimate will go on maintenance, trying to maintain a crumbling stock of pre-1920 houses.  I ask the Minister to take particular note of that because it is of the utmost importance if we are to keep our Defence Forces as near as possible to established strength.</P>
    <P>I note that of the 1980 Estimate £2 million was unexpended.  The Minister then should have diverted that towards the provision of Army houses, even if it meant purchasing them on the open market at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a housing crisis more serious than Dublin inner city and I quote from the Health Report, &ldquo;Where is the money to come from?&rdquo; I suggest that the Minister examine his own Department and look to his Government's capital programme for more money even at the <Col N="1274" /> expense of places like Knock Airport etcetera.</P>
    <P>There are other serious problems as well, such as a proper welfare service which would look after the needs of the Defence Forces and their dependants. The incidence of marital breakdown in our society also applies in the Defence Forces and the Minister should show his real concern by providing personnel and resources before the problem becomes more acute.  He must also tackle the shortages of qualified personnel due to the increasing complex and technical nature of the services.  We cannot walk out on the street and just pick the people with technical qualifications and land them into jobs; it takes long-term planning rather than instant recruiting of personnel.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to set up a special cadet programme to fill the vacancies for doctors and other urgently required professional personnel within the Defence Forces.  He should investigate the scholarship scheme to fill these vacancies. I would like to see the Minister showing his social concern to enable children who otherwise could not become doctors, engineers <i>etcetera</i> to do so through the Defence Forces.  Let him also increase the number of apprentices.  Let the Defence Forces be available to the children of those people who could not afford otherwise, for social or financial reasons, to achieve their goals in society. I am asking the Minister here seriously to investigate this suggestion.</P>
    <P>I now move on to the issue of equipment. Subhead 02 of the Estimate is for aircraft.  There is almost £6.5 million provided, of which £3.8 million is for maintenance.  Perhaps the Minister could explain the high cost of maintenance.  Is it because of the age of the equipment? I know that half the Air Corps Alouette fleet are out of action at the moment for maintenance, as are the basic trainers. The Air Corps have to be commended for their dedication in operating in dreadful conditions with totally inadequate equipment.  Only one leased helicopter out of 11 helicopters can operate at night or in bad weather, yet the pilots often fly to save lives with this inadequate equipment. <Col N="1275" /> Sooner or later, if all-weather helicopters cannot be provided there will be a very serious tragedy.  The Minister must now state what he proposes to do about the acquisition of further helicopters. Apparently there is money available according to the former and present Ministers for Justice for all-weather helicopters for the Garda Síochána.  The Air Corps desperately need this equipment. In the last two years we have had to call on British helicopters on 24 occasions. This is a disgrace.  What if the British are not available or unwilling to provide the service?  Following his recent speech the reason should be very apparent to the present Minister.</P>
    <P>Another serious matter is maritime reconnaissance.  I understand that money is or was available from the EEC.  I wonder has the Minister explored that avenue. This was available in relation to fishery protection aircraft.  The Minister should explain the reason for the delay and the fact that these aircraft are available in a number of other countries.  Our pilots are our greatest asset.  I would like to take the opportunity of extending my sympathy and that of my party to the relatives of the late Edmund Barry who was killed in a tragic accident last February on a training flight in Baldonnel. We owe a great debt to all the members of the Air Corps.  There are other items that could be needed for training also.  In view of the rising cost of equipment, I would like to see proper home produced equipment and not another repeat of the Timoney saga.  We need many items and we should investigate home produced designs or licensed productions.</P>
    <P>Finally on equipment I turn to subhead P dealing with naval stores.  I am delighted to note the increase from £1 million to almost £11 million.  This provides much needed employment in the Cork area, particularly in the Verolme Dockyard.  To raise employment the Minister should consider replacing the almost 50 years old auxiliary vessels in his Department and those that are leased at the cost of £150,000.  This could provide employment for a smaller boatyard. He could also consider replacing the 30 <Col N="1276" /> years old mine sweepers, also providing very much needed employment.  I would also ask the Minister to refit the Deirdre-class vessels with proper electronics, radar and sonar, in view of recent events, namely, the sinking of the trawler by the British submarine.  This suggestion which I made to his predecessor was ignored.  I now ask the present Minister to consider those points.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Defence Forces and the problems in regard to housing and unsocial hours.  The security service provided by the Defence Forces should be examined by the Minister.  The banks should make some contribution.  Long and unsocial hours are involved in providing that kind of service with members of the Defence Forces having to leave their homes early in the morning and return late at night.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to arrange for housing co-operative schemes whereby the local authorities would provide the land and the services and the Minister would provide a contribution, because this is an immediate problem.  I would also like to know what the Minister proposes to do in regard to the overholders because this is increasing by the day.  It particularly applies in the Minister's own constituency but it applies in other parts of the country as well.  The housing that is there should be made available to the Army personnel in the Curragh and throughout the country.  I am grateful for the Minister's assurance that he will reply to any points raised by Deputies and I look forward to some constructive approach to this serious problem.  It is easy for a Minister to come into this House and to produce an Estimate like the one produced today and say all the nice things.  But while we are recruiting people are leaving.  They are trained and still they leave after their initial term of three years.  So there is no point in the Minister saying that 50 are going today but we are getting in 49.  That is what is happening.  There is a fast turnover.  It is a waste of personnel within the Army and in the Naval Service and Air Corps.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the Womens Corps in the Army and I am grateful for the Minister's promise that there will <Col N="1277" /> be no discrimination in relation to promotion. I would like to pay tribute also to the Army nursing service and the Red Cross.</P>
    <P>In regard to pensions some improvements have been made in the past.  But I would ask the Minister to consider this again because some of the pensioners are in very poor circumstances and in need of attention.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cuidiú leis an méid atá ráite cheana faoi Mheastacháin an Roinn Cosanta.  Ar dtús ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas a ghabháil leis an Aire as ucht é a bheith tofa ina bhall den Rialtas, agus tá súil agaim go ndéanfaidh sé sár-obair ar son an Airm agus ar son An Roinn Cosanta sna blianta atá romhainn.</P>
      <P>I would like to offer a contribution to the debate on the Estimate before the House for the Department of Defence and for the Army pensions for 1982.  It is a matter of regret that there is so little interest in the House in this very important Estimate.  It contrasts remarkably with the attitude which is adopted on occasions of stress and difficulty when a particular service breaks down or there is an industrial dispute in some field by the armchair generals &mdash; and I do not mean that in any military sense &mdash; who are quick to rush in and suggest that we get the Army to do this and that.  But when we are presented with an opportunity in the House to discuss the Department of Defence, the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps together with various other branches of the Defence Forces, very few Members come in to contribute either constructively or otherwise. This is a matter for regret.  I would hope that more Deputies would show an interest in the Estimates for this Department as the debate progresses.  Every contribution has some merit and I know that the Minister will listen attentively and take note of any suggestions that are made by Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I welcome the provision of £304 million, an increase of 18 per cent on the 1981 figures.  The Estimate for this Department has not generated any great amount of interest over the years.  That <Col N="1278" /> is disturbing in view of the large amounts of money involved in these Estimates and because decisions taken affect a large number of persons both directly and indirectly.  They affect members of the Defence Forces and their dependants and many retired members who have given sterling service to the nation which should be acknowledged by all.  Third, but not least important, it is a matter affecting national security and should therefore be of interest to us all.</P>
    <P>I have already congratulated the Minister on his appointment and I am certain that he will do an excellent job, coming as he does, from that part of the country where the Army and certain other pastimes, such as horseracing, are located. I am delighted that the Minister, as the Deputy for Kildare, has the responsibility for the Department of Defence. Although he might be an inland man I have no doubt that he will also devote his attention to the other branches of the Defence Forces such as the Naval Service and the Air Corps who are also giving very worth while service on behalf of the community at large.</P>
    <P>The public are becoming more aware of the role played by the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  I am certain the public accept that there is need to increase the existing forces and expand their operations.  This can best be done by the provision of adequate financing and up-to-date modern equipment.  I am sure everyone will derive satisfaction from the fact that the permanent Defence Forces are up to the maximum peace time establishment of 15,000 members.  I do not suggest that this satisfaction should cloud the underlying position.  I would question whether all personnel are being used to maximum effect or if, in view of the current unemployment situation, a case could not be made for an expansion of the services.</P>
    <P>I never served any time in the Permanent Defence Forces but I spent a considerable number of years in the FCA.  It is an occupation which would do a person a lot of good and teach them many skills which are desirable.  If any young persons approached me I would have no hesitation in recommending that they engage <Col N="1279" /> in a career in the Defence Forces.  They would leave with many attributes which would stand to them in later life.  I asked the Minister to consider the desirability of increasing the establishment strength of the Defence Forces to accommodate those who are seeking positions and enlist in the various branches of the Defence Forces.  I understand that there may be an embargo on recruitment and that at present, for the first time in the history of the Army, there may be a waiting list of 300 prospective recruits.  Perhaps the Minister would deal with this point in his reply.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a new departure by the Army which was mentioned by the Minister in his speech when he gave the numbers and grades occupied by female members.  They acquitted themselves very well at Arbour Hill yesterday.  The Department have succeeded in providing them with a very satisfactory and, from an observer's point of view, well-tailored uniform.  I do not know what the members of the force think about it.  I welcome the presence of female members of the Army and the Minister's statement that they will be treated equally with their male counterparts as regards promotion and advancement in various branches of the service.  I am sure they will uphold the very honorable and courageous standards which have been set by male predecessors who had complete domination of the Army up to now.  I am sure we will hear more about the female soldiers we have.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the UN in his speech.  This is an area where the Army have served with distinction.  I am sure everyone is aware of their service in the Congo, Cyprus and recently in the Lebanon. Members of the forces should have an opportunity to avail of overseas service.  I accept that this can at times be dangerous.  We must acknowledge the sacrifices made by members of the Army. They suffered their worst casualties in the Congo.  These were casualties in the Labanon and we regret this.  Their sacrifice is made on behalf of the cause of peace, a cause which supersedes any other we may be called upon to make. <Col N="1280" /> The opportunity to serve overseas is worthwhile and necessary.  It is an experience which allows members of the forces to have contacts with other contingents from various parts of the world. They can exchange military experience with each other.  This leads to an improvement in efficiency and ability.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and the Government will, as far as national considerations allow, accede to requests within reason which the UN might make either in the immediate future or later on to send a contingent of the Army to any part of the world where their service might be needed.  I have no doubt they will acquit themselves as admirably and capably as they have in all the areas where they have served up to now.  In this context the fact that we are a neutral country and that our neutrality is accepted is one of the major factors in ensuring that we have received, by and large, an open armed welcome wherever we have gone in the role of peacekeeping.  I hope our neutrality is not diminished.  I am sure the Government will refuse to align themselves with any power bloc.  In this context I welcome the Government's decision not to become involved in any further sanctions in the EEC in pursuit of a military adventure by a person I can only describe as a war-mongering meglomaniac.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bellew</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that our Army should be used in a peace keeping role only, or a role compatible with our neutrality.  Our Army have served us well in the past.  I am confident that the Army will be maintained in the future.  I welcome the increase of £21 million for stores and equipment.  I hope it indicates a desire to ensure that our forces are equipped with the most modern and up-to-date weapons and logistical back-up compatible with our needs at home and our international obligations in a peace keeping role.</P>
      <P>I hope some of this money will be ear-marked &mdash; or possibly through an arrangement with our EEC partners &mdash; to furnish the Naval Service and the Air Corps with more modern vessels and helicopters. Both these branches should be expanded and their respective roles and duties re-examined and updated to enable them to react more quickly than they can at present.  That is not in any way a criticism of the sterling service given by the naval and helicopter arms of our forces in carrying out the duties allotted to them from time to time and to which they have given their best endeavours. They have saved many lives and provided worthwhile services for the nation.</P>
      <P>Additional naval vessels should be constructed in our own shipyards in Cork. The vessels constructed there to date are good examples of what can be done, and compare favourably with anything produced elsewhere.  The necessary finances should be procured either direct from Government resources or from the EEC for an expansion of their fishery protection role.  We should have an increase in the number of ships available to the Naval Service to enable them to react as speedily as possible in any situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Creed referred to the recent sinking of a trawler from Clogherhead in my own constituency.  It is not a criticism <Col N="1282" /> of the Naval Service to say there was a delay by virtue of the fact that the naval vessel had to disengage itself from fishery protection work in the Donegal area and sail around the coast to take part in the search to find out what had happened in this incident.  We owe the Naval Service a debt of gratitude for the work they did in locating the wreck and recovering the nets which eventually showed the cause of the sinking of the trawler.</P>
    <P>Certain personages &mdash; I cannot name them but the British Ambassador apologised for them subsequently &mdash; suggested that perhaps the Loch Ness monster sank the trawler.  I am glad our Naval Service were able to provide the evidence that the irresponsible action of a military vessel sailing in waters close to our shores was responsible for this grossly and I would almost suggest malicious act in pulling this trawler and its crew to the bottom of the sea.  The Minister should have sufficient funds to allow for an expansion of the Naval Service to ensure that an incident of this nature will be detected quickly, and responsibility assigned to the offending party.  To do this we would need to have vessels stationed around our coastline.  I am not suggesting we need a naval vessel in every port, but it should not be necessary for a naval vessel to sail from Donegal in any future incident.  I hope we will not have a repetition of the incident to which I referred.  The fishermen in Clogherhead are very appreciative of the efforts made by the Naval Service and the tremendous work they did in this instance.</P>
    <P>Apart from any military role which our helicopters might have, this wing of the Army is being used increasingly to assist in security duties and in surveillance of the transshipment of large sums of money from one part of the country to another in co-operation with the Garda, in search and rescue missions, and in ambulance duties carrying victims of various accidents from one point to another.  Would it be feasible or practical to have helicopters based in some of the military establishments to ensure security?  These machines are located at Baldonnel at the moment and they have to be prepared there, take off and fly to the location of <Col N="1283" /> incidents to carry out research or whatever role is allotted to them.  Perhaps helicopters could be based in Cork, Donegal and Galway to enable them to react quickly when their assistance is required.  We should acknowledge the skill of pilots and of the enlisted men who operate the winches on these machines and carry out the dangerous duties they perform in all types of weather to save lives, be it in civil situations or when they are acting in a purely military role.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a matter raised by Deputy Creed, namely, the question of housing of military families. This is an area which requires a great deal of attention.  The Minister could devote his undoubted energies towards finding a satisfactory solution.  There is little to be gained now from discussing percentages of housing which have been provided by this Administration, a previous Administration or indeed a pre-Independence Administration because that is totally irrelevant.  The present situation is one in which human beings must be considered and that should be of paramount importance.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity of raising this matter again. I shall not reiterate the details of the history of this problem except to say that <Col N="1284" /> I raised this matter on the Adjournment of the House on 4 May.  In reply that evening the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Connolly, said:</P>
      <P>In the course of the discussion the Minister indicated that he was open to consider fully the needs and problems of Cork City and to that end he asked the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, who has special responsibility for urban affairs, to visit Cork and to assess the problems on the spot.  The Minister also undertook to give favourable consideration to the needs of Cork in relation to the allocations which he hoped to make very shortly out of additional funds which have been made available for certain services in the recent budget, and also appropriate consideration to various projects which have been referred to in the course of the discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The needs of Cork were set out clearly by the deputation who came to Dublin on 30 March last, of which I was a member, and have been placed on the record of this House in the course of the previous debate.  Therefore I shall not waste time going into that matter again except to say that Cork Corporation looked for £2.9 million to fund existing deficits and maintain service levels in 1982, and that we consider that £2.9 million as <i>pro rata</i> with the allocation for Dublin.  At that meeting with the Minister we were promised &mdash; and all shades of political opinion in Cork are adamant on this &mdash; a reply within six to seven days, a reply we did not receive.  That was the reason I raised this matter originally in the House.  Then the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, indicated that the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, would be going to Cork and, from different statements made, the indications were that an announcement would have been made in Cork yesterday. I was quite surprised when I heard from Cork last evening that no announcement had been made except of an allocation for the Merchant's Quay development of between £100,000 and £150,000 as well as £132,000 for an itinerant site in the north-west part of the <Col N="1285" /> city, which had been forthcoming anyway.</P>
    <P>I hope this evening we shall debate this matter in a proper manner because on the last occasion here the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, referred to items not relevant to the subject under discussion.  I might refer again to Minister Brady's visit to Cork and the expectations raised.  My information is that at his press conference last evening he said he did not intend making a statement about a major financial allocation and that the indications were that there would be no Gregory-type deal for Cork city.  Some of the points made by the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, last evening quite surprised the people present.  He painted a very rosy picture of the housing situation in Cork, one quite at variance with the facts.  The situation in regard to housing in Cork at present is that there are major difficulties being experienced in the number of starts this year and also it would appear there will be a major decrease in the number of completions.</P>

      <P>If we are to talk about track records, one of the major problems that arose in Cork concerns the NBA Scheme at Mayfield where major remedial work needs to be carried out and to which we referred in our submission. We have been receiving piecemeal contributions towards that remedial work. We are now seeking an allocation that would make a major impact on this remedial programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> I might revert to the statement made by the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, last evening to the effect that he would be anxious to have copies of the local plans made available to him.  The situation is that Cork local plans, which are part of the land use and transportation scheme, have been lodged with the Department of the Environment for some years, with which any Minister in that Department should be familiar.  My contention is that the Minister's journey to Cork was what might be described as a time-saving excercise, in order to win time for the Department and in an effort also to placate Cork Corporation.  We have seen very little results from his visit. If the Minister this evening is unable to make any announcement in relation to the submission to his Department, then will he say whether his senior Minister will be in a position to do so shortly?</P>

      <P>What I am afraid of is that, even if the intention was there some weeks ago, it has now evaporated because moneys must be ploughed into areas much more politically sensitive.</P>
      <P>I do not want to reiterate what I said on the Adjournment Debate last time. But I must refer to figures made available in the last week in relation to unemployment in Cork.  It is important that unemployment and the lack of infrastructural services be linked because the figures for Cork show something like 7,900 people now unemployed in the greater Cork region, which constitutes an increase of approximately 8 per cent since January last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a lot of lip service about the problem of unemployment in Cork. There are two important factors in the approach to the problem.  We have to create services, roads, bridges, the down river crossing, in order to make the infrastructure attractive enough to foreign industrialists.  The evidence is that we are not attractive enough to industrialists and as soon as they come to see our setup the vast majority are discouraged <Col N="1287" /> and go elsewhere.  If moneys are allocated to Cork for the provision of those services it will create employment in the Cork region.  When we look at the figures for the construction industry in Cork we see that that sector is very badly hit.  It would be a major boost to that industry if funds were made available.  How long do I have?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. B. Allen Mr. B. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to link unemployment with the lack of services in the city.  It is very difficult to provide services at low cost because of the geographical layout of the city.  It is important that public representatives from all parties in the Cork region make their views known.  I am glad to see that some Deputies have done so.  I want to refute something that was said in the House on 6 May.  It was said that when a deputation from Cork came to Dublin and when an offer was made of a visit to Cork by the Minister of State the deputation dithered. I am sure the Minister agrees that the deputation presented a very detailed statement of their hopes and aims and presented their case in a very workmanlike manner.  The Minister stated that he was impressed.  The Minister of State took over the proceedings for a while and when the deputation were asked for a date for the visit of the Minister of State to Cork the manager and the Lord Mayor, who are busy people, were not able to come up with a date immediately. They said they would get back within a few days.  It is a grave injustice to the people who travelled to Dublin at great cost to infer that the deputation were disorganised, mismanaged and dithering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister of State has a special interest in the reconstruction of the inner cities.  I ask him to impress on his Minister the urgency of the Cork situation.  He has seen the Shandon Street, Blackpool, Blarney Street areas <Col N="1288" /> and he is now aware that those areas require aid immediately.  Cork Corporation are implementing the Shandon local plan but the rate of progress in the implementation of the plan has been slowed down by lack of finance.  I am not saying that has happened overnight.  Although the co-operation of the people in the area has been good up to now, if funds are not injected into the area the plan could grind to a halt.  The local people who have put so much effort into the plans for the area would like to see a realistic input from central Government.  I hope the Minister of State will refer to the points I have raised.  I could have gone into the pros and cons of other issues.  The other Minister of State the last time did not stick to the relevant points and went into interest rates and so forth.  I appeal to the Minister of State to stick to the subject under discussion this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Brady, Dublin South-East) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Brady, Dublin South-East)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Brady,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dublin South-East):</i> I welcome the opportunity to speak on this subject this evening.  I am delighted it came before the House because it affords me an opportunity to set the record straight as far as my visit to Cork as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment with special responsibility for matters relating to urban affairs and inner city renewal are concerned.  I absolutely reject the suggestion that there is any conflict between the statements the Deputy referred to.  It is regrettable that he used this opportunity as a political football by making snide innuendos on such an important matter to gain some political advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was at the deputation to which the Deputy referred and I remember in detail what my brief was and why, as Minister of State, I travelled to Cork.  I am sure the Deputy also realises that.  Within a few days of being appointed as Minister of State I attended that deputation and I referred to an extract from the speech given by the Taoiseach on 26 March in the Metropole Hotel, Cork, in which he stated categorically that the new Minister of State for urban affairs would be charged with drawing up a nationwide <Col N="1289" /> programme for urban renewal.  That is why I went to Cork.  I went on a fact-finding mission, as a start.  I intend to travel to as many cities and towns in the country as possible with the specific objective of endeavouring to draw up an order of priorities submitted to me by various corporations and district councils, to identify the problems in particular areas and report back to the Department of the Environment so that we will have a reference and will address ourselves to the problems which are in urgent need of solution.</P>
    <P>In the limited time available to me I will go into as much detail as I possibly can relating to the Cork issue.  The opening remarks of the city manager at the start of our tour of Cork city were to the effect that he realised that the problems in Cork were not of a similar size or magnitude as the dereliction and problems facing Dublin city.  They are not my words but the words of the city manager, Mr. Joe McHugh in Cork.  I realise that Cork, and every city and town in the country, is faced with problems of great magnitude, but I did not allow myself to be drawn into a situation of travelling to Cork to give any financial package.  I deliberately mentioned that to the press and the factual record of what I said is contained in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times.</i> In fact almost every word I said to the press when I arrived in Cork was reported in that newspaper.  I reiterated those comments at a press conference yesterday.  I requested the city manager, his officials and officials from my Department to attend that conference so that there would not be any ambiguity concerning the purpose of my visit to the city.</P>
    <P>Those who choose to draw a different interpretation from my visit are misleading, deliberately or otherwise.  The purpose of my visit to Cork and other towns and cities will be to see for myself what the problems are, to get a greater insight into the brief before me.  I cannot do that any other way, Reports are very good but I am anxious to see what the situation is like for myself.  The Department will be preparing a report directly related to <Col N="1290" /> urban affairs and urban renewal as I found them.  I made that clear yesterday. If the Deputy is in any doubt about that, I suggest he speaks to the reporters who covered the press conference, the city manager or the Lord Mayor.  I had dinner with the Lord Mayor and the city manager and we spent almost two and a half hours dealing with the problem.  There was no doubt about the reason for my visit and to suggest I went there to deliver a financial bonanza is misleading the House.  I resent that accusation.  It is taking cheap advantage of the importance of urban renewal.  Local authorities are responsible for the management and maintenance of rented estates.  Under Fianna Fáil local authorities were permitted to use a proportion of the proceeds of the sale of their rented houses for such management and maintenance costs but the National Coalition withdrew that arrangement earlier this year.  The Government changed that decision.  I am sure the Deputy realises that that move means an extra £350,000 for Cork.  The limitation of statutory demands for supplementary welfare brings more than £70,000 and those moves result in close on £500,000 for Cork.</P>
    <P>I examined Mayfield, Glen and Togher and inner city schemes that were in progress. It is important that I give the House details of the figures in relation to housing. In the period since 1978 the allocation of capital to Cork Corporation for local authority housing increased at an exceptional rate, from £3.2 million in 1978 to an initial allocation of £12.5 million this year.  This represents an increase of 300 per cent at a time when the total capital allocation for local authority housing has increased by 139 per cent. The figures speak for themselves.  I have not attempted to present figures to suit myself.  While in Cork I complimented the work being done in relation to inner city renewal and I viewed schemes at Shandon and Blackpool.  The project at Blackpool is very commendable and the project at Blarney Street is an excellent example of inner city renewal.  I went through the Marsh areas and walked around the inner city of Cork to see what was happening, but I did not go down <Col N="1291" /> with an open cheque for Cork.  To say I did is a desperate effort to mislead the House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I met the deputation and gave them my reasons for going on a fact-finding mission.  My reasons were accepted by the deputation and the city manager.  Anybody who visits Cork frequently, as I do, realises the problems at Merchants Quay in relation to traffic congestion.  Sums between £100,000 and £150,000 were allocated for that project.  A sum of £132,000 was allocated for halting sites for itinerants.  I was asked yesterday if that was all I was giving Cork and I replied that it was coincidental that those sums were now being made available to Cork.  I pointed out that they <Col N="1292" /> could have been given next week or might have been made available last week.  As the Deputy is aware money is continuously given to local authorities and it is not factual to state that £100,000 was given to Cork yesterday as a result of my visit.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the fact that I had not made any reference to the LUTS plan for Cork, but had he attended yesterday's press conference he would be aware that a considerable amount of time was spent discussing that plan.  I would dearly like to see a plan of that type being implemented in all major cities and towns and I complimented the city manager for continuing to push that plan through.  If the Deputy visits my office later we cantalk about Cork for as long as he wishes. My only regret is that I do not have sufficient time now to answer the slight he cast on my visit to Cork.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 18 May 1982.</P>

      <P>There is no record of the receipt of a claim for unemployment benefit in my Department from the person concerned. He did, however, claim disability benefit from 13 November 1981 and was paid from 17 November 1981, fourth day of incapacity, at the maximum appropriate rate.  All disability benefit due to 9 February 1982, after which date he was certified fit to resume work, has been issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social welfare regulations provide that the combined weekly rate of disability benefit and pay-related benefit may not exceed a person's reckonable earnings in the tax year relevant to his claim. As the weekly flat rate of disability benefit (£55.10) payable in this case was greater than the reckonable weekly earnings (£50.48) in 1979-80, the tax year <Col N="1204" /> relevant to his claim, the claimant is precluded from receiving payment of pay-related benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The compulsory retiring age for public servants (apart from some groups) is normally 65 and most of these are entitled to retire with immediate pension at age 60, if they so wish.  The conditions covering such early retirement have in fact been made more attractive in recent years by a number of improvements in superannuation terms.  For example, the qualifying service for maximum lump sum has been reduced from 45 to 40 years and pensions are now increased annually in line with current salaries.  In addition, persons who resign before the minimum retiring age can, provided they have at least five years' service, have their accrued entitlement to pension and lump sum preserved and brought into payment on an uprated basis at age 60.  Furthermore, the revised arrangements for the transfer of pensionable service, which scheme is now being operated on a provisional basis by a large number of public sector bodies, allows public servants to reckon earlier service rendered elsewhere in the public sector provided such service complies with specified conditions.  Since these improvements were introduced, the <Col N="1213" /> number of voluntary retirements from the civil service before the compulsory retiring age has tended to increase.</P>
      <P>Taking account of these improvements and also of cost factors, no further measures to make early retirement more attractive are envisaged at the present moment.</P>

      <P>Following an inquiry by the Deputy in March 1982 regarding the non-receipt of disability benefit cheques in December 1981 and January 1982 a list of all the cheques which issued during these months was sent to the claimant and he was asked to indicate which cheques had not been received by him. While he could not specify exactly all the cheques which had not been received by him he indicated that he was positive he had not received the cheques which had issued on 29 December 1981 and 12 January 1982.  A form of indemnity was issued to him in respect of these cheques but so far this form has not been returned.  It was intended that, on return of the form, duplicate payments would issue.</P>

      <P>At the commencement of his claim the 85 per cent limit applicable to the person concerned was calculated at £58.44 weekly.  However, following a recent review of his claim it was discovered that the amount had been incorrectly calculated and that the appropriate amount was £66.79.

      <P>Two pension books (one for herself and one for the children) containing orders from 2 April 1982 were issued on 29 April 1982 to the designated post office for collection by her and she was notified accordingly.  The arrears of pension due from 5 March 1982 to 1 April 1982 have been paid direct to her by payable order.</P>
      <P>Following inquiries it has been ascertained that the late husband had additional contributions which had the effect of qualifying the widow for the full rate of pension.  A supplementary pension book has now been issued to the widow together with the further arrears of pension from 5 March 1982.</P>

      <P>I am aware that instances of delay in the arrival of unemployment assistance payments in the Slane area were reported to the Drogheda Employment Exchange recently.  Inquiries which were made with the postal authorities in that connection, indicate that the delay was due to the effect of the recent rail dispute.  With the ending of the dispute the postal service in the area is expected to revert to normal.  However, the position will continue to be monitored by the local office to ensure a satisfactory service for postal applicants.</P>

      <P>The person concerned originally claimed and was paid disability benefit in respect of an incapacity from 1 March to 6 March 1982, after which date he was certified fit to resume work.  Payment was made on this claim at the time.</P>
      <P>The claimant subsequently submitted a first certificate dated 8 March 1982 and inquiries were necessary to establish whether this was a new claim or a continuation of the previous incapacity.  Before these inquiries were completed the South-Eastern Health Board had intimated that he was in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance.  Payment of benefit was accordingly withheld pending notification of the amount of the allowance received.  On receipt of this information a refund was made to the health board and the balance of the benefit due to 27 March 1982, after which date he was certified fit to resume work, was issued to the claimant.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed benefit from 5 April 1982 in respect of an accident at work.  Pending inquiries regarding the nature and origin of the incapacity he has been paid disability benefit and pay-related benefit on an interim basis from 8 April 1982, fourth <Col N="1239" /> day of incapacity.  A cheque in payment of all benefit due to 11 May 1982 has been issued to him.</P>
      <P>The delay in payment was due to conflicting statements made by the claimant as to the date of commencement of incapacity. It was necessary to contact the employer to ascertain the date of last employment before payment could be authorised.</P>
      <P>On completion of the inquiries regarding the occupational accident he will be notified of the decision on his claim.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 27 March 1982 and a cheque in payment of all benefit due to 11 May 1982 has been issued to him.  He is not entitled to pay-related benefit as his average weekly earnings in the relevant income tax year, 1980/81, were less than his entitlement by way of flat-rate disability benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The delay in payment was due to inquiries necessary to ascertain the claimant's date of birth as he also claimed old age contributory pension at the same time.  As disability benefit and old age pension are not payable concurrently it was necessary to establish whether he was entitled to benefit or pension before payment <Col N="1240" /> could be authorised.  In the event he will not attain pension age until 16 June 1982 with the result that payment of disability benefit will continue up to that date if he remains incapable of work.</P>

      <P>1.  The maximum of the wage scale for county council road workers with effect from 1 March 1982 is £5,318 (£101.87 p.w.).  2. Provision for superannuation deductions is included in the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956 and the Superannuation Revision Scheme, 1977.  The 1977 scheme applies to all road workers recruited on or after 1 June 1978.  Roadworkers recruited prior to 1 June 1978 were given the option of transferring from the scheme applicable under the 1956 Act to the 1977 scheme.  Under the 1956 Act deductions of 4 per cent of total wages and emoluments are applicable.  The 1977 scheme provides for a deduction of 1½ per cent of total wages and emoluments and an additional deduction of 3½ per cent of co-ordinated wages and emoluments.  A further deduction of 1½ per cent of co-ordinated <Col N="1246" /> wages and emoluments is payable in respect of the relevant Widows and Orphans (Contributory) Scheme by all roadworkers recruited on or after 1 June 1978 and by roadworkers recruited before that date who opted to have the 1977 scheme applied to them and subsequently elected to join the widows and orphans scheme.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;co-ordinated wages and emoluments&rdquo; is defined as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The amount by which weekly wages and weekly emoluments taken together exceed twice the maximum personal weekly rate of Old Age (Contributory) Pension (currently £40.25 per week) payable for the time being to a man who has no adult dependants or qualified children&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The following are the details of the contributions payable under both schemes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  1956 Scheme&mdash;The deduction for superannuation for a roadworker on the maximum of his scale is £4.07 per week which is equivalent to 4 per cent of wages. The Local Authority Widows and Orphans (Contributory) Scheme does not apply in this case.</P>
      <P>(b)  1977 Scheme&mdash;The deduction for superannuation (including widows and orphans pensions) for a roadworker on the maximum of his scale is £2.60 per week which is equivalent to 1½ per cent of the total wages plus 5 per cent of co-ordinated wages.</P>
      <P>Where the 1977 scheme applies, pension benefit in respect of service given on or after 27 May 1977 is calculated, in the same way as contributions, on a co-ordinated basis.</P>

      <P>A national wage scale for roadworkers was introduced on 7 March 1981.  Prior to that date, roadworkers employed by Meath County Council were paid at the maximum of a local scale (£81.37 per week) irrespective of length of service, provided they were recruited by the local authority on or before 6 March 1980.  These employees moved to the maximum of the national scale i.e. to £83.39 with effect from 7 March 1981 and to £96.10 with effect from 1 January 1982.  The latter figure includes increases applicable from 1 June 1981 under the second phase of the 1980 agreement on pay policy and from 1 January 1982 under the first phase of the current agreement on pay in the public service.</P>
      <P>Employees recruited after 6 March 1980 are at various points of the national scale depending on length of service.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the method in which preserved superannuation benefits (lump sum) is operated under the Superannuation Acts and the superannuation schemes for: (a) officers and (b) servants; and the estimate of preserved benefits (lump sum) where ordinary or regular pay is £100 per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The concept of preserved superannuation benefits was introduced under the Superannuation Revision Scheme, 1977.  There is no corresponding provision in the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956.  Under the revision scheme the benefits preserved become payable in the following circumstances:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  Officers&mdash;An officer who voluntarily ceases to hold his office, having had not less than five years of pensionable local service, and who is not employed in another position in which his service is capable of being reckoned under the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956, will have his lump sum, allowance and death benefits preserved, on the basis of his actual service, that is, his pensionable local service.  The lump sum and allowance will become payable, upon application for payment being made, when he reaches age 60 and the death gratuity in the event of death before that age.  The amount of the death gratuity would be equivalent to the lump sum payable on the basis of his actual service, <Col N="1249" /> i.e. three-eightieths of pensionable remuneration for each year plus any odd fraction of a year of pensionable local service up to the date on which he ceased to hold his office.</P>
    <P>The amount of preserved benefit in any case will be based on an officer's pensionable remuneration as increased by reference to pension increases granted in the meantime.</P>
    <P>(b)  Servants&mdash;Preserved benefits for servants are calculated on the same basis as for officers except for the purpose of determining so much of an allowance (pension) as relates to service on or after the 27 May 1977, (i.e. the effective date of the provisions of the Superannuation Revision Scheme, 1977) in which case the pensionable remuneration of a servant who is an insured person will be reduced by twice the maximum personal weekly rate of old age (contributory) pension payable on his last service day to a man who has no adult dependant or qualified children.  Under this arrangement a servant with 40 years service would qualify for combined local service and social welfare pensions of not less than half pay.</P>
    <P>The amount of a lump sum would depend on the number of years pensionable service and the date when the pensioner reaches 60 as well as the rate of pensionable remuneration suitably updated.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the increased incidence of crime and vandalism in the St. Bricin's Park area is a matter of particular concern and special measures have been taken to deal with the situation through the provision of special additional uniformed patrols which operate for up to eight hours each day and supplement the normal uniformed and plain clothes patrols.</P>
      <P>The area is served from the Bridewell station, to which an extra garda was assigned on 7 May, and the question of further increasing the strength at the centre will be considered according as additional manpower becomes available for assignment.</P>
