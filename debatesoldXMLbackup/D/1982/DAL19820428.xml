    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach when the Government expect to obtain vacant possession of the UCD premises (the School of Engineering) in Government Buildings, Merrion Street, Dublin; if such premises will be made available to the Houses of the Oireachtas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department are working closely with the Higher Education Authority and the university authorities on the gradual evacuation of the accommodation occupied by the School of Engineering in the Merrion Street premises and present indications are that vacant possession of about 2000m² will be secured between now and October next. The date when the balance of the accommodation will become available is not yet established.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works are at present examining how the accommodation could best be used to alleviate the accommodation problems of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach have <Col N="1408" /> in the information supplied to him the area of the balance of the accommodation which will become available after October?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have that but perhaps it would be better to send it to the Deputy because it is a bit confused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage is it appropriate that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges be consulted regarding the utilisation of the premises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be a bit premature but it should be done in plenty of time.  We will ensure that the committee are consulted well in advance of any specific action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the accommodation be made available to the Dáil?  I was somewhat disturbed when Taoiseach to discover that there were plans to allocate part of it in such a way that the full accommodation would not be available to the Dáil as a result of a shift in the Taoiseach's office.  I took the view that that should not happen and that all the space should be made available to the Dáil.  Will the Taoiseach assure us that that is his intention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of alternatives being considered but the whole idea is that the Oireachtas should benefit from whatever arrangements are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The plans which I saw and which were put to me for approval&mdash;I did not approve them&mdash;involved allocation of space for the office of the Taoiseach at a point in the building which not only took up space but prevented space further down the corridor being available to the Dáil.  The net effect was to increase the amount of the accommodation of the Department of the Taoiseach but not to give extra space to the Dáil.  I am concerned about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I could assure the Deputy that there will be no attempt to improve the position of the Taoiseach at <Col N="1409" /> the expense of any other Members of the Oireachtas.  Perhaps, as Deputy Quinn has suggested, these matters are best dealt with by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give details of any public relations contracts which he has placed since his appointment indicating in particular the names of the persons or firms involved, the length of the contracts and the contract sums or consultancy fees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he intends to implement the previous Government's decision to set up a Department of Culture and Arts with a view of co-ordinating responsibilities at present spread among many different Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No such decision was taken by the previous Government.  The most effective way to co-ordinate all the cultural and artistic activities and responsibilities of the Government is under consideration at present.  The Deputy will be aware that arrangements including the preparation of the necessary legislation for the setting up of a National Heritage Council are well advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Taoiseach expect this process of consideration to conclude?  What stage of conclusion has the memorandum which is being circulated to the various Government Departments reached?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy referring to the National Heritage Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the subject <Col N="1410" /> matter of the question, a Department of Culture and Arts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no memorandum circulating to the Departments about that matter at present.  No memorandum about the setting up of a Department of Culture and Arts has been circulated by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to what the Taoiseach intends to do about the previous Government's decision. One had been circulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question asks when we intend to implement the previous Government's decision and in my reply I pointed out that the previous Government did not take such a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of a policy commitment by the previous Government to set up such a Department? Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House his intention with regard to such a Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Strangely enough the Government do not feel bound by policy decisions taken by the previous Government in a number of areas.  I have indicated in my reply that we are examining for ourselves &mdash; I hope the Deputy will grant us the privilege of doing that &mdash; how best the different cultural and artistic activities and responsibilities of the Government can be co-ordinated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he intends to send a formal message of good wishes to the Northern Ireland football team and officials for their success in the World Cup in Spain; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, of course, wish every success to the Irish Football Association and to the Northern Ireland team in the forthcoming World Cup finals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach be sending <Col N="1411" /> an invitation to them to visit him or will he be going to Belfast to wish them well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would dearly like to go to Belfast to wish them well if a suitable opportunity presented itself.  I did not turn my mind to the question of inviting them to come to see me but now that the Deputy has raised it I will consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Republic of Ireland team were going to Spain &mdash; we all wish they were &mdash; the Taoiseach would have been making efforts to try to contact them to wish them well, he would be paying a visit to the team's headquarters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would imagine that that type of thinking would be invading the Taoiseach's mind.  What effort is the Taoiseach making to let it be known to the Irish Football Association that he would be available to go to wish them well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not done anything as yet about the matter.  However, now that the Deputy has raised it, I shall consider what might be done.  I readily acknowledge that I have been given very valuable advice as to how to play the game.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will specify the constitutional amendments he envisaged when he referred to them in his address at the White House, Washington on 17 March, 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my White House speech on March 17 last to which the Deputy's question refers, I was speaking about the obstacles which need to be overcome in seeking to bring the partition of our country to an end and in this context I stated that we would make <Col N="1412" /> whatever constitutional arrangements might be thought to be needed.</P>
      <P>I have spoken previously on a number of occasions, as I did on April 16 last, at a function commemorating the Bi-Centenary of Grattan's Parliament, of a new constitution for the whole island under which we might see a legislative assembly which spoke for the whole nation.</P>
      <P>As I said on that occasion, our aim should be a political structure for the whole island which would banish exclusion, discrimination, bias and even condescension from Ireland forever; a political structure in which all traditions would find their representation as of right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Which question is the Taoiseach answering?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am answering Question No. 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing the seeming willingness on the part of the Taoiseach now to engage in constitutional reform, would he not think it worthwhile to begin to implement some policies of constitutional reform at this stage, rather than wait for some unspecified events to happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy should be well aware of my position in that regard, which I have stated on a number of occasions.  It would be a futile exercise to start making changes in our Constitution in order to accommodate different traditions without having the participation of the representatives of those traditions in the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That reply by the Taoiseach is at variance with his willingness to discuss with me the question of constitutional review, as stated in the Dáil some weeks ago.  I hope that the Taoiseach has not changed his mind on the question of constitutional review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will communicate with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Taoiseach's position to be that he, as most of <Col N="1413" /> us, would like to have an input from the people of Northern Ireland into what way we should frame a new Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential.  In what way does the Taoiseach hope to reach that objective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, I would like to see a major input into that situation from the London Government. I hope that this process can be pursued constructively through the Anglo-Irish process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A final supplementary question from Deputy Harte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>My question arises from the Taoiseach answering a different question. I have asked the Taoiseach in what way he plans to or believes he can obtain an opinion from all the people of Northern Ireland.  He has answered that he seeks an opinion from the London Government. In what way does the Taoiseach hope to obtain an opinion from the Northern people, as outlined in his political thinking, to which I subscribe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward, ideally, to a situation where we will be all sitting around a table discussing this very matter, discussing new political structures and possibly a new Constitution for the island as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach has a commitment to have a referendum in the future on certain constitutional issues, surely he must consider it worthwhile to include other items which are unacceptable to the Northern Ireland community which will need changing in Southern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already dealt with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, if success is as lacking in the next 50 years as it was in the <Col N="1414" /> last 50, must we wait 50 years for the objectives at which the Taoiseach aims?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It means that we rededicate ourselves to working towards that objective and trying to bring about the sort of situation which I have envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach mean that we have not tried to do that in the past?  People have tried and have not been successful.  If success is as lacking in the future as it was in the past, must we wait 50 or 100 years to have a Constitution in this part of Ireland to which the Taoiseach aspires and with which we all agree?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that in these matters the thing to do is to devise a constructive, forward-looking policy and work to try to make this succeed. If it does not succeed, then we shall have to consider alternatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not just a question of saying what we would like to see in our Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the statements which the Taoiseach has just made, in the event that the President refers the private rents legislation again to the Supreme Court, would the Taoiseach consider the possibility of joining to the pro-life question a constitutional amendment in relation to clarifying the balance between the rights of private property and the common good?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate matter. As I have already indicated, my electoral commitment is to bring this forward as a separate constitutional amendment and I intend to do that.</P>

      <P>Yes.  There are a number of events planned to commemorate the Bicentenary of Grattan's Parliament.</P>
      <P>Some events have already taken place &mdash; a reception hosted by myself in the old Irish Parliament House, at the Bank of Ireland, College Green.  This was held on 16 April 1982, which was the actual bicentenary date of Grattan's &ldquo;Declaration of Independence&rdquo; speech.</P>
      <P>An article on Grattan's Parliament, by Professor J.C. Beckett was included in the April edition of the Department of Foreign Affairs' publication <i>Ireland Today.</i> At the moment also a school pack and film strip, which has been prepared by the Department of Education, is being distributed to schools throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Other planned events are:&mdash;(i) a major exhibition covering the Grattan era to be held in the National Museum. This exhibition will commence towards the end of June; (ii) a commemorative plaque will be unveiled on the site of Grattan's former home on St. Stephen's Green; (iii) a bust in stone of Henry Grattan will be unveiled in Merrion Square Park later this year; (iv) a commemorative stamp to be issued in October.</P>

      <P>Was the Taoiseach aware, when he made this statement referred to by Deputy Harte, that to the members of Grattan's Parliament the ideals and purposes of the United Irishmen and of Wolfe Tone were poison?  How does he reconcile his attachment &mdash; or does it go any further than attending receptions or throwing them with public money &mdash; how does he reconcile the policy of Grattan's Parliament with the professed allegiance which his party has always shown to Wolfe Tone?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question is based on some apparent statement which I did not make.  I believe that Grattan's Parliament was a very important event in our history which made a great contribution, particularly to our economic development, and I do not feel it necessary to regard admiration for one particular position as necessarily being equivalent to condemning another.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Immediately I became aware of this incident I decided, as Head of Government, that it was sufficiently serious to merit full investigation by the appropriate authorities, and I so directed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that the appropriate Minister to direct an inquiry into an event of this type is Deputy Wilson?  What powers was the Taoiseach purporting to exercise in giving any directions in this matter at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave this direction in pursuance of the general power which resides in me as Head of the Government. The Deputy must realise that this incident took place on a Sunday afternoon and at the early stages it was not quite clear under whose auspices the matter correctly fell.  It could have been a naval matter, it could have been a fisheries matter or, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, it could have been a matter for the Minister for Transport.  The action <Col N="1420" /> I took on that day was to ask all the different bodies who could conceivably have an interest in the matter to look into it immediately.  Subsequently it transpired that the matter is one more appropriately dealt with by the Minister for Transport under the legislation which he administers and that course of action is being followed.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Now that the Taoiseach has taken an interest in this tragic if outrageous occurence, could he tell us whether he has any proposals to see that the skipper and owners of this vessel whose livelihoods depend on it will be properly compensated and put back in business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the validity of that suggestion and I assure the Deputy that the matter is being actively pursued by Bord Iascaigh Mhara who are in consultation with the skipper and an offer has actually been made to him with precisely the objectives the Deputy has mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give a specific undertaking of that nature because the Deputy will understand that the situation at present is that a preliminary investigation has been made by the Minister for Transport with a view to deciding whether to set up a formal inquiry.  In advance of that inquiry and its findings it is difficult to decide at this stage what might or might not be done.  I assure the Deputy, and I know the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry has this question in mind, that we are anxious to ensure that the skipper in question does not suffer any detrimental effect as a result of this incident.</P>

      <i>Note:</i> It should be borne in mind that changes made in the administration of the social welfare regulations and other changes in the coverage of the live register affect the comparability of these figures over such a long period of years.</P>
    <P>The principal considerations which affect the comparability of the figures are:</P>
    <P> (a)  The figures for the period from 1966 to 1982 exclude persons on systematic short-time and persons aged 65 years and over whereas such persons are included in the figures for earlier years.</P>
    <P>(b)  The conditions under which persons are eligible for social insurance cover have been changed from time to time.</P>
    <P>(c)  Following the introduction of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1965, smallholders were excluded from the live register as from January 1966.</P>
    <P>(d)  The operation of employment period orders for the period from 1960 to 1966 and again in 1971 excluded certain persons from the receipt of unemployment assistance between March and November in each of these years.</P>
    <P>(e)  The conditions which applied to single women and widows who were applicants for unemployment assistance were relaxed from 1 October 1978. </P>

I share the Deputy's wish to see parents having an adequate role in the operation of our educational system.

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>Speech training and drama form an integral part of the programme in national schools.  It is a fundamental constituent of the new curriculum and a detailed syllabus for all students is outlined in the programme.</P>
      <P>If the parents concerned wish to organise additional classes in speech and drama, for which I understand a fee would be payable, it would be open to them to do so outside school hours.  The use of the school building for such classes after school hours would be subject to the general conditions applicable including the permission of the board of management.</P>
      <P>It would not be open to me under the terms of the school transport scheme to provide free transport to enable such an extra activity to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this school &mdash; I am sure it applies to other schools &mdash; is a small school in a rural area which is not served by a public bus service? Does that not militate against children having speech and drama classes? There are two ways to do it, either to permit the classes during normal school hours or to have the Minister provide them with a school bus.  Is not the Minister, in effect, debarring children in all rural areas without bus services from having the benefit of this type of training, which is readily available to city children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that children are being debarred from this type of facility because, as I pointed out in my reply, speech training and drama are a constituent or integral part <Col N="1429" /> of the programme in national schools. Therefore, such training can be and is provided during normal school hours. The Deputy also asked whether there could be provision for an additional class specifically catering for speech and drama teaching outside normal hours as is being done in a number of schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in this school 30 of the 55 children attending, have, through their parents, opted for speech and drama classes?  The parents have available the services of a teacher and they have made provision for the payment of the teacher's salary.  However, they are unable to proceed further with the scheme because the Department have refused permission to have these classes during school hours.  If that is not permitted the whole project falls, because the children have not got transport to get home after normal school-leaving time.  That is the problem in the case of this rural school.  The Minister has said it is an authorised part of the curriculum but the practicality is that it cannot be done in a small rural school because there is no public transport.  It must be either within the school hours or the Minister must provide the transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the point the Deputy is making but does he in turn not recognise that it could be extremely expensive and complex to organise a second system of school transport to cater for after-hours activities?  It would be unreasonable to begin to make arrangements of that nature for one or two schools without organising it for all schools.  It would not be practicable to organise two sequences of school transport in rural areas.  As I indicated in my reply, in the context of the existing school transport system it is not open to me to make any such special arrangements for any one school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister is saying is, in effect, a discrimination against children attending rural schools: they are being discriminated against, in effect, by being unable to get the benefit of this <Col N="1430" /> course which the Minister agrees is part of the curriculum.  Whatever expense may be necessary to dispense with such discrimination ought to be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that for 20 years I have been aware of many forms of discrimination being operated at various levels of education, depending on the context of rural or urban children and children from different social categories.  The desirable objective is to have equality of opportunity for all pupils in comparable circumstances. I do not see how I can organise special arrangements for one school in this instance without considering the consequences for other schools.  Of course the other side of the coin is that if I cannot arrange it for all schools I do not think it would be right to prevent such schools that are in a position to offer additional activities for their pupils from doing so. That would be just as undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are difficulties in providing a further bus service, the situation could be met if the Department, with the approval of the school board, allowed these classes to take place during school hours.  That would not cost anything. All that is required is the Minister's permission.  Would the Minister do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputy that we examine the situation more fully in that context.  If necessary, we could then have a further question or a discussion on it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As already stated by me, I propose at <Col N="1431" /> an early date to establish a working party representative of management and teaching interests as well as of parent views to advise on the maintenance of discipline in schools, with special reference to the problem of disruptive pupils.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated, the position is that the prevailing code relating to school discipline was published in January last.  The question of dealing with any problems of school discipline arising from the new arrangements is of interest and concern to school managements, and parents in some instance.  There have been a number of discussions on the subject and, as I have indicated, as a result of those discussions I have arranged to put in motion the setting up of a representative committee. In the interim, essentially it is a matter for the management of each school to decide on the appropriate action to be taken.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals under consideration at present for the introduction of legislation to provide for the registration of architects.  I understand that prior to October 1979 negotiations were taking place between the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and the various bodies concerned but that agreement could not be reached in the matter.  As the Deputy is aware, the draft EEC directive in the field of architecture has been under discussion since 1967 and is still under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The appropriate qualifications in respect of level of courses in regional technical colleges are awarded by the National Council for Educational Awards.  Regional technical colleges to be established in the future will be administered on the same basis and provide similar courses, with due regard to variations related to regional needs, as existing colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The purport of the question is that the standard of the award for the regional technical colleges should be those of degrees to put them on a par with the universities.  Would the Minister favour that view and ensure that that will be done rather than awarding a lesser qualification?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no restriction as to the level of qualification which a regional technical college may be able to provide for its students.  But the question of whether a degree should be awarded is a matter between the regional technical college concerned and the <Col N="1438" /> NCEA who have discussions with the college and agree on the various levels of curriculum and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is agreed that it would be appropriate that, where a regional technical college would conduct a full-time three-or four-year course the status of a degree would be awarded to graduates rather than something less such as a diploma or something of that sort?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to give a non-qualified or blanket agreement to arrangements of that kind because the other consideration which has to be taken into account is whether or not it would be appropriate to extend in any one instance the number of institutions offering a degree level course in a specific subject.  For example, in a relatively specialised area in which there might be a comparatively small number of students it would be wasteful of very expensive educational resources to allow a large number of institutions to offer these courses.  Decisions as to the number and nature of degree level courses offered by bodies such as regional technical colleges should be decided on in the context not only of their own circumstances but of their relationship to third level institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that, if it becomes the pattern that regional technical colleges award a qualification of a lesser status than degree, that would downgrade their status and make them second class third level institutions not comparable with other third level institutions?

      <P>I can only answer by referring to the experience of the existing regional technical colleges. They were first put forward in 1967 and since they opened their doors over a decade ago they have proved their value and have been accepted as institutions of <Col N="1439" /> third level education which have no difficulty in attracting students.  They have had no difficulty in having their worth and value recognised both in the educational community and the community at large.</P>

I recall that when the scheme was introduced it <Col N="1441" /> only operated for students who took up the grant in the year in which they sat the examination.  It was to improve the scheme that the two year deferral was introduced.  Various other improvements have been built into the scheme since it was introduced.

    <P>The rule at present is that in order to qualify for a grant a candidate must have obtained successes as follows in the leaving certificate examination of the year in question: Either (1) Grade C or a higher grade in higher or common level papers in four or more subjects; or (2) Grade C or a higher grade in higher or common level papers in Irish and in two other subjects or in mathematics and in two other subjects; or (3) in the case of a candidate who will pursue an approved course in science (including agricultural science) or engineering, Grade C or a higher grade in higher or common level papers in two of the following subjects: mathematics, applied mathematics, <Col N="1442" /> physics, chemistry, physics and chemistry, agricultural science, technical drawing, agricultural economics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if, in view of the recent collapse in Dublin city of two old buildings with consequent danger to the public, and the total failure of his Department to respond to repeated requests from Dublin Corporation and public representatives to have the 24-hour telephone service to the dangerous buildings section of the corporation repaired, he will indicate in the interests of public safety when service will be restored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Leyden);</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that the dangerous buildings service provided by Dublin Corporation should not be impeded for want of telephone facilities. The telephone number of the service is 746235, which is answered in Belvedere Court during normal office hours.  This telephone is working normally.  However, there is a fault on a tie-line to an after-office-hours location.  Callers to 746235 after office hours are advised to ring an alternative number 420174.  Both 746235 and 420174 are afforded the highest priority.  And investigation is being carried out into the fault on the tie-line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that buildings do not have the kind of discipline that you or I have and, therefore, do not arrange to fall down during office hours?  Arising from that unfortunate lack of discipline on their part there is a necessity for a 24-hour emergency service and a caller who rings the first telephone number which the Minister cited to the House will get an automatic answering service.  The reaction of many people in panic on hearing <Col N="1447" /> such a service is to abandon listening to it any further.  The problem is one of the maintenance section of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs fixing this tie-line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in a profession similar to that of Deputy Quinn, and so I am well aware of the difficulties with buildings and the possible danger involved in the collapse of a building.  I assure the Deputy that I have given specific instructions that this tie-line will be repaired forthwith and I hope that that will be cleared within the next few days.  The facilities have been provided with an answering call on this line which will go to a phone which is numbered.  Both those phones are maintained by my Department on a 24-hours basis.  I thank the Deputy for bringing this to our attention and I assure him that the matter will be attended to as a top priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the suspension of the parcel post service is causing inconvenience to business and to the public generally.  However, I regret that it was necessary to suspend the service because the postmen drivers did not pass the picket placed by the National Busmen's Union at Connolly Station, which is the main distribution centre for the conveyance of parcel mail.  The service remains suspended as the drivers continue not to pass the picket.  Because of the very considerable bulk of daily parcel postings, it is unfortunately not practicable to make alternative arrangements which would enable the service to be fully restored. The question of a limited restoration of the service, which would not involve the normal use of Connolly Station, is under active consideration at present by my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be misinformed. In the short time that I was in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs I learned that about 4,500 bags of mail&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am asking it.  About 4,500 bags of mail are collected there and processed each day.  In an agreement with van drivers they cleared off in a matter of hours three days' accumulation of mail which amounted to something between 12,000 and 13,000 bags per day despite the fact that the general manager of the ITGWU said today that it is 10,000 bags. Bear in mind that there is a chain-link conveyor system between Sheriff Street and Connolly Station capable of moving 12,000 bags per day as against a need of 4,500 bags per day.  Is the Minister telling the House that there is no way in which this dispute can be resolved?  People in Donegal must cross the Border to post goods to other parts of the Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The chain conveyor link is in use for letter mail.  That service is being provided and is up-to-date.  The Deputy should also be aware that we are <Col N="1449" /> still delivering a substantial quantity of parcels from both the UK and the United States.  Post office workers are not passing this picket and for that reason the parcel post is suspended for the moment. The huge bulk of the parcel post is the problem but we are hoping to establish a limited restoration of service.  At the same time we are urging that the workers should pass the pickets.  Leaders of the Post Office Workers' Union are asking their members to pass the pickets and members of other unions are doing so. Deputy Harte has made a very good point about the seriousness of this problem for small industries and so on.  If the workers passed the pickets full service could be restored in a very short time.</P>

      <P>As announced by the previous Government, the financial allocation for overtime in the Post Office Estimate in the current year has been greatly reduced &mdash; from an expenditure of over £34 million last year at the pay rates in force throughout 1981 to £23.7 million in the current year at the increased rates of pay applicable throughout 1982.  To keep within the reduced provision, the volume of overtime worked throughout the Department has been scaled down drastically. Despite this other measures have to be taken to keep within the approved allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of these measures is to curtail, on an experimental basis, with effect from 19 April the number of subscribers in the Dublin area whose telephones are repaired after normal working hours. <Col N="1452" /> The cost of calling out staff to attend to an individual fault can be as much as £50 and in quite a number of cases where staff are called out it is not possible to repair the fault until more staff become available during normal working hours. The intention is that the new arrangements should be operated in a flexible way and with discretion to go outside the limits of the revised arrangements if individual circumstances warrant it.  The effects of the restrictions will be monitored on a continuing basis and changes made if these are considered essential.</P>
    <P>All categories whose telephones were formerly repaired outside normal working hours will, of course, continue to get priority attention during normal hours.</P>
    <P>In the experimental arrangements introduced, staff are not being called out to repair doctors' telephones, but doctors' telephones will continue to get priority attention within normal working hours.  The position is being monitored continuously and if it is found essential to give attention to some doctors' telephones outside normal working hours, that will be done.  In the meantime, the aim is that the new arrangements should be worked flexibly and with discretion to vary them in individual cases where the circumstances warrant that.</P>

The connection of doctors' telephones involves the lives of people.  Secondly, his reply to the question by Deputy Owen is one that the House can hardly accept because the Minister said he was not aware whether people paid to be on the A list.  Does he not accept that he is paid to know whether people pay to be on the A list?</P>

I said that the system devised for the saving of money in order to keep within the budgetary limits laid down by Deputy FitzGerald and his Government and which showed a drop of £10.8 million, without taking cognisance of increased pay rates for 1982 over 1981, was thought out on an experimental basis to give people an opportunity to make representations to my Department so that we might get the best possible service for the users of the telephones.</P>

Standing Order 25 provides that the Taoiseach announces the Order in which Government business is to be taken each day.  There is no motion before the House and there can be no debate.  Strictly speaking there cannot even be comment or questions.  The Chair, however, over the years has permitted a practice that questions may be asked about the business of the day, about the taking of other business on the Order Paper, about business the Government have promised to bring forward, about arrangements for sittings and as to when Bills or other documents needed in the House will be circulated.  Other matters are irrelevant and it is disorderly to attempt to arrange them.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a point of order.  First of all, A Cheann Comhairle, with respect to your ruling, you ruled that the matters which may be raised on the Order of Business include questions as to when Bills or other documents needed in the House would be circulated.  The matter I was raising was whether, in fact, a Bill needed to be circulated in respect of this matter which arises urgently because of the imminence of the by-election.  I should like to submit, in the first instance, that the question I put is in order in the terms of your own statement as to what is appropriate on the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, the point you made was that questions may be asked about the business of the day and about the taking of other business on the Order Paper.  That covers everything on the Order Paper.  Whatever follows after that must, therefore, in all logic, relate to matters not on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It covers items on the Order Paper.  This is not on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would you allow me to complete my submission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be glad to listen to the Deputy's submission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>First, there is the business of the day; secondly, taking other <Col N="1644" /> business on the Order Paper; thirdly, business the Government promised to bring forward which is not on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>So what is on the Order Paper is not an exclusive factor. Fourthly, arrangements for sittings and when Bills or other documents needed in the House will be circulated.  By definition that is a Bill not on the Order Paper because what is on the Order Paper has been included already under the second heading.  What I am talking about now is a Bill which may be needed in the House and what the Government's intentions are with regard to it, a Bill to amend the law to fill a gap which has been alleged to exist in the law.  In raising it in relation to something which is not on the Order Paper, I am acting in accordance with your ruling which makes it quite clear that &ldquo;Bills or other documents needed in the House&rdquo; refers to Bills or other documents not on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy FitzGerald's interpretation were right, anything could be raised.  We could ask for Bills on anything.  I am afraid Deputy FitzGerald is misinterpreting the Order of Business.  I am afraid he is misinterpreting the regulations and rules about the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you have already agreed with me in regard to the third item: business which the Government promise to bring forward. By definition that is something which is not on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The second point is other business on the Order Paper.  The third is business the Government promise <Col N="1645" /> to bring forward and, fourth, arrangements for sittings and as to when Bills or other documents needed by the House will be circulated.  By definition those Bills or documents are not on the Order Paper or they would have been covered by the phraseology about the taking of other business on the Order Paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>This is not the first time this matter was raised.  Deputy FitzGerald is not the first person to raise it.  It has been raised over the years.  The matter was clarified on a number of occasions. If the Deputy comes up to my office I will show him the references.  I am not trying to obstruct the leader of the Opposition.  Far from it.  I, too, am bound by the rules.  I am not trying to thwart any efforts on the Deputy's part to raise matters in the House.  He is at liberty to raise the matter with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I hope he will.  I felt equally frustrated at times about the Order of Business and the rules of the House.  We all do.  But I think the obligation is on us to attempt to change it in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I would like to accede to your request but I am bound by the rules too.  I know what you are trying to do, and I agree with you, but it cannot be done here.  I think it can be done only at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I think also that the matter could be clarified a little more &mdash; it is vague &mdash; but we have looked up the references on it and it has been stated very clearly over the years that matters <Col N="1646" /> like this do not arise on the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make the point &mdash; as I made it before &mdash; that until you go to the Chair, it is a matter of interpretation.  Such matters were raised frequently on the Order of Business with a view to finding out when certain things were going to come forward which were not on the Order Paper and if such a ruling existed previously it had certainly fallen into disrepute long before you took over the Chair.  I still want to contest your interpretation.  Having done that &mdash; I have to refer to it because I have no alternative in the matter at this stage &mdash; I would like to make another point of order.  I understood you to say, a Cheann Comhairle, that one of the factors that governed one of your rulings was that it would be unfair for a Private Notice Question to be taken because it would have meant that a question on the Order Paper then would have been pre-empted. I have been through the Order Paper. The question seems to be Question No. 332; is that not right?</P>

      <P>Sorry, Deputy, I took the decision on the basis that I had received a question for answering tomorrow. You see, you did not make the decision; you did not see the question.  I am the Ceann Comhairle and that is why I took the decision, because I was aware. But it does not mean that I must inform each and every one of you that I am going to get questions tomorrow.  The Deputy understands that.  I took the decision on the basis of information which I had. Therefore it is not a case of your not being aware of it because you did not take the decision.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Justice if he will express his Government's concern at the reported increase in the incidents of personation during the recent general election; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  &mdash;George Birmingham. </P>

This would create havoc in the House.  It would create a lot of problems for all Members &mdash; that any Deputy who found that his question was numbered 300, or 400 or 500 could try to raise it by Private Notice Question, and his argument could readily be that his question will never be reached.  Unfortunately, if there are more interruptions, such as the Deputy's, we will never get through any business of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, a Cheann Comhairle, during the exchange <Col N="1653" /> between Deputy FitzGerald and yourself you made a ruling which I think has very serious implications for parliamentary democracy and I should like to get clarification of it in case I misunderstood you.</P>
      <P>You said, I think, that Standing Orders were ambiguous or not clear on certain matters and you said that these should be cleared up by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  You also said that if an item does not actually appear on the Order Paper the subject matter could not be raised during the Order of Business. As I understand it, there is long established precedent that matters which did not appear on the Order Paper have been raised repeatedly on the Order of Business, have been allowed by your predecessors and by yourself on previous occasions and have been answered by the Taoiseach or the appropriate Minister. Departure from that practice would, to say the least, be of very grave concern to all Members who have any regard for parliamentary democracy.  Could I have clarification on whether or not that was your ruling and, if so, on what was it based?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall read this out again for the benefit of Members: Standing Order No. 25 provides that the Taoiseach announce the order in which Government business be taken each day. There is no motion before the House and there can be no debate.  Strictly speaking, there cannot even be comment or question. The Chair, however, over the years has permitted a practice that questions may be asked about the business of the day, about the taking of other business on the Order Paper, about business that the Government had promised to bring forward, about arrangements for sittings and as to when Bills or other documents needed in the House will be circulated. Other matters are irrelevant and it is disorderly to attempt to raise them. Deputies therefore (1) may only ask questions, (2) are confined to questions covered by the practice referred to above and (3) may not refer to the merits of any matter or make statements or speeches. If a Deputy wishes to raise matters other than the taking of business he must use <Col N="1654" /> some other procedure.  He cannot use the Order of Business as an instant question time.  If Deputies consider there is inadequacy in existing procedures then the matter should be raised in the Committee on Procedures and Privileges and new and revised procedures proposed.  That Chair cannot change procedures.  That ruling has been given by my predecessors on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>There was reference to other business or documents or Bills. Surely &ldquo;other business&rdquo; could be something which the Members desired to be on the Order Paper and it would be appropriate that it should be raised on the Order of Business precisely because it was not there.  Other Bills or legislation which a Member thought should be introduced or should be contemplated by the Government should also be proper to the Order of Business for mention and have been allowed at least for the past 16 or 17 years in my personal experience.</P>

The leader of Fine Gael has handed in a notice of motion for tomorrow that Standing Orders be suspended in order to allow the matter to be dealt with.  You have ruled that a four-day notice of motion is necessary for that.  I believe the Standing Orders confer on the Chair a discretion. I submit to you that you should exercise that discretion in this particular case in favour of Deputy FitzGerald.  Having regard to the personalities involved in this controversy it is of the greatest importance that not alone, to use an old legal cliche, must fair play prevail but it must be seen to prevail.  This is something in which the people of the country are taking a very great interest and about which they are very concerned.  I appeal to the Chair, having regard to the particular <Col N="1657" /> circumstances and the unique issues involved here, to exercise your discretion in favour of allowing the motion to suspend Standing Orders to be moved tomorrow.</P>

Do you accept that the practice, procedure and precedents established by your predecessors have a binding effect on you to a greater degree than the Standing Orders which you read out or indeed any ruling that might be made at a particular time?

      <P>On a point of order, I want to submit, as Deputy Fitzpatrick has submitted, that common sense always prevailed in a situation like this.  While it is not inaccurate for you to quote Standing Orders it should be appreciated by you that convention in the House always recognised that if a Deputy raised a matter on the Order of Business in the judgment of the Chair that business was important.  The Chair exercised a discretion and allowed it.  I submit if you had done that today we would have been on the Business of the House at 4 o'clock and there would not have been a disruption <Col N="1659" /> of business as has happened.  I also want to emphasise the point made by Deputy Cluskey that the conventions which govern the House over and above the Standing Orders of the House are being eroded.  I am afraid that your interpretation might be slightly biased.</P>

      <P>The House has been put in an impossible situation.  You ruled out the Private Notice Question which is one way of raising urgent business.  You have now created, whatever you say, a precedent by going back on the very rules you quoted because you have interpreted them in a way you have not previously interpeted them, nor in a way that any of your predecessors have interpreted them.</P>
      <P>There is a motion standing in my name on the Order Paper concerning a by-election in my constituency.  The matter that was originally raised by the Leader of the Opposition is vitally important and urgent because of that motion.  I want to ask your advice.  How can I move that motion if the Government are not prepared to stand up in the House and say what they will do as a result of a recent court judgment?  I refer to what Deputy Fitzpatrick said and there is no use in you or I hiding this fact.  This is why there are so many people in the press gallery.  The crunch of the matter is the personalities involved.  If you persist in your ruling it will go around the country that there is a massive cover-up of something scandalous. I do not think you would want that to go about.  I ask you to reconsider the extraordinary interpretation you are putting on the piece of paper in front of you because to any ordinary person reading that paper your interpretation is not consistent.</P>

      <P>In the course of the earlier discussion reference was made to Question No. 332 which stands in my name.  I would like to make clear to you, because you seem to have had some regard to this, that that question was tabled by me when the House first sat after the general election.  It was tabled long before any court case took place and <Col N="1661" /> was put down without any particular reference to any particular case.  I tabled that question to the Taoiseach in the anticipation that the House might find the Taoiseach's views on this subject of particular interest.  When the question was transferred from the Taoiseach to the Minister for Justice I protested.  So far as you appear to think that this question has some relevance I make the point to you that any other Deputy on this side of the House tabling a question in relation to electoral offences to the Taoiseach is likely to face exactly the same situation of a shunting exercise from the Taoiseach to the Minister for Justice or the Minister for the Environment because that is the precedent which has already been set during this Dáil session.</P>

That is a matter for the relevant Department and what the Government consider is the appropriate Department.  The Deputy's leader will confirm this fact.  I did not refer to the Deputy's question.  I refered to a question on tomorrow's Order Paper.</P>

The question that is down for tomorrow has been transferred to the Minister for the Environment and, consequently, it will not be reached for many weeks.  I would ask you in considering whether this motion should be taken tomorrow, to take steps to allow the Taoiseach to reply to it.  We would hope that after spending three hours on the matter already, the Taoiseach would volunteer to answer it as he has done frequently before.  Notably, he is not volunteering in this case. When you are considering your decision for tomorrow I suggest that you make a special arrangement for this purpose having regard to the fact that the writ for the by-election is on the Order Paper and in the ordinary way will be moved next week.  It is a matter of urgent importance that we know what steps will be taken to deal with this matter.  If the question were to be answered by the Taoiseach there would be no need for any special arrangement but that is not the case and in the exceptional circumstances in which we now find ourselves I would ask you to give special consideration to the motion tomorrow morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>From his experience as Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald should realise that questions are directed to the appropriate Ministers.  I think the Deputy will agree also that in considering whether to use his discretion about allowing a shorter time, the Ceann Comhairle must weigh up the circumstances and determine whether there are sufficient grounds for such action.  The Chair must not be seen to act capriciously on such matters.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, it is regrettable that this matter has become linked with the pending by-election. What is at issue here is much more fundamental <Col N="1663" /> and serious than that.  What is happening here this evening is hitting directly at parliamentary democracy and at the rights of elected representatives.  It is regrettable that some Deputies have made the plea of special circumstances because of a pending by-election.  Parliamentary democracy is being undermined by your ruling, Sir, and that cannot be justified.</P>

The question of what can be or cannot be permitted is raised time and again on the Order of Business.  In my capacity as Ceann Comhairle I must apply the rules of the House.

Standing Order No. 53 provides that in the case of great disorder the Chair may adjourn the Dáil without a question being put or he may suspend any sitting for a time to be named by him.

I am very definitely of the opinion that that should be done, that in the interest of this House and of the integrity of the courts, it should be so referred but if it is to be referred to the High Court it must be referred before Tuesday next.  If you insist on a four-day notice of motion there will be no possibility of raising the matter in the House before Tuesday next whereas it should be raised and an opportunity <Col N="1665" /> given to have it ventilated here before that time elapses.</P>

The second matter of importance is that irrespective of what decision you may come to this evening, we on this side of the House want it to go on record that we are not accepting that there is to be any change in the long-established precedents of raising matters of fundamental importance on the Order of Business.  I have been a Member of this House since 1969 and regardless of who has occupied the Chair at any time the practice has been that Deputies from any side of the House were allowed to raise matters of importance.  If you continue with rulings of this kind there will be many long and contentious arguments in the House such as we have had this afternoon.  This will permeate through the entire running of the business of the House and will make the whole operation very difficult.</P>

However, with great respect there is a perception on this side of the House that the Chair has radically altered his interpretation of the rules on the issue of what can be raised on the Order of Business. I should like to ask the Chair to reconsider his attitude if this side of the House can produce examples over the last number of months where the Chair accepted such matters willingly and directed the Taoiseach and Ministers to answer issues which were not then on the Order Paper and, in some cases, have not since been put on the Order Paper.

Such questions, by implication and explicitly, were allowed by the Chair. There is a distinction and there are many examples on the record of the House if the Chair cares to look.</P>

      <P>I have endeavoured on all occasions to be helpful to all Members and, indeed, to bend the rules in favour of Members because I had frustrating experiences as a Member in Opposition.  For that reason I have always been sympathetic to Members.  I gave Deputy FitzGerald's motion deep consideration and he is aware that I considered every aspect of it before I rejected it.  I did not reach my decision lightly but I am bound by the rules of the House.  The House would lose respect if I disregarded those rules.  The House must understand that on all occasions where there was doubt I gave the benefit of the doubt to Members.  I adopted that attitude in relation to private notice questions and matters on the Adjournment. Where there was a doubt at all I always came down in favour of Members.  Deputies wonder if I am not considering their <Col N="1669" /> interests but I should like to tell them that I am.  I have given this matter a lot of consideration.</P>

      <P>I understand that the position now is that the Chair is being asked to consider the matter and has indicated that he will.  In order to assist the Chair in his consideration I should like to remind him that five or six weeks ago when Deputy FitzGerald asked the Taoiseach in the course of a question to make a statement in connection with his visit to the President of the United States, the Chair, after some controversy, advised Deputy FitzGerald that he should not have put down a Parliamentary Question but should have raised the matter on the Order of Business.  How does the Chair reconcile that ruling with his ruling today?</P>

      <P>I will explain that to the Deputy because I am fully aware of what happened.  I was referring to a request by the Leader of the Opposition to make a statement in reply to the Taoiseach.  I stated that if he wanted the Taoiseach to make a statement as such without answering a parliamentary question the means at his disposal was not by way of a parliamentary question.  Normally after a Taoiseach has been somewhere and is anxious to make a statement, he gives notice of his intention to do so and the Leader of the Opposition seeks permission to reply.</P>

The Chair has now said that it would not apply to a parliamentary question, but if the Leader of the Opposition &mdash; of the Labour Party, Fine Gael, Sinn Féin the Workers' Party and others &mdash; request the Taoiseach to make a statement, that is perfectly admissible.

The Chair, on its own initiative, as I understand, told the Taoiseach that he could make a statement by way of reply and also indicated that Deputy FitzGerald could make a statement.

      <P>If I do not persist in making this ruling, it is a recipe for parliamentary chaos.  Deputy Cluskey must reluctantly admit this fact.  I will quote what a predecessor of mine said to Deputy Cluskey as reported in volume 326, column 543 of the Official Report on 29 January 1981:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to repeat what I said before. If the House, in its wisdom, decides on <Col N="1674" /> changes, I will faithfully carry out and put into effect whatever these changes may be.  When I suggested yesterday that the matter could be discussed by the Whips, it was in the context that I believed that discussions would be taking place on the whole matter of procedure generally.  It is open to Deputy Cluskey, or to any other Deputy, to raise this matter at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or through the Whips.  Deputies will accept that if we have a situation where a Deputy can ask a question which he decides is important, without any reference to the Ceann Comhairle, to the Department or the Minister concerned, the Deputy would be assuming the responsibility and the rights and duties of the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    <P>They are the rules.  I am quoting what my predecessor said.  Deputy Jim Mitchell.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Deputy Cluskey is absolutely right.  This goes to the very core of parliamentary democracy.  He is wrong when he says that we are wrong to bring in the question of the by-election, because the two things are under attack.  The court case concerned, the source or cause of that court case and the ruling of that court case, is an attack on democracy.  The Chair's ruling is an attack on the democracy of this House.  We have a twofold reason for concern.  I know the Chair too long to believe that it would want to attack democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle.  I will make a statement on the meeting of the European Council which I attended, together with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in Brussels on 29-30 March.  As I indicated before the Easter recess, I regret that the pressures of business prevented me from reporting to the House, as I would normally wish to do, as soon as possible after the meeting.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that the dates of the meeting were close to the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome.  This silver jubilee was marked by a ceremony to commemorate that historic event.  This took the form of an academic session, for which the members of the European Council were joined by the members of the other institutions of the Community, as well as by persons who formerly held office in the Community, or who otherwise made a signal contribution to its development.</P>
      <P>The commemoration was marked by satisfaction with what has been achieved, tempered by preoccupation with current difficulties in the Community and a keen awareness of how much has yet to be accomplished in pursuit of the Treaty's declared objective of &ldquo;an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe&rdquo;.  I avail of this occasion to reiterate our commitment to that goal, at once noble in itself and essential for the welfare of the European peoples, in a world where peace seems increasingly fragile.</P>

    <P>In his address at the academic session, the President of the Council, Mr. Leo <Col N="1676" /> Tindemans, mentioned how far the European citizen takes for granted the advantages of the Community's existence.  He also underlined how the choice of economic integration as an objective necessarily led to the position where Europe, as perceived by our citizens, is a complex of technical and often confusing elements.  These considerations led Mr. Tindemans to stress again the importance of giving the Community a human face and of helping individual Europeans to gain a greater knowledge and appreciation of the priceless heritage we share. An important part in this vital task will be played by the new European Foundation, which we formally agreed to establish at the jubilee celebration.  The foundation will promote mutual understanding and will give form to European solidarity, in particular by stimulating the exchange of ideas, fostering contacts across frontiers among individuals and schemes for the exchange of young people and scientists, as well as a whole range of cultural activities.  The seat of the foundation will be Paris and its programme and modes of action will be further elaborated over the coming months.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the meeting of the European Council itself.  We had an intensive discussion of the economic and social situation in the Community and in the world, including trading and economic relations between the Community, on the one hand, and the United States, Japan, Eastern Europe and the developing countries.  We heard an explanatory statement from the Greek Prime Minister. Mr. Papandreou, about the memorandum his Government has circulated on the position of Greece within the Community and a progress report from Mr. Tindemans, the President of the Council of Ministers, on the mission entrusted to him and Commission President Thorn by the last meeting of the European Council in relation to the Mandate of 30 May 1980.  In the sphere of European Political Co-operation, the discussions ranged over Europe-US relations. East-West relations, including events in Poland, and the Madrid meeting to review the operation of the Helsinki <Col N="1677" /> Final Act, Afghanistan, the Middle East, Central America and Turkey.</P>
    <P>My primary objective, in approaching the meeting, was to ensure that it led to the initiation, at both national and Community level, of a co-ordinated programme of specific measures to deal with unemployment.  As we met, the number out of work in Europe was expected to increase for the ninth successive year.  By the middle of this year, their number will reach 11 million with a strong possibility that, in the absence of worthwhile action, this could reach 12 million by the end of the year.  The average percentage rate for the year as a whole may be about 9 per cent, with rates for Ireland and the UK of over 11 per cent and a rate in excess of 13 per cent for Belgium.  In Ireland, we are regrettably no strangers to rather high rates of unemployment but the rates now prevalent in other member states reflect very substantial year-on-year increases in the numbers without work &mdash; by 49 per cent in the Federal Republic of Germany, 42 per cent in the Netherlands and 24 per cent in the UK and Belgium up to February last compared with 15 per cent in this country over the same period.</P>
    <P>This situation is a result of the depth and duration of the recession which has affected all our economies in recent years.  Last year, there was a decline of 0.5 per cent in Community GDP.  For 1982 the commission had forecast a slight upturn, an increase of 1.6 per cent but this is precarious and highly dependent on international developments affecting interest rates, exchange rates and world trade.</P>
    <P>Looking further ahead, a major source of disquiet is the low level of investment in the Community.  Our own high rate of around 30 per cent of GNP is exceptional and the Community average is less than 20 per cent.  Failure to raise the low rate of capital formation will condemn Europe to economic decline.</P>
    <P>Concern on the counts to which I have referred was registered in the paper submitted to the meeting by the Commission which also suggested certain guidelines for a Community response.  I am happy to say that the general thrust of these <Col N="1678" /> proposals was along lines which we could support.</P>
    <P>At the meeting itself, I reiterated my concern that concerted practical measures be instituted in order to tackle the critical situation we face, with due regard for the correction or avoidance of insupportable imbalances.  I described how the policies being pursued by the Government are contributing to achievement of these objectives in Ireland's case, through adoption of a budget which cut sharply the current budget deficit; through the implementation of necessary taxation in a manner which minimised price increases; through the establishment of moderate patterns of wage settlement; and through the maintenance of a high rate of publicity supported investment.</P>
    <P>I supported the Commission view that higher investment is the key to increases in employment and that new incentives to invest must be introduced.  Referring to the high cost of funds for investment at present.  I called for Community action to reduce these costs and suggested, <i>inter alia,</i> that the proposed increases in the capacity of the Community's credit instruments should be complemented by greater provision for interest subsidies, in the case of loans extended for investments in the less prosperous parts of the Community.  I also proposed that in their application to these regions, the credit instruments should make loans available for social capital, pointing out that in many cases the urban structures in these regions require renewal and rehabilitation if they are to play an effective role as centres of economic and social development. I also stressed the need for Community action to increase the pace of technological change and innovation in the Community.</P>
    <P>In relation to employment and unemployment. I expressed the view that future reports on the economic and social situation in the Community should include analysis of developments in the agricultural sector, having regard to the fact that in some member states the progress or otherwise of agriculture can have significant effects on the level of unemployment and to the pre-eminent position <Col N="1679" /> of the CAP in the array of Community policies.  While welcoming moves to enlarge the scope and capacity of the European Social Fund, I emphasised that this cannot be done at the expense of the priority now given to the less prosperous regions in the administration of the fund's resources.  I proposed that the Commission be asked to prepare further proposals on specific action to deal with unemployment, based on an examination of all the practical suggestions advanced at the Council meeting.  Finally, I pointed out that new action, on a worthwhile scale, cannot be taken within the financial restriction imposed by the existing limitation on Community own resources. Additional resources are required and the need to modify the 1 per cent VAT limit must be faced.</P>
    <P>At successive meetings of the European Council I have pressed these views and while progress was made on some individual issues on those occasions, my predominant feeling was one of disappointment at the apparent lack of will to act with decision and vigour at a Community level.  I am happy to say that reactions in Brussels and the conclusions of last month's meeting which I have had laid before the House some time ago represented a welcome contrast.  While there were certainly differences of emphasis on some issues, I found that my approach was widely shared and I was satisfied that with proper follow-up the outcome would lead to a concerted attack on the economic problems that beset us all.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the areas of international economic policy and the Community's economic and trading relations with the United States, Japan and the developing countries.  The European Council met against the background of some strains in trading relations between the Community and the United States and of concern about the effects on the European economies of very high interest rates in the United States, with their significant influence on rates in Europe.  The continued widening of the trade gap between the Community and Japan has lent urgency to the efforts to put trade relations on a <Col N="1680" /> more balanced and harmonious basis. More recently, concern has extended to Japanese macro-economic and exchange rate policies.  The Community has also been anxious about the persistent failure to make progress in the North-South dialogue between the developing countries and the industrialised world.  All of the matters I have mentioned will come up for discussion at the Summit meeting of industrialised countries in Versailles in June and the Brussels meeting afforded an opportunity for the Heads of State or Government of the Community countries to have a useful exchange of views in preparation for the Versailles meeting. Preparation of the Community approach is continuing in the General Affairs and Ecofin Councils.</P>
    <P>Ireland's position, as a small economy heavily dependent on trade, gives us a major interest in defence of the open multilateral trading system and in resistance to moves towards protectionism. The concept of reciprocity in trade must be interpreted in a broad global manner and not in a narrow bilateral and sectoral way.  As I indicated in my speech last month to the Economic Club of New York, the Community and the United States need to discuss and resolve, as friends, whatever difficulties we may have in the various international fora which have in general served us well in the post-war period.  In any such discussions the Community must show itself to be united and the need for such an approach at Versailles should be manifest in a strong and united defence of the Community's right to a fair share of the world market in agricultural produce. Unity is also strength in economic dealings with Japan and has led to an encouraging start in the opening up of Japanese markets, a trend which the Community must seek to reinforce.</P>
    <P>Because the issue had been remitted to a special meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council which it had been intended to hold shortly after our meeting, we did not discuss the issues arising in connection with the mandate of 30 May 1980 in any detail.  We heard a brief progress report from the President of the Council, Mr. Tindemans, following completion of <Col N="1681" /> an exploratory mission undertaken by him and President Thorn.  As noted in the Presidency's conclusions, the European Council asked the Council to do all in its power to enable decisions to be taken as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the meeting fixed for 3 April did not take place because of the Falkland Islands situation. The subject was taken up again at the meeting in Brussels yesterday.</P>
    <P>I can tell the House that progress was made at that meeting.  For the first time figures are on the table.  Nine delegations agreed on a figure for 1982 which should underlie an appropriate rebate agreement for Britain.  This figure was not regarded as adequate by the British side. They have been asked to reflect on the situation and Foreign Ministers will meet again within ten days.  Ireland, along with eight other delegations, expressed the strong views that no link should be made between the farm price negotiations and the mandate.  The British Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, Mr. Pym, agreed to report this view to his Government and to indicate their response today.</P>
    <P>At one stage there were suggestions that the Agriculture Council commencing today might be postponed.  These were of considerable concern to us and strong pressure by the Minister for Foreign Affairs ensured that the Agriculture Ministers are in fact meeting to day and that negotiations are continuing on the prices package.  I understand that in the response promised yesterday the British are talking about the need for paralles.</P>
    <P>I wish to say that the Government here would regard it as a very serious development if there were to be further delays in fixing farm prices, especially if these arose from a link with the question of budgetary rebates for Britain.  This would in fact run directly counter to one element in the agreement which provided for the original budgetary settlement for the UK, under which that country was a net beneficiary from the Community budget in 1981.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will recall, in the conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council on 30 May 1980 all member states undertook, <Col N="1682" /> particularly during the period when the mandate review for 1982 is under way, to do their best to ensure that Community decisions are taken expenditiously. We would like to see that undertaking honoured in the letter and in the spirit. Community solidarity is indivisible and must apply, in particular, in the annual arrangements under the Community's principal operational policy &mdash; the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>As is usual at meetings of the European Council, the heads of state and Government also considered a number of important issues in the framework of political co-operation.</P>
    <P>All of the Community member states have close and extensive links with the United States and it is right that at a time when the industrial democracies face serious international economic and political problems, the European Council should stress its desire to strengthen these links and to develop consultative arrangements.  The Council expressed its appreciation of President Regan's friendly remarks on the development of European unity made on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome.</P>
    <P>On Afghanistan the Council reiterated its position expressed at earlier meetings and called for a political solution that would entail complete withdrawal of Soviet troops and respect for the independence, sovereignty and non-aligned status of Afghanistan.</P>
    <P>Developments in the Middle East were also considered by the European Council.  The Heads of State or Government called for an end to the unilateral measures taken by Israel such as the dismissal of the democratically elected West Bank mayors and appealed for an end to violence and repression in the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza. They also urged the parties to respect fully the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon where dangerous clashes have occurred recently.  The Council reaffirmed the wish of the Ten, as expressed on previous occasions, to contribute to the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>The situation in Central America was <Col N="1683" /> also discussed by the European Council. As Deputies are aware, the Dáil has expressed the deep concern felt by many Irish people at the continuing tragedy in El Salvador and at the grave violations of human rights there.  The problems which affect El Salvador in so far as they are rooted in the gross social and economic inequities and under-development, are also present in other countries of Central America.</P>
    <P>For this reason, I welcome the attention given by the European Council to the conflict in Central America and in particular its desire to see an end to violence and the restoration of peace through dialogue and respect for democracy and human rights.  A number of important initiatives have been put forward to help reduce the appalling social and economic difficulties in the region and I am glad that the Community member states intend to intensify their own economic assistance to the region.</P>
    <P>The Belgian Foreign Minister and current President of the Council, Mr. Tindemans, reported on his recent visit to Ankara where he spoke with the Turkish authorities on their timetable to restore democratic conditions and on the problem of human rights in Turkey.  The Council trusted that Mr. Tindeman's visit would bring about the improvements desired by the Ten.</P>
    <P>In the margins of the meeting, I had a short informal discussion with the British Prime Minister.  It is not customary to disclose details of conversations of this nature but I can inform the House that we had an exchange of views on a number of matters of mutual concern.  It was arranged that the Minister for Foreign Affairs would meet the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in London on the following day for a full briefing and exchange of views on the proposals of Mr. Prior which have since been released.</P>
    <P>The meeting of the European Council in Brussels was moderately satisfactory. It afforded an opportunity for a valuable exchange at head of state or government level on a range of important political issues at a time of considerable international <Col N="1684" /> difficulty.  In the economic sphere it marked the beginning of a process which, if followed through vigorously, could put the economic weight of the Community behind a programme of economic recovery.  The House may be assured that the Government will do all in their power to see that process carried forward for the benefit of our own people and of all the people of Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the pleasure of attending the academic session of the European Council to which the Taoiseach referred.  I do not think that his summing up of the themes at that academic session does justice to the degree of concern expressed in speeches made there at the failure of the Community to make the progress necessary to be effective in tackling the problems facing the Community.</P>
      <P>Later on in his remarks, the Taoiseach said that the predominant feeling has been disappointment at the apparent lack of will to act with decision and vigour at Community level.  When he was reporting on those sessions, the Taoiseach did not express his disappointment.  He tended to think of them as something that had happened.  On this occasion he told us that this session was different, that it was better.  I cannot say that I share his confidence that the reaction in Brussels at the conclusion of the last meeting represents a welcome contrast to the failure of earlier Council meetings to make practical progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection a problem exists to which the Taoiseach made reference, that of decision making.  He recalled that in May 1980 all member states undertook, when the mandate review for 1982 was under way, to do their best to ensure that Community decisions would be taken expeditiously.  Such good resolutions have been made in the past.  One such was made at the Paris Summit, which decided on the inauguration of the series of European Council meetings.  At that Paris Summit it was decided that decision making procedure should be improved and that this should be done by making greater use of the qualified majority voting procedure.  In the months <Col N="1685" /> that followed that we were in the Chair and we inaugurated that progress.  Before the end of our six months in office we succeeded in reaching a point when qualified voting procedure was taking place on issues which did not involve the vital interests of member states.</P>
    <P>After our Presidency that was allowed to fall into disrepair.  I heard in the Brussels corridors when the Taoiseach was there at the academic meeting that during the Belgian Presidency there were suggestions that the procedures which I had introduced in regard to using qualified majority voting in cases when vital interests were not involved would be reinitiated. It does not seem to me that this has happened.  I regret it and I hope that the Taoiseach and the Government will encourage a further look to be taken at the decision making procedure.  Nobody could be more aware than we in Ireland during the past few months, when the common agriculture policy was under threat, that when vital national interests were at stake the Community had not reached the point at which a country like us could wisely give up our rights and insist that unanimity is necessary; that what has held up progress in the Community has not been the use of the so-called veto in cases when there is a vital national interest involved, but the abuse of it in case when it quite evidently is not.  It is to such problems that I hope the Government will direct their attention.</P>
    <P>From our point of view the most significant feature of the European Council is that the mandate issue will be left over to the Foreign Ministers.  Pressure on the CAP was reduced since the previous European Council, and the centre of attention has been shifted over to the British budget.  The National Coalition Government's resistance to the erosion of the CAP has been an important factor in this.  Our resistance was maintained at a time when the resistance of some other countries with an interest in the CAP had been relaxed.  We appeared then to have been somewhat isolated.  The energetic diplomatic efforts of our Government then, even during an election campaign, helped to stave off that danger and, as a result, when this Government took over <Col N="1686" /> they found themselves in a happier position because the pressure on the CAP had eased and the centre of attention had been diverted to the British Budget, as the Taoiseach has told us.</P>
    <P>There was a marked contrast between the dramatic campaign we waged &mdash; which had some useful results as we have seen &mdash; and the subsequent neglect by the new Government of the Community institutions which could have been fatal but for the success of the earlier dedicated and skilful work of Senator Dooge and Deputy Dukes.</P>
    <P>But the Government, now that they have begun to take the Community mechanisms seriously again, must keep up the pressure to ensure that the attack on the common agricultural policy does not resume and that the solution to the British budget question, whatever that may be, does not weaken or endanger the solidarity of the Community by introducing a <i>juste retour</i> principle.</P>
    <P>The correct and wise attitude of the Government in supporting Britain in the Security Council and the EEC in the face of Argentine aggression has helped to convey to British opinion, hitherto even after almost ten years in the Community insensitive to the whole idea of Community solidarity, the value of being a partner in such an enterprise.  This should help to soften some of the British attitudes which have hitherto been based on the narrow concept of getting back as much as they put in financially, without even taking account of the remarkable opportunities for the expansion of exports which free trade with 200 million Europeans has provided to the United Kingdom.  It is to be hoped that this new British perception, evident even in the popular press in Britain, will translate itself into concrete reactions in terms of a more reasonable approach to the budget issue and in particular to recognition of the importance of the CAP as a binding force in the Community.</P>
    <P>The Community's role is not confined to solidarity with a country whose territory has been the victim of aggression; it is also the duty of other members of the Community to help a partner to react <Col N="1687" /> flexibly, intelligently and in a mature way to such a situation, showing openess to negotiation on the real issue of sovereignty that has been temporarily obscured by Argentine aggression.</P>
    <P>In the past the Community has played a significant role of this kind&mdash;for example, in relation to Britain in the case of Zimbabwe.  For quite a period in the late seventies British Governments were under pressure from inadequately informed domestic opinion to negotiate a so-called internal settlement in Zimbabwe which would have led to an indefinite continuation of the war and a danger of Soviet involvement in Southern Africa.  EEC support for negotiations with the Patriotic Front helped sustain successive British Foreign Secretaries in relation to their own domestic opinion and in relation to pressure within their Governments.  Ireland, under successive Irish Governments, played a constructive part in this process.  This was privately acknowledged to me subsequently by a senior British Minister who had had responsibility in the matter.</P>
    <P>At this point we have a similar opportunity with others in the Community, such as our close friends the Netherlands who view so many foreign policy issues in similar light to us, to help Britian to show flexibility and moderation from its present position of military strength.  I urge the Government to pursue through private diplomacy this opportunity to contribute to a peaceful settlement from the position of goodwill which we have earned through our unambiguous condemnation of the initial act of aggression.</P>
    <P>Coming nearer home, we must be concerned with our own exposed economic situation in the Community.  The financial situation which the National Coalition found in the middle of last year alarmed not only us but the Commission also.  That body was reassured by the action we took in July and by our firm determination to pursue this policy with a view to bringing the real level of borrowing down to around 13 or 14 per cent of GNP and the current deficit down to or below 6 per cent of GNP in 1982, even though the latter target involved the <Col N="1688" /> tough task of virtually halving the threatened current budget deficit.  Failure by the present Government to maintain this policy and the initial shift in the policy involving an increase of about £170 million, almost 1½ per cent of GNP in the real level of the current deficit and borrowing, has alarmed the European Commission and other observers abroad as was evident to me in discussions I had on the occasion to which I have already referred in Brussels.  A further drift of over £50 million since the budget must have added to this disquiet.</P>
    <P>The Community's position is clear from the reference in the statement which the Taoiseach circulated after the meeting to the importance of the lowering of interest rates.  But the Government by their policies, and even the threat of their coming to power before the actuality, raised interest rates by 1½ to 2 per cent through a diversion of borrowing from abroad to an already tight domestic credit market, caused by a fear of devaluation aroused by the soft option approach of the Government.  Industry is now paying dearly for the advent to power of Fianna Fáil, both in having to borrow its share of the £170 million extra to be found by business this year to finance Government spending and in paying 1½ to 2 per cent more for this and other borrowings.  The effect of this on unemployment will be evident in the months ahead.  Instead of levelling off and after some months falling, as our policy was designed to achieve, there is now a prospect of a further sharp rise in unemployment due to redundancies caused directly by the Government's policies.</P>
    <P>The Government must heed the Community's view on this issue, a view to which they have nominally subscribed in this statement.  They must take the steps necessary to reduce the fear of devaluation and the consequent excess pressure on the tight domestic credit market which has pushed up interest rates and held them at unnecessarily high levels.</P>
    <P>One feature of the European Council meeting which was encouraging was the recognition of the value of a youth employment policy of the kind pursued by our Government.  A commitment to <Col N="1689" /> strive to ensure that all young people over the next five years entering the labour market for the first time will receive vocational training or initial work experience is closely aligned with the youth employment policy of our Government, an area neglected by Fianna Fáil up to last year but even this Government will scarcely dare to overturn our constructive achievement in this respect, although the Taoiseach's failure to say much about this in his statement is a bit discouraging.  One is forced to wonder whether his reluctance to comment on this aspect of the statement may not have arisen from the extent to which the Community's policy which here is so closely aligned with the policy which we initiated during our eight months in office.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, we cannot be too sanguine about the results of this European Council.  While less threatening to our interests than it had seemed it might be, there are no really firm, constructive decisions likely to change the direction of European policies on a scale that would affect us significantly.  The Taoiseach is mistaken in trying to suggest to the contrary. These meetings, as the Taoiseach now admits he previously found, tend to involve a lot of talk but little action, and they rarely have the atmosphere of mutual support which can be generated in the Foreign Ministers Council, which is of course a genuine organ of Community and not, like the European Council, an accretion to the European system.</P>
    <P>On other foreign policy issues, our position on a number of matters&mdash; Poland, Afghanistan, the West Bank in Palestine and Central America &mdash; is aligned to that of the Community generally, though we have been ahead of others in our practical concern and constructive approach to some of these problems. On issues of this kind we are able to make a more effective and constructive contribution through the Community than in isolation in seeking to lead opinion within the Community, which we have successfully done with other like-minded countries in the Community.  So long as the Government do not allow our position with respect to military alliances to be eroded &mdash; as threatened to happen as a <Col N="1690" /> result of the Venlo meeting attending by the present Minister for Agriculture, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, earlier last year &mdash; the Government should not be afraid to pursue an active foreign policy based on a principled approach to world problems that will command respect inside and outside the Community.</P>
    <P>I have noted comments recently in the press and from different sources which seem to suggest that neutrality involves not non-participation in military alliances but actually cutting oneself off from playing any role or taking up any moral position on any world issue.  This point of view is totally out of line with the tradition of neutrality which we have established even before neutrality became an issue in the last war.  The kind of position taken up by the late Mr. de Valera as President of the Executive Council in regard to issues in the League of Nations in the thirties, including Abyssinia at that time, was one which did not involve pussy-footing in regard to the issues but taking up a strong moral position in the face of aggression.</P>
    <P>It is right that this Government should continue to do this and I am glad the Government have done so.  I regret that there were press reports which suggested that the Taoiseach was not in accord with the policy and that in some way it had derived from within the machinery of Government.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs subsequently made it clear that these reports were not true.  It is right that we have taken up the clear position we have and from that position of moral authority we should endeavour to give a lead to ensure that what is happening in regard to the Argentina crisis and to other world crises does not lead to greater conflict, war or violence.  We have some moral influence in the UN and the EEC and this should be used to good effect as has been the tradition of our Governments to do and as has been done over the last couple of weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The communiqué issued after the Brussels European Council Summit meeting was to say the least of it disappointing.  Given the magnitude <Col N="1691" /> of the unemployment problem and the fundamental disagreements which have emerged on the Community budget, the results are indeed meagre.</P>
      <P>The meetings of the Heads of Governments of the European Community are rightly or wrongly expected by the general public to produce decisions on the problems common to member states.  As the European Council itself is not a formal decision-making body, it is all the more essential that it should issue clear guidelines for follow-up action at the level of the Council of Ministers and at national government level.  It may well be that this is to expect too much from such meetings.  If this is the case, their relevance needs to be seriously looked at.</P>
      <P>When the entire European Community is experiencing low or negligible rates of economic growth and record unemployment, failure to resolve outstanding disputes and give a fresh impetus to tackling these problems represents a setback.</P>
      <P>The preamble to the conclusions of the Presidency recognises the seriousness of the world economic crisis and that all member states have the same interest in combating unemployment and restoring economic growth.  No one can quarrel with that statement.</P>
      <P>With commendable realism it acknowledges that the slight recovery in the European economy this year will not be sufficient to arrest the growth of unemployment. However, the diagnosis is not matched to any extent by the proposed remedies.  That is my chief criticism; the diagnosis correct, the remedies inadequate.</P>
      <P>Apart from the commitment to take vocational training and work experience measures at national level to combat youth unemployment, no substantive proposals can be detected to tackle unemployment, which the communiqué acknowledges will continue to rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness to the Taoiseach, he is reported to have sought the expansion of the regional and social funds as well as supporting the extension of the new Community instrument as an appropriate <Col N="1692" /> response to unemployment.  I have no doubt that such an approach has the support of this House.</P>
    <P>The new Community instrument which, according to reports, has been increased to 3 million units of account is welcome, but really only scratches at the surface of what is required.  The appeal of Commission Vice-President Ortoli for Community instruments and adequate tax concessions to promote investment appears to have been ignored, as was any expansion of the regional and social funds.</P>
    <P>The discussions on the &ldquo;30th of May Mandate&rdquo; became bogged down, as predicted, on the question of the British contribution to the budget.  In turn this has resulted in the stalemate on the fixing of farm prices which is estimated to have already cost our farmers £7 million.</P>
    <P>However, the Taoiseach seems to have got carried away with the public relations aspect of the Summit in indicating that he was pleased with its outcome.  It is understandable that a Taoiseach coming from here should appear to be as constructive as possible on the outcome of the Summit. However, to some extent, and the Taoiseach on reflection might agree if he assesses again the achievement of the Summit, his own comments on it were a little too sanguine.  There is the very real prospect that with the British Government continuing their intransigent position on the UK budget contribution, agricultural prices will not be fixed until the end of May.  I do not understand how the Taoiseach could have expressed himself as pleased with this outcome in that situation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Press</i> of 31 March reported that the Taoiseach had secured one of his main objectives, namely that his relationship with the British Prime Minister was to be maintained and developed.  Success in this objective can be gauged by the British Prime Minister's specific relegation of the Anglo-Irish Summit meeting to the status of similar bilateral meetings with France and West Germany.  Admittedly, it has always remained the British position that our bilateral contacts are on a similar level but it is significant that the British Prime Minister should have <Col N="1693" /> referred to it specifically on this occasion and made it quite clear that she considered it as no more than similar meetings between France and West Germany.  In addition, considering the context of our relationship with the British Prime Minister, the spring meeting between the British and Irish Governments, which was discussed at the London Summit meeting last year was postponed until July.  I do not see how one could, with the best intentions, consider that those results from the Summit meeting point to a deepening of our relationship with the British Prime Minister.</P>
    <P>At the end of the meeting the Taoiseach stated that he was pleased the communique contained a specific acknowledgment that unemployment is a Community as well as a national problem and that the Community must adopt a co-ordinated investment policy to deal with it.  It is to be easily pleased if one takes acknowledgment of this kind, which has been made at the last two meetings of the European Council, as indicating a real commitment to take Community-based initiatives to boost investment and reduce unemployment. This was the objective at Community level but to confuse these statements with reality is a mistake.</P>
    <P>It must be said, with some regret, that the Community is suffering from a paralysis of political will.  It must be conceded that the EEC is suffering from a lack of progress and a disease which appears to simply see Summit meetings relegated to the point of analysing what is wrong with Europe but takes no specific measures to deal with it.  It is self-defeating to correctly analyse the crises in which the Community finds itself and then fail to take appropriate action.</P>
    <P>The development of an integrated investment policy by the Community, that is combining Community-based instruments with national instruments, is what is required if we are to reverse the unemployment spiral.  The scale of funds necessary obviously means that the resources of the Community which primarily consist of 1 per cent of VAT revenues must be expanded.  Otherwise the boosting of investment is going to remain <Col N="1694" /> a mere peripheral item on the agenda of these meetings indefinitely.</P>
    <P>In point of fact, the Mandate Report contains specific proposals to encourage investment; but the Council of Ministers has yet to decide on these proposals.</P>
    <P>The depressing reality is that West Germany does not believe in a Community-based initiative.  While not minimising the beneficial impact of a fall in US interest rates on the European economy, it would appear that the position of West Germany is that each country must look after itself and secondly that external factors such as US interest rates are more important than any Community-backed initiatives.  As long as that remains the West German position, it is difficult to see any real movement at Community level or co-ordinated Community instrument to deal with unemployment.  I do not know what one could do to alter their attitude but it is regrettable that it obtains because the German economy in the past has been the motor of the Community.  If this is their attitude to Community initiatives at present it is depressing for all members, especially smaller members like our country.</P>
    <P>If the Community fail to commit the necessary resources this will be the case. I accept that the balance of payments of each country is primarily the responsibility of each national government.  However, if member states with stronger economies do not see a role for Community policies to deal with unemployment and to boost investment, then the prospects for the future of the Community are indeed bleak.</P>
    <P>With regard to the EMS it appears that all that could be agreed was that the system has worked well over the past three years.  Without a commitment towards economic convergence the EMS will be characterised more by realignments of exchange rates that the relative stability of the last three years.  Again in this regard Ireland's record on domestic economic management largely renders invalid criticism from the Taoiseach as regards a further development of the EMS.</P>
    <P>Turning to international relations, the <Col N="1695" /> statement on foreign policy is generally welcome.  In particular, the renewed call for the ending of martial law in Poland and the resumption of a genuine dialogue with the Church and Solidarity has all our support.</P>
    <P>The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan is rightly condemned.  The Community has taken a commendably resolute line from the beginning on the situation in both of these countries.</P>
    <P>In summary, it can be only hoped that the next meeting of the Heads of Government is shorter on analysis and longer on commitments.  This Community-backed investment must continue in all our economies, otherwise the small or peripheral economies like our own will continue to suffer high unemployment. Unless future Summit meetings produce remedies as well as analyses, citizens in Europe of the various member states will begin to believe that neither the leaders nor the institutions of the Community can offer any European solution, as distinct from purely national initiatives, towards solving the crisis unemployment levels being experienced in member states at present.  If that position continues, then the whole ideal of a European Community which tackles economic and social questions will die.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Committee do not agree with the Seanad in Amendment No. 1 to the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1982.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the Seanad an amendment was put down by Senator O'Leary to add an extra subsection to section 13 of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1982 and the amendment was made on a division of the House.  Section 13 deals with the criteria to be taken into account by the court in determining the rent of a formerly controlled dwelling.  The purpose of the amendment was to limit the rent that the court could fix to 7 per cent of the open market value of the dwelling. The text of the amendment was:</P>
      <P>Where the terms of the tenancy are fixed by the Court under section 12, the gross rent shall not in any case exceed 7 per cent of the open market value for the dwelling at the date of the application to the Court.  The open market value for the purpose of this subsection shall mean the amount for which a willing purchaser would purchase and a willing seller would sell the dwelling, freehold with vacant possession, for use as a dwelling without further improvement. </P>
      <P>My reasons for resisting the amendment in the Seanad were twofold.  My first objection was that I felt the 7 per cent would operate as a norm in determining rents rather than as a limit which would only be called into operation in the occasional case.  Secondly, I saw certain constitutional difficulties with the amendment in that the setting of a definite figure like 7 per cent would leave the Bill open to a challenge based on the particular circumstances of an individual landlord who might be able to show that his property rights were being adversely threatened. Since the Seanad debate I have examined the matter further.  I am convinced that my reasons for resisting the amendment initially were valid and still justify the deletion of the amendment as I have now moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1697" /> My first fear with regard to this amendment is that it would lead to a generally higher level of rents than would result from the existing criteria set out in section 13 (2).  It should be remembered that the 7 per cent formula set out in the amendment is generous to landlords in the case of a house used as a single dwelling unit. It would, in these cases, probably give a rent higher than would be determined by market forces and treat landlords of very highly valued houses particularly favourably. If one could be certain that the formula would operate to set a maximum in unusual cases, little harm would result from the amendment and it would have limited impact.  If, as I think would be inevitable, the figure was to operate as a norm it would result in significantly higher rents being set.  It would not be unreasonable to expect that the very clear-cut nature of the figure would unduly influence district justices seeking to set rents having regard to the more subjective criteria, such as the means of the landlord and the tenant, in section 13 (2).  The 7 per cent formula could then assume much greater importance than was intended by the amendment and could outweigh all other factors in the deliberations of district justices.  At the very least the 7 per cent formula would likely become the initial or base figure to be adjusted by taking into account the individual circumstances of the landlord and tenant.  Even this more limited application would lead to higher rents than would otherwise be set under section 13. I do recognise that there would be an attraction in having a definite limit in the section.  I agree with Senator O'Leary when he said that it could prove useful for landlords and tenants in coming to agreements outside of the courts, but I fear its very attractiveness could prove its undoing and result in higher rents being charged.</P>
    <P>My second concern is that the amendment as proposed could also pose constitutional problems.  In passing this Bill, we are doing no service to landlords or tenants if we include in it a provision which, on a balance of probability, could afford grounds for a successful constitutional challenge.  I should stress that it is not the <Col N="1698" /> 7 per cent formula, of itself, which is a particular cause for concern.  As I said earlier the 7 per cent figure is, if anything, generous to most landlords and would not, I think, constitute an unjust attack on property rights in itself.  The amendment, however, provides a new basis for a challenge.  It could be demonstrated that application of the new formula to a particular set of circumstances would constitute an unjust attack on the rights of an individual landlord.  The other criteria in the Bill for the fixing of rents do not set definite figures or apply specified limits and thus do not suffer from this difficulty.  The particular set of circumstances I have in mind is where a landlord could show that his property has a low market value for purchase which, in normal circumstances, would not be reflected in the rental value of the property. This could occur where the dwelling was not a house used as a single dwelling but a flat or a room of a number of such dwellings in a house.  Such a dwelling might not realistically be a saleable unit and thus would not have a true market value or would have only a very limited one.</P>
    <P>The amendment, which relates the rent of a particular dwelling to its saleable value, could thus result, in individual circumstances, in very low rents being set, rents that would be manifestly unjust and unfair to the landlord.  In addition, because there is no uniform relationship between saleable value and market rent over the range of house prices &mdash; from the very modest to the upper end of the market &mdash; it would be possible for one landlord, or for that matter a tenant, to show that he was being unjustly treated <i>vis-à-vis</i> another landlord or tenant.  Over a certain level, increases in the purchase value of houses are not reflected fully in increases in the market rent.  Were this amendment to be accepted landlords of large and more valuable properties would stand to benefit more than landlords of more modest accommodation.  I do not find it easy to see how the 7 per cent formula could be applied fairly where there are a number of dwelling units in the same house or even to the range of single dwelling units which can vary so <Col N="1699" /> much in their potential for renting and sale.</P>
    <P>Finally, the amendment in itself is defectively drafted.  For example, the obvious intention of the draft was that the 7 per cent figure should apply as a limit to a year's rent but the draft does not relate the formula to a particular period.  This, however, is a minor matter which could be corrected if I could accept the principle of the amendment.</P>
    <P>I hope that what I have said makes it clear that my opposition to the amendment stems purely from the practical and legal difficulties to which I see the amendment giving rise.  In framing the Bill, I have had to tread a careful path to achieve an acceptable balance between a variety of conflicting interests.  I feel that the amendment passed in the Seanad is not in the best interests of the Bill and accordingly I do not find myself able to accept it.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Minister has adopted this attitude.  I had hoped that he would see the wisdom of what was done in the Seanad ten days or a fortnight ago and accept this amendment. It is a necessary amendment in that it has attempted to do something that was needed in this Bill, that is set a ceiling on the rent that can be charged for what is now a controlled-rent dwelling.  I imagine that the debate in the Seanad was a very long debate.</P>

      <P>The Minister himself said in relation to this:</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate Senator O'Leary on the amount of work he obviously put into the preparation of his case for his amendment which showed a tremendous depth of research. </P>
      <P>He went on to reject the amendment and then stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite honestly, I accept the good faith of Senator O'Leary, Senator <Col N="1700" /> Robinson and others who have debated this point.  I accept that they are trying to be fair and just. </P>
    <P>That was on Friday, 16 April and on the following Sunday, only 48 hours later, the same Minister said at a Fianna Fáil convention that the Senators acted like a bunch of school children intent on peevish mischief-making with no thought to the consequences of what they were doing or their duties as legislators.  That was a most irresponsible statement for any Minister to make about a House of the Oireachtas.  He had already said in the House that he recognised the amount of work they had done and their sense of responsibility.  He made an attack outside the House &mdash; he did not utter a word of criticism of Senators in the Seanad &mdash; in a way which was at least reprehensible and falls far below the standard I would have expected from the Minister, especially as there was a most considered, detailed debate on this very important measure by two Senators whom he admits were concerned and fair and who had done a tremendous amount of work in drafting this amendment.  I leave it to Members of this House to decide who was mischief-making and acting like a peevish child.  It was certainly not Senator O'Leary or Senator Robinson.  I believe the Minister owes those Senators and the Seanad in general an apology for his unwarranted, biased and most unfair attack on the Members of that House and on the House itself.  He referred to it as a &ldquo;left over&rdquo; Seanad.  Under the Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Barry, I know you will appreciate the position here.  As I indicated earlier, this is a Committee Stage debate and the Standing Order in this case in the matter of the amendment advises us that we must adhere strictly to the terms of the amendment.  I noted with care the Minister's speech and was happy to see that the order was being satisfied.  While I appreciate that one might be encouraged to stray a little I would ask Deputy Barry not to move too far and not to give me the opportunity of interrupting him.  I do <Col N="1701" /> not wish to do so but I must do it where a Standing Order is being disregarded.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel quite incensed that a Minister of an Irish Government should refer disparagingly to one of the Houses of the Oireachtas set up under the Constitution as a &ldquo;left over&rdquo; Seanad.  It was a Seanad set up under the Constitution which performed its duty correctly in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been several attempts by the Oireachtas to introduce legislation to cater for the situation which has arisen because of a High Court case decontrolling rents which for over half a century had been controlled.  When the Supreme Court makes a decision on such a matter the Government and the Oireachtas must introduce legislation to cater for the situation. The Supreme Court decided that the property rights of landlords were infringed under existing legislation.  However, the Oireachtas must also take into account what is happening to people who are affected by the decontrol of rents. Many tenants would have their rents raised by an inordinate amount if free rein were given to landlords to charge any rents they liked, within the rather <Col N="1702" /> loose set of constraints under section 13(2).</P>
    <P>This amendment was introduced in an effort to put a ceiling on rents which may be charged.  If the landlord and tenant can agree on a fair rent, adjudication by the court will not be necessary, but when they are unable to reach agreement the District Court must set the rent for a dwelling.  Certain guidelines have been laid down in the Bill relating to the circumstances of the tenant and the landlord, the location of the property and the size of the tenant's family.</P>
    <P>As a further safeguard in the fixing of rents, it was proposed in this amendment that in no case should the rent exceed 7 per cent of the market value of the house. As Senator O'Leary said, the figure of 7 per cent is not an arbitrary one.  As the Minister acknowledged, the Senator did a tremendous amount of research to arrive at this figure.  The figure of 7 per cent gives a fair return in real terms to the owner of a property and we would contend that it thus conforms to the decision of the Supreme Court.  It is reviewable every five years under another section.  Historically inflation and property prices have moved in tandem, although on certain occasions this has not been so.  At the end of the five-year period the rent of the property will be adjusted by the court; the value of the property will have increased by the rate of inflation and the rent, being 7 per cent of the new value, will reflect that increase.  At the same time the ceiling will protect tenants, many of whom are old and unaware of their rights and do not know what is a fair rent.  They could be in danger of agreeing to an extortionary rent.  Of course, tenants have the right to go to court and appeal.  If there is a 7 per cent ceiling, the majority of landlords will abide by that ceiling and will not charge, even with agreed rents, more than that. Where the rent is not agreed this will give the District Courts, the assessors of the rents to be charged, a further yardstick against which the rents may be charged. It is very desirable that this House endorse the views of the Seanad in this regard and pass this amendment which <Col N="1703" /> would benefit tenants and make this Bill more watertight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what happened here earlier today and the comments of the Chair to establish the terms of reference when speaking on this amendment, I propose, with the permission of the Chair, when speaking on this amendment to refer to the interpretation of the Constitution, as the Minister did, and on the two basic grounds on which he saw fit to reject it.  I do not wish to get into any argument with the Chair and he might tell me if that is admissible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has already indicated that we are on Committee Stage and the Deputy is familiar with a Committee Stage debate. It is required that we stay specifically within the terms of the amendment.  I noted that in his comments the Minister made a slight reference to the Constitution and said that in his opinion the amendment could lead to constitutional problems.  That being the case, the Chair would accept a passing reference by another speaker to the Constitution but would not wish any speaker to regard what is in the Minister's speech as a justification to range over the terms of the legislation because that would not be in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for that clarifification. As Labour spokesperson for the Environment I wish to speak on this amendment and say at the outset that we will be supporting it and pressing it to a vote if necessary.  We do this because the amendment, which has certain limitations, is nevertheless an advance on the string, chewing gum and cellotape aspirations contained in the original section 13, which devolved on a range of district justices the benign responsibility for fixing rents.  Having regard to the discussions which took place here today, every Deputy would want to be very wary about the benign judgments of district justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, in principle, attempts to give specific guidance to the courts in relation to the ceiling in fixing rents.  To that extent it intervenes positively <Col N="1704" /> into the market forces on behalf of the community, setting as a norm what would be regarded by any fund manager or any gilt-edge operator as a reasonable return on capital.  To that extent we think it is a benign and positive intervention into what would otherwise be regarded as uncontrolled <i>laisse faire</i> market forces which in the past demonstrated no great concern for the homeless or those who economically cannot house themselves.</P>
    <P>The second point is that the District Courts&mdash;I will not labour this point or try to make political capital out of it&mdash;are not equipped and do not have the expertise or the resources to have regard in a constructive manner to all the factors they should take into consideration, as set out in the original section 13 which has been amended by the Seanad.  During that debate the Minister indicated that certain resources were being extended to the District Courts in terms of extra district justices and so on, but at no stage did he indicate that any guidelines would be provided by his Department as to the way or the manner a district justice should have regard to the various criteria&mdash;I think there were eight in all&mdash;when fixing a just and proper rent.</P>
    <P>To the extent that the Fine Gael amendment&mdash;argued with great skill, expertise and experience by Senator S. O'Leary&mdash;is an attempt to try to bring some coherent rationale to an otherwise totally uncontrolled combination of market forces, the Labour Party welcome it and are prepared, as our colleagues in the Upper House did, to support it in a division.  Let us now look at the reasons for its rejection by the Minister who, as Deputy Barry rightly pointed out, in the privacy or perhaps obscurity of a Seanad campaign, saw fit to recognise the scholarship and study those Senators utilised in putting forth their arguments and, at the same time, in Dublin West saw fit to make other observations.  Let us look at the Minister's arguments, which he read with great fluency, as to why he is not prepared to accept the amendment which the Seanad passed.  At the beginning of his speech he said:</P>
    <P>Secondly, I saw certain constitutional difficulties with the amendment <Col N="1705" /> in that the setting of a definite figure like 7 per cent would leave the Bill open to a challenge based on the particular circumstances of an individual landlord who might be able to show that his property rights were being adversely threatened. </P>
    <P>Because of the possible fear that &ldquo;an individual landlord who might be able to show that his property rights were being threatened adversely&rdquo; the Minister rejected a very clear set of guidelines and reverted to the original open-ended, anything-you-like-sir, to district justices around the country in the hope of getting through a possible constitutional gauntlet.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister's arguments are based on very spurious, suspect and extremely conservative property-biased analyses in his Department and in the Attorney General's office, who no doubt advised him.  It is based on the proposition of a &ldquo;might&rdquo; of an individual landlord and there is no attempt to balance that against the probability that up to 30,000 tenants will find themselves automatically at risk, and indeed very definitely at risk.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on record that since I last spoke in this House on this matter I have been inundated with telephone calls and letters from tenants who at this very moment are being served with notices to quit and letters requesting them to be prepared to move or to pay exorbitant increases.  I have no doubt that my comments on section 13 are very valid and perhaps even understated in view of the response I received from the public in my constituency.  That may or may not be the experience of other Deputies.  I can speak only for myself.</P>
    <P>That was one of the reasons why the Minister saw fit to move the rejection of the amendment.  Just as the 15 per cent norm in the PAYE sector agreement has become the norm, I accept that the 7 per cent formula would tend to operate as the norm.  I do not see that necessarily that should be regarded as a reason to reject it.  It is better to have something as specific and precise as that, as against the multi-factorial grounds contained in the <Col N="1706" /> original section 13 having regard to the variety of judgments district justices are capable of making as recent events have demonstrated.</P>
    <P>Another argument put forward by the Minister was the possibility that the 7 per cent might cause problems.  It is worth reading from the Minister's speech as it seems to contain a contradiction.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, do I understand that the Minister will be replying?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I presume the Minister will reply to any questions put to him.  I do not have to remind the Deputy that he is at liberty to speak as often as he wishes. He does not have to put all his questions simultaneously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been vocal on this matter and I propose to make one argument and leave it at that.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>As I said earlier the 7 per cent figure is if anything, generous to most landlords and would not, I think, constitute an unjust attack on property rights in itself.  The amendment, however, does provide a new basis for a challenge.  It could be demonstrated that application of the new formula to a particular set of circumstances would constitute an unjust attack on the rights of an individual landlord.  The other criteria in the Bill for the fixing of rents do not set definite figures or apply specified limits and thus do not suffer from this difficulty.  The particular set of circumstances I have in mind is where a landlord could show that his property has a low market value for purchase which, in normal circumstances, would not be reflected in the rental value of the property. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us deal with that for a start.  In a previous life the Minister had fair skill and expertise in property matters.  Such a combination would be extremely rare. Most people with any knowledge of how the property market operates would concede that.  This is the Department and the Minister scraping the barrel of intellectual <Col N="1707" /> argument to try to justify the rejection of the amendment.  If I can be proven wrong in that I will accept such proof. They seem to be arguing against the normal set of circumstances most people experience.</P>
    <P>They go on to explain how this might occur and this is where they become absurd:</P>
    <P>This could occur where the dwelling was not a house used as a single dwelling but a flat or a room of a number of such dwellings in a house. </P>
    <P>Many of us &mdash; and particularly the lawyers who have experience of conveyancing &mdash; know the frequency with which a controlled tenancy is confined exclusively to a room in a tenement.  It is unique.  I have never come across it.  If there is documented evidence available to show that houses have been divided into individual occupancies or tenancies and allocated to a number of people, as distinct from the entire property being let to a group of people, I would be interested to see it.  I should like to hear from the Minister how many such examples there are and if it is on the basis of a very small number of examples that he is proposing to reject the amendment.  It seems to me to be arguing in the extreme to reject a considered argument made by somebody who has expertise in the matter, Senator S. O'Leary.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made up his mind on this and no doubt he has got the support of The Workers Party and Deputy Gregory as he had in the past.  Therefore his amendment is likely to go through. Regettably yet again the Department have seen constitutional ghosts in the dark in the Custom House and in the AG's office and have run for cover from a reasonable and generous intervention into the uncontrolled and incalculable forces of the market which historically have never had regard to the plight of the homeless or attempted to ensure that people who have no economic muscle of their own can house themselves.</P>
    <P>The Department, the AG's office and the Minister have put forward this argument to bow to the conservative interpretation <Col N="1708" /> of the property clauses in Article 40.3 of the Constitution.  I regret that yet again the Minister is trying to defend the indefensible on a day when the House has been arguing for over four hours about the arbitrary nature of decisions made by district justices, and at a time when the Taoiseach has repeated yet again his refusal to amend the Constitution to introduce a proper balance between the legitimate rights of private property owners and the very obvious and pressing needs of the common good.</P>

      <P>Before the Easter recess the Dáil passed this Bill in one day to enact legislation to give protection to tenants who are very frustrated and worried people.  At the same time a temporary Bill was introduced.  A question arose as to whether the Bill as enacted would be constitutional.  I agree that a change in the Constitution is needed.</P>
      <P>Since then an amendment has been put down to the Bill.  The previous speaker referred to my party.  When we make a decision we analyse the situation and make our decision quite impartially.  I want to make that statement very clearly. I always relate legislation being enacted to the situation as I know it at local level over a number of years.  In Mallow many people are living in controlled rented accommodation.  The rents are very low. The Bill being enacted will give some protection to such tenants but the amendment, if adopted, would not help these people.  It would give an opportunity to landlords to go to court and seek at least that amount, and that is an opportunity which they have not got at this moment. For that reason we feel this amendment is not a good amendment.</P>

      <P>My reluctance to accept the amendment stems from practical and legal difficulties which acceptance of the amendment would create.  The practical one is that the 7 per cent formula would operate as a norm.  Deputy Quinn accepted that the rent would become the norm, that 7 per cent would be taken by district justices as being the rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the line that Deputy Sherlock <Col N="1709" /> has mentioned, that the practical reality is that most landlords, as a result of this 7 per cent norm, would be achieving a return on their investment far above what they could expect under ordinary market forces.  In the property page of <i>The Irish Times</i> today there is a report &mdash; admittedly in the industrial sector &mdash; that contends that for large projects yields of 5.75 per cent or 6 per cent are anticipated.</P>

      <P>My rejection of the amendment is not because it would set a ceiling, if it was to be a ceiling that would be fair enough, but the practicality is that the rent would be a norm.  Consequently, we in Government feel that it would be over-generous to the landlord and against the best interests of the tenant.</P>
      <P>In the whole drafting of this Bill &mdash; as I have said so many times before both in this House and in the Seanad &mdash; we must be even-handed in our approach.  There is very little else I can say that I have not said already in my introductory remarks on this amendment and I shall leave it at that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why it should be assumed that if this amendment were adopted district justices up and down the country would take it as a norm that they should fix 7 per cent as the appropriate revalued rent of a dwelling. They would be quite incorrect in doing that.  There would be no basis for so doing under the Bill as it would be with this amendment incorporated.  That is not what the amendment says, it does not say that at all, and they would be incorrect if they took that position.  I think any average district justice would say that if the intention of the Houses of the Oireachtas was to determine rents at 7 per cent, then we would have said so. That would be a very different situation, would give rise to a very different Act and a very different interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the amendment proposes to do is quite a different matter.  It proposes an <Col N="1710" /> overall ultimate restraint, an overall ultimate ceiling above which a court may not go, a second line of resistance, a resistance measure for the protection of the tenant.  The protection of the tenant is its only purpose if the law was correctly interpreted and applied.  We must assume here that an average district justice will look at the legislation and apply it.  I know from personal experience that by and large they do that.</P>
    <P>The conditions for determination of the rent, the various conditions laid down stand and apply.  It is on the basis of those criteria that the district justice is obligated under the legislation to set about the determination of the rent.  It could be that if all those criteria were to operate in many cases in favour of the particular landlord in a particular case and against the tenant in a particular case the figure arrived at would be a very high figure indeed.  In that kind of circumstance this protective measure would come into play, would provide for a ceiling in that particular set of circumstances beyond which the court might not go. That could operate only as a protection for some tenants.  I am quite sure that there are some tenants in Mallow also who might well derive a benefit from that amendment if it were passed by the House.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House not to have regard to what I would see as a red herring introduced here by the Minister and supported by Deputy Sherlock to indicate that the district justices would apply the 7 per cent figure as the norm.  There would be no basis for them so doing. They would be flying in the face of the directives given in the Bill for determination of the rent.  I find it rather strange that a Deputy of the SFWP would be prepared to discard an overall ceiling protection which could operate only for the protection of some tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter of opinion, it is a matter of fact because there is nothing in the Bill, as amended, that would prescribe a 7 per cent figure.  The <Col N="1711" /> criteria of the Bill remain unaltered.  All those criteria are quite unaffected by this amendment.  They constitute the guidelines given to district justices for the purpose of determining the rent.  Having considered all those criteria, having done his calculations and arrived at his figure as to what would be the appropriate rent, if a district justice was to find that it would go beyond the 7 per cent he must impose a ceiling on the rent so that it would amount to no more than 7 per cent.  It constitutes a valuable protection for some categories of tenants who could fall into a difficult situation were it not there. I would be in favour of the Seanad amendment for those reasons.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must not have been listening to his colleague because he made the strong point that he accepted my line that in practical terms the 7 per cent instead of being a ceiling would be a norm.

      <P>They are the people who would be determining the matter, not any Deputy in this House.  All I am saying is that anybody reading the criteria, with the overriding provision of the amendment having been inserted, would conclude that the 7 per cent is a ceiling that would apply in certain cases.  The original criteria remain unaltered.  The amendment does not affect those.  That is the way in which the Act, in its amended form, would reach district justices.  The question of the opinion of any Deputy in this House would not have any relevance there at all.  The district justice will look at the Act as it comes before him.  The Act will lay down a set of criteria and direct him to assess the rent in accordance with those criteria.  If perchance the calculation he would then arrive at were to <Col N="1712" /> exceed the 7 per cent he must then limit the rent to the 7 per cent in accordance with the provisions of the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The point being made by Deputy Taylor is correct.  I must say I was surprised at Deputy Sherlock's attitude to this.  Certainly a ceiling on a rent is very desirable.  I do not accept that the rent would be the norm &mdash; it does not have to be the norm &mdash; and a district justice would look at it as being a ceiling and not a norm.  The courts are there to interpret the law, to interpret what we here lay down for them as being the law. If we say it is the norm then of course they will say 7 per cent.  If we say it is a ceiling and one cannot go above that then the courts will say that or something below it.</P>
      <P>I want to give an example of a terrace of houses in my constituency with controlled rents.  We all know the type of buildings, single storey buildings, many of them with a dormer window built into the attic &mdash; they are all over Ireland, one sees them regularly &mdash; with a narrow hall, one room and a kitchen built out at the back.  About 200 of those are owned by one landlord who served notice on all the tenants, in the case of all those dwellings that were still tenanted &mdash; some in fact had been bought from a relation of this landlord who previously owned them and had been sold to the tenants.  The landlord served notice on the tenants for varying rents from £25 to £35 per week for each of the houses.  One of the houses that had been owned and sold freehold fetched £14,000, the selling price since Christmas, the free market value according to this amendment.  I do not say she will get the rents she is seeking because other factors in the subsection will be taken into account if the tenants go to court but in fact the landlord is now demanding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I was saying that on 3 April at six o'clock in the evening two days after the Dáil recessed people who are concerned with employment in the National Film Studios of Ireland at Ardmore and the much wider interests involved with film making and tourism were very much taken aback at the sudden announcement that the Minister had decided to close the National Film Studios.  There was no prior notification of the board of the film studios, no prior notification of the workers, no consultation with any trade union or with anybody involved in Irish film producing, no consultation with the newly constituted Irish film Board, and no consultation with the Arts Council of Ireland.  It was an extraordinary and unprecedented decision made quite brutally without any consultation with anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy to imagine the effect on people whose livelihood is placed in jeopardy when they so find out from the cold announcement in television or radio news.  Not only are 46 full-time jobs in the studios directly affected, but it is calculated that when a film is being made at the National Film Studios a minimum of 300 people are at work, so that we are talking in terms of employment of not only the 46 currently employed but about a much larger number.  This particularly <Col N="1715" /> affects me.  Not only did I grow up on the road where the studios are located and see the effect of their establishment on the surrounding area, but my constituents are widely affected, and the whole of the North Wicklow area, both in employment and tourism, are very seriously affected.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the employment element is that a technical expertise has been built up in the National Film Studios which would be extremely hard ever again to assemble and which is vital to the success of a film studio.  Again I stress that this event took place while the Irish Film Board were actually holding their first meeting, an extraordinary juxtaposition of events which leaves one quite breathless. It is generally considered that from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; there was a lack of capitalisation for the National Film Studios. This capitalisation should perhaps have been undertaken by the previous Coalition Government, and the Fianna Fáil Government from 1977 to 1981 had ample opportunity to undertake it but did not.  There was lack of capitalisation on one hand and insufficient business coming to the studios on the other.</P>
    <P>Many reasons could be given for insufficient business and among those reasons &mdash; I believe a very valid reason &mdash; would be the lack of any incentive scheme which would attract Irish or foreign people to invest in film making.  Incentive schemes exist in many areas where we wish to attract investment but there is no such scheme to attract film making.  The reasoning behind calling for an incentive scheme could well be summed up when you consider that the amount of foreign currency attracted here and spent in Ireland since the inception of the National Film Studios is conservatively calculated at £12.5 million.  This calculation is achieved by getting figures from the accounting section of visiting foreign film companies, asking them to detail expenditure in this country which they undertook by making a film here.  The value is estimated by adding the number of films and foreign film companies visiting this country and it amounts to something in the region of £12.5 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1716" /> When the Minister was announcing the closure and subsequently giving interviews to the Press, before he decided that he might have any words with anybody else involved, he mentioned a loss of £2 million since the studios were set up.  In the context of attracting foreign currency to Ireland I do not think that £2 million compares with the amount of investment we see fit to make in an airport in the west, or the continuing staggering sums invested in NET, Whitegate Oil Refinery and Clondalkin Paper Mills, which it cannot be said attract foreign currency to Ireland.  We have yet to see what kind of foreign currency an airport, which may be closed half the time, will attract to Ireland.  We must put into context the kind of losses this company have had in the past.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government completed the appointment of the Irish Film Board during their term of office.  This was the first step to having an integrated policy about Irish film making and the National Film Studios.  The Coalition Government were about to reconstitute the board of the National Film Studios; new life was to be brought into the film industry.</P>
    <P>The Board of the National Film Studios favourably considered investment by the private sector in facilities in and around the studios.  The building of a new film laboratory was grant-approved by the IDA.  The laboratory would have increased permanent employment by 30 people.  It is interesting to note that since the Minister came into office he has not met the board of the National Film Studios. In a letter dated 12 March 1982 the Minister was invited to meet the chairman and chief executive of the board of the National Film Studios to discuss the future of the film studios.  On 16 March an acknowledgment was received from the secretary of the Department.</P>
    <P>It is important that I should state the facts about a letter which the Minister made a lot of when he was replying to criticism on the closure of the National Film Studios.  He quoted a lot from a letter which was sent by the chairman and a member of the board, not by the chief executive of the National Film Studios. This letter must be seen in the light of a <Col N="1717" /> series of discussions the board had been having with the Department on the whole question of the kind of investment needed by the studios from the State for film-making and providing incentives. The Minister quoted at length from this letter and it is also important that I should quote from it as follows:</P>
    <P>Without substantial direct investment in films and the tax incentives recommended by the board in the past we cannot expect the National Film Studios of Ireland to reach the minimum of break even let alone be profitable. A healthier environment for film making, as outlined above, would go a long way towards solving the company's problem. </P>
    <P>The Minister presumably received this letter on 13 March and, without having met the board or having answered their letter of 12 March, he proceeded to act very swiftly to close the company.</P>
    <P>This letter was a call by the chairman for help for the National Film Studios, for a new look and discussions.  Instead of any talk with the board the Minister proceeded to close down the company. Why did the Minister proceed to close Ardmore Film Studios so abruptly without any consultations or discussions with any interested parties?  That must raise serious questions in the minds of any people involved in State companies.  On 3 April it was Ardmore Film Studios, next week it could be any other State company, it could be CIE.  It was the most extraordinary handling of a Minister's brief and was out of character with the often stated interest of the Taoiseach in furthering Irish arts.</P>
    <P>It is important to state that a direct result of that decision is that a film called &ldquo;Jigsaw Man&rdquo;, which was due to come into the studios, has now been withdrawn with a loss to Ireland of $3 million in revenue.  The film, &ldquo;Educating Rita&rdquo;, which was also due to come to the studios, is now in jeopardy, a further $3 million lost to the country.  I understand also that a film, which would have starred Seán Connery and which was to be made between Ireland and two other countries, with a spending budget of $25 million of <Col N="1718" /> which $8 million might have come here, is going to another country.</P>
    <P>We already see the losses to the country of this extraordinarily quick decision made under very mysterious circumstances. I would like the Minister to explain why it was felt this decision had to be made so quickly, why he refused to meet the chairman and the board, why there was no consultation with the trade unions or any film making interests in the country, what he intends to do about the employment which will be lost and if he has any plans for replacing in that part of the country, which is already badly hit by unemployment, the tourism losses which will accrue.  I regret the way this matter is being handled and that we should have had to wait until now to have a democratic discussion in this House because it was done so suddenly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for giving me the opportunity to support this matter she has raised on the Adjournment.  While the studios were facing serious financial difficulties the Minister should have given sufficient time for them to come to grips with any final decisions that might have to be taken in relation to the overall financial structuring of the company.  There was no prior notification to the board of an imminent decision and no prior notification to the 46 workers, the vast majority of whom are highly skilled in a particular industry. A number of those workers live in my constituency.  There is great anger about the sudden decision by the Minister without any prior consultation.</P>
      <P>I am aware that about three months prior to this decision some efforts were being made in relation to the studios. They should have been pressed forward to try to bring a joint venture into the operation of the studios prior to taking a final decision.  That should have been fully explored and efforts should have been made to find other private capital interests who might be prepared to share the work of the studios.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On many occasions in the House I was critical of the extent of State subvention which was necessary to maintain the studios. I recall the Minister, Deputy <Col N="1719" /> O'Malley, indicating they were on their final chance.  Nevertheless, the manner of the decision, with no prior consultation, was utterly precipitous and in the context of the vast sums of money which the Minister and the Government have spent on all sorts of things which do not relate in any way to employment or the maintenance of it, it is highly questionable that that kind of expenditure, even in the context of State losses, should be so suddenly cut off.  I wish to record my serious concern and that of my colleague, Deputy Kavanagh, regarding this closure, a closure which perhaps could have been avoided but which certainly should not have been effected in the way in which it was effected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> The decision to close the Ardmore studios was announced during the Dáil recess.  The first observation I would make in relation to that decision is that it is strange that a Government who are preaching continuously about proper industrial relations should announce such a decision without any consultation with either the management or the workers involved.  This decision is in stark contrast to the Government's much publicised commitment to the question of job creation and to the maintenance of existing jobs.</P>
      <P>Workers in the private sector have reached the stage of accepting as typical this type of practice in so far as many employers are concerned but for the Government to indulge in such practice is another matter and is something that must be condemned without reservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ardmore film studios are a national asset.  They form an integral part of the Irish film industry.  However, the question must be asked whether the studios can be maintained by way of private enterprise.  Any objective person would have to answer no to that question having regard to present circumstances.  Indeed, this is accepted by the workers.  However, <Col N="1720" /> it should be recognised also that when RTE were connected with Ardmore, the studios were making money but it was only when a policy of privatisation was introduced that the studios began to lose money.</P>
    <P>The workers' committee involved in the studios are convinced that with an adequate capital base and with a new board representative of the studio workers together with State participation, there can be profitable future for Ardmore. The workers' committee have carried out a detailed analysis based on a restructured company and they are anxious to meet the Minister so that they will have the opportunity of putting their case to him.  I strongly urge the Minister to accede to this request.</P>
    <P>The Ardmore studios have been responsible for attracting millions of pounds from abroad and apart from the full-time employment there, hundreds of ancillary jobs have been generated. Therefore, the decision to close the studios represents two major blows to Irish workers: first, the loss of the jobs and the consequent effects on the workers of being made redundant and, second, the closure will mean the death knell of the Irish film industry.  The smallest portion of the expenses involved in the running of the studios is the wages of the workers while the largest proportion relates to the exorbitantly high interest repayments to an American bank as a result of the failure of successive Governments to capitalise the company.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for agreeing to accommodate me and I urge him to accede to the request to meet the workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great display of political hypocrisy from two Deputies opposite.  Deputy Gallagher has only come into the House recently and cannot be expected to be in possession of the facts in relation to the whole background against which the decision was made, and I am willing to take his point of view.  I have listened to figures being pulled out of the air regarding films that were to have been made at Ardmore but the situation <Col N="1721" /> is that there was not a single contract in existence for a film to be made there.  Various sums of money have been mentioned this evening.  One might get the impression that all these moneys were to be spent at Ardmore but that is not the position.  Deputy Hussey has quoted from a letter from which she says I quoted extensively on radio when being interviewed in relation to this situation.  I have never quoted from a particular letter in this regard and I recall distinctly saying that the board of the National Film Studios concurred with my view and that I was surprised to hear somebody express a contrary view.  However, Deputy Hussey was very selective in what she quoted and in the way she presented the whole matter to us.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond talked about a joint venture and so on.  I can tell the Deputy that when I became concerned with the situation, everybody was aware of the financial crisis that existed but that nothing had been done about it.  Deputy Hussey complains about my not meeting the board only three days after resuming office but I would remind her that my predecessor, according to the record in my Department did not meet the full board at all.  Let us be realistic about this whole situation.</P>
      <P>The decision to close the National Film Studios must be looked at in the context of the state of the company's financial affairs when this Government took office.  In the years 1977 to 1981 their losses had totalled almost £2,500,000 and they were projected to increase to £2,750,000 in 1982 alone.  Excluding the expense incurred in the purchase of the studios, amounting to approximately £500,000, direct Exchequer grants totalling nearly £1.5 million have been made available to NFSI since it was set up, principally to cover the company's administrative expenses during periods of inactivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the foregoing does not adequately portray the disastrous financial state the company was in, I would add that the ongoing operations of the studios were being virtually entirely financed by a bank overdraft which, since the beginning of 1980, was increasing on average <Col N="1722" /> by £50,000 per month.  On my assuming responsibility for the company, this overdraft stood at £1.615 million and had just been increased to £1.665 million to enable the company to continue operations for about a further month.  Surely that indicates clearly where the crisis point lay.  This money was only advanced subject to ministerial guarantee, and if one recalls that further debts of approximately £200,000 existed, on which a ministerial guarantee was also being sought, and that there is a statutory limit of £2 million on the issue of such guarantees, the writing on the wall was plain.  Despite this, the Opposition say that the situation was unknown.  The only way in which closure could have been deferred was by provision of substantial funds in the Estimates for 1982, and as the House will be aware, there was no such provision.  It seems necessary, although it should not be, to remind Deputies that these Estimates were prepared and agreed by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that in these circumstances the Government had to address themselves to the issues involved as a matter of urgency.  On the basis of the information available, the Government felt there was no reasonable prospect of the studios becoming viable in the foreseeable future and, in the context of increasing borrowings, which would inevitably have to be met ultimately by the taxpayer, amounting to more than £1,000 per month per man employed, felt it had no option but to order closure and liquidation of the studios.</P>
    <P>This decision was taken in the knowledge that the board of the film studios had recently decided to recommend that the Exchequer should not continue to subvent the continuing substantial costs of the company, and that it was firmly of the opinion that even capitalisation in full, that is, paying off the borrowings of the company, would not solve their problems. The studios as they were organised could not become viable without the making there of at least four feature films a year.  The studios failed in the last five years to achieve this level of business, <Col N="1723" /> and indeed no feature film was made there in the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>In approving the closure and liquidation of the studios, the Government were also aware that interest had been expressed by private sector groups in acquiring the studios, and it is my hope that a suitable purchaser can be found who will not only continue to maintain film facilities there, but will also provide viable self-sustaining employment in the area.</P>
    <P>For seven months we were lectured on financial rectitude by the same people who are in Opposition today, yet they produced estimates without making provision for an operation that was in a crisis situation.  Everybody knew that the studios would have to close within a matter of weeks and nothing was done about it, and when something is being done about it there is an outcry.  This is the type of political hypocrisy that we have had here this evening.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1724" /> Indeed, recent approaches to the liquidator in this regard give grounds for optimism, and in the desire to sell the studios as a going concern, the liquidator has decided to defer issue of notice to the company's employees to provide the time necessary to assess the substance of the approaches made to him.</P>
    <P>I believe that these approaches give cause for optimism regarding employment at the studios.  I also believe that the development and encouragement of the Irish film industry can be achieved through the operation of the newly-established Irish Film Board, and I would again quote the NFSI board which felt that Exchequer money should be directly invested in film production, which would yield better opportunities for job creation and retention of skills in Ireland.  I have got the same message from many people throughout the industry.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 2 October 1981 and was paid from 6 October 1981, fourth day of incapacity, at the maximum appropriate rate.  All disability benefit due to 9 April 1982, date of the latest medical evidence received, has been issued.  The claim for benefit was not received in my Department until 1 February 1982 when the claimant submitted a number of medical certificates together covering the period 2 October 1981 to 15 January 1982.  As an RSI number was not quoted, his insurance record for 1979-80, the contribution year governing his claim, could <Col N="1461" /> not be traced.  Following inquiries, which were protracted, it was established that he had been employed on a commission basis in that year but had not registered for income tax purposes.  It was also established that he had not paid PRSI contributions in 1979-80.  In accordance with special arrangements made for such cases his claim was then considered on the basis of the contributions paid in the 1978-79 year.  His record of contributions for that year were sufficient to qualify him for payment at the maximum appropriate rate.</P>
      <P>Payment for the period 6 October 1981 to 15 January 1982 was issued on 19 April 1982 and following receipt of medical certificates covering from 16 January 1982 to 9 April 1982, which were handed into Waterford Employment Exchange on 20 April 1982, payment to 9 April was issued on 23 April 1982.  Further payment will issue as medical evidence is received.

Pending inquiries as to the nature and origin of the incapacity, he was paid disability benefit on an interim basis.  In addition he was paid pay-related benefit.  On completion of the inquiries on 30 September 1981, it was accepted that the incapacity was in fact due to an accident at work and injury benefit was allowed at the maximum appropriate rate.  All injury benefit due on the first claim from 21 August to 10 October was paid at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The claim from 30 November 1981 was not associated with the earlier claim, but payment of disability benefit was however made from that date on an interim basis pending inquiries as to the nature and origin of the incapacity.  The matter has however been resolved and an adjusting payment of injury benefit has been made in respect of the period from 30 <Col N="1463" /> November to 18 February 1982.  As from the latter date entitlement to injury benefit ceased on the expiration of 26 weeks from the date of the accident.  Payment of disability benefit and pay-related benefit has continued up to 23 April 1982, the date of the latest medical certificate received.</P>
    <P>As the claimant may be entitled to disablement benefit in addition to disability benefit and pay-related benefit from 19 February 1982 in respect of loss of faculty arising from the accident, the necessary form on which to claim the benefit has been issued to him.

    <P>1 From the introduction of wealth tax until its abolition three valuation dates occurred, namely 5 April 1975, 5 April 1976 and 5 April 1977.  The figures 5,494, 5,142 and 4,911 respectively are the numbers of payers who made payments referable to those valuation dates, irrespective of the year in which any particular payment was made.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that for wealth tax purposes payers comprise the three categories of assessable persons namely, individuals, discretionary trusts and private non-trading companies.</P>
    <P>2 The Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976 became law on 31 March 1976 and there was therefore no yield in 1975.</P>
    <P>3 The statistics available do not show the number of payers of capital acquisitions tax for the years 1976 and 1977.</P>
    <P>4 Post-Budget estimate (25 March 1982). </P>

    </P>
    <P> (1)  Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and the figures shown for the tax on such profits are therefore estimated.</P>
    <P>(2)  Because of a change in the timing of income tax payments, the figure for 1980 for farmers represents 1½ year's tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1483" /> (3)  PAYE figures include certain receipts from non-employee taxpayers &mdash; for example, tax on fees and salaries of proprietorial company directors.</P>
    <P>(4)  The figure for 1982 receipts from PAYE is the post-1982 budget projection.  It does not take account of the subsequent £45 million income tax concession to offset the effects of PRSI increases. </P>

      <P>On the assumptions stated by the Deputy the payments in 1983 on the national debt at end 1982 are estimated to be as follows: Interest Payments, £1,450 million; Capital and sinking Fund Payments, £1,110 million.  These estimates are based on current interest and exchange rates.  Very <Col N="1484" /> short-term liabilities such as Exchequer Bills which are being constantly rolled over and small savings are not included in the estimates for capital payments.  As the borrowing requirement for 1983 is not known at this stage it is not possible to calculate what payments it will give rise to in 1983.</P>

      <P>A superannuation scheme for secretarial assistants to Deputies who are not office holders has been prepared by the Department of the Public Service.  The basic conditions of this scheme, which will commence with effect from 14 November 1980 are similar to those applicable to non-established civil servants.  It is a non-contributory scheme, providing for a pension after 40 years service which, together with the personal rate of social welfare pension would give an aggregate benefit equal to one-half times pay, together with a lump sum of one-and-a-half times pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme also provides for a death gratuity on death-in-service and preservation of benefits where a person resigns voluntarily before retiring age.  Service reckonable will include service funded out of the grant for secretarial assistance and service in a similar capacity given before the grant was introduced.  However, before any benefits which may arise in current year can be paid under the <Col N="1485" /> scheme, it will first be necessary to introduce a Supplementary Estimate in order to secure the approval of Dáil Éireann for the additional expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>The question of amending the scheme to cover the secretarial assistants to Senators is being considered.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 585 and 586 together.</P>
      <P>A sketch scheme for a new Garda District Headquarters in Wicklow town was submitted to the Department of Justice and the local authority in March 1979. The local authority laid down certain conditions which necessitated a revision in design.  Subsequently, requests for the inclusion of extra Garda requirements were received from the Department of Justice.  These were included in a further revised scheme which had to be resubmitted to the Department of Justice and the local authority for their agreement.</P>
      <P>Tenders have recently been invited for the erection of the new headquarters and are due on 20 May.  The question of cost must await the receipt of tenders.  It is not possible at this stage to say when building will commence but there will be no avoidable delay in placing a contract.</P>

    <P> Notes:&mdash; (a)  The Agreement on Pay in regard to the construction industry related general workers employed in the Public Service provides for increase in three phases of 5 per cent each for a period of 16 months.  As the General Operatives and related grades listed at the Botanic Gardens, the Machine Attendant at the Butter Testing Station and the Labourer at the Wool Council are linked for pay purposes to general workers in the construction industry the first two phases of this Agreement are amalgamated to take effect from 1 January 1982.  The terms of the Agreement on Pay in the Public Service, 1982 do not apply to these workers.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Assistant Foremen and Gardeners at the Botanic Gardens have pay parity with Supervisory Gardeners employed by Dublin Corporation. The Supervisory Gardeners concerned have not accepted the terms of the Public Service Pay Agreement, 1982, but are awaiting the outcome of a pay claim being processed by the Labour Court at present.  In the circumstances it is not possible to state the revised rates of pay for the Gardeners and Assistant Foremen at the Botanic Gardens.</P>
    <P>(c)  Certain Labourer related grades enjoy a 10 per cent differential over the basic rate and therefore the first phase increase of the Public Service Pay Agreement 1982 is £4.40 per week. </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Wilson);</NameTxt>
      <P>With over 530,000 accounts issued quarterly it is to be expected that there will be a measure of dissatisfaction on the part of subscribers whose accounts are higher than they expected them to be and who will consequently feel they are being overcharged.  The position was aggravated over the last few years when, because of industrial action, billing was late and somewhat irregular.  The increased charges for calls have also led some subscribers to believe they were being overcharged.</P>
      <P>The billing systems is now up-to-date and that should be helpful from a number of viewpoints.  Means of improving the billing system are examined on a continuing basis.  At present, the following measures are being taken to improve the position:</P>
      <P>&mdash;a new telephone account form, setting out charges more clearly, will be available from the current quarter</P>
      <P>&mdash;the reading of subscribers meters by the photographic process is being extended nationally</P>
      <P>&mdash;an automated system of transferring the filmed data to a computer for processing is being introduced reducing the processing involved</P>
      <P>&mdash;a new type of ticket for recording trunk calls made via operators that will require reduced processing subsequently is being used.</P>
      <P>&mdash;meters for checking meter usage will be made available later this year on a sale or rental basis to subscribers who wish to have them</P>
      <P>&mdash;a substantial proportion of trunk calls made via operators are now being reversed i.e. the callers are being rung back.  </P>

      <P>The person in question had disputed his telephone account on a number of occasions in recent years and rebates were allowed on two occasions.  The subscriber is now querying his accounts for the quarters ended March 1981, September 1981 and December 1981.  His letter of 9 June 1981 was acknowledged but I regret that no response was issued to subsequent letters.  Because of the history of complaints by the subscriber, a detailed check of the apparatus will be necessary and the Department will write to him in the next few days about this. On the general question of subscribers feeling they are being overcharged, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 714 to-day.</P>

At various stages of their development from infancy the treatment of these children may involve the services of plastic surgeons, oral surgeons, otolaryngologists, restorative dentists and speech therapists as well as orthodontists. <Col N="1566" /> There are approximately 20 orthodontists who may provide treatment on behalf of health boards for children with cleft lip and palate but only one of these specialises in treating children presenting particular difficulty at birth or in early infancy.

    </Speaker>
    <P>

    <P>(b) an assessment of management information requirements;</P>
    <P>(c) an evaluation of staff development and training needs; and</P>
    <P>(d) an implementation plan giving effect to any recommendations made.  </P>
    <P>The assignments, which are being carried out by M/s. Coopers and Lybrand Associates commenced in November 1981 and are expected to be completed by end of June 1982.  Total fees payable in respect of these assignments is £116,000 (exclusive of VAT) apportioned as follows, Eastern Health Board &mdash; £66,000; North-Eastern Health Board &mdash; £40,000; Mid-Western Health Board &mdash; £10,000.</P>
    <P>(4) St. James's Hospital &mdash; Arising from a previous assignment, Messrs. Stokes Kennedy Crowley are engaged on a month to month basis to provide assistance in implementation of improvements recommended in financial accounting and control systems.  Average monthly cost in fees is £3,000.  This arrangement will probably terminate at end of June, 1982.</P>
    <P>(5) Apart from the foregoing there are some management consultancy assignments <Col N="1571" /> in which certain stages have been completed and for which commitments have been made but, due to phasing arrangements in the carrying out of assignments, are not currently in progress. These include (i) systems developments for the new Beaumont Hospital, (ii) patient administration and pharmacy systems for the Mater Hospital and St. James's Hospital, and (iii) development of a community index for the NorthWestern Health Board.</P>
    <P>In general, management consultants are engaged to provide expertise which is not available within the local health agency and to provide also an independent assessment of requirements.  All such assignments are funded directly from the Department's Vote and are carried out in accordance with guidelines laid down by the Department of the Public Service. These include prior approval to the assignment, selection procedures, and monitoring by a Steering Committee representative of the Department of Health and the health agency concerned.</P>

      <P>The girl referred to in the question has been attending the Eastern Health Board's dental clinic in Finglas for treatment since April 1976.  However, it was not until January 1982 that her condition was assessed as being suitable for orthodontic treatment.  The treatment was of a type which required her referral to the Dublin Dental Hospital and the health board placed her name on their waiting list for treatment there.  The waiting list is quite extensive, however, and the health board cannot say when treatment might commence.</P>

    <P>A new post of consultant orthodontist in the Eastern Health Board is among <Col N="1573" /> five such posts which have been approved and which it is hoped to fill soon.  The filling of this post should help considerably to reduce the waiting list for orthodontic treatment.</P>

      <P>As, according to the records of my Department, she had less than the minimum of 26 contributions to her credit in the governing 1979/80 contribution year, it was necessary to make inquiries regarding her employment in that year before her entitlement to benefit could be ascertained.

    <P>The number P.851698 refers to a claim for a contributory retirement pension made by the person in 1980, while the number CP 202200 refers to a claim for contributory old age pension made by him in 1981.  He was awarded a pro-rata retirement pension under EEC Regulations from 20 March 1980, amounting to £0.83, increased to £1.05 from 3 April 1980.  He declined to accept the award. He was awarded a pro-rata contributory old age pension, again under EEC Regulations, from 20 March 1981 amounting to £1.55, increased to £1.95 from 3 April 1981 and to £2.05 from 2 October 1981. Although he took this pension originally he returned his pension book to the Department in January 1982 indicating <Col N="1585" /> that he no longer wished to accept it.

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 23 October 1981 and was paid from 27 October 1981, fourth day of incapacity.  Payment was disallowed from 3 March 1982 following examination by a medical referee of my Department who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  She appealed against the decision to disallow payment and in connection with her appeal arrangements have been made to have her again examined on 30 April 1982 by a different medical referee.</P>
      <P>The medical certificate, dated 26 March 1982, submitted by the claimant, indicated that she was in hospital on that date but it did not state the period of hospitalisation.  Following inquiries it was established that she had been in hospital for four days for investigation of her complaint and payment has accordingly been allowed for the period 24 March to 28 March.  When the report of the medical referee examination becomes available the question of her entitlement to payment for the balance of the period will be considered and she will be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <P>However, he did claim disability benefit from 20 November to 3 December 1981.

      <P>The social welfare regulations provide that the combined weekly rate of disability benefit and pay-related benefit payable may not exceed a claimant's reckonable earnings in the tax year relevant to his claim.  The claimant's rate of earnings in the relevant tax year was £96.08 a week.  The rate of disability benefit payable is £88.40 a week with the result that the rate of pay-related benefit is £7.68 a week making a combined total of £96.08 a week.</P>

    <P>With regard to Part (b) of the Deputy's question, I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that it has estimated that between 1973, when it commenced its annual manufacturing employment survey and 1981, 71,000 jobs, which still exist, were created in IDA grant-aided new industry and small industry.</P>
    <P>With regard to Part (c) of the Deputy's question, the latest information available <Col N="1602" /> to me shows that the grant cost per job sustained in the period 1973 &mdash; 1980 was approximately £9,000 at 1980 prices.</P>

I understand from the ESB that the individual concerned has been informed of this and has been quoted the appropriate terms.  The timing of the connection depends upon the ESB's work programme for each district, and is, accordingly, a matter of day-to-day administration of the board.  However, I understand from the ESB that connections will be effected as quickly as possible.</P>

A number of parties have shown interest in such a possibility but no firm take-over proposals have so far emerged. In the circumstances the IDA are also looking at the possibilities of attracting a new project to the premises.</P>

      <P>The <Col N="1626" /> question seems to be based on a misapprehension. Neither the alcolyser (commonly known as the breathalyser) nor the results obtained from its use are produced as evidence in court.  The relevant procedures for prosecutions in drinking-and driving cases based on blood/alcohol concentration above the prescribed limit are set out in the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1978.  Statistics of the various types of drinking-and-driving offences and of breath tests carried out by the Garda Síochána are contained in the annual crime reports of the Garda Commissioner, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>No issue arises of broken seals on alcolysers. If the question is intended to relate to the number of cases in which the seal was broken on bottles containing samples of blood or urine received by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety from the Garda, the figures are: 1978 (from commencement of the current Act in July 1978), 36; 1979, 68; 1980, 61; 1981, 43.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that the Garda station in Glengarriff, County Cork, is considerably under strength as it now has only one sergeant attached to it; and if he will take steps to provide extra gardaí for the area.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the normal Garda strength at Glengarriff Station is one sergeant and two gardaí and that an increase in that strength would not be warranted.  One of the gardaí was transferred from Glengarriff on 9 April but replaced on 21 April. The other garda, who has been on temporary transfer since 4 April, is due to resume duty in Glengarriff next week.</P>
      <P>In addition to the service provided by the local gardaí, the Glengarriff area receives attention from patrols carried out by the district patrol car based at Bantry and from the traffic corps and the divisional task force at Bandon.</P>
