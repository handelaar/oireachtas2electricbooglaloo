      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13 and 12.  Private Members' Business will be taken from 7 to 8.30 p.m., item No. 14 (resumed).

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following regulations in draft&mdash;</P>
      <P>Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations, 1982,</P>
      <P>a copy of which regulations in draft was laid before the House on 18th March, 1982.</P>
      <P>Subsection 3 of section 9 of the Health Contributions Act, 1979, provides that the Minister for Health may by regulations vary the income ceiling level which, taken in conjunction with the rate of health contributions applicable, determines the maximum amounts of contributions payable in respect of an individual in any particular contribution year. Subsection 5 of section 9 of the Act of 1979 requires that a draft of the proposed regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft regulations has been passed by each House.  The draft regulations now before the House deal with the income ceiling which, it is proposed, shall apply in relation to the contribution year commencing on 6 April 1982.</P>
      <P>The original ceiling level specified in the Health Contributions Act, 1979, was £5,000.  This was varied to £5,500 before income-related health contributions came into operation on 6 April 1979.  The latter sum was varied to £7,000 under regulations approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas in March 1980 and applied to the contribution year commencing 6 April 1980.  This ceiling was increased again in 1981 to £8,500 with effect from 6 April 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> The proposed new ceiling figure is £9,500.  This will apply to the contribution year commencing 6 April 1982. This ceiling of £9,500 is the same as that specified in the Social Welfare Bill, 1982, which we have already discussed.</P>
    <P>The income limit for free hospital consultant services will also be raised to £9,500.  This new limit will come into operation from 1 June 1982 and will relate to income for the year ending 5 April 1982.  The reason for the later date arises from the necessity of producing evidence of income when claiming entitlement.  The usual evidence required in the case of employed persons is the form P.60 issued by employers.  This may not be issued until some weeks after 5 April.  However, the later date is to the general advantage of applicants as their eligibility during the months of April and May 1982 will depend on their income for the year ended 5 April 1981.  All persons are now entitled to free hospital inpatient services in a public ward and to free out-patient services.  Those who had incomes of £9,500 or more in the year ending 5 April 1982 will be liable to pay the consultant's fees.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of collection of health contributions, income is divided into three streams:</P>
    <P>Income which is liable for income tax under the PAYE system and which is derived from Insurable Employment;</P>
    <P>Income which is liable for Income Tax under the PAYE system but which is not derived from insurable employment;</P>
    <P>Income which does not fall within the previous categories such as income from farming, the income of self-employed persons and investment income.</P>
    <P>The collection of health contributions from employees is integrated with the administrative machinery for the collection of pay-related social insurance contributions and redundancy contributions through the PAYE tax system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> It is necessary that the ceiling levels for social insurance, redundancy and health contributions should be identical: otherwise the operation of the collection system would be more costly and far more cumbersome.  In particular, the co-ordinated arrangements facilitate employers in the administrative processes involved at their end.</P>
    <P>The collection of health contributions from individuals with income which is liable for income tax but which is not derived from insurable employment is arranged through the tax collection system. The collection of health contributions in respect of income derived from farming is administered by health boards. Taking into account the situation as regards farming income, the multiplier which is used by health boards in the notional assessment of income for health contributions purposes will remain unaltered for the contribution year 1982-83 at 117.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that raising the ceiling level from £8,500 to £9,500 should result in an increase in the amount of contributions to be collected of approximately £2 million in the contribution year 1982-83. Of the estimated additional income about £200,000 should arise in the calendar year 1982.  The remainder of the additional yield should be paid over in the first quarter of 1983.  This position arises simply because most contributors with incomes under £9,500 will not have paid over their maximum contribution by the end of 1982.  These represent by far the greatest proportion of income earners.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the purpose of the draft regulations is to fix the upper limit of income in relation to which the amount of the health contributions payable in respect of any one individual in the contribution year commencing 6 April 1982 will be determined.  I now ask the House to approve of the Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations, 1982 in draft.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael are broadly in agreement with the setting of the figure which was the figure agreed as part of the January budget.  The income limit will <Col N="279" /> operate from 1 April.  The Minister said the benefits will come into operation as from June.  Will he clarify the reason for the delay?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): In his speech the Minister said that the evidence of income will be the form P.60.  He stated that this will be to the advantage of the person paying the contribution because eligibility will extend for April and May on the previous year's income. I should like to know what the Minister will use after that.  In the situation of a person with an income in excess of £9,500 in 1982 after the tax year commences, will he be assessed on income for the whole year on the basis of the form P.60? A sentence in the Minister's speech suggests that it will apply only for April and May and that subsequently some other form of assessment will apply.  I should like the Minister to clarify that.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to notional assessment for farmers and he stated that the multiplier used by health boards in the notional assessment of income will remain unaltered at 117 for the contribution year 1982-83.  In the present state of farming 117 is a very high multiplier. It should be revised downwards to keep the real level of income and eligibility in line with what it was originally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): As the Minister has told us, the objective of these regulations is to increase the ceiling for payment of health contributions from £8,500 to £9,500.  The Minister states that the effect of this will bring in £2 million in the year 1982-83.  The Minister has told us that a comparatively small amount of that money, £200,000, would be brought in in the calendar year of 1982 with the remainder being brought in in the first quarter of 1983.  The Minister has also told the House that as well as increasing the ceiling for payment of contributions the income limit will also be raised from £8,500 to £9,500.  I should like the Minister to tell the House the number of people who will be eligible for benefit as a result of increasing the eligibility limit.  He should also tell the House <Col N="280" /> the cost to the Exchequer of increasing that limit.</P>
      <P>I presume that the extra £2 million that will be collected will be sufficient to cover the cost of extending the benefits to the additional people.  If that is not so I should like to know what provision the Minister has made for discharging the additional cost to the health boards and the Exchequer.  I should like to know the number of people who do not have medical cards and whose income is under £8,500.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to look at the system of collection from the farming community administered by health boards.  It appears to be cumbersome in that a number of small farmers who are medical card holders receive demands which must cost a lot of money administratively to issue.  The receipt of such demands poses problems for those farmers.  Will the Minister investigate the possibility of transferring that function to rent collectors who are in a better position to know owners of small holdings?  It appears that the lists operated by health boards are not up to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputies for their contributions.  In relation to a question raised by Deputy Flaherty I should like to state that the problem relates to having a P.60 form available. That form very often is not available until the middle or the end of May.  It varies from year to year and person to person and it was for that reason that 1 June was considered a convenient time.  That date has been found to be satisfactory. Administratively it fits in well.  If an earlier date was chosen we could run into administrative difficulties.  I should like to tell Deputy Noonan that eligibility and the payment of contributions are two separate things.  That is part of the confusion in the system.  Contributions are on current income and eligibility is based on the previous year's income as certified by tax returns or, in other cases, by the use of the multiplier.  That is the reason why such a small proportion of the new <Col N="281" /> increase comes into this year, a matter that was referred to by Deputy Fitzpatrick. Most people will only exceed the £8,500 limit towards the end of the year or the beginning of next year.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like the Minister to clarify that matter further.  With the pacing of wage agreements a person on £9,500 after the beginning of the tax year in 1982 may be carried 10 per cent over that figure and I should like to know if such a person will be paying on £9,500 or on the figure in excess of £10,000?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of £9,500 is the upper limit and people only pay until they reach that figure.  The Deputy may recall that there was a proposal earlier in the year &mdash; not from this side of the House but from the previous Government in documents circulated &mdash; to include all income under the 1 per cent levy.  That was dropped and was not included in the first budget and is not included now.  We are talking about going to £9,500 and stopping there.</P>

      <P>Yes, eligibility is based on the previous year's P.60.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan also raised a point about the notional assessment in relation to the farming community.  He made a fair point that in the past year farming was bad and although it improved somewhat this year it was still in difficult circumstances. I am aware of that and in the last year when I was involved in this I decided not to increase it.  For the second year in succession it has not been increased.  I am sure the Deputy will accept that that is a reasonable approach on the part of the Government. With regard to the question raised by Deputy O'Hanlon on the method of collection from the farmers I should like to state that collection has been difficult in <Col N="282" /> relation to farming as it is in relation to many other sections of the community. As far as the Department is concerned the collection system operated is satisfactory. It is a new system and the farming community accept this as a contribution they make towards these services.  They are happy to work with that.  I will have the statement in relation to demands going out in error investigated.  We will look at the administrative side in relation to the collection system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be difficult to answer that now because this only changes entitlement to consultant services. Everybody is entitled to a bed in a public ward free but entitlement to consultant services changes.  All that is happening is that we are keeping more or less up with inflation.  The numbers should be more or less similar.  If we did not make this change, people would lose eligibility.</P>
      <P>On the more complex aspect of exact costings throughout the system that information is not readily available.  So far as the health boards are concerned, I shall be meeting these in the near future about their problems.  They have very substantial problems, as the Deputy is probably aware.  These have been fairly well publicised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be extremely difficult because the Deputy is talking about people who might apply for consultant services in the coming year, based on their last year's incomes.  That is not something which is readily quantifiable, although one could get it historically, perhaps. Basically, it is estimated that there would be no increase in numbers.  All we are doing is keeping up with inflation, keeping the same number of people in the system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That would be the normal situation.  The figure of £9,500 was calculated under the previous Government. It is carried through because it is tied in also with the social welfare payments and the figure of £9,500 there. There could be minor variations, depending on how the inflation rate goes.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I have one last question.  In the case of contributions from the farming community who are eligible, as the Minister is probably well aware, sometimes they do not pay their contributions.  At what stage does eligibility cease if the payments are not made?  Is there a general practice?  As I understand, it varies from health board to health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question. This is because the eligibility and the contributions are two separate things. One is eligible by definition of one's position.  Whether one pays or not is a separate matter for the health boards to take up.  One's eligibility would be covered by one's notional assessment.</P>

    <Title>Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) (No. 2) Bill, 1981 [Seanad]: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is not a controversial measure.  It is an important consumer protection measure which had been promised for some time.  The Bill was prepared on the instructions of Deputy Albert Reynolds under the previous Fianna Fáil administration and was subsequently accepted by the Coalition Government.  My predecessor, Deputy Paddy Cooney, introduced the Bill in Seanad Éireann on 21 November 1981 where it was welcomed by all sides of the House and passed Committee and Final Stages on 9 December 1981.</P>
      <P>The basic purpose of this Bill is to provide in law for measures to govern and regulate the operation of the Irish travel industry and to protect the interests of the travelling public.  The measure before the House is an enabling one and the implementation of the protection measures provided for will necessitate the making of regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be well aware of some of the difficulties experienced by customers of the travel trade in the past couple of years.  The question of the regulation of the travel trade in the interests of the travelling public has been an ongoing <Col N="285" /> issue for some years now.  The ideal situation would be one where governmental regulation could be avoided.  With that end in mind, successive Ministers for Transport have, in recent years, urged the trade to aim at a high degree of self-regulation in the interests of both the trade and the public.  The trade, through the medium of the Irish Travel Agents' Association, did establish a fund which was used in the case of the failure of two relatively small companies and was also drawn on in the arrangements in which the ITAA participated in relation to Bray Travel clients who were abroad on holidays at the time of that collapse.  However, the fund never reached a level sufficient to deal with a major collapse in the trade, such as occurred in December 1980 in the case of Bray Travel.  I acknowledge that, particularly in the wake of the Bray Travel collapse, the trade took upon itself in a more serious way to protect its customers by voluntary bonding arrangements and so on.  Nevertheless, events have demonstrated that a need exists for Government-sponsored arrangements based on legislation to protect the public.</P>
    <P>The Irish travel trade consists of tour operators who negotiate and organise tours, arrange travel, book hotels, publish brochures and so on and travel agents who are the retail outlets for the sale of holiday packages, airline tickets, sea voyages, etc., on behalf of tour operators and transport carriers.  At present there are about 30 tour operators in Ireland advertising to more than 100 destinations. There are, in addition, about 200 travel agents in the country, many of whom, although primarily concerned with the retail of packages on behalf of various tour operators, organise weekend tours to London, Amsterdam, and so on.  The majority of tour operators and travel agents are members of the Irish Travel Agents' Association.</P>
    <P>The person buying a holiday is in the unique position of paying in full and in advance for a very perishable product available outside the jurisdiction almost entirely on the basis of descriptions of the product contained in a holiday brochure. Needless to say, these are extremely <Col N="286" /> attractive.  The vast majority of Irish tour operators and travel agents are responsible individuals.  However, there is at present no ban on entry to the trade and no criteria or qualifications to be met by new entrants.  At present a person can rent a basement flat or shopfront, set himself up and advertise as a tour operator or travel agent and proceed to accept large sums of money over the counter for a service that may or may not materialise, depending on a whole range of factors. The Irish Travel Agents' Association have only limited means of enforcing consumer protection measures on their members and, of course, have no function or power whatever in relation to non-members or new entrants to the trade.</P>
    <P>The collapses which have occurred have prompted the ITAA and individual operators to look closely at the degree of protection offered to their customers.  As a result the ITAA, as a body and a number of tour operators individually, have secured bonds from insurance companies and banks which are being widely advertised as offering safeguards to the public booking holidays on trust.  Action along those lines is, of course, to be commended; the pity is that it took a major collapse in the trade to spur the move.</P>
    <P>The bonding arrangements entered into voluntarily were the subject of a study last year by Messrs.  Craig Gardner, management consultants, on behalf of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The findings in that study, though necessarily tentative because of the nature of the exercise, pointed to some major shortcomings in the trade.  Chief among the shortcomings was the capital structure, with companies trading on the basis of a relatively low paid-up capital compared to the size of their turnover.  A further indication of this inadequate capital backing can be found in the fact that only one of the companies surveyed owned their premises with the remainder having their premises on lease.  While this may be typical of service industries with little or no investment in fixed assets, the under-capitalisation which the survey revealed, coupled with the absence of reserves or other readily liquifiable <Col N="287" /> resources, suggests a heavy reliance in the trade on credit and cash flow with all the dangers that such a situation holds for the consumer when things go wrong for an operator.</P>
    <P>In the area of bonding arrangements, the consultants found that generally tour operators who were members of the Irish Travel Agents' Association were bonded individually to the extent of 5 per cent of turnover, backed up by a reserve fund of £50,000 and a group bond of £500,000 for the summer 1981 season.  These arrangements were of course voluntary, and the consultants pointed out that it was very difficult for any trade association to regulate its members when all the regulations were voluntary.  For these reasons the consultants concluded, among other things, that the only way to enforce the adequate bonding of tour operators was by means of legislation.</P>
    <P>The basic elements envisaged in the present measure are:</P>
    <P>&mdash; a bonding arrangement for tour operators and travel agents for the protection of their customers;</P>
    <P>&mdash; a back-up protection fund to be raised by contributions from tour operators on a basis to be determined by the Minister for Transport:</P>
    <P>&mdash; a system of licensing to control entry to the trade.</P>
    <P>The bonding arrangements, which would be inter-linked with the licensing system, would represent the first line of defence in the event of an operator or agent failing to meet his commitments and the protection fund would represent the reserve.  Availability of an adequate bond would be an essential requirement before any operator or agent would be considered for a licence.</P>
    <P>The basic objectives of the Bill are to prevent failures in the trade as well as to provide remedies where failures occur, to protect the consumer as well as to regulate the trade.  Consumer protection is the major motive, but the licensing and bonding elements will have, as a major objective also, the imposition of certain <Col N="288" /> rigours and disciplines designed to put the trade on a proper footing over time and in this way to seek to prevent failures. It is envisaged that the bonding requirement will lead to financial assessments by underwriters who are expert at gauging risks and tour operators who are seriously under-capitalised are likely to be faced with the choice of improving their financial position, paying a high premium or not securing a bond at all.  In the same way it is envisaged that in vetting applications for licences, I will be able to call for details of financial resources, reports and balance sheets, and pay particular regard to the degree of capitalisation of applicants and condition licences accordingly.</P>
    <P>The three elements involved represent an integrated package which draws on the best elements of protection in force in other European countries.  A number of other possible options were considered including the possibility of some form of insurance arrangements.  However, such arrangements would not prevent the entry of undesirable elements into the trade and were accordingly discarded in favour of licensing and bonding arrangements of the type envisaged.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been generally well received by all the interests concerned.  I am aware that retailers, particularly smaller ones, have been concerned about the question of having to secure licences and provide bonds, and I know that many public representatives received representations from retailers about the matter. During the course of the Seanad debate on this measure, many Senators made the point that they would be worried that the Bill might be unduly onerous where agents are concerned.  My predecessor gave much consideration to this point in advance of introducing the Bill and came to the conclusion that we would not succeed in achieving our fundamental objective to protect the travelling public unless we included agents.  I share that view.  I acknowledge that retailers, members of the ITAA, have a good track record, but the question of new entrants to the trade or retailers who are not members of the ITAA is a matter which needs to be considered.  However, the Bill is <Col N="289" /> essentially an enabling measure to be implemented by way of regulation.  Provision will be made for the particular difficulties of the travel agent and full consultations will take place with the trade in drafting the implementing regulations. My predecessor made this point clear when he addressed the annual banquet of the Irish Travel Agents' Association in Limerick last November and I am happy to confirm it again today.</P>
    <P>I am aware that this was not an easy Bill to prepare and that drafting turned out to be somewhat more complex than one would have anticipated at first sight. The first difficulty to be resolved was balancing the need to protect the consumer against the need to avoid the imposition of excessive restrictions on the trade.  I believe that the package constructed has been built carefully to achieve that end &mdash; to protect the consumer without imposing any undue restrictions on the trade.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that the term &ldquo;inability or failure of a tour operator to meet his financial or contractual obligations&rdquo; is very carefully and fully defined in section 2.  It will be clear from this that the measures provided for in the Bill are intended to protect travellers in a disaster situation where a tour operator or agent goes out of business or absconds with customers' moneys etc.  The bonding and protection fund are not intended to be used to compensate individual or particular clients where, for example, an operator or agent is unable to provide a flight on the date specified due to circumstances outside his control, such as an airline strike.  Deputies will appreciate that in such circumstances there could be no question of calling in a bond, revoking a licence or terminating an operator's or agent's means of livelihood and in such cases of <i>force majeure</i> or in cases of an act of God, the question of refunds or the arrangement of an alternative flight or holiday are matters for settlement between the tour operator and the traveller concerned in accordance with the provisions of the original booking contract.</P>
    <P>In a statement issued on 22 September last, the Director of Consumer Affairs <Col N="290" /> supported the proposals provided for in this Bill and indicated his belief that the measures involved offer the best hope of avoiding a repetition of the extensive losses which some consumers have suffered in recent times.</P>
    <P>There were lengthy consultations with the travel trade in the preparation of this measure.  The Bill has been welcomed by the trade and I would like to place on record the assistance received from the trade in preparing this measure and to express my gratitude.  This consultation process will, of course, continue through the implementing stage.</P>
    <P>I should remind the House that the present measure is an enabling one, and the House may be assured that I will proceed with all possible speed to make the necessary orders and regulations to bring the relevant arrangements into operation.  I can say now, however, that the practicalities involved in implementation and indeed the need for further consultations with the trade make it impossible to have all the protection arrangements involved operational for the 1982 summer season.  Indeed, even if the proposed measures could be brought into force overnight, it would take some time, for example, to build up the protection fund to a level that would be sufficient to deal with a major collapse. In these circumstances there is an obligation on the trade, in their own interest, both from a customer-relationship point of view and in establishing or maintaining credibility with banks and insurance companies, to offer protection in the intervening period by maintaining or improving their existing bonding and other protection arrangements.</P>
    <P>The present measure is an important consumer protection measure and I am happy to recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I first of all congratulate the Minister on his appointment to the office of the Department of Transport and offer good wishes to him in the discharge of his duties there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see this measure being brought forward so early in the life of the new Dáil.  Whether that is fortuitous because the budget has been postponed <Col N="291" /> until Thursday I will not deal with in detail.  As the Minister said, the original measure had been under consideration by Deputy Reynolds, and I introduced the measure in the Seanad where it passed all its Stages.</P>
    <P>There is no area of disagreement between us on the principles of the Bill. I echo the Minister's tributes to the travel trade, who have shown a lot of responsibility with regard to their obligations to customers, and obvious sensitivity about their standing and reputation.  They have shown this first in the high degree of co-operation which they offered to the Department during the framing of this legislation, in their availability for consultation with regard to the legislation and, more important, with regard to the regulations which will be necessary in the implementation of the legislation.  It is only right that the appreciation of the House should be put on record in this respect.</P>
    <P>Another matter for which the trade deserve to be commended is the steps they have taken, so to speak, to put their house in order pending the passage of the legislation and the implementation of the regulations.  It is unfortunate that it took a number of rather spectacular collapses in the trade to highlight the need for bonding protection for customers.  That is not to say there was not protection already, and in the case of a great many operators that level of protection is being extended.  Now it behoves the public to make simple inquiries to see whether the firm with which they intend to deal is bonded.</P>
    <P>The travelling public will find that all responsible firms are so protected.  It is important particularly this year that customers should be protected and should make such inquiries before they deal with a firm because from what one gathers from the newspapers the foreign travel business is not as buoyant this year as previously.  In addition, new financial burdens will be placed on foreign travel as a result of tomorrow's budget, and that may have a significant effect on a business which is notorious for relying on cash flow for viability.  It is a business which <Col N="292" /> tends to be under-capitalised and in such a business any squeeze in cash flow can have serious consequences.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the advice I offer to people who are booking foreign holidays this year is to make sure that they book only with a bonded firm.  Of course the responsible members of the trade are bonded and difficulties there should not arise, but as the Minister said, it is possible for irresponsible elements to enter the trade who do not have adequate qualifications, knowledge or experience of the business and who are not adequately capitalised. The proposed system of licensing will put an end to that and, as the Minister said, the bonding requirement will constitute a vetting procedure on new entrants because a firm which the Department would not regard as suitable because of lack of experience or capital structure would have difficulty in entering the trade.  The regulations to be implemented later will act as a further vetting procedure. This vetting of new entrants will ensure that when the new regime comes into operation only firms who are healthy <i>ab initio</i> will be trading.  Therefore, the possibility of collapse for the reasons that have caused collapses heretofore will have been removed and it is difficult to foresee how any firm could go out of business except from some unforeseen commercial disaster.</P>
    <P>I wonder if in practice the protection fund will ever be called upon.  I agree, of course, that it should be set up, but I suggest that the size of the fund should be looked at early on to ensure that an excessive amount would not be gathered into it.  I think that in every jurisdiction where there is a licensing system such as is proposed here it has been possible to reduce if not cease altogether contributions from the trade to the protection fund.  I am sure that is something that will be considered carefully.  It is a matter which exercised my consideration and I believe the Minister will give serious thought to it also.  There is the question of the use that might be made of the moneys in that fund and the fruit of the fund.  Obviously, a substantial sum will be put into the fund.  It would not be worth having if it were not reasonably <Col N="293" /> substantial but it must be in proportion to the risk that it is envisaged should be covered and, as I indicated, I think that risk will be small after the new regime. Nevertheless, there will still have to be a reasonably substantial fund and whether that money is to lie dormant and the fruits to be reinvested in the fund or whether they are to be used for some other purpose is a matter which must be considered. It is difficult to see what use could be made of that money because it is obviously in the nature of trust money subscribed by particular persons, a section of the travelling public, and the nature of the Trusts Bill will limit the uses to which the fund can be put.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I wish to pay tribute to Aer Lingus for effecting the rescue operation last year of a number of Irish holidaymakers who were stranded due to the inability of a firm to meet its commitments to them.  If we did not have a national air carrier that rescue operation might have been extremely difficult to arrange and I want to put on record the ready co-operation of Aer Lingus, an acknowledgment by them of their special position in relation to stranded Irish visitors. We hope, however, that when the new regime comes into operation next year such calls will not have to be made. In future if they are made there will be a fund to remunerate the airline promptly for the expense involved.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see this measure coming up so quickly.  I hope the regulations can be made and the implementation of it achieved in time for the 1983 holiday season.  I am well aware that the regulations in this case are more significant than the usual consequential regulations made following the passage of a statute because they in effect will be the operating regime for the tourist industry from then on. Obviously, their drafting is more complex than normal.  Yet, because of the need for it and urgency in having this scheme operational I share the Minister's implied hope when he says they will not be available for 1982 but will be available for 1983.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedBrennan" hpid="Mr. N. Brennan Mr. N. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies I welcome this measure which, if anything, <Col N="294" /> was overdue.  Personally I should like to see a figure stated in respect of the bond: it seems that no figure is there at present.  I should like to see it stated that the bond must be so many thousand pounds.  I know it has been stated that it could be £3 or £5 per head but I would like to have a very substantial figure stated for the bond which would ensure that anybody booking holidays would have no worry about whether they would go or not.  The recent collapse of Bray Travel which, I suppose, gave rise to this measure indicates that there should be some measures taken to prevent any recurrence of such an event.  Anybody who books a holiday should have no worry or uncertainty about going or not going.  They should not have to go to the airport to find out that the holiday is not on.  The provision being made now will, I hope, close any existing loopholes, but a close eye will have to be kept on this matter.  The Bill goes a long way towards achieving this.  We cannot afford to have any recurrence of the situation where 1,500 persons lost their money as happened in the Bray Travel case.  As Deputy Cooney has said it was through the goodwill of Aer Lingus and other people that the travellers were brought home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any citizens booking holidays here should have no worries on that score. When they pay their money they should be assured that the holiday will go ahead as planned.  This measure should instil confidence that this will be the situation in the future.  I should however like to see a figure stated for the fund and this is something the Minister should consider so that only bona fide operators could do the job.  If a firm of the calibre of Bray Travel collapsed it is possible that other firms could collapse.  I compliment the Minister on the celerity with which he has introduced this measure and I hope there will be no recurrence of the previous situation so that holiday makers who have booked a holiday can travel without a hitch or fear of the travel agency collapsing. I gather that we have about 200 of those agencies.  Personally, I have never availed of the sunny beaches of Majorca or these places but I should like to feel secure if I were going there.  Even <Col N="295" /> though it will not be possible to implement this measure in 1982 I trust the Bill will be a warning to travel agents that we are in earnest about this matter and that there will be no further collapses such as that in the case of Bray Travel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and I welcome the Bill which surely will have an easy passage through the House given its rather broad parentage seeing that the original sponsor of the measure, Deputy Cooney, now finds himself in opposition and the Bill being introduced by the incoming administration.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that both Governments have accorded a degree of priority to this measure which having regard to the recent history of the trade seems to me entirely appropriate.  It was among the first measures introduced by the previous Government and it is now the first substantial piece of legislation to emerge from the incoming Government.  The fact that both Governments have given it such a degree of priority shows the level of public concern that exists in this area.  I welcome the aims of the Bill.  It seems to me the measure does two things: it tries to prevent collapses in the future and prevent difficultues arising &mdash; that should be our primary objective &mdash; and at the same time provides a remedy in the event of difficulties actually arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach that has been taken, one of licensing and bonding, is probably the correct approach.  I know that when the question first arose it seemed that something might be done in the nature of insurance and so on.  But I can see that difficulties would arise and I can see that licensing and bonding is the correct approach.  But that obviously begs the question about the adequacy of the bond and the arrangements that are going to be made there.  We are in a difficulty in that we are discussing legislation which is essentially enabling legislation and the real meat of the measure will come in the regulations that are to follow.  I would caution that many of the operators at the moment advertise the fact that their holidays are bonded.  There appears to be <Col N="296" /> some ground for apprehension that the bondings are not all as secure as they might be.  I would caution the Minister that when drafting the regulations he should not adopt, in any sense, the present <i>status quo vis-à-vis</i> bonding as his guideline but that he should strike out afresh and in no sense feel that all he has to do is to put the present level of protection on a statutory basis, because that would be quite inadequate and would fail to meet the needs of the situation.</P>
    <P>There is one area to which I want to refer.  This debate and the introduction of the legislation is largely sparked by several highly publicised collapses, the most notable of which was the Bray Travel collapse.  I have spoken to quite a number of the people who found themselves victims of that collapse.  Some of them were engaged couples who had put whatever spare cash was available to them into their honeymoon plans.  I spoke to one man who after 20 or 30 years without a foreign holiday found himself redundant, saw hopes of getting himself into another occupation, and decided to take advantage of the redundancy money to take his first foreign holiday in his entire adult life and invested his redundancy money to bring himself and his wife on a holiday, and that was down the drain.</P>
    <P>As legislators we have a responsibility to those who find themselves victims because this is a subject that has been talked about for years.  It did not come out of the blue.  There were parallels in Britain.  We all knew or should have known that this was an area where dangers arose, where people were at risk.  If as legislators we fail to take the necessary action in time to protect consumers, then we have the responsibility to remedy that situation.  Buying a foreign holiday is almost unique in terms of a transaction in the extent to which somebody is at risk and is required to pay generally the whole amount well in advance and, in the nature of things, for something which he is incapable of inspecting.  If one is going to buy a car one can test drive it and bring in a mechanic to look at it.  If one is going to buy clothing one has an opportunity to look at it on the counter.  But it would be <Col N="297" /> hard to find another area where someone is required to pay in advance the entire purchase price, a very substantial amount, without any opportunity of finding out what is going to be on offer except for relying on the representations made by the tour operators or the travel agency.  For that reason we should all have recognised that people required to pay in advance were in a particularly vulnerable situation and we had been alerted by what happened in Britain to just what the consequences could be from that.  Yet, as legislators we failed to respond in time.</P>
    <P>We have an obligation.  I would remind the House that there have been other areas of activity where it was felt that the legislation was not as effective as it might have been in securing the interests of people who were at risk and in that situation those people were compensated in full.  I refer to the actions in relation to the investors in the Irish Trust Bank who were compensated in full by the party now in Government.  At that stage it was accepted that it was important to establish that our regulations for the banks were adequate and if they were not adequate that as legislators and as a Government we would stand behind people who had relied on their adequacy.  I suggest that exactly the same principle applies here and I suggest that we have a very clear obligation to those who find themselves victims, in particular of the Bray Travel collapse.</P>
    <P>This subject was touched on by the previous Government when the matter was before the Seanad.  At that stage the then Minister, Deputy Cooney, indicated his sympathy with the victims but pointed out that at that time any firm decision to make funds available would be premature. So it would be, because the liquidation proceedings were still before the court and nobody knew whether funds were in fact going to be available.  It would not be desirable that State funds would be available to the victims when funds might have been available within either the company itself or some associated company.  But it is now quite clear that the victims of Bray Travel are not <Col N="298" /> going to be compensated unless the Minister opposite and the Government make funds available.  I challenge the Minister to tell this House why, if those whose circumstances are such that they are in a position to be substantial investors in a merchant bank where they go after high interest rates knowing that the high interest rates are a function of risk, are entitled to be baled out, the small man who finds himself the victim of this collapse and who we have failed to protect in the past should not now be similarly protected.  I would ask the Minister when replying to advert to this question and to indicate what can be done for these people because he is a member of the party who in the past have shown this determination to stand behind the adequacy of protection in a field where protection is seen as being necessary.  This is manifestly a case where protection was necessary and he has an absolute obligation, now that it is clear that there is no other course available, to make the necessary funds available.  I ask the Minister now to meet the needs of the Bray Travel victims.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focail a rá ar an Bhille seo, ach ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liom comhghaírdeas a ghabháil leis an Aire as ucht na oifige atá aige anois agus ta súil agam go ndéanfaidh sé sár obair san Roinn sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say a few words on this Bill.  Perhaps being a new Deputy and speaking for the first time in this House, the Chair would give me a little leeway. I am somewhat disappointed about the contents of the Bill.  I have always felt that Bills of their very nature &mdash; I suppose it has something to do with the necessity to draft them in some legal form which is a custom going back over a long period of time &mdash; never seem to deal with the problems which they were originally brought in to deal with.  A person who has been deprived of a holiday due to such circumstances is a victim for whose protection one presumes the Bill was brought in.  However, reading through the various sections one finds that by the time the unfortunate victim would get <Col N="299" /> compensation the value of the money in question would have dissipated, somewhat in a similar way to what happens in relation to malicious injury claims, because of the lengthy procedure involved in claiming where operators have failed to keep their contractual obligations.  However that is the system and I do not suppose my contribution will change it.  Would it be possible to have a more speedy solution to the various problems that have arisen?  One presumes that there will be no retrospection but that new situations will be dealt with as they arise.  I hope that the Bill when it is implemented will not be a pious platitude and have little effect.  I would like to think that it will have teeth and be operated in a practical fashion to the benefit of people who are the victims of the collapse of any tour operator.</P>
    <P>As regards granting licences, it is only correct that there should be certain requirements attached to this.  I should like if the question of the bond was spelled out more clearly.  No doubt many Deputies have practical experience of bonding in relation to housing and the construction industry where it has been found that it is virtually impossible, because of the manner in which the bond has been drawn up, to get any redress in respect of the collapse of a firm or failure to complete a house.  The Minister should ensure that whatever regulations are made regarding the bond are incapable of being mistreated and that the bond should be for the benefit of the person who has lost out on a holiday.</P>
    <P>The time scale between the occurrence of any wrong and the redress a person may expect to receive is very long.  I do not know what the Minister may be able to do in that respect but it is necessary to have speedy redress.  One can imagine the situation of a young couple going on honeymoon and due to the collapse of a tour operator that happy holiday has to be abandoned.  There is little redress in offering such a couple financial compensation two years later, which appears to be the situation that might arise under the Bill if there is a question of insolvency, liquidation or bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="300" /> I welcome the principles in the Bill and hope that it will go some way towards rectifying the situation which arose in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire) Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> My contribution to the debate is mainly a plea. I welcome the Bill.  The outgoing Minister, Deputy Cooney, was unable to make provision for the victims of Bray Travel by virtue of the fact that liquidation proceedings were taking place.  It is now clear that whatever funds are available will not be presented to assist the victims of Bray Travel.  Without the collapse of that firm the urgency which was placed on the implementation of this legislation would not have come about.  We all recognise that this group of people have done something for the good of the community at large.  I make a plea to the Minister to assist the victims of Bray Travel in some way.  I appreciate it will be difficult and I do not mean to make a political point out of this.  It is not something one plays politics with.  However, we have a group of people who have suffered and who directly contributed to this legislation.  It would be a good gesture on the part of the Minister to find a way to assist these people.  The efforts they have made justify this.  I repeat my plea that some way be found to assist the victims of Bray Travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The public will be relieved when it passes through this House.  A lot of time has elapsed since it was first introduced.</P>
      <P>There is an aspect of people booking holidays which I hope the Minister will have regard to.  It is the difficulty many clients have in getting redress for holidays on which they have embarked when they find that the accommodation they get on arrival is not the accommodation they booked.  I have been told by many people who have complaints with travel agents at present that it takes a long time to get redress.  Sometimes it means having to go to court.  The Act dealing with trade descriptions should be brought into force particularly where the accommodation booked by people is not what they get on arrival.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> I booked accommodation sometime ago and found it had been allocated to someone else and I was shut away into a little annex.  I screamed and roared about this and finally was put back to the place I had booked originally.  Not everyone is capable of screaming and roaring when they go on holiday, nor should they have to do this.  Travel agents must be held responsible.</P>
    <P>I know the Bill is to protect people from fly-by-night operators who are not bonded.  I hope the Minister will keep a careful eye on the implementation of the Bill.  As the Minister said, I know that the vast majority of tour operators and travel agents are responsible people. People must be careful about whom they book a holiday through and check that the company is a member of the travel agents association.  As we know, anyone can set themselves up as a travel agent and simply sell a holiday and get commission from some other travel agent on whose behalf they may be booking the holiday.  In the past very often when deposits were taken from those booking the holiday the travel agent just disappeared. There was a case of this not long ago following on the Bray Travel situation. It is fair to say that prior to the 1981 election the then Opposition had said that the people who had lost their money would have that money paid back to them if the then Opposition were returned to Government.  Now we know that the Opposition when they were returned to Government did not keep this pledge.  I had to speak on this Private Members' Bill in Private Members' time when the public gallery was filled with many people who were described as victims of Bray Travel and who had been given the impression that they would get their money back and that this legislation would be retrospective.  That did not happen. It is wrong to mislead people, but the buyer still must beware.  The onus is on the public and they are much more alert now to the possibilities of losing their holiday money than they were previously.</P>
    <P>It is important that the bonding arrangements be sufficient to protect the person going on holidays.  It is very important <Col N="302" /> that if it can be shown that a company took payment from the public knowing full well that the likelihood was that the people who paid would never be able to embark on the holiday, or that the company were likely to close up, they should be prosecuted for fraud because that is what it is.  There are too many loopholes in the law at the moment which allow people who know that they are in a very difficult financial situation to get away with this kind of operation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to protect the consumer and very little can be said on it that has not been said already.  The protections offered in the Bill are in line with protections offered in other countries. Ultimately the bonding of these travel agencies is a very secure way of protecting the consumer.  I understand that the trade itself had certain reservations about this Bill because they did not want to have too many restrictions, but they have accepted that this Bill is not too restrictive and will enable them to carry on their business because, naturally, the outlay of money for holidays requires quite an amount of capital outlay and the only source of this capital open to most travel agencies is the people booking holidays.</P>
    <P>I should have started by saying that I wish the Minister well in his Ministry and in all the legislation that he will be bringing before this House from time to time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to thank the Members of the House for their contributions on this Bill which has been exposed, let us say, to a greater extent than most Bills that have come for Second Reading before the House.  The Bill has benefited considerably by public discussion and by its passage through all Stages in Seanad Éireann.  I thank Deputy Cooney for his good wishes and for his comments on the Bill.  I endorse his remarks with regard to the trade and how helpful they were to him and to me and how helpful we hope they will be in the discussions which will have to take place when we are making regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> As I indicated in the course of my speech, a great deal of work has still to be done and its effectiveness will depend on the degree of co-operation that can be established between my Department and the people in the trade.  I would like also to endorse Deputy Cooney's remarks in praise of the trade for their attempts to put their house in order.  This has been done, as I indicated in my speech, in roughly the kind of way which we are establishing statutorily in this House, by bonding and by having a fund and a very large guarantee.  We have, as indicated, licence, bond and fund.  They are the three basics in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney went on to emphasise the seriousness of under-capitalisation and of having inexperienced people entering the trade.  He pointed out that this was a possible recipe for disaster. The possibility of that kind of collapse is lessened by the very fact of what the ITAA members have done and by the fact that this legislation is being put through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Deputy made an interesting point. He said that an eye should be kept on the size of the fund.  Of course, priority, No. 1 is that the fund should be built up to a substantial level, and I take his point that there will be an obligation on the Minister for Transport to see that it does not grow too excessive and just lie there.  He indicated that in the UK, which has a similar fund, some steps have been taken to reduce the amount of contribution because of the healthy state of the fund. I tell the House that we will be very pleased if we reach that stage because of the great comfort it would be to those interested in consumer protection.</P>
    <P>The Deputy indicated that a considerable amount of work has to be done in consultation with the trade before the regulations are finalised and the provisions of the Act become effective. Deputy Bellew when speaking was disappointed that this could not be expedited, but he will realise that a great deal of work has to be done.  There will be an onus on the Department to examine this capitalisation and to have a very good <Col N="304" /> look at the way a particular applicant for a licensing bond is conducting his business.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan mentioned that legislation was overdue.  I think that this Bill would be on the Statute Book already were it not for the various changes that took place, as I indicated.  The present Minister for Industry and Energy worked on the Bill and my immediate predecessor had taken it to the Seanad.  Therefore, there was no deliberate delay in dealing with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan said that he would like a bigger figure for the bond.  Like Deputy Brennan, I deplore the fact that so many people suffered as a result of this collapse.  He mentioned a figure of 1,500 people.  He need not have any worries about this Bill because the combination of licence, bond and fund will be more than adequate to protect the consumer.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Birmingham for his congratulations and good wishes and his general welcome for the Bill.  He warned &mdash; and it is no harm to reiterate it &mdash; that there is no proof that the present bonds are necessarily adequate.  In this Bill we are seeing to it that there will be adequate bonding and protection.  He mentioned the fact that there was full compensation for those who suffered through the collapse of the Irish Trust Bank and talked about the protection of the smaller person who might have been involved in the Bray Travel collapse.  I do not accept that the principle is the same, nor do I accept that the people involved in the case of the Irish Trust Bank were large financiers. I had several letters from people in my constituency who had made very modest investments in that venture, emigrants who were hoping to use their investment to return and finish their lives in Ireland.  In this matter there was a determination to ensure that the reputation of Irish financial institutions would not suffer, especially abroad.  I do not accept the parallel drawn by Deputy Birmingham.</P>
    <P>There was never at any time a commitment from Fianna Fáil, either in Government or Opposition, to compensate those who suffered as a result of the Bray Travel collapse.  Fine Gael in Opposition <Col N="305" /> did indicate that in Government they would compensate the Bray Travel victims, as Deputy Briscoe called them. Deputy Cooney as Minister found that there were considerable problems in attempting to do this and that there were also some constitutional problems.  I wish to put it on record that there was no commitment on our side to pay compensation and there was no breach of trust, though the latter could perhaps be attributed to people who claimed they would pay if in power and did not subsequently do so.</P>
    <P>Is mian liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Bellew as ucht a chomhgháirdeas dom agus an méid a dúirt sé faoin Aireacht seo.  He said he was not satisfied with the Bill and that the value of money erodes.  I do not think that is relevant.  The only figures mentioned in the Bill refer to fines and they are substantial enough.  I cannot envisage any rate of inflation which will cause a £100,000 fine to be regarded as negligible. In the regulations for bonding and for the fund, provision will be made for adequate consumer protection and compensation. I assure Deputy Bellew that this is a sound Bill and he need have no worries about it.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable amount of work to be done before the Bill comes into effect and it is important that the measures which have been taken by the sound people in the trade &mdash; they are the vast majority &mdash; should continue for the time being to give consumers protection.</P>
    <P>I recognise Deputy Barrett's special interest in the case of Bray Travel and I have already dealt with that matter. Deputy Briscoe took exception to people who suffered as a result of the Bray Travel disaster being invited into the gallery and he said they were misled into believing that they would be compensated for what happened to them.  Deputy Briscoe's clarion call &ldquo;let the buyer beware&rdquo; will be important for the time being, but when the agents and tour operators have been licensed and when the fund has been established the State will be in the position of being beware on <Col N="306" /> behalf of the consumers.  I thank Deputy Briscoe for his good wishes.</P>
    <P>We know that the 1981 season was very successful for the travel trade and it is natural that there should have been a sense of euphoria with regard to 1982. However, there has been a cutback on the number of seats on offer which would indicate that agents and tour operators are fully conscious of the dangers and are very anxious to apply the strictest and most prudent business principles to their operations for this year.</P>
    <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed. When reading the Seanad debate I noticed that many Senators said they hoped there would be a greater concentration on holidays in Ireland and that this Bill might focus too much attention on holidays abroad to the detriment of holidays at home.  I would add that Bord Fáilte are concentrating heavily on holidays available at home and are mounting an operation to counteract the large sums of money being spent on foreign holidays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will briefly outline the main provisions of this short Bill.  BIM, in addition to their grant-in-aid for capital development, the bulk of which is used to provide grants for the purchase of new fishing boats, receive repayable advances each year from the Central Fund for the <Col N="308" /> provision of loans at a reduced rate of interest for the same purpose.  These advances are repaid to the Central Fund from the loan repayments made by purchasers of boats.</P>
      <P>Under existing legislation, section 2 of the Sea Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1974, the amount of outstanding repayable advances from the Central Fund to the board may at no time exceed IR£15 million.  That limit has now been reached and it is necessary that it be extended so that the development of our sea fishing industry may continue.  Because of the rapidly rising cost of fishing vessels and the tendency to use increasingly larger vessels together with the modernisation of the existing fleet, I consider that the limit should be raised to IR£40 million, and I recommend this short Bill to the House.</P>
      <P>As this is the first occasion on which I have spoken here, perhaps I should mention a few items which I am concerned about in my short time in the Department. It is already evident to me that fishermen, not only in Ireland, but throughout Europe, are faced with many difficulties mainly because of reduced stocks, rising costs, and market problems. I feel that one of the most urgent matters in need of EEC agreement is a common fisheries policy.  The present uncertainty is clearly a barrier to the development because it is causing a natural unwillingness to invest in new boats and processing projects.  I hope, therefore, that within the next few months real progress will be made.  In my view, it is a reflection on the member states of the Community that no real progress has been made in this area in recent times. There has not been a Council of Fisheries Minister's meeting since last October. This is an indication of the lack of urgency which has been directed towards fisheries in the Community.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the House that I will be pressing for an early agreement. This will have to be an agreement that will meet the needs of our fishing industry and allow it to expand on a realistic basis in the interests of our economy.  I will not be prepared to accept an agreement just for the sake of having one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> I am concerned about the marketing regulations agreed on several months ago but not yet operative and unlikely to become operative for some time.  I will be pressing for an early operation of this regulation in order to improve the very unsatisfactory market structure at present in operation in the European Community. I am just a short time in the Department and am getting familiar with the various aspects of that Department. I propose to carry out a detailed examination of all facets of the Irish fishing industry, both sea and inland.  To that end I hope to have early discussions with BIM, the Central Fisheries Board, the regional boards and I propose to invite in for discussions the national fishery organisations such as the Irish Fishery Organisation, the National Fisheries Council, and to visit at the very earliest opportunity the major fishing centres.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies opposite will not object if I mention the dumping of fish at sea.  Since taking up my appointment one of the major problems brought to my attention has been the dumping of fish. No one is happy to see good fish being dumped back into the sea.  There have been some incidents recently of herring being disposed of in this way, having been withdrawn from sale by producer organisations under the EEC intervention rules.  The quantities dumped represented a small proportion of the total landings of herring in the ports involved and I think there was a certain amount of exaggeration.  Neverthless, I was concerned about this problem and I have directed that every step possible be taken to ensure that the dumping of withdrawn fish should no longer take place, except where it is absolutely unavoidable.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that given the satisfactory agreement of an EEC fishery policy and with the co-operation of the various sectors involved that considerable progress can be made in developing the Irish fishing industry and increasing employment opportunities, even in the short term.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

I hope his time in the Department, whether long or short, will be fruitful so far as the fishing industry is concerned and happy as far as he is concerned.  I also congratulate him on having secured the services of a Minister of State and I congratulate Deputy McEllistrim on assuming his new role as Minister of State.  One person who was impressed with the burden I had to carry in that Department was my wife.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this Bill, which I introduced on 26 January is to increase the borrowing powers of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara from the Exchequer.  At present the total advances that may be outstanding at any one time are limited by legislation to £15 million; the Bill proposes to extend that limit to £40 million.  This is an enabling measure.  It does not mean that the £40 million will be advanced right away or within a given time.  It means that the Exchequer will be enabled, when the Bill becomes law, to make advances totalling £40 million at any one time.  As the Minister said, these advances are largely made available and used by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to provide grants to fishermen for the purchase of new boats. The fishing industry is going through a very difficult phase at present and even <Col N="311" /> the most experienced skippers, and those who know their jobs best, find it difficult to repay their loans and to make their jobs pay to discharge their obligations to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister mentioned the common fisheries policy and the fact that a lot depends on the bargain we can hammer out in Europe.  I am also glad both Ministers appreciate this fact and hope to get the common fisheries policy agreed upon and formulated.  When we entered Europe about ten years ago we knew we would have ups and downs, losses and gains and that we were exposing the industrial manufacturing arm of our economy to competition from abroad. Against that, we hoped our agricultural and fishing industries would benefit to such an extent that we would have a net gain, apart from the handouts or grants we would get from Europe.  I want to warn the Minister that he will have a fight on his hands.  I am not satisfied that the Irish fishing industry is getting a fair crack of the whip in Europe.</P>
    <P>When the European Community was formed it was assumed it would look after the member states before being good to countries which had not joined or submitted themselves to the rules and regulations of the Community.  There is too much fish being imported into the Community from outside countries &mdash; Norway, Canada and elsewhere.  The unfortunate thing is that that fish is being imported in the interests of some member states to the disadvantage of others.  It is being imported to the advantage of the big processing and manufacturing states but it is certainly not in our interest.  We are a net exporter of the fish in question and will probably have to remain so for some time.  During my short time as Minister for Fisheries and Forestry I resisted as hard as I could the importation of this fish.  I was amazed when in the dying days of 1981, when people were preparing to celebrate Christmas, both in terms of the religious festival and from the point of view of having a rest, my telephone began to ring loudly and frequently for the purpose of informing me that there was a <Col N="312" /> regulation concerning the importation of fish into the Community that had to be agreed almost immediately.  These messages were coming from Dublin, from Britain, who then had the Presidency, and from Brussels.  The calls continued on Christmas Eve and I asked the people concerned what they thought they were at.  I reminded them that the personnel had left my office for Christmas and that I did not know where they were.  I was told then by way of threat that if I did not agree to the package that had been hammered out about the importation of herring into the Community there would be certain consequences.  This was at a time when, as the Minister says, we were dumping herring in the sea because we could not get rid of it otherwise.  I said that regardless of the consequences I was not agreeing.  I was threatened then that there would be a meeting the following week, that this would have to be a ministerial meeting but I was too long in the tooth to think that that would materialise, that Ministers would be brought together in Christmas week.  I am merely relating that as an example.  I wondered if this was a coincidence or if there was an attempt to rush something through at a time when people would not have advice available to them.  In any case, the result of that episode was that after votes of one kind or another and after a number of round robins of which I understand the Minister may be aware, there was agreement to reduce the amount of imported fish though not to reduce it sufficiently.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be threatened that if he does not act now there will be consequences for us elsewhere.  The whole matter is an undesirable and vicious circle but each part of the economy must be thrashed out on its merits.  If we, as a small and not fully developed fishing industry do not get a fair crack of the whip from Brussels, the future of the industry is bleak.  However, a fair crack of the whip will not be got without a fight. One could become very disillusioned about what goes on in Europe.  One might be threatened by the big nations.  The whole thing is somewhat unsavoury.</P>
    <P>By and large our fishing boats are small.  It is essential that we ensure that <Col N="313" /> foreign boats are kept away from our shores.  I wish the Minister luck in dealing with that problem because it involves a tough battle.  On assuming office in 1977 one of my predecessors threw in the towel in so far as the 50-mile limit and even the 30-mile limit was concerned.  There are large states, France in particular, who have claimed rights even within six miles of our shores.  We must put up a solid fight now in that regard.  I am glad to hear the Minister say that he will not be party to an agreement merely for the sake of having an agreement.  An agreement can be hammered out, an agreement that will afford us an exclusive area around our coast that will not be available to foreign fishermen with their larger boats and their superior skill in some respects.  If we agree to a common fisheries policy which does not give us exclusive rights around our shores we will be doing a bad day's work for the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Much of the money we are providing today will be used for the purchase of boats.  This brings me to the question of boatyards.  My predecessor sold the boatyards that were owned by BIM.  They were sold to private enterprise.  It is not my intention to go into the question of the merits or otherwise of the bargains that were made in that regard but I am not disagreeing with the sale of the yards. However, I am reserving my comments as to whether the sale was carried out to the best advantage of the State.  I object though to the move that seems to be afoot now to nationalise these boatyards again indirectly by way of saying that BIM must make advances for the building of boats if the boatyards are not to perish. This crops up every few months: a boatyard is in trouble and, unless a grant or a loan is given, and given quickly, so many men will be laid off.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are blamed for investigating the proposed borrower too closely and they are blamed for delays.</P>
    <P>The Minister will find that the boatyards need to rationalised.  There should be sufficient boatyards to build the type of boat our fishermen need.  There should be sufficient boatyards to service and repair the boats operating around our shores.  I make a present of this to the <Col N="314" /> Minister.  He and his Department should not have responsibility for this.  The IDA or some other State agency should organise the boatyards.  It does not make sense to give the Department of Fisheries and Forestry responsibility for keeping on building boats whether or not they are wanted, under threat of unemployment in the boatyards.  These are two different issues.</P>
    <P>If the boatyards are to be operated as an employment giving agency, or as a social service, that is one thing, but I do not think it is wise.  It is not wise to compel BIM to sanction loans and grants without a full investigation, and without satisfying themselves that the borrowers are skilled people who will be able to operate the boats and get the best out of them.  From time to time BIM are pressured into doing this, that or the other.  I believe my point of view is the sensible one and that the IDA should organise the boatyards. If grants are necessary, perhaps there is something to be said for giving them grants to bring them up to a certain standard, but only if the IDA believe the boatyards are being run properly and that management will do a good job.</P>
    <P>The most important problem the Minister will have to deal with will arise in Europe.  He will have to ensure that the big states live up to their responsibility to a small country like this.  We were led to believe that if we joined the EEC the agricultural industry and the fishing industry would benefit.  This is an enabling Bill.  I do not want to say any more at this stage.  We will have an opportunity on the Estimate or on some other occasion to have a longer debate on this topic.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, ar an chéad dul síos ba mhaith liom comhgairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire Stáit agus an Aire Iascaigh agus Foraoiseachta agus guím gach rath ar an obair atá á déanamh ag an mbeirt acu.  I wish to congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on their appointments to the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  This is a difficult time for the fishing industry.  As two men from the west coast of Ireland they know <Col N="315" /> well the difficult task facing them.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which increases the borrowing powers of BIM from £15 million to £40 million.  Now that the figure of £15 million set out in the Sea Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1974, has been reached, it is important that this Bill should be enacted as quickly as possible to allow BIM to continue with the development of our sea fishing industry.  I want to take this opportunity to make some observations on this industry which is of vital importance to people living along our coast, and in particular in the constituency which I represent.</P>
      <P>The mere fact that we now have a Minister for Fisheries who has the assistance of a Minister of State demonstrates the importance of this industry and the importance the Fianna Fáil Government place on the fishing and forestry industries. It is heartening that these two Ministers come from the west coast.  A short few months ago we had very few Ministers from the west coast.  There was a concentrated attack against the west by the Coalition Government.  We thought the Pale had been extended and that there was no west coast of Ireland.  The Taoiseach saw fit to appoint a Minister and a Minister of State to show that, so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, the people of the west are just as important as the people of the city of Dublin or any other part of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> While this increase in the borrowing power of BIM is vital to the industry now that the figure of £15 million is about to be surpassed, it will not cure the many serious ills, but it will help to alleviate some of the many problems facing the industry.  This increase in borrowing power will give BIM a greater opportunity to invest more in boats in the form of grants and loans for fishermen, to enable them to purchase new and secondhand boats and to assist them in the conversion of the many boats which are almost obsolete.  I expect an increase in <Col N="316" /> investment in smaller boats such as half deckers which are vitally important in my constituency where we depend on salmon, lobster, white fish, crabs and the drift netting of herrings.  Assistance may be needed to instal more modern equipment in some boats.  Hopefully this will be forthcoming, subject to scrutiny by the Department and BIM.</P>
      <P>I hope also that a greater degree of interest will be shown in the 50-foot to 60-foot range which, of necessity, are more versatile.  I strongly advocate that substantial grants and loans should be made available from the extra moneys which are being provided, not only for the purchase of boats in the 60-foot to 85-foot range, but more importantly for the conversion of this range of 65 to 80-foot boats so that they could use them for another type of fishing.  This other type of fishing is one to which the skippers are well accustomed but for which unfortunately at present their boats are not equipped.  I am referring to the seineing method of fishing.  These boats are at present equipped for trawling of herrings, white fish and mackerel when the mackerel are near our coast.  Unfortunately at present they are sited a distance from our coast which means these boats are unable to catch them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the conservation measures implemented I would hope that stocks of herrings would return to their state of some years past when there were plenty to be found off our coasts.  The herrings at present being landed are difficult to sell, this is because of cheaper imports from Canada and the supply of fresh herring fillets to the German market from Denmark. It is unfortunate that discussions have been taking place in Brussels prior to the Minister's appointment in regard to the licensing of the importation of something in the region of 80,000 to 84,000 tonnes of herring flaps or fillets duty free to the Continent.  It is difficult to condone this practice while herring along our coast are being dumped.  I am sure the Minister will investigate the problem and do his utmost to ensure that such quantity will not be imported into the European Continent during the coming <Col N="317" /> year.  One wonders whether continentals have a vested interest in fishing boats off the Canadian coast.  One wonders also whether the Germans are using their muscle at the EEC table to ensure that they get these 80,000 to 84,000 tonnes.  I am confident that the Minister, like his predecessors, will have this industry at heart and will do his utmost to ensure that such importation does not occur.</P>
    <P>We must also examine the situation in order that the Danes are not allowed to have the same withdrawal prices as we have here.  We must accept that we are on the periphery of Europe and must compete at the same withdrawal prices as the Danes and those in the South of England despite the fact that we are situated two sea crossings from the main continental markets.  These are two expensive sea crossings rendering our products that much less competitive.</P>
    <P>A common fisheries policy is vital but I wonder how serious are our European counterparts when they speak of a common fisheries policy and of working in harmony.  I sincerely believe that it is not in the interests of our European counterparts to achieve a common fisheries policy in the near future.  Later I hope to give my reasons for so saying and to suggest alternatives.  I feel one should not take a negative approach and I shall be suggesting alternatives to be studied in the interim period.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier of boats between 65 and 80 feet and said they were almost obsolete. However, I believe steps can be taken to ensure that they will not become obsolete so that their skippers will not become bankrupt and there will be longer dole queues within this industry.  If additional moneys are made available by way of grants and loans for the conversion of these boats &mdash; and here I emphasise their size of between 65 and 80 feet which do not have the power to catch the mackerel which constitute our main market at present &mdash; for sea net purposes, this would be most beneficial because this method is much less expensive and quite effective. This method also reduces oil expenses by half.  For example, a 65-foot boat would use 1,000 gallons in a normal four-day week.  This sea net method also is less <Col N="318" /> expensive on gear and affords these white fishing boats an opportunity to fish grounds which could not be fished were they using trawl net gear.  The usage of this type of net also lessens the risk of their being damaged.  The conversion of this type of boat from trawl to trawl and seine &mdash; which will not be a complete conversion but one of a versatile nature so that they can be used for both trawling and seineing &mdash; would cost something in the region of £55,000 to £65,000.  Boats at present almost obsolete would cost in the region of £350,000 to £500,000.  Is it not realistic, therefore, to take the obvious plunge and invest a further £55,000 to £65,000 ensuring that boats are converted from a loss-making operation to a profit-making one.</P>
    <P>I am not preaching doom or gloom but it is a fact that practically all fishermen would sell their boats in the 65 to 80 foot range at present if there was a market for them.  For the reasons stated earlier there is no such market for them.  I believe fishermen would not sell their boats were they presented with an attractive package of grants and loans for their conversion. I should add that I am not merely trying to make a strong case because I represent a constituency with a lot of fishermen. The fact is that these fishermen need this money.  They are not beggars and would not have their boats tied up if they were able to make sufficient money to ensure that their crews and skippers made a reasonable income each week.  Perhaps the Minister would assist these men by way of grants and loans not alone for reequipment but for gear as well because it can be very costly.  If substantial loans and grants were made available for equipment with none for gear, in my view that would constitute a retrograde step. I believe such assistance would stimulate enthusiasm amongst skippers generally. I have no doubt also but that it would revitalise the white fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope some grants and loans will be made available in the not too distant future bearing in mind that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will soon have their increased borrowing powers.  Speaking of the conversion of these white fishing boats from trawling to trawling and/or <Col N="319" /> seining, perhaps it might be suggested that a study group should be established to examine the feasibility of a concentrated commercial fisheries.  However, I suggest that such would not be necessary as the solution is abundantly clear, which I hope I have made reasonably clear to the House.  I hazard the guess that by the time any such study group would have reached the recommendation stage it would be already a little too late.  The problem must be tackled immediately and, if necessary, the board should recruit additional staff on a temporary basis to process these applications.  There would not be very many applications but if extra staff were needed to expedite them they should be provided.  Some may think that the changeover in the boats will create a problem in the processing of white fish as only a few of the major firms process white fish.  This is because of the lack of continuity of supply.  I have no doubt that regular and continuous landings will ensure that the processors will respond as they have done in the past.  If the steps I have suggested are taken I am sure this continuity will be maintained.  If the Department implement those steps, grants and loans could be made available at an early stage.  I am sure that if the landings are regular there will be no problem with the marketing of the fish.</P>
    <P>The conversion of the boats is one of the major problems facing the industry. I make a special plea to the Minister and to the Minister of State to study this matter as quickly as possible.  I appreciate that the Minister of State has just been appointed to his post but I am sure he will ask his officials to give consideration to this matter as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We must not forget that the skippers of the larger boats got their training in the white fisheries grounds.  The question must be asked where we will train the future skippers for our larger boats.  If the conversion of the boats takes place we know that the training grounds that were used in the past by the skippers of today will continue to be used.  I suggest that the grant should not be a direct handout but should be done over a phased <Col N="320" /> period, say over four or five years.  This would ensure an increase for the skippers and crews during the initial and possibly difficult transition period.</P>
    <P>The 100 ft. to 135 ft. refrigerated seawater tank boats are the only profitable boats at the moment and they are involved in our mackerel landings.  We must decide if further such boats are to be grant-aided.  We should forge ahead with this size of boat and the 25 per cent grant that is available to successful applicants should be supplemented by FEOGA grants.  We should exert pressure on the EEC to ensure that such grants are made available.  I am of the opinion that such grants are not available for such boats, although I am open to contradiction on this point.  These boats cost approximately £2 million and it is very difficult for skippers to obtain this kind of money. We should make a case to the EEC that FEOGA grants are essential.</P>
    <P>Half-deckers or small boats are very numerous along the western seaboard and many families depend on them.  In the past two years FEOGA grants have not been available for these vessels.  One wonders if the EEC are interested only in the larger boats.  I understand that grant applications are on file for many years and I ask the Minister to make a special case to the EEC so that the small boats may be considered for FEOGA grants.  Many families depend on these half-deckers for their livelihood.  The crews of such boats are as important as the crews of the larger boats.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is an abundance of mackerel off our coasts and it is the most lucrative fishing in the EEC.  It is unfortunate for us that we have such lucrative fishing grounds because they attract so many foreign boats.  It is the only fishery ground in Europe that is attracting what we must call the sharks from Europe.  Our major factories are dependent on mackerel and it is important that we protect our fisheries.  This is a priority and an obligation on us.  If the Germans, Danes, British and the Dutch are permitted to continue over-fishing, our stocks will be decimated and the death knell of the industry will be sounded in the not too distant future.  It <Col N="321" /> is only a few months ago since 27 Dutch boats of 200 ft. and over were off the Staggs of Broadhaven.  They were not there to view the west coast of Ireland but to catch the maximum quantity of mackerel.  It is estimated that 650,000 tonnes were taken from the fisheries during the past few years.  That is a ridiculously high figure when we compare it with the total catch permitted by the EEC.  The experts say that 650,000 tonnes is more than twice the total catch which should be taken from our fisheries if we want to sustain our stock of mackerel. Unfortunately this is the only and most lucrative mackerel fishery in Europe.  It is the last remaining stock of pelagic fish in Europe and we have an obligation to ensure its preservation so that our fishermen will get a livelihood from it for decades to come.</P>
    <P>When we consider the question of over-fishing we do not need to look further than the Celtic Sea and the south-west coast of England for examples of what can happen if that is permitted. They had lucrative mackerel fishing grounds but they were over-fished.  If we allow foreigners to continue as they are doing we will be in the same position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Donegal South-West</i>): I should like to suggest some alternatives because I do not believe we will have a common fisheries policy for some years to come as such a policy is not in the best interests of other members of the EEC. The obvious solution is to ensure that all foreign boats fishing off our coasts are licensed and that they have an observer on board them at all times.  I suggest that <Col N="322" /> the observer should be from BIM or the the Department.  It should be the duty of that observer to ensure that foreign trawlers take only their quota.  He could also build up vitally important scientific information such as is being done in Canada. He would be in a position to suggest the best type of gear for certain areas, give the water temperature and the depth at which the fish were caught.  The observer could also give information as to the plankton content of the water and the spawning areas.  That information would be valuable to the Government and the EEC and it would not cost very much to obtain.  It is an alternative which could be used pending the implementation of a common fisheries policy but could continue when that policy is implemented for the purpose of feeding that vital information to Dublin and Brussels.  We would be in a position to know the total catch we should allow so that we can sustain our fisheries for decades to come. It is a simple and straight-forward solution.</P>
      <P>In my view that is the only effective way forward and it can be implemented without a common fisheries policy.  It would be advantageous to Ireland and the EEC.  We must do everything to ensure that that lucrative fishery off the west coast is protected in the interests of Irish fishermen.  We should make a special case to the EEC in relation to our fisheries.  I do not believe it is in the spirit of the Treaty of Rome to have any contry's raw material stocks decimated.  If we had a proper management system in relation to fisheries our fishermen could continue to get a livelihood from that area indefinitely.  We should make a special case to get greater protection.  If foreign boats limited their catch to a certain tonnage that fishery could be maintained. One suggestion we should make is that an observer be permitted to go on board to check on the extent of the catch.  We are all aware of what happened to our herring stocks because of the activities of some fishermen from other European countries.  I hope we learned from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had also the experience in Dunmore East where Dutch fishermen exploited our waters and processed our <Col N="323" /> fish by salting them until they got them to Holland.  That was not of any value to Ireland and did not mean the creation of any employment here.  In dealing with mackerel one must refer to the freezer boats that operate off our coast in the season.  They freeze and process the mackerel landed by our boats at Castle-townbere, Galway, Killybegs, Burton-port and Rathmullen.  It is unfortunate that we cannot process all that fish, but we must be realistic and accept that it is not profitable or practicable to process all that fish here.  In my view it would take £150 million to provide freezing facilities for the processing of that fish without taking into consideration the question of marketing.  Should we invest that amount of money in processing facilities which would be obsolete for six months each year?  Fishermen in Scotland and England in recent years have had to avail of such factory ships also.  People may get the impression that I welcome the presence of such ships but it is a qualified welcome.  If they were not available the fishing industry would be a lot worse off.</P>

      <P>I see the difference as being the difference between negative and positive.  The Sunningdale declaration by the British Government was in the following terms: The British Government solemnly declare that it was and would remain their policy to support the wishes of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland &mdash; that is the first statement. The present status of Northern Ireland is that it is part of the United Kingdom; that is the second statement. If in the future the majority of the people of Northern Ireland should indicate a wish to become part of a united Ireland the British Government would support that wish.  I want them to go further than that and to indicate that they favour the unity of this country.  I think there is an important difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that the difference is next to invisible if they have nearly nine years ago committed themselves, as they did here to support a majority wish in the North for change when that wish emerged? Does the Taoiseach suppose that if they were to say in advance of that emerging, &ldquo;We would like to see it emerge&rdquo; that would make it emerge any faster?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying in my reply is that what I would like to see is a declaration by the British Government favouring Irish unity.  In the Sunningdale declaration there is simply a statement that if the people of Northern Ireland wished to become part of a united Ireland <Col N="326" /> the British Government would support it.  I think there is a very important difference between the two statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am trying to get the Taoiseach to concentrate on is this: He said in his original reply if I heard it properly that he accepted that the wish of the majority of the people in the North was a precondition to a change in that status.  I understood him to say that he accepted that just as the Government of 1973 accepted it.  What makes him suppose that a different form of words now adopted by the British and incorporating the word &ldquo;favour&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;support&rdquo; would make that majority wish emerge one minute sooner than it otherwise might?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It so clearly arises out of this and is so clearly of the substance of it that I can only conclude that the Taoiseach does not want to answer and that he is hoping that he can play to the Gallery in his usual way on this subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot do more than state my position.  If the Deputy does not wish to accept that, it will cause disagreement between us but he must accept that I see a clear difference between the Sunningdale declaration by the British Government to the effect that if the people of Northern Ireland indicated a wish to become part of a united Ireland the British Government would support that wish, and what I would now like to happen, namely, that the British Government would declare that they favour Irish unity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I must accept &mdash; and I think this moment is important to record &mdash; that it is the first time, if I am not doing him an injustice, that I can remember hearing the Taoiseach say in so many words that he accepted that the will of the majority of the people of the Six Counties was essential, that their willingness to accept a change in their status was essential before such a change could <Col N="327" /> come about.  I never heard him say that before, I believe.  But what I want to know is this, and I cannot see it as a separate question or that he should be inhibited from dealing with it: what is there in the formula which he now wants the British to substitute for their Sunningdale formula, a thrawneen &mdash; anything, the smallest iota &mdash; which will push anybody in the North of Ireland one minute sooner towards a willingness which they do not now entertain to change their status?</P>

      <P>Certainly.

Does or does not the Taoiseach unequivocally rule out coercion as a means of solving this problem?  If he does, does he not see it as using coercion by proxy to try to get some other Government?</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Taoiseach whether in fact it is his view that the continued statement by successive British Governments to the effect that they would stay in Ireland so long as the <Col N="329" /> majority in the Six Counties want them to, means that they are saying that they will stay until Tib's Eve?  Further, is it in keeping with what the Taoiseach has been saying in reply to various questions here that it would be very helpful if the British Government were to indicate, without conditions, that they themselves would wish for the unity of this country &mdash; in other words, that they would stop giving assurances and would declare their wish for unity?

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 3, 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I visited the United States from 15-17 March, in response to the kind invitation of President Reagan to meet him and to join him for luncheon in the White House on St. Patrick's Day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to avail of the opportunity while in the United States to pay a visit to the Secretary-General of the United <Col N="330" /> Nations, Senor Perez de Cuellar, address the Economic Club of New York, hold separate discussions with Governor Carey, Senator Kennedy and other political leaders, and meet a representative group of the Friends of Ireland organisation in the United States Congress, headed by Speaker O'Neill and Congressman Foley.</P>
    <P>Accompanying the President at our meeting in the White House, were Vice-President Bush, Secretary of State Haig, the National Security Adviser, Judge Clark, and the newly designated Ambassador of the United States to Ireland, Mr. Peter Dailey.  During our discussions we had a useful exchange of views on a range of subjects, including the links between Ireland and the United States, the situation in Northern Ireland, United States investment in Ireland and aspects of international affairs.  I invited the President to pay a visit to Ireland and he indicated a keen desire to do so at a mutually convenient time.</P>
    <P>I saw my visit in the context of the intention, to which I referred here on 9 March, of seeking international backing for the Government's efforts to bring together all the parties involved in the tragedy of Northern Ireland, in an endeavour to bring about a durable settlement in a spirit of peace, reconciliation and accommodation for all the traditions in this country.  I wished to dispel any doubt or confusion that might exist on Irish Government policy and to set out clearly what that policy is.</P>
    <P>I indicated my belief that Britain should be encouraged to seek more positively and persuade more actively a change in attitudes and outlooks which would pave the way for the unity so ardently desired by the vast majority of the Irish people.  I said that we had pledged ourselves to overcoming the obstacles to the further reconcilement of the two great traditions on our island and that, for our part, we would give, to that end, any pledge that may be sought, any guarantee that may be thought necessary and make unassailable constitutional arrangements for those in the Northern part of Ireland who may feel a special need for such provisions.  I expressed the <Col N="331" /> hope that the great fund of goodwill for Ireland that exists in America would enable the objectives I have mentioned to be reflected in American policy.</P>
    <P>The extent to which that ideal is already widely shared in the Congress of the United States may be seen from the St. Patrick's Day statement of the Friends of Ireland group.  I welcome the renewal of their commitment to the goal of Irish unity, through reconciliation and on the basis of consent.  Let me here welcome the declaration of support for the Friends of Ireland in America, included in the statement issued by President Reagan on the occasion of our meeting.</P>
    <P>The president's statement also contained a number of other elements that will be a source of encouragement.  I refer in particular to his words of support for the widening of Anglo-Irish co-operation instituted by my meeting with the British Prime Minister in December 1980.  The President saw this as contributing to a process of reconciliation between the two traditions and between the two countries which he saw as the only basis for a lasting solution.  The President also indicated the readiness of the United States Government to contribute in any way they can to such a solution.  He also reiterated his appeal to all Americans with Ireland's interest at heart to refrain from assisting those who perpetuate violence.  Finally, I welcome his strong and unequivocal support for American investment in Ireland&mdash;to the benefit of all our people.</P>
    <P>I know that this latter statement will be of great assistance to the Industrial Development Authority in the stepped-up campaign they are mounting to attract industrial and services investment.  I was glad to have the opportunity, through my address to the Economics Club of New York, to inaugurate this fresh effort.  I am satisfied, and am happy to assure the House, that my speech on that occasion helped to correct the damage done by some unfortunate impressions conveyed on previous occasions and re-established Ireland as a country which offers a stable, welcoming and profitable environment for investment.</P>
    <P>My discussions with the Secretary-General <Col N="332" /> of the United Nations, in addition to touching on Northern Ireland, ranged over a wide range of current topics in international affairs, including the role of the United Nations generally and in peace-keeping, the Middle East, Namibia, Afghanistan, Cyprus, the hostilities between Iran and Iraq, the problems of South-East Asia, especially Kampuchea, the problems in Central America, with particular reference to El Salvador, and the Law of the Sea Conference. In the course of what was a valuable exchange, I reiterated Ireland's total commitment to the role of the United Nations in the resolution of international conflict and in the advancement of human welfare throughout the world and informed him of the Government's positive response to the request for additional Irish troops for the UNIFIL force in Lebanon.  The Secretary-General, for his part, paid tribute to the Irish commitment to the United Nations and its peace-keeping operations and to the work of Major General Callaghan, as Commander of UNIFIL.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to express to President Reagan and to all those I met in the United States, my deep and sincere gratitude for the warmth of the welcome, and the generosity of the hospitality extended to us in the United States.  I know that these are a token of the bonds of kinship that exist between Ireland and that great democracy.</P>
    <P>I have had copies of my speech to the Economic Club of New York, my address in the White House, the statement made by President Reagan on St. Patrick's Day and the Joint St. Patrick's Day Statement of the Friends of Ireland laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, at the outset, to say, on behalf of my party, that we were glad that the Taoiseach, despite all the pressures on him in the immediate aftermath of his election to this office, decided to accept the invitation originally extended to me to lunch with President Reagan on St. Patrick's Day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of great practical importance, too, was his attendance at and speech to the dinner of the Economic Club in New York, <Col N="333" /> which club had originally asked me to address a distinguished audience of almost 1,000.  Very many of these were directly or indirectly influential in the location of American investment outside the United States.  The Taoiseach took full advantage of this opportunity to present to this audience the positive aspects of investment in Ireland and the unique capacity of this country, amongst the States of Northern Europe; for further development.  I am ignoring his comments which, as everyone knows are without any foundation, suggesting that there was any failure on the part of the previous Government to pursue this course.</P>
    <P>In the days before the Dáil met to select a Taoiseach, I was concerned that he should be aware, not only of the well-publicised invitation to lunch at the White House on St. Patrick's Day but also of this important opportunity in New York on the previous Monday.  I am sure that he was informed of it so that, when he was making tentative plans to visit the United States, in the event of being elected Taoiseach, he might make provision for this important event also.</P>

I was very pleased also to see the emphasis given in both statements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy FitzGerald, I realise there is a misunderstanding about this.  Unfortunately, a statement made by the Taoiseach is followed by a statement from the Leader of the Opposition or a person nominated by the Opposition, but the Taoiseach must give prior notice when he intends to make <Col N="334" /> such a statement.  There is a misunderstanding in that it was put down by way of a parliamentary question.  I recognised this and I ensured there would be some flexibility to enable you to make a statement. It would be better if you could make it by way of a question, which would conform to the Standing Orders of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, is it the situation that the Taoiseach in the form of a reply to a question has made a statement as is the normal practice except during Question Time?

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Taoiseach is answering a parliamentary question and he was asked to make a statement, but this is different from a situation where the Taoiseach might give prior notice to the Chair that he intended to make a statement.  He did not give prior notice to that effect.  Deputy FitzGerald came to me to see if arrangements could be made for the Taoiseach to make a statement at 3.30 p.m. today or 10.30 a.m. tomorrow morning.  Unfortunately, we were not able to arrange that because of the few minutes available and I exercised a little flexibility with regard to the reply by way of supplementary question by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy FitzGerald.

It was on the basis of your telling me I could make a statement in reply that I decided not to postpone the question, the possibility of which we had discussed.  My proposal to postpone the question if there was any doubt about my right of reply was on the basis that you would allow me to make a statement, which you assured me of in this House immediately before I spoke.  Therefore, on that assurance I did not postpone the question.  I must now continue with my statement.</P>

      <P>The question I put to you was if the Taoiseach made a statement in reply to the question could I make a statement and you said you would allow me to do so.  There was no ambiguity about it.  I then said I would not postpone my question.  That was the exchange between us and I am not going to accept a situation where the Taoiseach is allowed to make his statement and I am deprived of making a reply.  I do not think you intended that and, on reflection, I think you will want to honour the undertaking which you gave me.</P>

      <P>There was no attempt on my part to thwart your efforts here.  I tried to accommodate you where I could, but we were confronted with this situation at 2.27 p.m.  We had not time to ascertain whether the Taoiseach would make a statement at 3.30 p.m. today or at 10.30 in the morning.  That is under Standing Order No. 38.  A parliamentary question was put down asking him to make a statement.  A parliamentary question <Col N="337" /> does not give the questioner the right to make a statement.  I thought I could accommodate you by asking you to phrase your statement by way of a supplementary question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The question was not as you have stated; it was to ask the Taoiseach if he would make a statement and that required an answer yes or no.  It then transpired that the Taoiseach was contemplating making a statement in reply to the question.  I then suggested I would postpone my question in those circumstances so that the matter could be considered as to whether the Taoiseach would be making a statement today or tomorrow.  It transpired the Taoiseach was not prepared to do that and he was going to make a statement in reply to the question.  I then asked you if I could make a statement in reply and you said I could. On that assurance I allowed the question to stand because, as you know, I intended to withdraw the question if there was any possibility of my not being allowed to reply.  I took your assurance I could make a statement and I think the House can only proceed on the basis that assurances of that kind, given in accordance with the Ceann Comhairle's powers, should be honoured.  I must ask that I be allowed to complete my statement as authorised by you.</P>

      <P>The three questions on the Order Paper today by Deputy FitzGerald are in the normal form in which these questions are put down.  They are simply questions addressed to me at Question Time.  This form of words &ldquo;if he will make a statement&rdquo; are included in questions here day after day.  I am answering Questions Nos. 3, 4 and 5 on the Order Paper.  I have taken them together, answered them at some length and this is Question Time.  I must ask you, <Col N="338" /> a Cheann Comhairle, to abide by the rules of Question Time.  For instance, on the Order Paper to-day there is a question by Deputy Creed &ldquo;To ask the Minister for Agriculture if he has any plans to restrict the export of live cattle; and if he will make a statement on the matter&rdquo;. That is a normal question at Question Time in this House.</P>

      <P>There is considerable confusion as to what transpired between you and Deputy FitzGerald.  In the interests of the House and in trying to restore some sanity to the proceedings, would the Taoiseach state whether he will avail of an opportunity at 3.30 p.m. of even repeating his reply in the form of a statement to the three questions and allow an opportunity, as is normal, for a reply to be made?</P>

      <P>When this matter came up first, a question was addressed to me by Deputy FitzGerald and I took it to be the normal procedure that I would explain to the House about my American visit.  I have been following that procedure. The suggestion has been put by Deputy Cluskey that I would avail of the normal statement procedure.  I would certainly consider doing something like that, but not today &mdash; perhaps tomorrow morning.</P>

That would have been the normal courtesy we would expect from the Taoiseach.  However, for reasons perhaps known to himself, the Taoiseach decided to do it differently.</P>

In his reply today he repeated what he said in the White House last Wednesday &mdash; indeed he used the very same words, the same text.  I am asking him to outline the pledges, the guarantees and the constitutional arrangements he envisaged when he referred to those matters in the White House?</P>

      <P>Really, I must ask you to decide where we are going.  In replying to Questions Nos. 3, 4 and 5, I followed normal procedure.  I gave a fairly lengthy reply to the three questions.  If we wish to proceed by way of supplementary questions now, I am perfectly prepared to do it.  Alternatively, I am prepared to accept Deputy Cluskey's suggestion and consider between now and tomorrow morning whether I should resort to the other procedure of making a statement to the House; but I cannot answer questions here, have supplementaries on them and then make another statement <Col N="340" /> tomorrow morning.  That would reduce procedure to a farce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As long as the position is that the agreement to make a statement will be vindicated tomorrow morning, that is all right.  However, I could not now stop on the basis that the Taoiseach will consider doing something, because if the Taoiseach then decided not to, I would be left in the position of not being able to carry out what I was assured I would be able to carry out.</P>

      <P>You have been misunderstanding me about your parliamentary question.  A parliamentary question is not covered by Standing Order No. 38.  I think the mistake was in putting in a parliamentary question to get the Taoiseach to make a statement.  It should have been arranged under Standing Order No. 38 for the Taoiseach to make a statement and persons nominated by the Opposition could then make statements in reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I came to you and suggested that if there was any question of the Taoiseach having misinterpreted this question and having decided to answer it by making a statement, I would withdraw the question.  The only reason I did not withdraw the question to enable that procedure to be followed was that you assured me that if the Taoiseach decided to make a statement in reply to the question I would be allowed to make a statement in reply.  I then said to you, on the basis of that assurance, that I was prepared to let the question stand.  I will not accept being trapped in a position where, having got that assurance, and having allowed the question to stand, I am precluded from either raising the matter with the Whips directly or persisting for a reply.  It must be one thing or the other: either we get an assurance there will be a statement in the morning or I will seek my reply now.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that there is an epidemic situation in parts <Col N="350" /> of Dublin, would the Minister agree that there is no training in the customs service? It has been alleged to me by a reliable source that when customs officers at a certain level express an interest in training they are abused and asked if they are using drugs themselves or why they have such an interest.  I urge the Minister to review the training for customs officers. I ask the Minister to accept that training at present is negligible and practically non-existent.</P>

In January 1981, arising from extensive tests, a new field testing kit was tried out which is the Becton-Dickenson &ldquo;NIK Polytesting&rdquo; kit, and forensic scientists and the Garda approved that.  The kit was introduced in April 1981 at 17 major import centres.  It has proved very satisfactory.  If there are new ways known to us locally or used internationally that can be introduced to detect the importation of drugs we will be oncoming in that regard.</P>

      <P>All commentators have agreed that within the budget deficit of the Deputy's order of £750 million and the Exchequer borrowing requirement of 14 per cent of GNP the balance of payments deficit this year will fall relative to GNP.  The Deputy is speaking only about the balance of payments deficit on current account.  Capital inflows, including the processing of foreign borrowings by the private and public sectors, have also to be taken into account.  Notwithstanding <Col N="354" /> our current deficit our external reserves are being maintained at an adequate level.  The Government are firmly committed to maintaining the value of our pound within the EMS and will take all necessary measures for this purpose.</P>

      <P>The Minister has power to reject anything.  The balance of payments on current account which I have mentioned is that of the ESRI, a respected and impartial institute.  Does the Minister reject that?</P>

      <P>The repayment of foreign debt interest on capital is likely to be £400 million or one-third of the balance of payments deficit.  Does the Minister accept that foreign borrowings must be stabilised if we are to protect our currency and to defend against devaluation and cuts in employment in the years ahead?</P>

    <P>The tables below list Irish commitments and receipts in respect of the various expenditure sectors of the Community budget.  Commitments are made at the commencement of multi-annual projects, and payments in respect of expenditure incurred are phased over the life of these projects.  It is accordingly inherent in this system of financing that a certain amount of commitments will be outstanding at any particular time.</P>

The Government view with the greatest concern this latest act of violence and in particular the circumstances in which it occurred.  On behalf of the Government and people of Ireland I extend my sympathy to the relations and friends of the four journalists.</P>
      <P>With regard to the position of Irish citizens in EI Salvador, the latest information available to my Department is that one Irish journalist and three missionaries are there.  The Government consider it to be the responsibility of the Government of EI Salvador to ensure the safety of these people.  However, it is clear that that Government have scant control of their own forces.  In the event of the situation deteriorating to the extent that evacuation of Irish citizens becomes necessary, the Government have made arrangements for this purpose. The Irish honorary consul in San Salvador has also been instructed to offer all possible assistance to Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>The Government are not aware of any specific threat being made against any Irish journalist.  I have, however, noted the assurances given personally by President Duarte to journalists in EI Salvador in the aftermath of the killings of the Dutch journalists that the Government will do all in their power to protect them.</P>

Is he aware whether the Irish journalist referred to has her name on that death list or whether any Irish journalists' names have appeared on such a death list?

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Donegal South-West) Mr. Gallagher (Donegal South-West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> When we resumed after lunch I was speaking regarding mackerel <i>vis-à-vis</i> the freezer ships.  These freezer ships are at present an integral part of our fisheries. However, like all other Irishmen and all other public representatives, I would like to think that we could process all fish ashore, but my costings indicate that if we were to provide sufficient moneys to freeze all of these mackerel ashore it would be necessary to provide £150 million and thereafter we would have the problem of marketing and disposing of these mackerel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would add that these freezing facilities would be obsolete for six or seven months of the year and in view of the substantial moneys required I believe it would be necessary to allow these freezer vessels to continue operating off our coast provided this would not be detrimental to the industry ashore.  The Minister and the Department should ensure <Col N="372" /> that this would not affect employment in our shore-based plants.  We should certainly allow these freezer ships to operate but not at the expense of employment for our young people.  Fortunately this does not arise at present because the supply of fish is greater than the demand and there are sufficient fish for our own factories. We must ensure at all times the supply of fish to the factories before we consider putting any fish aboad the East European factory ships.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that under EEC regulations these factory ships can use their own labour force but it is vitally important that we should consider the question of licensing these ships and examine the feasibility of having 50 per cent of the labour force recruited locally, whether at Killybegs, Burtonport, Rathmullan, Castletownbere, Galway or Dunmore East. The Minister for Fisheries in co-operation with the Minister for Labour should study the legalities of the situation to see if the use of local labour would be possible.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that proper management methods will ensure the continuation of our mackerel fisheries.  If we catch only the proper tonnage each year we can sustain our fisheries over coming decades and centuries.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that the processors will respond as they have done in the past by increasing their freezing facilities and I congratulate them for their response to the challenge and for taking a calculated risk in providing extra facilities during an uncertain time in the industry.</P>
    <P>I regret having to say that Irish boat yards are not competitive.  This is not a reflection on them but is due to the fact that other such enterprises, particularly the Dutch boatyards, are being subsidised by their Governments, whether this is right or wrong under the Treaty of Rome.  This makes it impossible for our boatyards to be competitive.  I say without fear of contradiction that the standard of boats produced in Irish yards, whether of wooden or steel construction, is equal to if not better than any in Europe.  Our boatyards would not be experiencing problems were it not for unfair competition.  Our biggest competitors <Col N="373" /> are the Dutch who are getting a subsidy of 16 per cent and I question whether this is fair competition in the context of the EEC.  Someone suggested earlier that there should not be grants for the sake of grants or handouts for the sake of keeping the places open, but I do not believe any of our boatyards are begging. They do, however, require assistance either from the Minister, BIM or the IDA.  I would ask the Minister to meet these people and discuss the necessary measures to ensure the future of our boatyards.  Irish boatyards are turning out boats second to none.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the moratorium on or freezing of arrears due on boats.  This was initiated by Fianna Fail before they left office and I hope it will be continued by them now with the interests of the industry and the west at heart.  This did not seem to exist during the months when the Coalition were in power when we felt there was an extension of the Pale but we were left outside.  This moratorium, together with the interest subsidy, ensures that no interest is payable for two years but it is necessary to continue with the standard repayment.  I would ask that this be reviewed in about a year's time in the light of circumstances then prevailing. Owners of boats ranging between 50 feet and 80 feet are experiencing difficulties at present.  I spoke earlier of the change from trawling to seining and trawling and this matter needs consideration.</P>
    <P>The 10 per cent salmon levy is passed on by the processor to the Department of Fisheries but it is paid indirectly by the fishermen.  I would ask the Minister to examine this matter because the income from this levy is not much greater than the administrative cost of the scheme, yet the levy causes much hardship to small salmon fishermen in Burtonport, Arranmore Island, Tory Island, Inishbofin Island and other places along the coast. The Minister might consider rescinding the order whereby they must pay a levy of 10 per cent.  I appreciate that it is necessary to have some income but there may be other ways of doing it.  I do not believe this is the way to do it because at <Col N="374" /> a later stage it can create unfair competition.</P>
    <P>Some of the smaller fishermen with half-deckers who are not fortunate enough to obtain favourable grants like those for the larger boats, engage in lobster fishing.  The stocks of lobster are declining.  The half-deckers which depend on lobster fishing immediately after the salmon season are suffering because of this.  I believe that if the scientists could submit an up to date report the fishermen would respond to any recommendations made by them.  They know it would be in their interests if the scientists could establish the reason for the decline in lobster stocks.  As well as a drop in the quantities landed there is a drop in the price of lobsters to the fishermen. This is as a result of imports from third countries.  Those imports of lobsters from third countries should be looked into.  I believe we can make a case to the EEC to have the quantities being imported from Canada into Europe reduced.</P>
    <P>It was felt some years ago that sprat fishing would be a substitute for the 80-foot boats until herring stocks built up. We commenced landing sprat at Dunmore East.  They then moved on to Cobh and Castletownbere and then to Galway. It was felt that some of the smaller fishermen had a good future because of this but, unfortunately, last year there were no sprat landings along our coasts.  Many fishermen committed themselves to buying nets suitable for fishing sprat.  Some of those people had spoken to the IDA and Údarás na Gaeltachta about the erection of canning factories.  If there were observers aboard the foreign boats fishing off our coasts who fed the information collected to the Department or to the EEC we could establish where sprat are. I believe they are along our coasts but because we do not have enough research vessels available it is difficult to pinpoint them.</P>
    <P>Sprat fishing cannot take place right through the year.  It can only take place during the winter season while they are feeding.  When sprat are feeding they must be taken in to the bays in the same way as they are taken into the fiords in <Col N="375" /> Norway to allow them to empty themselves. It is important that research is done so that we can pinpoint the sprat grounds during the months of October to February.</P>
    <P>With regard to harbour development we must do everything possible to develop all the harbours along our coasts. The large boats, which are landing practically all the mackerel at the moment, can land in only one port 24 hours of the day, that is the port of Rathmullen.  They can land at Killybegs most of the day but sometimes they cannot land because of the tide.  That harbour has been dredged because of the programme initiated by Fianna Fáil.  The work will be finished shortly and fishermen will have access to Killybegs harbour at all times.</P>
    <P>There are other harbours in Donegal, particularly the one at Burtonport, which need development.  There is a commitment from the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and Roinn na Gaeltachta to have this harbour dredged.  It is vital that it be dredged because 65-foot boats and larger ones can land at that port only on the tide.  Landings in that area must be reduced when they cannot land at any time during the day.  Boats, like any machine, should be used to the maximum. While there is a problem with dredging and tidal harbours it becomes very difficult for those boats to make sufficient money to repay BIM and for their crews to make a reasonable income.</P>
    <P>The port of Burtonport is vitally important. I ask the Minister for Fisheries, in conjunction with the Minister for the Gaeltacht, to do everything possible to see that the dredging of Burtonport harbour is commenced this year.  I appreciate the financial constraints but I hope that at a later stage that harbour will be extended.  It is pointless developing har-boats without considering the infrastructure of the areas around them.  I refer specifically to roads which must carry the large 40-foot articulated freezer trucks. I know this is a question for the Department of the Environment but it is in the interests of fishermen that money is made available to build better roads into such <Col N="376" /> ports as Burtonport, Killybegs, Bunbeg, Rathmullen, Downings, Moville and Greencastle.</P>
    <P>It is very important that all major ports have ice plants.  However it is not sufficient just to have an ice plant in a port: the capacity of that ice plant is very important.  It is important that each port has more ice than is actually required on any particular day.  When there are electricity breakdowns those ports are left without ice.  We cannot keep up the high standard and quality of fish without a good supply of ice at all times.  Some of the Donegal fishing boats fish near Castletownbere which has a capacity of only 15 tonnes per day.  This is not adequate. We must look at this in the future. When large boats fish near small ports we must ensure that those ports are provided with reasonably large plants.</P>
    <P>I will be brief in my remarks about quotas.  The Hague Agreement of 1975 suggested that between 1975 and 1979 the Irish quotas would double.  In 1975 the landings of herrings were in the region of 30,000 tons, which would give us a quota of 60,000 tons in 1979.  It is pointless to even discuss that figure now because there is not that quantity of herring left.  It could mean we might look for a higher quota of mackerel in 1982.  I understand the total allowable catch for the EEC as a whole is in the region of 300,000 tons.  Obviously the Irish quota would be in the region of 80,000 to 100,000 tons.  It is important in any negotiations that we remember The Hague Agreement, which said our quotas should double between 1975 and 1979 and that the Irish fishing industry should be allowed to progress and prosper.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately when one speaks of fishing one automatically thinks of tragedies. This is a sad fact.  Over the years we have had many tragedies at sea.  We must ensure that there is safety at sea and a policy should be formulated to ensure there are on-board safety regulations and if a boat is in trouble, certain procedures are followed and the necessary body should co-ordinate any services, if necessary. I hope this will not be necessary but we must be realistic.  Over the last six <Col N="377" /> or seven years the people of Donegal have experienced too many tragedies and if the Department can do anything to reduce these tragedies they will be doing an excellent job.  Perhaps something along those lines is already being formulated.</P>
    <P>I regret having spoken for so long on this subject but it is very important to the people of my constituency.  The people of Donegal &mdash; from Killybegs, Ardara, Burtonport, the Island of Aranmore, Inishfree, Rutland and Tory Island, Bunbeg, Inishdooey, Magheraroarty, Ballina, Port na Blath, Dunfanaghy and Downings &mdash; depend on the fishing industry and without it they would be much poorer.  The people in these ports have to pay this levy and I appeal to the Minister to look seriously at the possibility to rescinding this 10 per cent levy on salmon paid by the small fishermen in my constituency and in all the constituencies around the seaboard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the new Minister for Fisheries and Forestry every success in the Department for which he has responsibility and I wish to extend that to his Minister of State.  I was interested in Deputy Gallagher's maiden speech which was interesting in the extent and range of the matters he covered, even though I will be dealing with some of them critically later. On January 27, when this Bill was first presented to us, I began to make a few points.  I had moved the adjournment for the budget and now we have a new Minister. It is appropriate therefore that I <Col N="378" /> repeat one or two points I made on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I said I had always been impressed by the sincerity with which Members spoke about fisheries.  Generally one has present in this House people whose constituencies include the coastal communities which depend on fishing for their livelihood. As well as that there is an immediacy to fishing as an activity which sharpens the focus of many of the people who speak on the subject &mdash; for example, the risks associated with the sea and the tragedies which the sea regularly delivers.  I was interested to hear Deputy Gallagher referring to this at the end of his speech. The Minister's predecessor established an interdepartmental committee to review safety at sea regulations.  They met for the first time on 14 January and it is appropriate that the work of that committee be brought to a conclusion and their recommendations circulated and assimilated among the people who earn their living from the sea.</P>
    <P>Having participated in an earlier debate on fisheries, there are still a few fundamentals I consider depressing.  Listening to the speeches made on fisheries over the years one hears a litany of descriptions of bits and pieces of fishing as an activity.  Sometimes it is piers, other times ropes or catches, nets and all kinds of things.  But missing from the treatment of the fishing industry is any commitment to see the fishing industry as part of the economy.  It would be off the point if I referred to the hostility to planning in the economy that seems to be part of the national malaise, but one relevant point is that our failure to plan within the economy is extended to our attitude towards the fishing industry, of seeing it as part of a planned economy, as something that is prepared for, with resources allocated to it to achieve certain objectives over a long period.  If I make a remark like this it is incumbent on me to justify it and I intend to do so, quite extensively.</P>
    <P>There is no point saying things are well with fisheries and I hope they will get better in a couple of years.  What one needs to do is to change the mentality of people charged with responsibility for <Col N="379" /> fisheries, and this applies especially to the present Administration.  Let us get to the root of the matter so that we may know how bad the situation is.  In 1832 there were ten times as many people in Ireland making a living from the sea than is the case now.  In relation to processing, for every person engaged full-time in fishing there is 0.7 of another occupation whereas the average for the European countries is seven persons in the processing industry for every person engaged full-time in fishing.  We can work out what these statistics tell us.  They represent the story of the neglect of fisheries down through the years.  This neglect began many decades ago by failure to allocate resources within a systematic plan.  This situation had many other effects also.  It led, for instance, to the people turning their backs on the sea.  When one has regard to the history of the industry in the coastal communities along the west coast one finds some very interesting factors. The decline of the fishing industry and the lack of interest in it are associated also with the collapse of communities and indeed with the collapse of the language. We are in the position where factories in the Gaeltacht are closing after making chewing gum as an experiment while the communities in the west never had any allocation of resources made to them for the expansion of the fishing industry.  We have made this economic journey from tens of thousands of people going to sea regularly to the making of chewing gum. This tells us a lot about ourselves and about our attitude to coastal communities and to fisheries.  There has never been any systematic, careful plan.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recall that on the evening on which his appointment was announced I urged that the Taoiseach change the title of this Ministry as soon as possible.  I urge the Minister now to endeavour to have this change made.  We are unique among maritime nations in having the title, &ldquo;Fisheries and Forestry&rdquo;. In Canada the title of the appropriate Minister dealing with fisheries is the Minister for Oceans and Fisheries.  In other countries the title is Seas and Fisheries. One gets some idea of how crazy we are <Col N="380" /> when one realises how useless is the title we use.  The Department should be called the Department of Seas and Fisheries and should be capable of handling all matters in relation to the sea.  Lest the Minister should wish to muster enthusiasm for recommending this change to the Toiseach I shall give an example of the situation we would be in if, for instance, we wished to carry out a hydrographic survey.  If there are two areas in which research is needed one of these is in relation to hydrographic research on grounds only of safety and future development and the other is oceanographic research. To carry out any such survey it would be necessary to make contact with seven different agencies or Departments of State.  These would include the Department of Energy, of Transport and Power, of Fisheries and Forestry as well as some other agencies.  It would be an imaginative step to co-ordinate all aspects of marine affairs, to bring them all under one administrative heading.  In addition, education in relation to matters dealing with the sea could be brought under that umbrella as could the whole question of science and the question of trading and of planning.  This could have an electrifying effect on the whole attitude of young people towards the possibility of availing of the sea as a livelihood.</P>
    <P>From tomorrow I presume the Minister will have inherited the possibility of a very large fund being available for youth employment projects &mdash; £67 million from our own resources plus £23 million from Europe.  It would be crazy to think of unemployed young people all along our coasts not using that money to fund ventures relating to marine aquaculture, to fish farming in all its different forms and to the various forms of industry associated both directly and indirectly with the sea.  I hope the Minister and his officials will advocate the use of these funds in areas such as these for the purpose of providing employment in coastal communities.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the whole question of how we moved from boats to bubblegum in our economic history.  The reasons for such a movement are not clear to me, but then my views on the economy <Col N="381" /> have never been regarded as the orthodox vision so I cannot accept responsibility for this economic strategy, whatever may be its curious logic.  However, when one considers the cost of creating a job in any of the communities where fishing might be developed, one is talking of the order of from £25,000 to £30,000.  By exploiting a natural resource and by using the money that is available one can create employment and return the vision of the people towards the sea itself.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to make is that I was rather depressed to hear about further studies of marine matters.  The number of our people who have written about the sea and who have studied it must exceed the number who go to sea.  Many people write about the sea and about fisheries without ever going to sea.  There is no shortage of studies in this area.  I would direct the Minister's attention to the studies that were carried out in 1964 and to the recommendations made then about the possibilities of the Irish Sea fisheries.  In 1974 there was another volume entitled <i>Ireland, Science and the Sea</i> while in 1980 we had a report on aquaculture and on fish farming and its possibilities. There is a new report entitled <i>Science and Technology for Aquaculture Development</i>.  Why should we need more studies?  What is needed is even the slightest semblance of a commitment to plan for fisheries, for aquaculture and for fish farming.</P>
    <P>The evidence is historical and irrefutable in relation to fisheries.  We have lost 90 per cent of the opportunities of the fishing industry in the past 100 years.  It is interesting to consider how all those people who made a living from the sea in the last century succeeded.  In relation to the stocks that were available then and to the technology that was required and in the absence of threats from outside regarding stocks, they were able to operate on a regular basis and provide themselves with a livelihood.  Obviously, this is not possible today but our record as a nation is that we sat back and allowed other countries with fewer facilities and less access to the sea to develop their fleets and this had an impact on stocks <Col N="382" /> which was disastrous for the future of fisheries at European level.</P>
    <P>In the Bill before us reference is made to the year 1952.  When Bord Iascaigh Mhara were started in 1952 they could do many things.  They could be involved directly in processing.  They could do other things in relation to the organisation of fisheries directly.  We decided that by 1962 we would take them out of processing and out of direct involvement in the fishing industry.  They could print cookery recipes.  They could make films about going to sea which were excellent and were a source of inspiration to many young people.  They are a credit to the people who made them.</P>
    <P>From 1952 on Bord Iascaigh Mhara lost their functions.  The speeches made as they lost their functions from 1962 to the modern period are very interesting. Every time they lost a function the words &ldquo;private sector&rdquo; were mentioned.  It was suggested that perhaps the State should not be involved in boat building and that the private sector could develop it.  The State got out and the private sector got in.  Then the State came in again in a secondary way.  It was suggested that perhaps the State could assist again but not directly, and that the private people could step into the place of the State. This is a microcosm of the confusion which strikes the minds of many people who want to know where the private sector is in Ireland, and who are pursuing that illusive myth of the Irish private sector unassisted by the State, wherever it may have been in hiding for several decades. The answer to that question will be part of my own economic education when I hear it.</P>
    <P>During the sixties we decided what we should do to finish off what we were doing logically.  In the negotiations on the Treaty of Accession to the European Communities, the neglect of fisheries was monumental and disgraceful.  This was acknowledged by a number of Deputies on the Minister's side of the House in their speeches in the past year or two, sincere Deputies I met in the seventies such as Deputy Coughlan.  I remember meeting him in Donegal town when, to his credit, he said that the Irish protocol <Col N="383" /> in relation to fisheries was quite insufficient. In our haste, fisheries did not matter and we did not protect them sufficiently by the explicit insertion of terms in protocols which might do so.  We decided that a protocol was not needed at all.  That was the importance attached to fisheries.  It was put well to me by a very earthy man I met in Donegal during the course of the campaign who said that when it comes to milk and fish, milk will win out.  He was right.  In our haste to get benefits from the EEC of a general agricultural kind, we were told we could forget about fisheries for a while.  At that stage we were relating to the European Community.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well and I congratulate him on his commitment and his grit in saying he will not accept an agreement for the sake of getting an agreement and that it will have to be a good agreement. For the sake of the industry, I hope it is. I heard that before too.  I remember people talking about the limit.  I attended meetings at which we discussed a 50-mile limit.  They were like auctions.  People said: &ldquo;Why 50 miles?  Why not 100 or 200 miles?&rdquo;  In the Dáil Official Report of 27 January 1981 it was suggested by one speaker that we could take that agreement or have no agreement at all, and we decided to take that agreement.  The rhetoric and the auction were over and we were telling fishermen behind closed doors: &ldquo;Either take what we have been able to get or do without&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am not being unduly pessimistic but if the new Minister is to make a beginning he must face the realities of the fishing industry.  I have a number of positive things to say about it.  The fact is that there is no industry there to be managed and brought step by step to some neat developed stage.  It is in a chaos of neglect.  This has been brought about systematically over the years.  I will give one last example.  In regard to traditional fisheries, we missed the boat &mdash; if I might use an unfortunate image &mdash; simply by not having a commitment to getting things together.  In regard to the other most exciting development, marine aquaculture, we look like doing the exact same <Col N="384" /> thing again.</P>
    <P>Some unfortunate person, influenced by what has been written and said by scientists about what it is possible to make from the sea, will want to get into something like mussel cultivation.  He will apply to the county council for permission to put out his raft and to the Department of Transport if he has ropes attached to it, and to the Department of Fisheries and Forestry who will put him in touch with BIM for information on how to get involved.  If he or she survives all those inquiries, God bless him or her not to be sexist, and gets into the business of mussel cultivation, good luck to him or her.  These are the practical arrangements and the kinds of attitudes that have existed in relation to fisheries in the past and exist today about marine aquaculture.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to a few specifics, and it is worthwhile to do that on the question of fisheries.  I said there are positive things that could be done.</P>
    <P>There are many things we can do.  Here again we live in the miserable shadow of bureaucracy.  Even people whose livelihoods are threatened within fisheries &mdash; and there are many of them after many very bad years in fisheries &mdash; will tell you that the price of a box of fish is now something like one-seventh of what it was in good times.  If we want to change things like that we must change the basic laws which affect the livelihoods of people in poor circumstances.</P>
    <P>It would be appropriate to look at how our fishermen fare under the social welfare code.  Clearly they are discriminated against in fisheries as an occupation in comparison with other occupations.  If they are regarded as private operators they are disqualified from ranges of benefit for which other people in part-time employment can qualify.  There is a bureaucratic requirement about where they are located and what their adress is which affects them.  This was all pointed out 15 or 16 years ago, and it was never changed.  It was one of those great national tasks which could not yet be undertaken to change simple little things. I can recall people putting it into print 20 years ago that it was time for a charter of <Col N="385" /> rights for people who worked at sea, ranging through everything from safety to conditions of employment.  Apparently that is not only impossible but it is also ideologically loaded.  The concept of workers actually working at sea &mdash; God protect us from such a notion &mdash; was not followed up either.</P>
    <P>In the files of the Department the Minister will find many excellent suggestions from people who worked in that Department. I want to pay tribute to individual people in the Department with whom I have had dealings.  They designed schemes but they were never instructed directly to prepare a plan for the future of the Irish fisheries.  When most of the benefits had disappeared we contracted out large studies to tell us the full extent of our loss, how precarious stocks are, how many other boats are needed, what the different threats are, and how little we can make from fisheries we had allowed to run down.  We have made some progress in so far as we have commissioned outside studies in relation to aquaculture to tell us what the benefits might be if we ever get started.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to aquaculture because it is one of the matters which affects the workings, the role and the expenditure of BIM, for whom I have respect and to whom I should like to make some suggestions. This is the appropriate time to do so.  The last document which appeared from the National Board for Science and Technology entitled &ldquo;Science and Technology for Aquacultural Development&rdquo; was circulated to us in Leinster House in March 1982.  This document carries the publication date of January 1982, summarises the present state of the industry and there are many suggestions in it which could be applied.  But we are in a truly incredible position in relation to aquaculture.  The position is that in this matter research work carried out by Irish scientists has drawn the attention of scholars in Japan, California and places like that.  Work on the genetics of species is regarded as being of a world level in relation to research that has been published. We have that achievement there. But while we are impressing the international community with our scholarship <Col N="386" /> we are still far away from applying that research finding in a way that might provide benefit, employment and development for the people who live around our coasts.</P>
    <P>May I give the Minister a list of things he will want to solve in the next few months?  It is a matter even of some doubt who has the right to go to the coast at all. The Minister will want to look at the Foreshore Act.  Perhaps it will be appropriate in the next few weeks &mdash; I shall put down a question &mdash; to ask the Minister directly what he proposes to do about that in order to sort out the question of who can put a raft out into the sea.  Will it require a change in the Constitution? What are we going to have to do about the ownership of and access to the coast? Many possibilities exist.  For example, will it be confined to those already there with access to the coast?  What about the people from the flats in Dublin who might develop an interest in the sea becoming aquaculturists and who wants to go to the coastline?  Will they be able to get there? Will they be able to use the coastline? There is the whole question about the foreshore, about how one even starts and then &mdash; even if we could get that one straightened out &mdash; how we might even be able to make a beginning.  There is the question of the piers that are there, how many are there, what expenditure should be outlayed on them in relation to how safe they must be.  There is the question of the dissemination of the research I mentioned earlier in its most appropriate technological form.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that we have unemployed &mdash; I do not care who is upset by it; it is a scandal at present &mdash; many of the scientists who brought us to this point of development within aquaculture and fish farming, having got their redundancy notices, some companies having folded. We must ask a question about that and it is another question that arises specifically even in regard to how the industry is to be made possible at all, even in terms of law, in terms of the physical requirements necessary to be there.</P>
    <P>There is another question that arises: how will the development of aquaculture be structured?  Will it be by private individuals <Col N="387" /> who are citizens?  Will it be by private individuals who are not citizens at all?  Will it be by private companies? Will it be by co-operatives?  Will it be by somebody wishing to make a small living either by direct income or, for example, to supplement small farming, which would be very desirable?  Are we to have State involvement directly in order to apply training and educational techniques?</P>
    <P>May I say this, lest the Minister find himself lost in the labyrinth of further studies, that these questions were posed years and years ago?  They were posed at seminars on aquaculture for the first time in 1978.  They were listed in 1978 and forwarded to the different people who might be interested in the development of this industry.  To my knowledge the problem about it is that there has been very little progress in relation to its solution. The House will notice that I am ecumenical in my criticism of different documents of the Ministry.  I regard fisheries as so important that I have forwarded suggestions to different Ministers in different administrations at different times.  The reason I am making these remarks this afternoon is that I wish every incumbent of the office the success that might have escaped other people, and I know the Minister will want to take these suggestions in the spirit in which they are offered.</P>
    <P>There is a vague approach to this question of fisheries.  I listened to some of the other speeches, which were a mixture of prayer and hope in a way, There is nothing wrong with either prayer or hope but in the modern world neither is a substitute for the planning process.  This is a battle which I acknowledge I have lost to date: but may I hope to win an ambush in this campaign about planning in relation to the matter of fisheries?  If one needs people to become involved in the fishing industry at present one must take stock.  It is a more critical decision now because internationally there are three levels at which the situation has changed. The Law of the Sea Conference is meeting and has met.  It has foundered on any principles of equity in relation to the general <Col N="388" /> use of the oceans.  The United States have mirrored their attitude on many other matters by just deciding that it will be the principles of their own greed that will inform the new Law of the Sea arrangements rather than anything else. The work of eight, ten or 14 years has foundered by their attitude now in relation to the Third World countries.  Their attitude is being based on two principles essentially, one in relation to the possibilities of ocean-based mining and minerals and the second in relation to what they call research but which might more usefully be termed in many cases reconnaissance. I would urge you that when you find yourself in the new ministry of seas and fisheries to ask questions about the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As always, I am greatful for your advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was discussing the international constraints on the development of fisheries. The Law of the Sea is one and also the American attitude which has created confusion as to what would be possible in relation to oceans.  The principle that arises here in relation to sea fisheries is that the next phase of the development of fisheries in general will be in the form of ocean ranching, which will be the form of the fisheries of the future.  The conditions under which it will be carried out <Col N="389" /> will be defined in time by the Law of the Sea.</P>
    <P>The second point is much more important than that, that is, the immediate question referred to already by Deputies, that of Europe.  Here I would agree with one good point made by Deputy P. Gallagher and which I should like to develop. I should like to think that the suggestions he makes about putting Irish observers on foreign boats was practical, possible and legal within the Community.  But in the short term, while we are testing the legality of that, there are a few things we could do and that we have not followed up.  After our accession to the European Economic Community in 1973 and the disgraceful neglect of fisheries by any practical defensive measure within Protocols to the Treaties, we do have within the Treaties, and in one Protocol, reference to resources which are crucial to the existence of a country.</P>
    <P>I am afraid this is not an original suggestion. I was a member of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EC between 1973 and 1977.  The idea was put forward in Brussels by the present Taoiseach, then chairman of the committee, myself and a number of others and it has not been followed up since then.  In order to do something about that what we would have had to have done was to have initiated a series of surveys of our own showing the dependence of the coastal communities on fisheries.  We failed to even initiate these; not only have they not been published but they were never initiated.  In the talks which took place at that time about the manner in which the future of Irish fisheries had been jeopardised by the Treaty of Accession we continually complained that the statistics and research which were being used to inform the debate between Ireland and Europe were being produced entirely from the European Communities. Yet these are the figures which are being used to some extent in the debate still.  We did not allocate the resources to carry out the surveys that we needed ourselves that might have assisted our case.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say to the fishing community that I hope something will <Col N="390" /> turn up that will enable the fisheries to survive for ten years, and I think other Deputies felt it incumbent to say not only for ten years but for decades and for generations.  The fact is that in the 1970s we swallowed hook, line and sinker the arguments about how much we could do to protect our fisheries and we did not do much about it.  People like myself who prosecuted those arguments at the time throughout the country were regarded as eccentric people who could not see the benefits of membership or were simply being troublesome about the overall benefits that might accrue.</P>
    <P>What we might do now is to see if we can make something of this question of the dependence of the coastal community on sea fishing as a livelihood and get some room to manoeuvre.  That is still possible in the context of the law deriving from the Community.  However, to do that would be to address ourselves to the external conditions in which the future of fisheries must be concerned.  None of these is exclusive.  For example, the international conditions in which the future of fisheries must be concerned is crucial because it affects the decision of a person who might buy a trawler as to whether he will go into the industry or not.  It affects the investment decision because one is involved in anything from boat-building to education of young fishermen.  It is necessary to get these external conditions correct.  However, that does not preclude us from launching for the first time in the history of the Irish nation a plan for fisheries and aquaculture and their development. Of its nature it would include everything from what it is possible to earn for the industry, the different investment levels and the different choices that are open even within forms of investment in fisheries and agriculture.</P>
    <P>I was reminded about how far we are from that by a statement I read a few months ago about what is happening in relation to Rossaveal pier in my constituency. It is a constituency with a coastline and with families who make their livelihood from the sea.  We were told that between July 1981 and January 1982 the provision of toilets at the pier had gone ahead and that it was hoped before the <Col N="391" /> end of 1982 to improve the pier lighting. Rossaveal pier was built many times politically.  At the beginning of the 1970s I was driven to make the remark that if the project had gone ahead every time it was mentioned it would have connected the Aran islands to the mainland in Galway. Nevertheless, the pier at Rossaveal did exist but access roads, lighting at the pier, running water or toilets were not provided.  Having waited decades for a pier that might possibly serve the needs of the Aran Island fishermen &mdash; immensely more suitable for them than to travel to Galway &mdash; a battle was then to begin as to how they might ever have lighting, water and basic facilities such as toilets.  Here, again, we found ourselves in the Irish approach to the fishing industry. The roads were to be a matter of contest between the county council and the Department of Fisheries; the lighting involved the county council, the ESB and the Department of Fisheries, and so it went on.</P>
    <P>It is important that everything to do with the sea and with fishing be brought under one heading.  We should take back from the Departments of Transport and Power, Environment and Energy all of these functions and put them in one strong Department.  It should be called the Department of Seas and Fisheries because fisheries are not the totality.  The seas create great possibilities that extend way beyond fisheries, including hydrocarbons, mining, the question about who is spying in our waters between the limit of our territorial waters and our economic zone.  That involves a great deal of geology.  When one looks at the Official Reports one sees questions about what boats were doing off the Irish coast and the answer given was that the boats were not within our territorial waters.  The distance between our territorial waters and the economic zone, which is 200 miles, is immense.  We do know what people are doing in waters we regard as ours.  We do not know what people put on board such ships, we do not know if they are involved in laying reconnaissance matter on the seabed as has been alleged.  Perhaps all of this will change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> I have said it is necessary to secure the external conditions in which there might be a future for the fishing industry but this need not preclude our preparing an effective plan for the development of fisheries and aquaculture.  I said that all of these activities should be integrated in a Department with an entirely new title. Within such a plan and deriving from such a principle, it is clear that the principles that should be followed are those of conservation, education and adequate capitalisation for both industries, particularly fisheries.</P>
    <P>It is pointless to talk about conservation if we do not put it into the more general setting of the threat to stocks. Then we can make meaningful arguments about conservation that will be accepted up to a point by the fishing community. Personally I feel we are still far removed from a sufficient recognition of the importance of conservation in the future of sea fisheries.  The second principle is that of education.  Even with the valuable addition of a mobile training unit that Bord Iascaigh Mhara have used, I doubt if there are sufficient resources in education. This is not through lack of goodwill but the resources have not been released into education.</P>
    <P>The third point concerns capitalisation. Is it not rather like the matter of the toilets, the lighting and the running water at Rossaveal pier?  Sometimes we take in complete isolation the question of the future of the boatyards or some other aspects of fisheries.  It is a fragmented, daft approach to the idea of what is possible. Capitalisation decisions within fisheries need to be justified within an overall plan for the industry.  Otherwise it becomes a matter of individual bits and of factions within groups putting pressure on the Minister of the day with particular demands.  I am not expressing an opinion on the merits of any of the demands.  I am simply saying that in the absence of any regular, ordered plan of development all we will ever hear about will be how they are getting on and whether they are likely to get money.  This reduces the whole question of the future of the fishing industry to the question rather like, has a horse a good chance or not; perhaps we <Col N="393" /> have been better in the world of horses than in the world of planning.</P>
    <P>Within conservation there are practical matters that, are still undecided.  On 27 January 1982 at column 203 of Volume 333 of the Official Report, Deputy Deasy referred to purse seineing, a particular form of net use which represents a great conservation threat.  It consists of the surrounding of shoals and almost of lifting them entirely from the sea.  Most international conservation advice is against the use of this technique and I urge the Minister to have a report prepared for him on the use of that technique which represents the single greatest modern conservation attack on the species:</P>
    <P>I should like to return to the question of aquaculture and it is in relation to that that some of our best prospects of all lie. We are in the position now of trying to sustain a fishing fleet at a time when stocks are threatened.  Of course the time to have gone into all that was when there were fewer threats.  Let me be perfectly clear, there was a disgraceful character to the exchanges I had between the Commissioner for Fisheries of the EEC about these matters when we joined the Community. The great European nations, many of whom are our partners in the EEC and many who are not, have put fishing stocks in European waters at risk. Their own greedy predatory activities had wiped out stocks in several of the seas of the Community and they could now concentrate on our coast.  Historically, I believe we will not be forgiven for our neglect in the Protocols to the Treaty of Accession.  Perhaps having looked upon this resource for decades and not getting around to the business of how we might put a light bulb at the end of the piece of ground sticking out into the sea and building a pier, we decided in the seventies to give it away.  The trawlers came then and we had the question of the discussion on quotas and how conservation would be managed.  What was taken into account then was the existing fishing capacity of the nations of Europe.  This tiny nation with the resources surrounding it had a low capacity, a small fleet and did not have the tradition of working for long days.  The structure of the industry <Col N="394" /> was rather fragile and instead of getting the space so that it might expand and relate itself to the resource that had not been used up to then what happened was that we got &ldquo;mickey mouse&rdquo; concessions that we could double our catch for five years.  However, after that it was open season again.</P>
    <P>We should be clear about the fact that if a common fisheries policy does not emerge by the end of 1982 European nations will represent an even further threat to Irish fishing.  That is a reality we cannot ignore.  In other words, the people who had ecologically and economically represented the greatest historic threat to the future of fishery at European and, indeed, world level were not sanctioned in any way by the negotiations which eventually took place.  They were able to relate themselves to these last remaining resources and it was that view which prevailed in the balance and the contest of power that was represented between these strong nations and this small nation with an undeveloped fishing fleet.</P>
    <P>In relation to aquaculture a number of things are extremely important.  It will be necessary to change the foreshore, navigation and fishery legislation from which a number of applied policy decisions might be derived.  I will return to those matters in future debates but it is necessary that that work of clearing the legal obstacles out of the way so that people can get into the industry be put in train immediately.</P>
    <P>There is then the question of research. I should like now to deal with some of the work of BIM who have been involved in funding seminars which seek to disseminate techniques of fish farming.  There is a problem in this regard.  For example, how does one bridge the gap between research findings on the one hand and people who might wish to make full-time or part-time livelihoods on the other hand?  The kind of skills that are necessary are ones that are sociological in many ways.  The Combat Poverty Team in rural areas were involved in techniques that were precisely suitable to galvanise people towards becoming involved in development that would include matters like aquaculture and fish farming.  There <Col N="395" /> is need for some other form of agency. There is need for somebody who would bridge the gap between the technician and the community so that the community will benefit from aquaculture as a livelihood.  That gap must be filled by motivating coastal communities through co-operatives and ventures to become involved in the sea.</P>
    <P>Earlier I paid tribute to BIM.  The Bill which increases the capital capacity of BIM is welcome but I wish that between the agencies there was a better co-operation and a more obvious form of interconnection. On the one hand there is BIM which has a number of functions ranging from promoting the consumption of fish as part of our diet and marketing to promotional activities involving the fishing industry in general and we also have the work of the National Board of Science and Technology.  There is also the work that takes place in the Department. Surely if there is a case for bringing everything to do with legislation in relation to the sea under one Minister there is equally a case to be made to co-ordinate within one marine institute a number of applied matters in relation to the sea.  The Minister may wish to examine such a proposal.</P>
    <P>Earlier I mentioned that in the neglect of the fishing industry historically from 1832 when we had 62,000 people making a living from the sea to today when we have between 6,000 and 7,000, there had been a great negation of the sea as a reality among people in relation to the sea being perceived as threatening and that education was not directed towards the sea.  In a study of the attitude of school leavers in the seventies among 2,000 children in County Mayo only one child said he would choose to make a living from the sea.  With the neglect in terms of the absence of a political will to achieve a plan for the future of the fishing industry, and institutionally the chaos that surrounded the bits and pieces of the neglect of this industry, there has been also a psychological withdrawal from the sea.  The time has come to turn to the sea again.  Many people in these coastal communities faced with the choice of going <Col N="396" /> to cities and into industry that is ageing and not producing the capacity to create new units of employment would look at the sea again if there was a dynamic approach towards this industry.  We do not want further studies; we want a few imaginative principled decisions followed by determined planning to indicate what is happening.  Within the school system the excellent films and promotional material of BIM could be disseminated on a wider basis through the school system. For example, teachers might include knowledge, attitudes, details and matters about the sea as part of the curriculum in a more enthusiastic way than they have done so far.</P>
    <P>I would not be pessimistic in relation to aquaculture.  The ESRI investigated aquaculture at one stage and decided to compare the average industrial wage with, for example, what it is possible to earn from mussel farming.  This is not a very useful comparison.  What one must also ask oneself is: if you take the population statistics of these coastal communities and look at what income is necessary so that a person will have a choice of actually remaining there or to combine it with small farming and still remain in the community, then you are talking about meaningful criteria of comparison.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well.  I shall however look for progress on all these matters in whatever time is given to us to be in this relationship of Minister and opposing person in this area.  There are thousands of jobs to be created in the industry, even in this new area alone, provided we act with imagination.  If we do not do that the researchers, who brought the possibility to the point of delivery, having become unemployed will emigrate; the technicians who know how to apply the science will become unemployed and then the people of the coast will say as they once said of forestry which is within the Minister's Department, &ldquo;Trees do not grow here&rdquo;&mdash; they may say that aquaculture is something that did not work.  It is important to break through all that pessimism and by planning create an atmosphere in which people will want to make a living again from the sea.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" /> I will end by sharing a point Deputy Gallagher made in relation to transport. I opened on that point and said it was extremely important that the work of the committee on safety should continue until their final report is brought to the point where it might lead to some precise regulation.  People will expect this and it will be welcomed in all communities that have experienced the tragedies to which we have referred.  There is the whole notion of what happens in a fishing community when a tragedy of this kind occurs.  It is to the great credit and a tribute to the great loyalty of the fishing communities along the coast that despite such tragedies sons follow fathers, people marry fishermen and take on the risks. That indicates an attachment to fishing and the sea by the people of these communities. I hope that at the end of the present ministry these communities will have a more planned environment and a more secure future in which to give themselves and their families a livelihood all of their lives.</P>
    <P>I have been concentrating almost entirely on both a critique and a set of practical suggestions.  It is no good continuing to say we hope something will turn up for the fishing industry, that things will get better, that this little problem will be sorted out and that several more little problems will be sorted out in the time to come.  The time has now come to make up our minds whether we shall stop talking about the fishing industry and finally begin something that has been neglected for a century and that is a plan for the future of livelihoods to be earned from the sea.</P>

Before continuing my contribution I should like to point out that I have been waiting patiently here since early morning and that what Deputy Begley said was quite incorrect.  The majority waiting to speak in this debate have been on this side of the House.  As a new Deputy I am rather surprised to find Deputy Begley, with his experience, showing such discourtesy to somebody like myself on my first occasion. I understand before I came into the House that it was a respected tradition that new Members were allowed to speak without interruption.  Deputy Begley's example is no headline to hold up to anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bellew</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend now to continue to speak to the Bill before the House. Like other speakers, I welcome the increase in the money being made available to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in addition to the funds that have already enabled many of our people to provide a livelihood for themselves from the harvest of the sea.  All Deputies should welcome the increased provision which will ensure further facilities to be provided along these lines.  It is well to bear in mind that it is more profitable to teach a man how to catch a fish and to give him facilities for doing so than to give him a fish each day to feed himself.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the provision for it are a fine example of this type of attitude and anything that furthers or betters the facilities it can provide for the fishing community is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>BIM have carried out an amount of development in the fishing industry in the years since they were established but I believe that the industry is capable of much further improvement and that the improvement should be twofold.  First, it is capable of providing a rich source of food.  On this point it is lamentable to see the numbers who are starving in the world and at the same time see the unharvested richness of our seas and the seas of other countries.  We could possibly reap a much richer harvest from our seas than is at present being done.  As in the case of the cattle industry, it should not be necessary for us to export all this harvest as it were on the hook.  The processing of it should, as far as possible, take place in our own country thereby giving further employment to people on shore as well as to those actually engaged in fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fish imports, which, regrettably, still take place to a large extent, must be eliminated.  It is unbelievable that a country which produces such vast quantities of food, and is capable of producing greater quantities both on shore and at sea, should import huge quantities of both agricultural and fish produce.  The <Col N="400" /> Dublin markets and any fishmonger's shop display large quantities of imported processed food products.  This situation should be remedied.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara should double their efforts to see that much more of our fish products are processed here and sold here.  Surplus fish, if processed, could be used beneficially for animal feeding and also for human consumption and for exports.</P>
    <P>It has been said here that to dwell on the parochial aspects of the fishing industry may not be the best approach to the Bill before the House, but one must be aware of the needs of one's own constituency as well as of the fishing industry in general.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara, through the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, provide money for the purchasing of new fishing vessels but there should be an obligation upon the Board, or the Minister, to see that these investments are protected at the ports at which they are normally used.  Regrettably, that is not the case in many of the ports.  There has been a welcome investment of funds over the years for many ports.  Large-scale development has taken place along the east coast, on which I am most competent to speak, in Dunmore East, Dungarvan, Howth and also in the northern port of Killybegs.</P>
    <P>Coming as I do from a constituency with a small connection with the fishing industry, I am particularly interested in the fishing port in that constituency and will be putting before the Minister the needs of the fishing industry there and highlighting some of the apparent deficiencies. My constituency of Louth in years gone by had other ports but the fishing industry is now concentrated in the one fishing port of Clogher Head.  At that port there are 26 fishing vessels, representing probably an investment by the fishermen themselves and the State, through An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Minister's Department, of about £10 million. That fleet has been built up over the years and is fishing very successfully and giving worthwhile employment, both at sea and on shore, to quite a substantial number of people.  However, over the past 20 years developments have been awaited in connection with the pier and <Col N="401" /> the inner harbour.  Large amounts have been invested in other ports but it might be better, as with industrial development, to have ten units of 100 rather than one unit of 1,000, because one might fail and the other nine continue functioning. I urge the Minister to re-examine the question of devoting so much of his scarce resources to the bigger units.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister years in office and have every confidence that he will do a good job.  I hope that in the years ahead of him he will put some of the resources into some of the smaller ports to assist the people who have been waiting for 20 years for necessary repairs to piers.  The pier at Clogher Head does not even possess power points for the servicing of boats as they come in from fishing.  At low water daylight is visible through the pier because of the collapse of its foundations, which have been washed away. This is a danger and hazard to the people who go out in all types of weather to provide food for the rest of the community and employment for themselves.</P>
    <P>Two of the fishing fleet have to sail ten miles northwards to Annagassan, which port they may only enter at high water. If they miss this port, they become stranded on a sand bank.  Nine of the fishing fleet have to proceed to Drogheda port every morning, to the former fishmeal factory.  Regrettably, they are moved from there on occasions because that is the only location at which explosives are imported for the explosives factory at Enfield.  It is not, therefore, a very suitable location for these vessels.  Two more must sail further up the river into the town of Drogheda.  These vessels often must be moved to facilitate shipping in the port.  The Minister can appreciate that that situation is not very desirable, as only 50 per cent of the fleet based at Clogher Head can tie up there to discharge their cargoes and have the necessary work carried out.  These men are forced very often to stay on the boats when in Drogheda because of vandalism and to be ready to move them.  They use much more fuel than should be necessary in going to these locations.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will accept the invitation, not alone from Clogher Head <Col N="402" /> but from the various other ports, and that he will show an active interest in the problems and tribulations facing the fishing industry.  I am sure that he will do all in his power to alleviate all these problems.</P>
    <P>One very important item has not been mentioned so far in the debate which is more particularly related to the Irish Sea or the east coast than to any other coast, and that is pollution of our seas.  This problem if unchecked could make worthless the capital which has been voted for the industry today.  The sewage discharge from our major towns is probably the gretest cause of pollution in this area. Pollution causes great havoc with our existing stocks of fish and fish breeding stocks.  I have no facts or figures available, but one has only to travel from the port of Dublin to Liverpool on any clear day to observe the amount of pollution in the Irish Sea.  This cannot be beneficial for fish life.</P>
    <P>I urged the Minister to use his good offices with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, to ensure that local authorities instal the necessary plants to eliminate as far as possible the pollution which is being created and which is detrimental to fish life in our seas.</P>
    <P>I also advocate that the Minister should ensure that a greater proportion of the resources of Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the fishing industry generally are concentrated on the shellfish industry.  This is an industry which has been neglected over many years.  A revival of it has been effected over the past 20 years but its potential for improvement and investment is enormous.  A great amount of food could be procured from this area and employment and exports also have tremendous potential.  The Minister should concentrate his efforts on these worthwhile factors.</P>
    <P>Any discussion on the fishing industry obviously draws our attention to the question of the safety of people who engage in this industry and who go to sea in all types of weather and constantly put their lives at risk.  All Deputies would welcome and support any additional navigational aids or measures which would ensure greater safety for these brave men <Col N="403" /> and boys.  It would make their absences at sea less worrying for their families.  I would welcome any steps the Minister might take in that direction and I am sure the Members of the House would support any measures he might bring in from time to time.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the question of building fishing vessels.  They are becoming larger and more expensive and if any of them are obtained from abroad it means the export &mdash; in the worst possible way &mdash; of money.  In so far as possible building and construction of these vessels should be done in our own building yards in order that the money spent on them will generate further employment for our own people.</P>
    <P>I wish also to refer to the inshore salmon fishing industry and the share fishermen who gain their livelihood from that occupation.  I know the regulations and the methods of fishing vary from one part of the country to another and, therefore, I can speak only of the practices obtaining in the constituency I represent. I support the plea made today by Deputy Gallagher in asking that the Minister remove the 10 per cent levy which is being imposed on these catches.  Probably most of the people engaged in this type of fishing are not in a position to pay this levy, which is a substantial sum to be deducting from, in many cases, their only source of income.  I agree, however, that anybody found breaching the regulations or fishing illegally deserves the penalties imposed on him.  I urge the Minister to ensure that the regulations are strictly enforced in the various fishery boards areas.  The Minister should also, in so far as his resources allow, see what can be done in regard to the re-stocking of salmon fisheries because, without that, there will be no harvest there for anybody in another few years and employment will further disappear in this vital industry.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is, undoubtedly, our greatest industry, both in its practice as a science of growing products and their subsequent processing in our factories. Unfortunately, in many cases, a product is exported in live form to other countries <Col N="404" /> for processing to take place there.  The sea processes as much potential, and probably more, than the land both in its ability to give gainful employment and for yielding vital and very rich sources of foodstuffs, not just for ourselves but for exporting.  To that extent, any increase in the resources being made available to people to provide the necessary means to catch this harvest and have it processed is to be welcomed.  I support the Bill before the House.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment and I wish him well.  I should like also to compliment the Minister of State who has also been appointed to the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  I wonder what function he will have, will he be counting the waves as they come towards the shore?  As far as I can see in the Department of Fisheries and Forestry there will be more staff now attached to Ministers' offices doing constituency work than working for the fishing industry as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish also to compliment Deputy Gallagher on his speech and Deputy Bellew who made an excellent maiden speech.  I was glad to hear their points of view being expressed and the Minister should listen to those people instead of the self-styled authorities in Dublin, either in the Department of Fisheries and Forestry or Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>
      <P>Listening to this debate, one would think that Bord Iascaigh Mhara was the greatest thing that ever hit our country. To fishermen and anyone associated with the fishing industry it is one of the greatest disasters we ever had.  The Minister said he wanted to increase the bond to £40 million from £15 million.  It is well known that in December 1980 the total amount of money due to the State from Bord Iascaigh Mhara was £14,861,304. What is it now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister will give a down to <Col N="405" /> earth touch to this Ministry, as Deputy Fitzpatrick tried to do in the short time he was there.  Over 80 per cent of trawlers here are now in arrears with their payments to Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  There are over 400 outstanding accounts due to Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara lost every case which they brought against fishermen in the High Court in the past two or three years and had to pay substantial damages ranging from £80,000 to over £100,000.  I hope the Minister will send for those judgments straight away and read what Bord Iascaigh Mhara were trying to do to our poor unfortunate fishermen.</P>
    <P>We are told that BIM need an extra £25 million.  Neither the Minister nor his predecessor has told us where the £25 million will be spent, a pertinent question for Members of the House, the fishermen and the taxpayers.  Listening to the speeches made here today one would think BIM are the greatest thing ever to hit the country.  If one speech made here today had been made to a group of fishermen in Dingle, Killybegs or Burtonport there would not be many of them listening to it at the end &mdash; they would all have gone.  That speech did not make sense.  It was idealistic and there is an awful difference between idealism and common sense.</P>
    <P>Bord Iascaigh Mhara should be looked at very closely.  Does the Minister know that at the moment there is a group of consultants in BIM looking at how they are working?  I am sure the Minister does not know that.</P>

When I stood up earlier this evening to make my contribution I was ruled out of order by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Instead, he called on a Deputy who had not even offered.

      <P>I could find a better word for it.  I am asking the Minister for a breakdown of the £25 million.  Will the money be spent on large trawlers?  Has it been spent already?  Will it be spent on fish processing.  Will it be spent to the detriment of small trawler men?  Recently I read a statement in the press attributed to a Dr. Meaney who holds a very high position in BIM.  He said the days of new boats were gone, that we will have reconditioned boats from now on.  Is it the policy of BIM to get reconditioned boats which have been salvaged from the scrap-yards of Norway, Denmark, Spain? Would that learned gentleman feel satisfied if he were given a reconditioned car or a reconditioned house?  Statements of that kind, pronouncements of policy, should come from the Minister.  It is this House which votes the money for BIM and policy statements of that kind should not be made at chamber of commerce dinners or little social evenings in Dublin. I appeal to the Minister to clarify that statement.  How old will such boats be? What insurance company will cover them?  We have heard about tragedies at sea, and weaknesses in the structure of the boats have been blamed rather than neglect of the crews.  The Minister is a young man with the energy to find out about and to tell us more about these <Col N="407" /> reconditioned boats.  It is this House which provides the money and it does not matter whether it is a Fianna Fáil Government or a Coalition Government, it makes no difference&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has very little time here.  Make the most of it.  Policy statements involving money provided by the House should be made in the House. I should like to be told by the Minister what are the capital liabilities of BIM. Not so long ago we gave our boatyards for a song to a few individuals along the coast.  In effect we gave them a golden handshake.  They have had them only two years and they want to give them back to the State.  Will the Minister tell us if the yards contain the same stock now as when we sold them?  The taxpayers' money is involved here.  We should be told how much stock was in the yards when they were sold and how much today.  The Minister must look at this very closely.  Were those boatyards stripped of their assets to make a quick buck for those fellows before they got out?  The fishermen see people walking away with thousands of pounds while they are in arrears in regard to repayments on 80 per cent of our trawlers. I am reliably informed that that is the figure.  I ask the Minister please to take note.  If those boatyards are going back to the State, in what condition are they?</P>
      <P>The Minister's predecessor made one courageous decision.  He stopped BIM from leaving Hume House and going out to a white elephant which they had built in Dún Laoghaire.  What did this office block out in Dún Laoghaire cost?  I have been told that some of the money being provided here is to pay for that office block that was built in Dún Laoghaire. But what happened?  The secretarial staff of BIM met and decided they would not go out there.  What is happening to that office block in Dún Laoghaire?  How much money have we lost on this monstrosity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know a few I could put into it.  Why did it take the staff and the Minister of the day to stand up and say that they were not going out there?  What was the logic behind building this office block out there and renting it?  If that is not a disgraceful expenditure of taxpayers money, what is?  Every fisherman along the coast knows that Dún Laoghaire is not suitable for them when they have business to do.  Dublin was bad enough but to have to go out to Dún Laoghaire after getting off a train was the last straw altogether, with a beautiful office in Hume Street with two of the floors idle.  BIM were involved in marketing and they opted out of that.  They were involved in boatbuilding and they opted out of that.  All those sections are empty but the staff are still there.  This is the amazing thing about BIM.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy for the Minister because he has a problem which I hope he will be able to manage. The Minister should not be fobbed off by anybody.  The first thing the Minister should do is go out to meet the staff of BIM or invite them in to meet him.  He will be surprised at what he will learn and he will be learning it from the ground up, which is the best way to learn it.  I listened to Deputy Bellew.  He said the Minister should go around the coast.  But if he does that he should not go around with the same old story that the Government will do their best for the fishermen.  He should have something positive.  When the Minister goes to an area he should know how many boats are in the area; he should know about the pier facilities, the landing facilities, the marketing facilities and the freezing facilities in that area. When the Minister has done his homework on all these subjects he should go to an area and have something positive to say.  Otherwise he should stay away lest he be destroyed because the fishermen are in an angry mood with BIM. They are in an angry mood because their colleagues were dragged before the courts to pay arrears.  Yet one learned judge said to counsel for BIM that he should get out and settle the case or he <Col N="409" /> would make a decision after lunch.  Let the Minister read the briefs and the judgments of these cases to see how many more cases are like that.  It is regrettable that fisherman were dragged before the courts.  But they proved their point.  I make the point that there might be many more ready to go before the courts and that again there will be settlements out of court.  A settlement out of court is hardly ever reported in the newspaper but when a settlement is reached the word passes along the grapevine fairly rapidly, and some of these settlements were substantial.</P>
    <P>The whole structure of BIM needs to be looked at.  If the Minister can devise something, after consultation with the interested parties, he will have done something worthwhile for the fishing industry and the fishermen.  If ever any board here needed restructuring it is BIM.  They have outlived their usefulness as they stand and that is the consensus of opinion among the fishermen.</P>
    <P>A couple of weeks ago, before we moved from that side to this side, I received a telegram from fishermen at Brandon Head stating that 20 or 30 Dutch trawlers were fishing off Brandon Head and that none of the residents of Brandon Head could sleep at night because the factory ship was grinding away all night. I handed that telegram to the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and they responded; three of those ships were captured the following morning.  At present 30 of them are anchored off Ventry and there is no sign of any protection whatsoever. No wonder the fishermen are angry when they see the fishing beds being raped to death and nobody there to protect them.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry is in chaos at the moment.  The fishermen I have met are pessimistic about certain aspects of the industry.  They feel that they have been let down by everybody.  The Minister has a golden opportunity.  He is a new man and he is bound to have new ideas and he should do his own thing.  I wonder how much of the £25 million that we are providing today is going towards harbour development.  Recently I got in touch with the Department in regard to getting <Col N="410" /> a job done in my own town &mdash; everybody has to come back to base eventually &mdash; and I was told it was a matter for Roinn na Gaeltachta.  What have Roinn na Gaeltachta to do with the Department of Fisheries and Forestry?  Surely there must be some scheme in the Department of Fisheries and Forestry for grant-aiding harbours which need to be developed. Why should another Department be involved?</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach appointed the Ministers of State yesterday he said he was going to have a look at the whole aspect of Government in different Departments.  The time has come for the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, if it is to be a worthwhile Ministry, to be given control of harbour development and anything else connected with the fishing industry.  That is the reality of the situation.  At the moment everybody is looking into various situations but nobody is doing anything about them. The Minister should submit to the Government that all aspects of the fishing industry be brought under one umbrella, the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, I hope that a new body will be set up and that it will not be called BIM.</P>
    <P>This year could be a very sad year for Irish fishermen because, according to the Treaty of Rome, in 1982 our exclusive fishery rights no longer exist.  I was spokesman for Fisheries in 1971 when we went into Europe.  I wish to draw attention to the fact that there was no special package for fishermen.  This is borne out by the fact that the Dutch already think the agreement no longer exists.  The time has come when the kid glove attitude of successive Governments to Brussels must stop.  We should speak loudly and clearly to those in the EEC and say this country will not give up its traditional fisheries.  I am sorry the Minister of State is leaving just as I say this.  This is a fundamental issue facing fishermen.  We may talk about marketing and processing of fish but if no agreement is reached by the end of this year the Dutch, French and so on can fish right up into our harbours.  This is crazy.  I hope the Government will take a positive stand on this issue and point out that we are going to preserve our <Col N="411" /> fishery rights.  They had ten years to arrive at a fisheries policy but it did not suit them to do so.  They have over-fished their own waters and that is why they are now fishing off our coasts.  As far as the industry is concerned our attitude must be positive and we must say to the EEC thus far and no further.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry is a natural one.  It has been neglected by BIM through the years.  They opted out of marketing.  Why should a fishery board concerned for the promotion of the fishing industry do this? Members of the House will know that there are towns in which fresh fish is never received.  They cannot get it.  At the same time officials from the Department arrive at different ports with a gun and red dye.  They spray the fish and dump them into the sea because they did not reach a certain price.  This is crazy. There are voluntary organisations such as St. Vincent de Paul, the Samaritans, chambers of commerce and so on.  They know there are people who are hungry here, yet fish are sprayed with red dye and dumped.  Is it not immoral that such a situation is tolerated?</P>
    <P>If something positive is not done for fishermen within the next 12 months we will not have any fishing industry.  It is crazy that individuals can get a licence, bring in Dutch boats and fish our waters. How much more can fishermen take?  Not much.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara must be restructured.  There should be fishermen's representatives on the board. Those who were responsible for building the white elephant in Dun Laoghaire should be brought to justice.  Fishermen who are in arrears with payments on their boats should get special concessions.  If fishermen are taken to court by BIM, particularly for repossession of a boat, the Minister should see the file.</P>
    <P>I could go on and on.  However, I wish the Minister and the Minister of State every good luck in their jobs.  They have a difficult job.  They need more than public relations.  There must be action.  The only action I would recommend to them is to meet the fishermen.  They should not listen to BIM officials.  They are out of touch and out of tune.  They should meet <Col N="412" /> the people on the ground and do the right thing for the fishing industry and so preserve it for the future.  It is a natural industry which does not require development. It is in the sea and it is ours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be an air of expectancy and anxiety in what I have to say, speaking again on an occasion such as this especially in the light of today's events.  I have to compliment previous speakers here today.  I have listened with great interest to the contributions made by Deputies on both sides, some of them making their first speech in this House.  I know from my own experience that it is not the most encouraging aspect of a day's work to think that you have to face deliberation in this House, but I must compliment them on their contributions, particularly Deputy Higgins and Deputy Begley.  The remarks of those two Deputies would seem to indicate a shift from die-hard political attitudes and policies in relation to fisheries towards a fairly broad coming together of ideas and notions in relation to the development of our fisheries and the formulation of some sort of fishery plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> Deputy Higgins advised bringing all items referring to fishing, including roads, harbours and every other aspect, under the Minister's Department and direct control.  I was very interested in his detailed outline in relation to the fragmented plan that we have at present.  We can all be subject to pressure groups.  The Department and the fishermen and all those involved in fishing, be they in the actual fishing, in processing or in the ancillary industries, are crying out for a proper development plan.  If we are not to have a common fisheries policy within the structure of the EEC, let us at least be seen to have our own plan in the interim.  As somebody said today, we have had far too much talk, hope and expectancy and very little action.  I suppose there are as many fishermen in my constituency as there are in those of the other speakers and one would not have to be very Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael to realise that they are in difficulty and that neither Government really had the political will to tackle the basic problems that they have.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley was quite right in his advice to the Minister that we must meet the fishermen.  He outlined the problems that the fishermen have and their fear of having been let down and he raised questions in relation to activities of BIM over the years.  I would not be in a position to comment on that but his remarks gave me to understand that serious questions remained to be answered.  He also mentioned the question of harbour development coming under the Minister's direct control.  I can refer to a little pier in my constituency which is not very extravagant in its demands, but the Department and the Bord of Works are not in a position to implement the jobs since, they maintain, the pressure of work in the constituency prevents them from getting it under way.  The answer is not good enough for the fishermen.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be a little pessimistic in his view of the fishing industry.  My view of it is slightly different in that in recent years &mdash; I can speak with accuracy only in relation to the two major ports in my constituency, Killybegs and Burtonport <Col N="415" />&mdash; I have seen great development and great changes.  I have seen private individuals taking on expansion of firms and industries.  Granted they were very well assisted by the IDA and other State bodies in the formulation of industry there, but the element of risk is always associated with fishing.  In these precarious times it is encouraging to see somebody in the private sector prepared to have a go in an industry which is, to say the least of it, running through a very rough period.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the officials of his Department should accept comments made here by Members of the House as constructive criticism.  They are not offered in a personal manner but in order to be helpful to both the Department and the people directly involved in the fishing industry.  I would like to think that my contributions here and my criticism, if I should express it, would be constructive and would be accepted as such.  We have in this House on both sides of the political arena many people with great experience and knowledge in relation to the fishing industry.  We have former Ministers and many newcomers in the House with great basic and profound knowledge of the fishing industry in its present context, and we must talk about the present.  When I was at national school we had a little geography book which outlined the industries of the different counties and so forth and not one of the towns at present engaged in a big way in the fishing industry was listed then as a forerunner in that industry.  Brí Chualann was then the forerunner and we have seen what happened there in the course of not too many years. I believe we have had a worthwhile contribution from both these newly-elected representatives and the former Ministers for Fisheries and Forestry.  We should be seen to be tackling the problems of today and forget about past judgments and assessments.  Mistakes were made and there is no point in dwelling on criticism of those actions.  The remedy must be the aim for the future.</P>
    <P>I spoke previously on this subject and spent much of my time in dealing with the mackerel fisheries.  I appreciate that <Col N="416" /> the fishermen of Donegal in recent months have experienced a bonanza in relation to mackerel fishing and that area surely must be the best mackerel fishery of European countries.  However, saying that gives rise immediately to the question of how long this will continue and on the occasion of my last deliberation I referred to the conservation of stocks. Mackerel could quickly become an endangered species because of over-fishing and the exploitation of the quota system.</P>
    <P>I would have a prime concern about this in that the two ports to which I referred are within my constituency and about 1,000 people are directly involved in the fishing industry there.  These jobs are very badly needed in south-west Donegal and there are not many towns in the area which can boast of such a large number of jobs.  Were the fishing industry to collapse in my immediate neighbourhood there would hardly be a household which would not suffer a terrible blow.  It was with this in mind that I sounded a note of warning in relation to some form of control of mackerel fishing.  The Minister should listen to those involved as well as consulting, if necessary, with experts.  There have been cases in other sections of society where consultation did not take place and the people will always have their say in the final analysis.</P>
    <P>Although the number of people involved in fishing amounts in terms of votes to about 6,000 or 7,000, they are a breed of people unto themselves.  Many of them were reared in the tradition of fishing and do not know any other business. Many are of an age at which they could not be retrained or deployed into other industries.  We owe those people every effort since they seem to be a mere minority in the industrial and political sector.  Some previous Ministers have listened to the advice of fishermen, but some have not.  None of us is infallible and if an error of judgement is made at departmental or local level a Minister should be willing to see the error of his ways and take corrective steps.  He should not allow things to continue indefinitely on the wrong track.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="417" /> I said earlier that control in relation to fishing was very important and I have spoken at length on the conservation of stocks.  It does not necessarily follow that if we control the activities of foreign fishermen and luggers which come into our waters we can then say the job is done. We must also exercise control in relation to our own fishermen.  We are all susceptible to the same evils of greed for the quick pound and we might not be too worried about damage caused for short-term financial gain.  Every possible action should be taken to ensure the longevity of the resources around our coasts.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to infrastructural developments in relation to the fishing industry with particular reference to my constituency. I see here a colleague of mine from south-west Donegal who will be very familiar with the roadworks problems there.  The industrial sector of Killybegs cannot develop and expand if the roadwork programme and the network into Killybegs are not given priority. A survey carried out a year or two ago by Donegal County Council established that the road from Donegal to Killybegs was the busiest in the county. These figures can be substantiated by the county engineer.  Killybegs is in absolute chaos because the shore road has never been completed.  This road links the new pier and the old and should take all the heavy vehicles from the main street, thus alleviating the traffic chaos in the town. For many years it was believed that this road was the responsibility of the Department of Fisheries.  This belief was reinforced every time I made a request for planning permission because the Department of Fisheries had to give approval to someone who wished to gain access to the road.  This led Donegal County Council and myself to believe that the road was the responsibility of the Department but I have since learned that this is not the case.</P>
    <P>I do not see why the Minister for Fisheries, in co-operation with the Minister for the Environment, could not become actively involved in ensuring that the necessary money for this road is provided in the Estimates this year.  This matter was clearly referred to by Deputy Lenihan <Col N="418" /> when he visited Killybegs some years ago in his capacity as Minister for Fisheries and an assurance was given that the road would be completed.  Unfortunately I have to state that it is still incomplete and I ask the Minister to ensure that an allocation is forthcoming this year.</P>
    <P>There should also be some form of proper town plan for Killybegs which would involve the Department of Fisheries, BIM, Donegal County Council and the Department of the Environment.  I asked a question about the possibility of such a body being set up.  I cannot recall accurately the reply I got then but I cannot see any major difficulty or expense involved in this since we have a county development team and a regional development organisation.  On both of those bodies there are representatives from BIM, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the Department of Fisheries, Donegal County Council and all of the bodies that would be involved in the formulation of a plan for Killybegs.  There are some experts in County Donegal with first class ideas in relation to the development of a plan.  Several attempts have been made to clarify the postition but we are still being told that the Department have not made a decision in relation to certain points in relation to Killybegs.</P>
    <P>The road from Donegal to Killybegs is in very poor condition.  This hampers the development of the town.  A very fragmented programme has been implemented in relation to this.  There are some areas outside Donegal, between Donegal and Mountcharles, between Mountcharles and Dunkineely and Dunkineely and Killybegs, where one is in terror of meeting one of the lorries or articulated vehicles operating out of Killybegs. I know that Deputy McGinley agrees with me when I say that it is a wonder some of those vehicles can negotiate the road from Burtonport to Donegal.  How can a town or industry develop under such conditions?</P>
    <P>The development of Killybegs in hampered by the very inadequate water supply there.  I might sound extreme in what I am saying in relation to this but I remember at a meeting of Donegal County Council being informed by the <Col N="419" /> assistant county engineer that Killybegs operated last year and the year before by the grace of God.  I wondered what he meant but it transpired that if we had two dry months during the summer, particularly during July and August, Killybegs would have been at a standstill because of the lack of water.  We have rain there every second day and this is the reason why the ice plant at Killybegs and industry there can function.  Donegal County Council have that report from the assistant county engineer.  I am sure he would be only too delighted to forward a copy of it to the Department.  Since that report was issued some new houses have been built in the town, two new factories have been erected there and several very modern boats come into Killybegs.</P>
    <P>The question of the inadequate water supply must be a top priority.  The Department should do everything possible to improve the situation because we could have a disaster if we have a prolonged period of good weather.  The road from Burtonport to Donegal town is no wider than 18 feet at any point.  On one stretch of it around Gweebarra there are 52 corners within the space of one mile. I dread travelling that road in my car after a heavy fish landing at Burtonport because the heavy vehicles which travel that road are unable to remain on their own side of the road.  Drivers have to be very careful travelling that road at such a time.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the Department officials in relation to the facilities provided at Killybegs.  I refer particularly to the new pier, the other extensions that are envisaged, the new auction hall, which is almost ready for opening, the ice plant and the successful dredging which was carried out in the harbour.  I would like to pay tribute to the people who have been involved in the provision of those facilities in Killybegs.  Killybegs would be in a very serious position without them particularly in relation to the new boats which have been purchased and for which BIM have made great financial commitments. If those facilities had not been provided the unloading of those vessels would be very slow and cumbersome and <Col N="420" /> this would militate against prices.  There are many other items in relation to Killybegs which are still outstanding.  We do not expect them to be provided in a short space of time.  We expect to wait but are not prepared to wait indefinitely.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion I spoke on this subject I mentioned the example we should learn from the exploitation of stock off Cornwall.  I wish to state again that that particular mackerel fishery was exhausted within five years mainly because there was not the same development of on shore facilities in the area. The position is slightly different here and that is the reason why I do not agree with what Deputy Begley said.  We have an expanding on-shore development in Killybegs and Burtonport.  I like to see something like this happening.  We should not allow situations to occur where luggers can sit off our coasts, buy our fish and export it without people on shore having any access to the benefits accruing from this.</P>
    <P>We cannot allow the Cornwall situation to happen here.  We have a limited number of choices.  Negotiations with the EEC have not been very fruitful and it is evident that the formulation of a common fisheries policy is a long way off.  I would go so far as to say that many of our European partners are not interested in such a policy because the present situation suits them.  In the absence of such a policy we are left with the option of endeavouring to impose a licencing system on these luggers.  I do not think that would contravene any EEC regulations. This has been done in Canada by way of a local system.  I realise that a number of these luggers would be required at peak periods of mackerel fishing but they are not required in such great numbers all the time.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one incident I know of personally.  There were 37 factory ships operating off Rathmullen; it was like an armada.  The facilities at Rathmullen were not capable of dealing with that number of ships.  This is a natural harbour with the greatest water depth along our coasts.  I am not sure if the Department have any plans to develop it but even if they did, they would not have effect for <Col N="421" /> a very long time.  As I said, I do not expect mackerel fishing to continue at the same rate over the next ten or 12 years. Therefore the question of developing Rathmullen does not arise.  However, we have to impose some limitation on the operations.  What we are doing is providing facilities for neighbouring countries to exploit a facility we have and at the same time they are over-fishing their quotas.</P>
    <P>In Killybegs, Burtonport and other towns there is the question of the existing on-shore industries.  Everyone realises there is a large element of risk involved in the fishing industry at the best of times, without deliberately allowing the wholesale over-fishing of our natural resources. Unofficially I have established from fishermen and people involved in the processing industry that over the past three years 1.5 million tons of mackerel were fished off our coast.  That cannot continue. There has to be a political determination by all parties to tackle this problem. I offer my support to any constructive policy geared to protect our stocks, within reason and within the confines of the EEC regulations, with the terms of reference to prolong our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that Canada operated a coastal state control.  While I do not have the full details of this scheme there would be merit in finding out how that State control operates and we could see if we could apply such a control here.</P>
    <P>I am weary of the whole EEC attitude to the existing regulations.  It suits our European partners to leave the situation as it is.  They do not have the political will to finalise a common fisheries policy as is evident from the recent elections because, at worst, they would have to return to their own fishing grounds and, at best, they can fish out our waters over a short period.  In my opinion, we should not be trying to be the greatest Europeans.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what some Members said here today, we have a duty to protect public money, such as investments by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the IDA and the local authorities in our existing fishing towns.  Local industrialists must be given <Col N="422" /> credit for their endeavours and support, and this includes all involved in the processing industries.  Many of these people have submissions before the IDA for expansion.  I see this as a very good sign. It is a great tribute to their ingenuity and potential that they are prepared to expand their industries at a time when even the most objective observer can foresee great difficulties in the fishing industry in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>A few people have become involved in net making.  They have cut into what was heretofore a German market.  I would like the Department and the IDA to ensure continued support for those people and to help them in every way to secure a market which, if allowed, could be handed over to outsiders.  The IDA should be very wary of allowing too many people to become involved in one industry. It is only natural if an industry is doing well that somebody else should decide to jump on the band-wagon. There is no point in setting up two or three industries when there is only one outlet because it could lead to the closure of one firm.  This is one aspect the Department in their wisdom should look at.</P>
    <P>There are also possibilities in engineering works.  Deputy Gallagher mentioned the boatyards and their difficulties. I concur with everything he said about those difficulties, many of which are due to the fact that the boatyards with which they compete are subsidised.  It is only natural that people purchasing various goods will deal with the firm that can supply those goods at the lowest price.  I should like to make my position clear in relation to the boatyard at Killybegs. When that boatyard operated under BIM it got into difficulty.  It is clear now, though it may not have been clear seven to ten years ago, that the wooden fishing vessel of the type that is in difficulty now, that is, the 60 to 80-foot vessel, is practically obsolete in terms of catching ability. Possibly at the time it was wrong for BIM to continue to build that type of boat at Killybegs.  Today, though, the situation is different.  There is a firm there who are capable of building any type of vessel that is required for mackerel fishing. Between Killybegs and Burtonport <Col N="423" /> there are approximately 70 fishing vessels but about 14 of those are totally uneconomical with the result that their skippers are in financial difficulty, a difficulty that has been aggravated by virtue of mounting arrears and accruing interest.</P>
    <P>As I said before in this House, it would cost the Department a substantial sum of money to recover those boats but I am still confident that they should be recovered.  Having discussed the matter with the people concerned in Killybegs, with the workers and the management there, I am concerned that they would be capable of building boats for the fishermen of a type that would leave them once again in a viable situation.  What is encouraging is that many of these people are anxious to find work and this is something that is a rare commodity in the times in which we live.  The smaller type of vessel is no longer adequate and is not considered for conversion grants.</P>
    <P>It may sound unrealistic to ask the Government in what are difficult financial times to spend up to £4 million on the recovery of boats but in the long term such expenditure would be economically sound and would ensure continued jobs in the boatyard for the next ten to 15 years.  I am convinced that the boats having been recovered could be sold, not perhaps in Ireland but outside it.  The initial outlay would be substantial but if we allow matters to reach the stage where everything is lost, the situation will be much worse.  When I met workers at the boatyard recently they assured me that given the terms of reference of existing fishing requirements they could reach the standard required to build the type of boat that would be viable for the mackerel fishermen.  I would hope for the carrying out of an investigation into this situation.  There is no point in Department financiers or accountants reporting that a recovery operation would not be viable in the current financial climate.  I am talking about how feasible it would be over a number of years in the context of these 12 or 14 boats being put to work again.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should visit Killybegs whenever he can find time to <Col N="424" /> do so and look at the operation there.  I know that the sort of operation I am talking about would involve also the Department of Industry and Energy but again I come back to the question of the Minister and his officials consulting the people involved and trying to make financial arrangements on foot of whatever plan might be drawn up.  With the proper attitude the entire job could be done in Killybegs.</P>
    <P>I am aware that requests have been made to the Department regarding the problem being experienced in the boatyard at Killybegs.  This boatyard has been in operation for only a short period but during that time they have proved their worth and have justified serious consideration in any project that either the Department of Industry and Energy or the Department of Fisheries and Forestry could become involved in.</P>
    <P>I must refer also to the development of small piers, with particular reference to my own constituency.  I mentioned earlier the development which has been grantaided and approved for a little pier at Inver port.  That project was approved during the time that the Minister for Agriculture was Minister for Fisheries and Forestry but the whole matter has been bandied about since between the Office of Public Works and Donegal County Council.  I must refer also to the pier of Cladnageeragh near Glencar.  I am not an engineer but on inspecting this pier within the past six months I did not need specialist knowledge to convince me that the structure there is dangerous.  If the Department or Roinn na Gaeltachta or whoever are involved are not in a position to commence work on this project they should at least ensure that there is no admittance to the pier because of its dangerous condition.  There could be loss of life by the pier being used by somebody who was not aware of the situation.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister also to arrange for a report on the pier at Malinbeg and also the one at Creevy.  These are small piers but they are very important to the people who use them.  I am not talking about the trawlermen but about the small fishermen and those who use the half-deckers. <Col N="425" /> When two or three men must take a boat ashore in a place where there is not even the basic facility of a mooring ring or a slipway, it is asking a bit too much to ask for continued support from us regardless of what side of the political divide we are on.</P>
    <P>The same applies to small piers in the St. John's Point area, Ballysaggart, Ballyedderland and Carson's Sound.  A basic element required at each of these is a simple ESB light.  The people who operate out of there do not need intricate navigational lights but only one or two ESB lights, some source of water, a tap or whatever, and a power point, so that they can have maintenance jobs done on the little boats at the pier without having to take them to a boatyard.  I am talking about the small type of boat at a small pier.</P>
    <P>We also need basic facilities like mooring rings.  It is too late to provide these facilities, which are not very costly, when people have lost their lives.  We have had quite an amount of difficulty in this regard in Donegal.  Many people associated with the sea have sustained a loss. There is always an element of danger associated with the sea.  I know the grief and sorrow which can be caused.  Over a period of time the Department should ensure that the basic needs at piers used by fishermen with small vessels or bigger vessels are provided.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier a proper development plan for fisheries in Killybegs.  A very disjointed effort has been made in Killybegs, not from the point of view that the job is not being done, but is being done in such a way that there does not seem to be any set programme.  No one seems to know what the other crowd are doing.  Somebody queried me recently about the provision of a telephone exchange which was supposed to be sited on grounds which belonged formerly to the Department of Fisheries and Forestry. The Department did not know where the Office of Public Works intended to allow it to be built.  The Office of Public Works did not have permission from Donegal County Council. Nobody seemed to be able to tell me who was responsible.  With a county development <Col N="426" /> team who are prepared to help, it would be very easy and quite inexpensive to produce a proper plan for the town of Killybegs.</P>
    <P>I will not go in detail into the question of salmon fisheries because it has been well and truly covered.  There is one item in relation to salmon fishing and the protection of the stock which the Department would do well to take a look at.  I refer to a river which is not very far from my own residence and the question of water keepers.  This has not been tackled seriously.  I heard from locals that on a number of occasions a number of gentlemen arrived from Northern Ireland and pitched camp on a site adjacent to this river and intimidated the water keepers. If we arrived at a river with an abundance of salmon stock and saw ten or 15 hefty looking gentlemen engaged in an illegal activity, and if we were on our own, unarmed and unaided, we would have second thoughts about identifying ourselves. The Inny has a great salmon fishing potential and rod fishing potential and it should be protected.  The responsibility for that rests with the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success in his new post.  His job will not be easy.  He will have to satisfy many needs which have been there for quite a long time.  I offer my support to any project he takes in hand.  There seems to be a fair degree of agreement on all sides of the House on the common ground we should tackle in the fisheries programme.  I should like to be associated in any way I can with furthering that development.</P>

Mar tá a fhios agaibh, bhí san iomaíocht Teachta ó mo chontae féin, agus cara do mo chuid, agus, ar ndóigh, ní fhéadfainn rún a dhéanamh de go raibh brón agus díomá orm nár éirigh leis.  Mar sin féin, tá mé cinnte go mbeidh cothrom <Col N="427" /> na féinne le fáil agam agus ag gach Teachta, is cuma cén taobh den Teach atá sé, fhad agus atá tusa ansin.  Nuair atáimid ag déanamh comhghairdis, ní ceart dúinn dearmad a dhéanamh ar an Aire Iascaigh agus Foraisíochta, an Teachta Ó Dalaigh.

      <P>I should like to compliment you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on your election and wish you well.  This is the first opportunity I have had of speaking in the House since my return.  I should like to congratulate the Minister also and to wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dealing with the motion put down by Deputy E. Collins and his colleague, Deputy John Kelly, I find it somewhat confusing and I listened very attentively last evening to Deputy Collins when he <Col N="429" /> spoke.  The record of the House will show that Deputy Collins ran through some of our major economic ills but did not really develop the potential of the National Development Corporation.  In my opinion it is unacceptable that such an important subject should have been put down as an in-fill motion, if you like.  The outgoing Tánaiste and leader of the Labour Party was the person responsible and there is no reference in the motion to the Labour Party's commitment.  Deputy O'Leary, speaking on the motion last evening, more or less confined himself to suggesting to the Minister how various economic matters should be thrashed out rather than elaborating on the detailed workings of the proposed National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>Having spent four years, from 1977 to 1981, as a member of the Joint Committee examining the workings of the semi-State companies, of which Deputy Collins's colleague, Deputy Cooney, and the deputy leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Barry Desmond, were also members, I should point out that we investigated over 20 semi-State companies in that period.  The reports laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas will show that the contributions of those Deputies from the present Opposition parties were very much against the concept of this National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>That was the first committee set up since the foundation of the State to have direct access to the workings of those semi-State bodies.  Over the years this House voted vast sums of money to the various semi-State bodies whose accountability was through a board of directors. Therefore Ministers did not answer specific questions in relation to those bodies. During the period of the 21st Dáil, for the first time, an all-party committee was afforded the opportunity of meeting face to face with the directors and management of those bodies and of assessing how taxpayers' money was being used by them.  In regard to those 20 companies in respect of which comprehensive and detailed reports were produced one finds continuously major financial difficulties among the major ones.  As a committee we were at all times in agreement as to <Col N="430" /> how this should be dealt with.  We were in the position of being able to assess how in some cases taxpayers' money was not being wisely utilised or invested.</P>
    <P>On that basis I am somewhat confused about the intentions of the National Development Corporation.  Consequently, I feel this body was perhaps ill-conceived and ill-timed in its launching by the former Tánaiste on 10 February, when in the heat of an election campaign he hurried together a press conference for its launching.  At that launching we were told how crucial and important the outgoing Government, now the Opposition parties, felt the National Development Corporation to be.  One is somewhat mystified about why it took approximately eight months before an announcement was made for its implementation. One could genuinely suggest therefore that there was a difference of opinion among the Coalition parties as to its concept.</P>
    <P>I have no ideological hang-up about whether the National Development Corporation constitutes the way forward or whether it should be through the National Enterprise Agency; whichever vehicle brings about the desired effect of job creation is what should meet with the approval of this House.  I could not understand how another layer of bureaucratic procedure, under the umbrella of the National Development Corporation, would do anything other than find itself with a basketful of major semi-State companies, the bulk of which are in serious financial difficulties.  When one examines the list of companies the outgoing Government produced to be brought under the umbrella of the National Development Corporation one is even more horrified by any endeavour to assess how it would function in regard to job creation, inheriting some of the very serious difficulties obtaining in some of them and in respect of which the corporation was intended to be responsible.</P>
    <P>Among the companies listed at the former Tánaiste's press statement of 10 February one finds the Irish Sugar Company, who I believe are seeking something in the region of £66 million, or are in need of that amount of capital injection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> Whether or not they have a specific request to the Minister for Finance I am not in a position to say, but a recent article in a commercial journal suggested that they were in need of that amount. Irish Steel Holdings, it would appear, have overspent something like £25 million to £30 million on their project at Haulbowline.  Therefore they are in need of a major capital injection also.  Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta are on that list also and I see in this evening's <i>Evening Herald</i> that that company are experiencing further difficulties involving potential job losses of 200.  On leaving office in June last one of the last functions of our Government was to allocate an additional £50 million to NET which was half of what they sought from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  We then had the National Petroleum Corporation, the ESB, the Gas Board and Bord na Móna. I do not understand how one could say the National Development Corporation were going to get immediately into the job creation area if first of all they had to assess the present state of these companies and then decide from the financial point of view what was going to happen. The companies I have listed are a matter and a problem for the Ministers for Industry and Energy and Finance and there should not be an intermediary vehicle such as the NDC.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal at length with the concept of the NDC other than to put in perspective for the House the intended launch and the comments of some independent journalists following the press conference when they questioned the then Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy O'Leary.  I wish to quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 11 February:</P>
    <P>Slowly it came unstuck, steadily the questions layered over the grand plans until after an hour the infant NDC was almost buried under a mass of sceptical queries and vague replies.  And the Inevitable Question hung like a guillotine over the afternoon's proceedings, eventually to fall with a sad inevitability.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="432" /> A few paragraphs later there was the following comment:</P>
    <P>As the NDC's grand launching stuttered and stammered along came the inevitable.  If the corporation's gestation had come to a natural conclusion entirely by accident eight days before the general election, how was it that departmental officials had known nothing about its imminence on Monday and Tuesday of this week?</P>
    <P>Confusion among the officials.  A stoical Minister averred that his senior men knew nothing of such journalistic queries.  Did the Minister seriously expect us to believe that the unveiling of the NDC had just happened a week before February 18th?</P>
    <P>On 14 February 1982 <i>Magill</i> dealt with the same press conference.  A number of questions were posed and I shall refer to a few paragraphs in connection with the intended £200 million the then Tánaiste announced as the so-called working capital of the NDC.  <i>Magill</i> reported as follows:</P>
    <P>... £200m to throw into the employment kitty.</P>
    <P>Honest, no kidding.  We've been discussing this for months.  The five civil servants flanking Mick nodded wisely. &ldquo;This is not a Labour Party press conference,&rdquo; said Mick, &ldquo;it's a Departmental press conference&rdquo;.  He said that seven times.  &ldquo;The unveiling of this ... it is quite fortuituous!&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That could have been okay, par for the course, and the first half hour of the conference went by with easy questions while the journalists digested the six pages.  Then the hard questions began, and Mick came apart like someone had unscrewed his navel.</P>
    <P>It was the bit about taking nine semi-state companies under the umbrella of the NDC that got Mick in trouble.  What happens if, say, Irish Steel loses more money than has been allocated for it, where does it go for more?  The NDC, says Mick.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And suppose the NDC hasn't got the money?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mick tapped his biro on the table, <Col N="433" /> squared his jaw and said... &ldquo;Suppose NDC hasn't got the money, Mmmmm.</P>
    <P>That is the question I pose.  I hope that Deputy Kelly will come into the House as his name is down to the motion.  I should like to quote from a radio interview Deputy Kelly gave on the National Development Corporation.  This matter came up for questioning on a radio programme on 7 February when the interviewer asked the Deputy the following question:</P>
    <P>Well, are you a firm supporter of the National Development Corporation which Fine Gael is embracing now? Surely that might well be used to produce those kinds of jobs which you don't want?</P>
    <P>The then Minister, Deputy Kelly, stated he would not support job creation for the sake of job creation, that it should be for productive employment.  He made the following reply to the interviewer:</P>
    <P>No, not if I have anything to do with it.  I certainly would oppose that.  The actual working dimensions and structures of the National Development Corporation hasn't yet emerged. When it does, I certainly, and I believe everyone else in the Government, will be anxious to ensure that the jobs which it creates are productive jobs which justifies itself economically.  Any other kind of jobs may in the short term take figures off the unemployment list but in the long term it would be a millstone around people's necks.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly stated at that time that the actual working dimensions and structures of the NDC had not emerged but they came rather quickly, possibly because of the pending general election.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how the NDC could create jobs while taking on the difficult problems of the semi-State companies listed in page 5 of the press release of 10 February. Possibly the outgoing government should have taken the National Enterprise Agency and should have implemented what we intended to do.  The agency were established prior to our leaving <Col N="434" /> office in June 1981.  We had listed the board members of the NEA: it was a broad cross-section of people from industry, the trade union movement and with representation from the IFA and the Department of Finance.  It would have been practical and progressive if the then Government had allowed the NEA to commence their operations with a working capital of £5 million.  If it was obvious from experience that legislation and additional capital were necessary, the Government could have come to the House and convinced it that further investment was worthwhile, that the initial working of the agency justified further investment and they could have expanded the role into the concept of the NDC if that was the case.  However, the then Government did nothing about the matter for seven or eight months until they rushed into a press conference announcing the establishment of the NDC without considering the workings of the corporation and their functions.</P>
    <P>I come back to the experience of the Joint Oireachtas Committee dealing with semi-State bodies.  In four years we found that many semi-State companies had been making comprehensive recommendations to various Departments but that answerability was not there.  In my opinion it was irresponsible to create the National Development Corporation to act as a further in-between body with the Minister responsible.  I suggest that when the Minister is considering the workings of the semi-State sector and the NEA he should look at at the possibility of employing under his Department a hardcore of full-time directors for semi-State companies.  Many of the people I questioned when a member of that Joint Committee were competent and had been selected because of their experience but by virtue of their part-time involvement in some of the country's largest industries it was clear that it was impossible for part-time directors to devote the time and detail to some of the more complex semi-State companies.  In most of the 20 reports on semi-State companies presented to the House one finds that communications between the Minister, his Department and those companies were <Col N="435" /> not the best and resulted in some major problems.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the Minister's intentions for the NEA.  They have a crucial role to play and that role can be expanded in due course but the fact that the Minister is speedily setting about getting them operational is an indication of his determination to tackle the unemployment situation.  It is an indication of his anxiety to do everything possible to make an impact on the job creation programme. The policy being pursued by the Minister is correct.  It is correct that the funds for the NEA should be raised from sources other than from the Minister for Finance.  The potential of the agency is immense.  There is a need for involvement by the NEA with semi-State companies in joint ventures or in taking on some of their R and D work.  Some of those companies, because of their financial situation, are not in a position to diversify, but a lot of expertise in relation to job-creation programmes exists in them.  I recall that Bord na Móna carried out a number of studies on energy saving mechanisms and I feel that the NEA could make progress in that field if discussions were held with that company.</P>
    <P>There is a real distinction between the NEA and the NDC.  The NEA should be allowed to proceed on their own or in conjunction with private or semi-State companies and not as intended under the proposed NDC to pass the responsibility to the various boards of the semi-State companies.  The NEA could have a major role to play in my constituency.  It is my intention to approach the Minister about a number of projects in my area to see if there is job creation potential in them. The new agency would also benefit from the work of the research and development section of the IDA.  Very often the biggest problem of that section was to get private enterprise to recognise the necessity for research and development in bringing new products on the market. The NEA can act as a catalyst between private companies that possess the necessary expertise but do not have the working capital and semi-State companies that are already heavily committed <Col N="436" /> but have new ideas.  I should like the Minister, when replying, to tell me if he accepts my point about board representation of semi-State companies.  Full-time directors should be appointed to the boards of those companies with the responsibility of reporting directly to the Minister.  The reports of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies would justify that change.</P>
    <P>I am sure the job creation proposals will receive the support of all sides.  I suggest to the Opposition that their motion is not the correct way to deal with this matter now.  The intention of the Minister to make £5 million available, compared to the £20 million suggested for a national development corporation, at a time of limited resources is correct. That will give the new agency adequate funds in 1982 to create additional jobs. The figure of £20 million is excessive.  I do not see how the NDC would not get involved in the difficulties of the semi-State companies it was suggested would be under their control.  The Minister is to be complimented on his speedy action in introducing this proposal.  If the motion by the Opposition helped to speed that along then it has done some good, but in my view it amounts to a double think.  I do not think Fine Gael were committed to a National Development Corporation because yesterday Deputy Collins did not spell out in any detail how the corporation would function in 1982.  I look forward to the NEA operating.  I will keep a close watch on their workings and I will be putting forward some progressive and positive recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that a member of the Government party should regard as acceptable an allocation of £20 million to help meet our unemployment problem.  It is extraordinary that he even went further and stated that he regarded £5 million for the NEA as being the right amount in present circumstances.  If we are to assess the merits of the NDC and the NEA on the amount of money the Government intend putting into them there is no doubt that the NDC would win hands down.  However, other factors have to be taken into consideration.  If <Col N="437" /> the Government are to take non-economic considerations into their reasoning behind an input of a meagre £5 million, then it is indicative of niggardliness in regard to expenditure and a lack of commitment on the part of the Government that this enterprise agency will really do the job that needs to be done.  Let the House not doubt that special measures are needed at present to meet a deplorable situation which is becoming dramatically worse week by week.  If anybody were told in mid-1977 that the number of unemployed by mid-1982 &mdash; only five years later &mdash; would have escalated from the then figure of 85,000 to approximately 140,000 in all probability it would not be believed but such is the deplorable state now reached.  It is more remarkable that young people feature at an increasing rate in the unemployment figures. That is where the sadness is involved.</P>
      <P>In 1981 the Department of Labour were notified of redundancy at a figure which showed an increase of 20 per cent on that notified in 1980.  So, special measures are needed quickly because time is of the essence in this matter.  In more normal times which we had in the past couple of decades we could look at the structural effects existing in our industrial make-up, at the effects that perhaps a rate of inflation which was getting a little out of hand was having, at the effects which a recession in the terms of the sixties or even up to the mid-seventies which was limited in terms and theories would have on employment and the number being made redundant.  We have not now the leisure of normal times to go into this matter.  If we were to attempt to do so it would involve a study of the nature of these structural defects, what is needed to be done with many of our present manufacturing enterprises which have obsolete equipment as well as in many cases, obsolete ideas: one would need time to study and to plan adaptation in all those industries to ensure that everything was brought up to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An example of an industry which a couple of years ago was hailed with great expectations is the electronics industry. We can now read between the lines of various reports emanating from that <Col N="438" /> industry in this country that alarm signals are being sent up.  I had a case in my own constituency of an electronics firm not being in a position to carry out the necessary research and development to update their ideas and bring out more advanced equipment.  Particularly in the electronics field we find products becoming obsolete and out of date after six months in existence.  That means that a considerable input of money is needed to enable these factories to update equipment and products and carry out the necessary research.  Time is not on our side in this matter.  We know from experience how long it has taken us to investigate structural defects, to plan and implement what has to be done and provide the necessary money.  If the structural defects situation cannot be examined in the times we have and in the circumstances surrounding 140,000 unemployed &mdash; a number which is increasing by approximately 20,000 per annum &mdash; we find there is something else we must consider.  I refer to a report by the Northern Ireland Economic Council recently issued.  While it is in the context of Northern Ireland and the UK it has a certain relevance here. Although we have been able to congratulate ourselves over past decades that our rate of unemployment in this part of the country is not as high as in the Six Counties, we know from our experience over the past five years since 1977 with our escalated figures that we cannot be complacent any longer.  The Northern Ireland Economic Council report said that without special measures youth unemployment would rise to 60 per cent in the UK by the end of 1983 and that the outlook for Northern Ireland was even more serious. Youth unemployment at 60 per cent of the total unemployment figure &mdash; here we are talking about school leavers who go out from their studies with expectations and anticipations and the hope of finding jobs and so fulfilling their first dream in adult life.  We find that a figure of 60 per cent of the unemployment would be represented by school leavers.</P>
    <P>The report was quite modest where it said that unfulfilled expectations led to apathy and alienation.  I believe we have seen here evidence of apathy.  In the 1981 <Col N="439" /> general election, after the four-year period in which the unemployment figure escalated from 85,000 to about 125,000 in the middle of last year, on the doorsteps we found apathy creeping into the minds and attitudes of young people and their parents regarding success in finding positions.  In the 1982 general election I found it extraordinary that not only was there apathy but it was practically accepted that a high level of unemployment could be the norm for years to come.  That has social implications and consequences of such a massive nature that it needs to be tackled urgently.</P>
    <P>The other factor of alienation to which the Northern Ireland report referred has even more horrifying prospects if unemployment is not brought down.  Alienation means that young people and the unemployed withdraw mentally from the society in which they live, become almost hostile to it.  That breeds violence and civil disturbance, things we cannot be complacent about.  As we have seen, the horrifying increase in unemployment in Northern Ireland can now be repeated in this part of the country to the same extent unless the problem is tackled.</P>
    <P>The EEC issued a report in the past month in reference to the poverty situation within the EEC.  How sad it is to read that in the matter of household poverty Ireland has only Greece below it in the table.  I have no doubt that there is now acceptance that unemployment could be expected to be the norm for all those leaving school and all who try to obtain entry to the work force.  We had better face up to the social implications involved.  That is why special measures are needed.  That is what this debate is all about and not whether the development corporation would do a better job than the National Enterprise Agency or whether £20 million would do a better job than £5 million.  These are meagre amounts to meet a horrifying situation.</P>
    <P>In normal times we could accept as reasons for increasing unemployment international recessions.  These could be regarded as a contributory factor just as the worldwide recession can be regarded as contributing to the present sad situation <Col N="440" /> but the problems recessions present for this country are aggravated by the fact that recessions now seem to run into each other much quicker than ever before in the history of capitalism.  One recession is only interrupted by a short interval of prosperity &mdash; if one could call it that, not to mention a boom period &mdash; when another arrives.  A boom period is something that is almost gone out of our economic terminology.  I know it has been verbalised lately but we should not pay too much attention to mere verbalising about a boom.  If a recession is followed very quickly by another recession, in an interval too short for an economy to prosper and save up reserves by putting sufficient money aside for the wet day when it comes the difficulties then confronting this small country will be more numerous and worse than those presented to the stronger democracies.  We are not able to cushion the effects of the subsequent recession.  In the seventies it was very difficult to find any period of more than 12, or 18 months at the most, which showed any sign of affluence or upswing sufficient to enable us to put by sufficient for the bad times which were always nearer than hitherto.</P>
    <P>Regarding the rate of inflation, if we were talking about an inflation rate akin to other countries or slightly in excess of them, we could say that we had factors to compensate for our high rate of inflation so that foreign industrialists would still find this country attractive for investment. When we had a rate of inflation approximating to Britain's, as most of our trade is still with Britain, we could cope.  We are, however, moving into an area where our rate of inflation, at about 20 per cent, compares very unfavourably with the 6 or 8 per cent in EEC countries and in the UK of only 12 per cent.  How stands our excessive reliance for trade on the UK, with our almost double rate of inflation?  The gulf is so big that the consequences in competitiveness are not hard to envisage.</P>
    <P>We cannot act as if times were normal. We are suffering from the temporary effects of recession.  We cannot deal with the structural defects of our industrial make-up because the times are not <Col N="441" /> appropriate to give sufficient thought, study, preparation and planning to bring about structural improvements.  If our rate of inflation has gone berserk <i>vis-à-vis</i> that of our competitors, then there is need for special measures &mdash; and that is what this debate is all about, whether under the aegis of the development corporation or any other body.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that the State and semi-State authorities have not been doing their work; they have been working very hard since their establishment 30 or 40 years ago, or even in the last five years. The Industrial Development Authority have done tremendous work in attracting foreign investors and encouraging our own people to set up small enterprises. The authority have been very cautious in regard to risk ventures and we have ample experience of one which failed in Northern Ireland.  We can thank the authority for not hanging that millstone around our necks.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Credit Corporation have, to the extent of their ability, provided funds necessary for investment purposes. Fóir Teoranta have stood by as a rescue agency when the need arose.  Our State and semi-State concerns which employ considerable manpower have now developed such skills and expertise that they can go outside the confines of this country and earn money by professional advice and consultancy services abroad.</P>
    <P>Private companies are to be congratulated for their work, particularly those which have expanded in difficult times in the past.  Special tribute must be paid to large private companies which have engaged in joint ventures at considerable risk and for whom, perhaps, the outcome may not be all that satisfactory.  We have had the example of Fieldcrest recently. We have had the Buy Irish Campaign, the import substitution programme by the Industrial Development Authority, some local development companies set up on the initiative of, and at the risk of, many local people in many parts of the country to try to attract small and large industry to their areas, to use the development companies as a pressure group, if nothing else, to try to attract industry <Col N="442" /> under the aegis of the IDA.  We have had various Governments either initially establishing considerable taxation incentives or providing very considerable adaptation grants.</P>
    <P>The figures are proof that while commendable efforts have been made &mdash; and tribute must be paid to all these bodies &mdash; not enough, unfortunately, has been done to keep pace with job losses.  That is what we are talking about tonight, about what extra needs to be done and what is the best way of tackling these increasing job losses.  A new growth incentive is obviously needed in the Irish economy.  It was that need which made the Coalition Government in their short time in office introduce two measures, firstly, the National Development Corporation and, secondly, the Youth Employment Agency, the Development Corporation, through an initial capital allocation of £20 million to enable the State on its own or through a joint venture to directly create productive jobs.  It is in these productive jobs that our salvation lies.</P>
    <P>The Youth Employment Agency were established on the experience of the last five years where young people were given work experience tasks and found them so satisfactory that in many instances they moved on to other jobs in three or six months, or else moved into a permanent position which their employer decided at the time was warranted.</P>
    <P>My only reservation regarding the Youth Employment Agency is that greater emphasis should be placed on youth training, particularly in the sense of acquiring skills and crafts.  We have had experience where three or four weeks' or two months' work was given to young people levelling, cutting grass and so on on the roadside.  That is no good to those people.  It only curbs their initiative and creates disillusionment in young minds.  A greater emphasis should be given to their training in skills and crafts rather than employing them for employment's sake.</P>
    <P>In re-activating the National Enterprise Agency and killing off the National Development Corporation the present Government have taken a step and, going <Col N="443" /> on what the previous speaker said, I am not so sure that sufficient thought has been given as to why the National Development Corporation are inadequate and the National Enterprise Agency will do a better job.  The outgoing Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism last night said that there was sufficient documentary evidence to show that the National Enterprise Agency, when it existed a year or so ago, was not adequate for the task in mind.  Why, therefore, are the present Government killing off the National Development Corporation? There have to be good reasons for this. Last week the Taoiseach referred to developing a national plan.  If a national plan were to solve the problem, they would have been solved long ago.  The national plan is a waste of time.  It is necessary that a plan should be produced quickly and the Government of the day should have the courage to implement it. If we are going to indulge, for the term of this Government, in talking about £5 million being an adequate amount in present circumstances to get such an agency off the ground and to have some effect on unemployment figures, we may be talking about such things too late in the day.</P>
    <P>It all comes down in the end to what the Government's economic strategy is. Economic strategy is also the key to this problem.  Is that strategy one of tackling inflation to make our goods more competitive in other EEC countries, especially Britain?  Is it a strategy of pumping in more borrowed money to create jobs? If you tackle inflation on its own you will be more competitive, there may be a short-term price to pay but the long-term benefit will be that inflation will be reduced.  We cannot afford the situation to continue where our inflation stays high while inflation in other countries is falling. If the strategy is to pump in more borrowed money, you can fuel inflation and create jobs but the temptation is always to create jobs at a quick rate to justify excessive borrowing in the short term.  Jobs which are created on borrowed money are always at grave risk of dying off very quickly once the products <Col N="444" /> come on the market at an uncompetitive rate.</P>
    <P>The outgoing Government have left two matters for the present Government to act on.  Perhaps it was for spiteful or for other reasons that they killed off the National Development Corporation.  I hope the Youth Employment Agency is allowed to survive.  I would be horrified if either of those planks was thrown out for other than economic reasons because economics will solve our unemployment problem.  I ask Fianna Fáil to think again about the National Enterprise Agency because the amount of money they are devoting to it is not indicative of a full commitment on their part.  Money is crucial in the whole matter of solving unemployment. We should remember America in the thirties and what the American Government had to do at that stage. People should be engaged on productive work, that is the important thing.  We should not kill the incentive which is in the minds of young people.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable reservoir of talent in skills and crafts at local level which the Government can tap.  There is always a greater pride in a community being able to develop and create some small manufacturing unit rather than depending on the IDA to provide it.  It is a confidence which emanates from fulfilling something oneself, which can be contagious and have beneficial side effects.  The Government should encourage the establishment of small community development companies, either private or limited.  They could be made non-profit making under their articles of association.  If they need some form of assistance to purchase a site or epuipment, and if the Government are assured that that local development company are acting with skill and talent and are interested only in creating jobs, then they should contribute some financial aid to such development companies, private or limited, as long as the community feels an involvement in them and that they can see at first hand the work which is being undertaken.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to reconsider their decision to axe the National Development Corporation.  It has been plainly <Col N="445" /> obvious over the last decade that all the outstanding work which has been done by the IDA and the other promotion agencies is not enough in the present difficult times.  The NDA was established by the Coalition Government as embracing the special measures which could be provided to meet unemployment which has such difficult social implications for us, even terrifying in aspects unless it is curbed very quickly.  We can see increasingly the social effects of unemployment. Responsible persons have admitted that unemployment is adding to violence and creating difficulties which were not seen before.  The Government should provide more money to solve unemployment and to treat it as an urgent priority and not as something which £5 million can be allocated to for 1982.  It is plainly an inadequate amount.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get to the heart of the matter by pointing out the reason why the Government wish to have the National Enterprise Agency as opposed to the National Development Corporation.  It is not simply a matter of the name of this body.  We are not quibbling about what it is called. Our aim is to provide work for young people and to do it in a dynamic way. What is the difference between the National Development Corporation and the agency which the Government are going to set up?  The National Development Corporation which was proposed by the outgoing Government was intended to be a supervisory body, a stewarding body, another layer on top of the plethora of layers which we already have supervising people who work.  It was quite clearly envisaged by the outgoing Government that this would supervise the nine State companies which are mentioned. It was said it would invest funds through the Minister for Industry and Energy in existing State enterprise.  It would hold the shares of existing State companies, it would develop the strategies of State-sponsored bodies and exercise a supervisory role over the activities of the State enterprises involved.  The last thing we need at present is to delude <Col N="446" /> ourselves into thinking that we can set up another supervisory body.  We already have State boards looking after these State organisations.  Why do we need another layer, another Government appointed board suddenly to supervise all the State-sponsored bodies?  We would have the Government supervising the National Development Corporation which the Coalition wish to set up, that body supervising the boards of the State companies, the boards of the State companies supervising the management and the management supervising the workers. It is a magnificent structure but it takes away totally from what we are trying to do for our people.  Our objective is to provide jobs and not just jobs for the boys on State boards: we must provide jobs for the people.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I had no time for the National Development Corporation which sought simply, as stated in the handout of the previous Government, to supervise the activities of State enterprises. The last thing we need is another supervisory body.  Our choice is between a supervisory, bureaucratic type of organisation and the agency which this Government propose, which is a more commercial, more flexible venture-capital type of organisation which unashamedly would pick up areas that might have been overlooked by the State companies, to try to get a better commercial return out of them.  When we talk about commercial returns, profits, we do not talk about them for their own sake.  We are talking about profits for the benefit of the people.  For too long making a profit here was something to be looked down on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the view that we should encourage our State companies to make surpluses. It is then a matter for the Government to decide how the surpluses will be utilised, but before we start distributing all those profits let us get down to making some.  We can then help the people of the country.  The simple alternative to surpluses is deficits and that means that taxpayers' money must be paid out continuously.  That is what would have happened if the National Development Corporation had been imposed on us &mdash; more bureaucracy, <Col N="447" /> more deficits and more money extracted from the State purse.</P>
    <P>Although the National Development Corporation had a nice aim, to make State companies more commercial, I do not believe that it would do that by itself. If you want to make State enterprises commercial you must talk to the boards of those companies and tell them to get their companies properly organised, but do not set up another body to do it.  It is in that area that the agency proposed by the Government would get to work.</P>
    <P>The proposed National Development Corporation among other things would have had to take up some of the losses of State companies.  They would have to take on board responsibility for all the borrowing of those companies.  In such circumstances how could such a corporation provide new jobs?  Most of its time would be taken up sorting out the difficulties of State boards and attracting new capital to provide jobs for the people?  It was bad thinking even to suggest for a moment that such a corporation could do that.  The corporation, as proposed, would have been tied down completely with the job of sorting out State companies, dealing with the banks and generally trying to bail the State companies out instead of concentrating on what the Government are now trying to do through the National Enterprise Agency.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this agency is to try to create some jobs.  Our preference for such an agency is not because we think its name sounds better.  The agency will start afresh, it will attract some capital from the financial institutions because of the return it will offer and in that way it will provide the capital to create the badly needed jobs throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to make some suggestions to the Minister.  It is important that we consider what the new body could do by way of planning.  There are many companies throughout the country who would like to see a plan for each sector so that each company can decide where its future lies.  The agency must also consider specially our marketing structures because at the end of the day, we can cod ourselves all we like, if companies do not <Col N="448" /> sell abroad then the companies cannot survive and the jobs must go.  Although CTT do a good job, there is still a huge job to be undertaken in the marketing area.  The agency must also participate in the youth programme.</P>
    <P>Put youth, enterprise and capital together and see what it will give us.  I cannot foresee any conflict of interests between the IDA and the new agency. The IDA are a grant giving promotional body whereas the agency will be a development and venture capital body.  To some extent its role would be that of the merchant bank except, of course, that it would have a far more social conscience, nevertheless determined to enter the marketplace with a commercial outlook, having attracted the capital from the financial institutions and ultimately sponsoring projects which will be profitable for the people.  I am not speaking about projects which will take a few people off the unemployment list, because they are not real jobs.</P>
    <P>The spirit behind the agency will be to rekindle the element of venture enterprise which we so desperately need. People can talk all they like about redistributing wealth and looking after the less well-off, but we must first of all create the wealth.  It is only in that way that we can fulfill our social obligations.  As I have said, we have a million young people in education, there are 700,000 people on social welfare, there is a State sector which is growing daily, and at the end when you look at the Irish economy, you must come to the inescapable conclusion that the country needs a dose of venture enterprise, and I am not worried about whether that comes from the State, semi-State or private sector.  If we do not get that venture enterprise we all go down together.  The aim of the agency must be to foster that enterprise and to attract private funds for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The agency proposed by Deputy Reynolds will get its funds mainly from the private sector, whereas my understanding of the proposal in regard to the development corporation was that they would begin with a golden handshake from the State.  That has the implication that when they had spent the first £20 million they <Col N="449" /> would come back looking for more. Could one expect the big financial institutions to invest in any kind of operation which had around its neck a number of State enterprises with very heavy borrowings, heavy losses?  The body proposed by the previous Government could not attract private funds because commercial institutions would not invest in such a body.</P>
    <P>There is one other place that that money could be got.  It would have to come from the Government, from the pockets of the taxpayers.  That is a nice cosy operation and it bows the knee to the various philosophies but it does not provide the jobs we need.  More dangerously, it does not provide the kind of investment opportunities which our financial institutions need.  The major financial institutions, the merchant banks, are tending to let the venture capital of this country flow out of it not because they want to do it but because the opportunities for investing here have been getting smaller by the day.</P>
    <P>What we are trying to do in this agency is to give the major financial institutions and the merchant banks and all the people who today hold the capital in this country a real opportunity of investing Irish money in Irish organisations to provide jobs for Irish people.  If an agency like this does not provide that investment opportunity, how can one blame the financial institutions with the heavy funds to invest putting them into property or into foreign funds?  Of course they do that because that is where they get the return.</P>
    <P>This is not just a semantic argument about names for an organisation.  It is a fundamental difference of opinion between the kind of corporation proposed by the outgoing Government and the one which we are now proposing.  To illustrate that, it is proposed that the development corporation or association would get £20 million from the State.  Our proposal is to give them £5 million to start and send them out into the market place to pick up these private funds and in doing so to get moving in this country a very strong enterprise agency which, as it makes surpluses and opens up job <Col N="450" /> opportunities, will surely attract more and more private funds.  If it is not attracting private funds we have to question whether it is worth having because the day it stops attracting private funds is the day it will become a white elephant.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the enterprise agency is the way forward because of the openings which it gives financial institutions, because of its potential to create jobs, because it is a genuine commercial organisation and not just another super layer of Government organisation through which files will pass up and down from the Government to the development corporation, to the semi-State companies, to the board of directors until we are all blue in the face.  That sort of thing will not provide the new jobs and I want to stress that because that point has not come out as strongly in this debate as it should have.</P>
    <P>I want to ask our financial institutions and our banks to reconsider their policy in regard to lending.  It is all very nice and safe for the commercial banks to lend money for nice cosy commercial enterprises in accordance with the old definition of a bank: &ldquo;I will lend you money if you can prove you do not need it&rdquo;.  That is what the banks are inclined to do.  If a company has already made huge surpluses on a previous investment they are ready to lend money.  But they must follow the United States example in this regard and put aside more and more funds to put into Irish venture capital, Irish enterprise capital.  If the State puts in some initial amount and the banks can leave aside some of their funds from the cosy lending for the venture lending and we can get our young people mobilised, then we will have a real opportunity to provide jobs for our young people.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by restating what I said at the beginning.  The difference between these two bodies is not just simply in the name it is called or that because we did it it is better than what the Coalition Government did.  I am not interested in that kind of politics.  I am interested in providing jobs for 45,000 young people who are outside this door today in the streets, who have not got work. We can do that in two ways.  We can do <Col N="451" /> it by providing the enterprise and the initiative, by providing private funds with a State lead, or we can do it by adding in another layer of superstructure on top of the creaking State machine which is already over-burdened and cannot take much more.  I suggest that the enterprise agency as proposed by the Minister, Deputy Albert Reynolds, is the way to do it.  It is the only sensible thing to do and we should get on with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I spoke about the development within the Irish economy since the foundation of the State and how this party supported the development of a mixed economy where private enterprise was allowed to succeed, to prosper and to develop and given every encouragement to do so.  At the same time this party supported State investment in enterprises which were needed.  I instanced some of them, such as the ESB.  So, we are firmly committed to the concept of a mixed economy in which we have private enterprise and in which the State plays an active part.</P>
      <P>Obviously that intervention is important not only from the point of view of ensuring infrastructural development and establishing essential supplies but also in the context of attaining full employment to which everyone in this House aspires.  I indicated the recent developments within the economy and indeed outside the economy which have given rise to the increasing and unacceptable level of unemployment which began with the first oil crisis of 1973-74 and has continued since and has done great damage to the fabric of industry and to the base of taxation and public finance.</P>
      <P>We are now facing a crisis in Government. There is also a crisis outside this House in industry, and that includes agriculture.  There can be no doubt that the international recession which has become very evident in the past two or three years has been the main cause of many companies failing and has been the main cause of loss of markets with the consequent rise in unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also instanced the domestic pressures <Col N="452" /> on the monetary system which has caused our inflation rate to be substantially in excess of the inflation rates of the other member states of the EEC, and that our own inflation rate has been primarily induced by excessive Government expenditure which has caused pressures within the monetary system and has led to a very high rate of inflation within the economy, and that this is very serious especially for private enterprise.  This has also brought great strain on the Government themselves in so far as it has become difficult for them to finance their services both within the Departments and in the semi-State bodies.  We have seen an unfortunate development from the point of view of the long-term development of this nation and I am sure that the Minister for Industry and Energy who has recently taken up office is by now only too well aware of the crisis facing industry as I was in my short term in that Department.</P>
    <P>It is because we have a crisis and because the efforts of the IDA and other State agencies to attract new industry here have not been very successful in achieving the level of job creation necessary to meet the requirements of a rapidly growing population that a new initiative is required.  It is because of the crisis of unemployment and the crisis within industry that a new initiative is needed. The National Development Corporation are being put forward by us as a measure of confidence in the economy to prosper and in an effort to harness the vast resevoir of expertise which is available within the public service.  By the public service I mean not only State Departments but also State bodies which are effective in the trading and commercial sectors.</P>
    <P>Last night I mentioned the consultancy activities of the ESB.  That is a very small instance but it is important because it mirrors the ability of State companies to expand and create new services and employment.  It is possible that State trading bodies could play a greater role in the development of our economy.  I reject the comments made in the House yesterday afternoon by the Taoiseach when he said in relation to his visit to America that the occasion was &ldquo;to endeavour to repair the economic and <Col N="453" /> social damage done by Deputy FitzGerald, Deputy Michael O'Leary and Deputy Kelly&rdquo;.  He went on to say that the Coalition Government, as far as the United States was concerned, could only be described as national sabotage.</P>

      <P>It is most inadequate as a source of funds for any new major industrial initiative.  I listened with interest to Deputy Brennan.  His contribution was, by and large, constructive.  He mentioned the fact that the funds for the NDC were initially to be from the State side whereas the NEA funds were to come from private sources.  There would be nothing to prohibit the NDC from seeking funds in the private sector on any future occasion.  The initial capital input would be from the Government.  It would <Col N="455" /> be immediate and would be very useful in giving it a start.  There would be no prohibition on the NDC seeking funds in the private sector.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also mentioned the question of a supervisory layer which he was not able to support.  Yesterday the Minister said that the Government were committed to reviewing the operation of the commercial State-sponsored bodies and in particular would be seeking and supporting viable diversification proposals by these bodies in the growth areas of the economy.  The best and most efficient way of carrying out this review and ensuring viable diversification would be through the NDC, which would have statutory powers to carry out such a review. That can only be an on-going function if a supervisory role is given to the NDC. The Deputy missed this on-going aspect of the corporation's work.  It is a pity he omitted to deal with it.  The NDC will not lead to more deficits in State bodies.  Neither will it be the function of the corporation to take on lame ducks <i>ad lib.</i></P>

      <Col N="456" /> Deputy Lawlor was present last night when I said that the Government had a deep responsibility to review the activities of State bodies to ensure that they are efficient and not loss-making and that where there is a social content in their activities this should be identified and separated from their commercial activities.</P>
    <P>I am putting forward the National Development Corporation on behalf of my party as a major initiative in securing the expertise that is available within the public service in bringing about new initiatives within the industrial sector.  It is needed because we have not been able to create sufficient jobs for our young population.  It is also evident that the efforts of the IDA are falling short in their job creation function.  It is for this reason that we need a new initiative.  The suggestions put forward by the Minister yesterday are not sufficient.  They are lacking in commitment to an initiative.  It is only a window-dressing exercise on behalf of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason a person (details supplied) in Dublin who has three young children has been refused a deserted wife's allowance; and if he is aware that although she was unsuccessful in a District Court action she is in fact a deserted wife.</P>

      <P>An appeals officer has recently allowed the appeal of the person concerned against the decision of a deciding officer refusing her deserted wife's allowance benefit.  Deserted wife's benefit has therefore now been granted to her with effect from 30 January 1981 at the maximum rate for a woman with two dependent children.  An increase in respect of her third child will be paid as soon as the required birth certificate has been produced.</P>
      <P>A pension order book with orders payable from 25 March 1982 has been sent to the designated post office for collection by her and she has been notified accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrears due from 30 January 1981 will <Col N="370" /> be paid shortly when adjustment has been made for the dependants' portion of unemployment payments and for supplementary welfare allowance paid to her since then.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will indicate in relation to the decision to locate a waste disposal centre at Brownsbarn, Baldonnell, County Dublin (a) whether the necessary land had been purchased and, if so, the price and (b) the discussions, if any, that took place between his Department and Dublin County Council.</P>

      <P>The site in question will be used as a waste collection and treatment centre, and will not be used for the disposal of waste.  The site of 13.6 acres has been purchased for £150,000 by the National Building Agency, which will be responsible for carrying out the necessary development works when plans have been prepared.  There were no formal discussions with the county council but the project is subject to planning permission being obtained, and application for such permission will be made in due course.</P>

      <P>The detailed deployment of members of the Force and the precise allocations of official transport to be made to individual areas from time to time are matters to be decided primarily by the Garda authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the upward trend in the incidence of crime and vandalism in the Tallaght area is a matter of particular concern and special measures have been taken to deal <Col N="371" /> with the situation through the use of additional patrols and the services of the Crime Task Force which is based at Garda Headquarters and is called out to supplement the local policing arrangements in any area of the Dublin Metropolitan Area as the need arises.  The local Garda service is also augmented by plainclothes patrols operated by the Special Task Force.</P>
    <P>The current Garda strength at Tallaght is the maximum that can be provided at present having regard to overall resources and other demands on Garda services, but the question of increasing the strength at the centre will be further considered by the Garda authorities according as the additional manpower at present in training becomes available for assignment.  There are no proposals at present for the allocation of additional official transport to the centre but the matter will be kept under review.</P>
