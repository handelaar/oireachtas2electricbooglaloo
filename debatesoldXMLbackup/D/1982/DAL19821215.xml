      <P>I recommend Deputy John Ryan to the House, of which he has been a Member since 1973.  Since that time all will agree he has acquired the reputation of being a hard working, diligent and most efficient Deputy.  I am sure he is held in high esteem by all parties, irrespective of political divide.  It gives me pleasure to nominate Deputy J. Ryan.</P>

      <P>Molaimse Séamus Ó Tonnaí mar Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I would like to propose Deputy Jim Tunney for the post of Leas-Cheann Comhairle. There is no need for me to extol the virtues and attributes of Deputy Tunney. He has acted as Leas-Cheann Comhairle and in his occupancy of that position has won the admiration and respect of every Member of the House.  He has all the personal attributes necessary to give a first-class performance as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  In addition, he has the necessary experience.</P>
      <P>I might suggest that, in view of the atmosphere which we succeeded in generating here yesterday on the occasion of the change-over from one Government to another and the various statements and appeals made for a more constructive approach to our problems in this new Dáil and greater co-operation between the parties, we should now, in that spirit, revert to the old situation where the Ceann Comhairle usually came from the Government side of the House and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle from the Opposition.</P>
      <P>I readily acknowledge that on a couple of occasions recently, beginning with the Coalition Government of which Deputy Liam Cosgrave was Taoiseach, the situation altered and subsequently the Fianna Fáil Government under Taoiseach Jack Lynch followed that precedent. Perhaps this would be the time to reinstate the old tradition.  I believe that it would make for a much more efficient and effective transaction of our business and would promote a far better spirit of co-operation among the parties and here in the House if, on this occasion, a Member of the Opposition, Deputy Jim Tunney, were acceptable as Leas-Cheann Comhairle, particularly in view of the fact that he is such an outstanding person in himself and a Deputy who has all the necessary qualifications for the appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to intervene in this debate on this motion. However, I feel it my duty to express my dismay at this attempt by the Government to grab the position of Leas-Cheann <Col N="63" /> Comhairle.  It had been the accepted practice in this House over the years that where the post of Ceann Comhairle went to the Government, the post of Leas-Cheann Comhairle went to the Opposition. Regrettably, that rule was broken in 1973 but in 1981, by my casting vote, and again in 1982, I succeeded in restoring the balance in the interests of fair play.</P>
      <P>I am rather surprised that the Taoiseach fails to appreciate the importance of this.  He spoke yesterday of his need to secure the co-operation of the Opposition. I was very heartened by his words, as I was by the response of the Leader of the Opposition.  To win that co-operation now, as the Taoiseach seeks, he must show a magnanimity becoming a statesman, withdraw this motion and allow the Opposition to take the post of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I appreciate that what I am asking would pose very great problems for the Taoiseach, party-politicalwise, but what a wonderful way it would be to start off this new Dáil.  To withdraw this motion now would not be a display of weakness on his part but would make it clear that he is a big man, magnanimous and sincere in his desire to secure the co-operation of the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great regard and respect for Deputy John Ryan.  I was a close colleague of his when I was a member of the <Col N="64" /> Labour Party and I mean no disrespect to him in my plea to day to the Taoiseach. After all, Deputy Ryan could be given a junior Ministry.  With regard to Deputy Jim Tunney, I want to make it absolutely clear that this is not a plea on his behalf, but a question of the principle of fair play.  Members on both sides of the House will agree with me that there was no occupant of that chair more impartial as Leas-Cheann Comhairle than Deputy Tunney.  The Taoiseach need have no fears on that score.  There is a principle involved and a very important one.  We have consistently condemned the Unionists in Northern Ireland for their refusal to share in situations such as this, and the Taoiseach himself has been most vociferous on this point.  I would ask him now, in a very special plea, to consider seriously what I have said and prove to the country that he is the great statesman that so many of us believe him to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Tomás Mac Giolla Mr. Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support that plea, on the basis that it was a long-established procedure which worked well in the past.  For various reasons, it was altered and it is appropriate now to revert to the previous practice. I would ask the Taoiseach to agree to restoring the original practice and withdrawing the motion.</P>

      <P>Items Nos. 4, 5 and 6 are standard items gone through in the course of the last three Dálaí.  I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach on his appointment. We had an undertaking in the last Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and between the Whips, that these would be dealt with as part of Dáil reform. Following yesterday's announcement that the Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy Bruton will have special responsibility for Dáil reform, I wonder will Dáil reform now be excluded from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges <Col N="70" /> or will the Minister for Industry and Energy be a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges?  I might ask further will the work done to date, including all the documents prepared by all parties, including Independents, be discussed or will it now be dealt with separately? We have done a lot of work.  We have contacted other Parliaments.  We have examined the Committee system, we had gone through the new Minister for Industry and Energy's two documents, and the third Fine Gael document and taken submissions from a number of other people.  Will that process be continued through the medium of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, will there be a new committee, or will the new Minister for Industry and Energy be a member of the new committee if and when set up?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister of State consider proposing to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that the Orders of the House be amended in such a way as to permit, on Fridays, when normally the House sits, that no questions be taken but that Private Notice Questions be taken, because it came to be established in the last Dáil, and perhaps the one before that, that no matter what matter of urgency might arise between the time the Dáil rose on Thursday and the following morning or mid-day, the rule which precluded questions on Friday was interpreted in such a way as to exclude even Private Notice Questions for which an urgent reason might have existed.  There is a fair distinction between a Private Notice Question of that sort and questions of the ordinary kind where no great issue arises if they are left for a few days.</P>

      <P>We are agreeing to these.  I should like to make a general point on all the Supplementary Estimates as they are being moved together.  The Supplementary Estimates are for approximately £89 million but, in fact, that does not lead to any excess expenditure overall. What is being done is a rearranging within the subheads of some of the Votes, other Votes have token Estimates while others are giving effect to budgetary provisions. Although the total amounts to £89 million there is not any additional expenditure involved over and above that outlined in the March budget.  The Minister should confirm that before we deal with the individual Votes.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.</P>

      <P>This is a technical Bill which, obviously, having been prepared by myself I agree with.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to the Department of the Environment and I wish him well in his term of office which, hopefully, will be brief.  In wishing him well I can assure him that he will have the assistance of some of the best officials in the public service.  I have no doubt that they will extend to him the same loyalty which they extended to me when I was in charge of that Department. I am delighted to let this Bill go through the House.  Without introducing any note of rancour I should like to take this opportunity to ask the Minister if he will give us some idea of the finance he intends to make available to honour the commitment with regard to the construction of the 30,000 houses which have been mentioned.  I admire the goal of 30,000 houses but, having regard to the constraints of the budget and the constraints of national borrowing and the current budget deficit, will the Minister take this opportunity, without going into too much detail, to tell us where the funds will come from?</P>

There is a question of urgency with the Bill for the reason I have pointed out, that since the Bill was proposed on that date by the then Government and since it had my agreement at that time, I felt, because of the urgency of the matter, it should be on the Order Paper today and that it should be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.</P>

I also want to know why it is necessary to increase the capital of the Agricultural Credit Corporation by one-third at a time when farmers are unable to repay their existing borrowings.

      <P>I indicated earlier that this party were prepared to facilitate the Government in relation to these Bills and we accept their urgency.  I asked the Minister on the Appropriation Bill and on this Bill if he had any Second Stage speech for the information of the House before Deputy De Rossa's intervention. I felt sure a speech should have been provided by the Minister.  These matters could still have been dealt with today as the House can sit for some hours yet.  We are now reaching the last item on the Order Paper and I understand the House will be sitting tomorrow.  We prepared the Bills and we know they are urgent. We wanted them passed on the day of the last Dáil was dissolved but the then Opposition did not accept that they were urgent and would not facilitate the then Government.  It is important that all Deputies should know what is contained in these Bills.  I prepared them and I can accept them but every other Deputy should also know what they contain.  That is normally done by an explanatory memorandum which some of these Bills did not have, or they are explained by a <Col N="86" /> Minister is a Second Stage speech.  The Minister did say a few words by way of introduction but there was no speech circulated which would have taken care of Deputy De Rossa's point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the urgency of the measure in question, the proposal is to increase the borrowing limit of the ACC from £600 million to £800 million. It is not an increase, <i>per se,</i> in the capital of the ACC.  It allows the ACC to borrow up to £800 million rather than the current limit of £600 million and it increases correspondingly the amount of borrowing carried out by the ACC which was guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  It extends the security currently afforded to those who lend to the ACC <i>pari passu</i> with the increase in the corporation's borrowing requirement.</P>
      <P>The ACC are encountering some difficulties at present with regard to the management of the maturity of their deposits because they are getting near the upper limit of what they may borrow. This difficulty is also affecting their lending activities and the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that we do not have those difficulties in relation to the lending activities of the ACC at present because we do not want to see an unnecessary outside restriction of this kind put on the ACC's ability to finance farm credit and development in the agricultural sector.  It is for that reason that the limits are being raised in this manner.  It is necessary to do this now because the corporation are getting near to the limit and if we do not raise it as proposed in the Bill we could soon find ourselves in the situation where the lending activities of the corporation would have to be restricted to deal with the difficulties I have mentioned.</P>

The original Act was brought in to apply for four years in the hope that, after that period, it would no longer be necessary to provide the controls for which the Act provides.  In the intervening period, however, it has been clear for a number of reasons which, of course, have varied from time to time depending on circumstances that it is necessary to maintain these exchange controls so that, for example, we can proceed in the normal course of events without being subject to speculative or uncontrolled movements of currency which could, in certain circumstances, create difficulties for the management of our foreign reserves and the management of overall investment policy within the country.  The Bill provides for a further extension of four years for the provisions of this Act.  It is necessary because, since the last extension in 1978, the situation does not appear to have changed in any way which would justify a different <Col N="88" /> approach to exchange controls or discontinuation of the Act.</P>

      <P>Before you adjourn the Dáil, I must point out that the Government have seriously mishandled today's business.  We have dealt with these pretty routine items, as one would have expected, in a very short time because they are items about which there is no dispute.  As the outgoing Government were responsible for preparing the legislation it could have been anticipated that we would facilitate their passage through the Dáil.  The Government brought us here today to transact this business and no other business and it now appears they are ready to bring the House back tomorrow I understand for the sole purpose of enabling the Taoiseach to announce his Ministers of State.  Surely at this late stage it would be possible for him to come into the House and announce the Ministers of State so that we could adjourn for the Christmas recess and thereby save the taxpayers a very considerable amount of money.  I accept that an incoming Government take a little time to settle down and organise business and we are quite prepared to give then every allowance and facility in that regard but this is going a bit far&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will conclude, but seeing that we were brought here at 2.30 p.m. and that we are about to adjourn at 3.40 p.m.  I think the Chair could spare me a few moments on this important <Col N="89" /> aspect.  We are prepared to be understanding about the problems facing the new Government in getting to grips with the business they have to do in the short time available to them but I think this is absolutely gross mismanagement.  As I said, we have heard a great deal about reform of the Dáil.  With Fine Gael in particular and, to some extent, the Labour Party it has become a major topic and something they are continually advocating but if this is a sample of the sort of reform of the Dáil we are going to have, then we do not want to have any more of it.</P>
      <P>I must protest on behalf of the members of my party.  We are all here today and apparently we are expected to provide the quorum.  I must protest at this mishandling of Dáil business and the way the new Government are treating the House.  At this late stage I suggest that the Chair would adjourn the House for one hour in order to enable the Taoiseach to come to the House and announce his Ministers of State.  Then we could adjourn for the Christmas recess.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> I think the Leader of the Opposition is being rather unfair.  As he is aware, the new <Col N="90" /> Government were elected yesterday and we have tried to deal with the business left over by his Government.  In addition, we found that the Kilkenny Design Workshops Bill, 1982, must be passed before the Dáil goes into the Christmas recess together with the Salmon, Eel and Oyster (Miscellaneous Licences) (Alteration of Duties) Order, 1982, which, has to be dealt with before we go into recess. The reason they were not on the Order Paper is that the Bill in connection with the Kilkenny Design Workshops was not circulated and we were not aware of that until we went into office yesterday. Rather than ask the House to take a Bill that has not been circulated, it was decided to meet tomorrow.</P>
