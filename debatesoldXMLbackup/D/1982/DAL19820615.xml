      <P>On a point of order, there are two matters of order that I should like, with the indulgence of the Chair, to raise.  Both of them bear on the way questions are handled in the House.  I put down a question on 3 June addressed to the Taoiseach asking him if he would outline the role which he personally played with regard to the conduct of foreign relations in the context of the Falkland crisis; and to say under what legal or other authority he was acting.  This morning, at 10.40 a.m. &mdash; 12 days later <Col N="2" />&mdash; I was informed that that question was out of order.  I regard a delay of 12 days &mdash; which would not have been a delay of that length had I not acquiesced in a request from the Taoiseach's Department to postpone the question last week while he was away &mdash; I do not care what the excuse or official reason may be &mdash; as an intolerable delay.  It effectively means that your office &mdash; I do not say with bad faith &mdash; whether or not the Taoiseach's or any other Department is involved I do not know &mdash; is playing cat and mouse <Col N="3" /> with Deputies.  I was too late to put down a rephrased question, to mend my hand in such a way that it would have been answered today; and the best I can now do is to put something down this Thursday for answer next Tuesday; but I do not have any guarantee that I will not be told at 10.40 on the following Tuesday morning that it is out of order.  That is something I feel I must say as a matter of order, and I believe that other Members, whether in the actual or in the prospective Opposition, will agree with me.</P>
      <P>The second matter I should like to raise, although I am not quarrelling with the reasons which you were courteous enough to give me, is that the Chair implied that this question was out of order because the Taoiseach, you said, &ldquo;had no official responsibility to the Dáil in regard to either part of my question.&rdquo; Are we to take it from that &mdash; I do not quarrel with what you are saying &mdash; that a member of the Government, provided he misconducts himself within the ambit of his own Department, can be questioned here; but that if he misconducts himself by interfering with the work of another Department, he is immune from Dáil questioning?  Do I take it that that is what your letter means?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle;</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that there is collective responsibility and the Government are always responsible to the Dáil.  That is what we discussed before.  About the delay with regard to the Deputy's question, I should like to state that it was put down for answer on Wednesday last but, at the direct request of the Department of the Taoiseach, it was postponed by the Deputy until this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>For answer on Wednesday last but it was put down a week before that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>They are processed as rapidly as possible but owing to the very large number of questions I am sure the Deputy will agree that it is not possible to process it sooner.  Indeed, the staff are under great strain at present <Col N="4" /> because there is a shortage.  As a result of the embargo of last September we are not in a position to get the extra staff who are needed.  The Deputy will have to have consideration for the staff with regard to this problem.  I am afraid it is something over which we have no control at present. Certainly, it was not done with any intention to delay processing the question in any way.  I sent the Deputy a letter this morning in which I stated that questions are processed as rapidly as possible but owing to the very large numbers of questions at present being handled some delay is inevitable.  I said that the Questions Office therefore in general processes questions in order of proximity of date of answer.  In the case of the question relating to the Falklands situation the postponement to the following week by the Deputy meant that other questions for answer earlier took priority over it for processing and as a result the letter ruling it out of order only reached the Deputy today.  As a matter of fact, another question tabled by the Deputy for answer at the same time as this question had been processed before this Office was notified of the postponement of questions to the Taoiseach.  The Deputy was notified that it was out of order last week.  That was one submitted by the Deputy at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so; but, with respect, it must be recognised that questions to the Taoiseach of necessity are priority questions, because they are taken every Tuesday and Wednesday.  If I had been told at the time when the gentlemen from the Taoiseach's Department rang me at home in the middle of last week &mdash; I believe on Tuesday or Wednesday &mdash; that the question was out of order, instead of being allowed to suppose that it was still in order by the fact that he asked for it to be postponed, I would still have had time to amend my hand and put down an amended question by Thursday morning in time to be answered today.  I have been deprived of that by the way the system operates; and I am afraid, with respect to the Chair, I do not accept that that is the inevitable way the system works.  I would <Col N="5" /> be grateful for the courtesy of a reaction to the other half of what I raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very annoying for the Deputy that such should have happened but it is something we must bear with for the present time.  I cannot guarantee any improvement on it under the present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Chair recognise that that effectively means &mdash; I accept that there is no bad faith in the situation now &mdash; that if that ever did creep into the situation a Deputy could be indefinitely prevented from raising anything?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only hope that the embargo will be lifted so that we will have the necessary staff to deal with problems such as the Deputy's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest of respect, I appreciate staff difficulties, but even when there are 600 questions we all know that questions from No. 50 onwards will not be taken on a particular day; why then does this pretence apply, of supposing that in terms of urgency of deciding whether they are in or out of order, one question is ranked the same as the other? In regard to the other point which the Chair was kind enough to make in response to what I said a few moments ago &mdash; and I should like to know if it is the case &mdash; that the Government shares a collective responsibility for a situation &mdash; how am I to explore the manner in which they have discharged that responsibility better than by inquiring from the Taoiseach, who makes a virtue and publicity plus for himself, when it suits him, out of pre-empting, moving in on and ursurping the functions which by law, not by convention, are attributable to other members of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That ruling on the question of collective responsibility dates from the start of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is a collective responsibility I submit that it cannot possibly preclude any Deputy here from inquiring about the part personally played by a <Col N="6" /> member of the Government in a particular episode.  The fact that that part has been personally played in a Department other than his own cannot be a reason for making it immune from inquiry here. That is like the lawyer's paradox that it is cheaper to kill a man than to injure him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The rule is that you cannot inquire into relations between Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Deputy will not apply that paradox to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Our questions here are directed to Ministers so that they may be answerable for the area of responsibility allocated to them.  They are so answerable, and in the event of major default a Minister may feel it necessary to resign because of his failure in his own Ministry. That is comparative and parallel with the question of collective responsibility.  That being so, if we hold Ministers responsible individually for their Departments within the overall context of collective responsibility, on what grounds can Ministers not be held responsible when they go outside their Departments?  That seems to introduce a very dangerous principle indeed under which Ministers can avoid responsibility so long as they do other Ministers' work and not their own.  I cannot see that democracy will benefit from pressing that theory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of relations between Ministers and somethings about which we cannot ask questions. There are certain situations of collective responsibility and certain decisions are taken by Ministers in respect of their own Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We can deal with Ministers when they act in relation to their own Departments and they are answerable to us, but it is dangerous in a democratic system if Ministers act outside their own Departments and are not answerable to the House.  That is the principle you seem to be introducing.  We must challenge that if we are to have any <Col N="7" /> concept of answerability of the Government to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a Minister may take on a certain responsibility he would do so at the behest of the Government, he would be answerable to the Government and the Government would accept responsibility for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not talking of that.  We are not talking of the Government asking the Minister to do something. We are talking of a Minister &mdash; in fact the Taoiseach &mdash; undertaking something in an area which is the responsibility of somebody else.  It is a different situation. Is the Taoiseach not answerable for his actions as long as they do not come within the ambit of his own authority?  It is precisely that danger that the country fears at present.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Can we start Question Time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a responsibility which he is not willing to stand over and defend in this House at Question Time.  That is all I have been able to observe from this episode.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I have suggested to the Taoiseach that the impression is getting around, because of <Col N="9" /> the delay, that these are not important appointments and that they may well be a waste of money.  That is not in the interest of the appointments if and when they are made.  Will the Taoiseach agree with that?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Taoiseach's answer that he is thinking of appointing under these two headings particularly the Minister for the status of women.  I ask him to keep in mind that it is very important that this Ministry should exist in view of the fact that he has an all-male Cabinet and that it is incumbent on him to represent 51 per cent of the electors.  Will he accept that having this junior Minister will give him a special insight into and knowledge of the quite dreadful problems that exist in this country for women in view of the fact that Fianna Fáil during their term of office have never been good at legal reform in areas relating to women?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the Taoiseach's concern for women.  I would like to ask him if he would be prepared to exercise a similar and perhaps more pressing concern for the state of the tourism industry in this country which is in very serious decline, substantially attributed by some people to his recent action.  In view of the rapid deterioration in booking and the <Col N="10" /> whole range of other recognised indicators, will he now, irrespective of any other considerations which he may have, appoint forthwith a Minister of State with specific responsibility for the disastrous state of tourism at present?</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> The Deputy will appreciate that such arrangements fall to be made by the local authorities concerned.  I understand that the main streets of Youghal have been partially closed while a combined sewerage and water supply scheme is carried out. This work has necessitated traffic diversions in order that the contractor can work without undue interference.  From 1 June next until September 1982 work on the main streets will be discontinued and they will be re-opened to traffic for the summer season.  Work on the schemes will be confined to the side streets in this period.  I am advised that the traffic diversion, while difficult, does not put any significant extra distance on through traffic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I might elaborate on what I have said because it will include this problem.  I have had no specific recent representations from the Construction Industry Federation concerning the placing of public contracts with Irish firms though that has been the case in the past.  This is a subject matter aired regularly at meetings between the Department and representatives of the industry.  The most recent such meeting was held on 29 April last when it was alleged that the current problems in the industry were being exacerbated by the incidence of Northern Ireland contractors getting public contracts in the South.  The situation in this regard has not deteriorated since early 1981 when an inter-departmental examination was carried out at the request of the Government.  At that time the conclusion drawn was that the level of intervention by Northern contractors in the South was not such as to cause significant problems.  On the other hand, this intervention added an extra element to competition which was to the benefit of public authorities.  If the Deputy has any examples about which he is concerned I shall be happy to investigate them for him.</P>

This is most unfair to Border contractors. It is all right talking about it being all one country but Northern contractors operate under different terms, they have more favourable conditions for transport, fuel and so on.  The Minister may not be aware but I would ask him to bear in mind the fact that social welfare comes into it in some strange way or other, all of it adding up to very unfair competition.</P>

      <P>I am trying to establish if I understand correctly what the Minister has said.  Is it not the case that there is absolute and total confusion on this issue without any idea of coherent policy?  Is it not further the case that there is a wide area of public contracts in respect of which we are not bound by any EEC rules and in respect of which the Minister, if he so wished, could apply the kind of guidelines he has given as being his personal view of how we should do things?</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> The confusion is in the Deputy's mind because I am left in no doubt, as the contents of the reply I have given to the House indicates, that the situation is constantly being examined with a view to the fairest possible competition being provided by firms operating within the State and that they are given the fairest crack of the whip.  I do not believe the Deputy in this question got the point of what I call major contracts.  Major contracts are over a certain value.  I am quite sure the Deputy is aware of that from his EEC experience.  It does not apply in every case so it would be wrong to give that impression to the House.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I wish to refer the Deputy to a reply which I gave on 3 June 1982 to a similar question in relation to the filling of the office of Offaly county manager consequent on the degrouping of Counties Laois and Offaly for management purposes.  As in the case of Offaly, I appointed a person to the office of manager, temporarily, in Laois County Council pending the making of a permanent appointment thereto by the local authority on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners. The degrouping of the two counties became effective on 1 April 1982 and I understand that Laois County Council have forwarded the formal statutory request to the Local Appointments Commissioners requesting them to recommend a person for appointment on a permanent basis to the office of county manager.  An advertisement announcing the competition for the filling of the vacancy on a permanent basis appeared in the national press on Wednesday 5 May 1982.  The arrangements for the selection of a suitable candidate for recommendation to the county council for appointment are matters for the commissioners.</P>

    <P>Departmental responsibility for the Dogs Act, 1906, and the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, rests primarily with the Department of Agriculture and the preparation of proposals for any amendment <Col N="39" /> of these codes would therefore be a matter for that Department.  Neither my Department nor the local authorities have any statutory functions in regard to the licensing or other control of dog numbers and this limits the relevance for my Department of the memorandum referred to. Planning authorities are, however, empowered to assist a body or persons providing homes or shelters for stray or unwanted dogs or cats and my Department operate a scheme of grants for the recoupment to planning authorities of 50 per cent of the expenditure incurred by them on such purposes.  A sum of £75,000 is provided in my Department's Vote to finance this scheme in the current year.  While, therefore, as I have explained, the local authorities do not have a direct responsibility in regard to control of dog numbers, this scheme enables them to play an important supportive role in dealing with some of the problems involved.</P>

      <P>First elected a Member of Dáil Éireann in 1973, he had been a member of Galway County Council since 1969 and vice-chairman of the Galway County Committee of Agriculture.  A founder member of Macra na Feirme in Galway and a national Vice-President for many years, he was also a founder member of the then National Farmers' Association and a member of several other bodies and organisations.</P>
      <P>John Callanan's views on the agricultural industry commanded the widest respect and attention.  He was at all times a fearless champion of farmers' rights, especially the rights of the small farmer. The underprivileged and the less well-off members of society were always his special concern.  Johnny Callanan, as he was affectionately known to us all, was a dedicated public representative, a great Irishman and a true patriot.  He devoted his whole life, tirelessly and unselfishly, to the welfare of his people, who held him in the highest regard and respect, as did every Member of this House.</P>

Everyone in this House enjoyed hearing him speak his mind on many issues and they knew that when he spoke it was his mind he spoke rather than views he felt he had to put forward on behalf of a particular interest or party.  He had a great respect for parliamentary institutions and a single-minded devotion to the cause of agriculture and the people of his own area.</P>

      <P>We welcome the setting up of this joint committee, but we must protest at the continued absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  With all due respect to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, I would like to point out that this is the fifth occasion in the life of the current Dáil when matters relating to foreign affairs have been discussed when the Minister has not been present.  We appreciate that the Minister is abroad on business today, but does he have to be absent on every occasion?  We appreciate that he has a busy schedule but it is very inconsiderate to the Members of the House that he should be missing for every such debate.  There were four in all, and I believe he was also missing for several debates on foreign affairs in the Upper House.  While we welcome the setting up of this committee, we must voice our protest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Deasy in welcoming the establishment of this committee again.  This is a very important committee and its workload is very great. Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond the control of anybody, the last time the committee met was 12 months ago.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind Members of the House of the type of work this committee does and the amount of work that the last committee carried out.  I am privileged to be a member of that committee and to be chairman of its legal affairs section.  The last committee of the second last Dáil had 103 meetings between meetings of the joint committee itself and meetings of its sub-committees.  It published no fewer than 94 reports on an extraordinary range of subjects from energy matters, agricultural matters, consumer affairs, free movement of persons and services in the community, unemployment and work sharing, company law, budgetary matters, transport policy, free competition within the Community, product liability and marketing and fishery policies as well as a wide range of other subjects.  There was an extraordinary amount of work involved in this for members, and Members of this House who look forward to becoming members of that committee should bear in mind that they are really only welcome onto that committee if they are prepared to devote a lot of time to its work.  Because of the enormous workload, after an absence of 12 months it is going to be necessary to spend even more time in the immediate future trying to make up lost ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems of the committee is that a lot of its work is of a technical nature and requires resources that the committee often does not have.  The committee has worked very well, but unfortunately sometimes it has to consider matters that perhaps are not entirely within its competence because of the lack of resources available to it.  One of the last reports published by the last committee was on product liability and on that occasion the proposed directive of the European Commission, if adopted, would have incredible ramifications for our legal system.  Even though the committee <Col N="142" /> enjoyed the benefit of seven lawyers as members of the committee, it was unfortunately not in a position to consider all the ramifications that the directive might have.  At that time members of the committee considered what we could do to employ the resources necessary to consider the far-reaching effects the directive might have if adopted.  Unfortunately we did not have finances available to employ legal consultants; the committee did not have available to it the resources of the Attorney General's office which is there to advise the Government and not the Oireachtas. Here was one example of where a committee felt inhibited in its deliberations on a very important matter.  The House might consider granting to the committee the resources to enable it carry out its functions more fully.  There is a precedent for this in other committees.  The Joint Committee on Semi-State Bodies has financial resources available to it to retain consultants in its work.</P>
    <P>One of the other problems that arises is the power of the committee to summons witnesses before it.  Before mentioning it I should offer thanks and gratitude to all of the people who went to the trouble of making submissions to the committee in the past and indeed coming before the sub-committees and giving evidence to them.  The voluntary effort put in by many interest groups in the commercial field, in the consumer field, in the educational field, in the agricultural field, proved to be of great benefit to the committee.  Indeed, the committee could not have operated effectively without the benefit of the knowledge and information made available to it by outside groups.</P>
    <P>But the committee does not have available to it, if it felt the need, the power to summons witnesses before it.  That is not something that is missed regularly on the committee in the conduct of its affairs, but it is something which the House should bear in mind sometimes places the committee at a disadvantage.  I would ask Members of the House to bear in mind the importance of the committee.  Its function is to report to the Houses of the Oireachtas not only matters which make <Col N="143" /> up the subject of legislation by the European Communities but the acts and decisions and plans of every institution of the European Communities.  It is only through that committee that this House will have available to it reports on such matters.  Members of this House are already too busy themselves to have the time to involve themselves in the minutiae of the hundreds and thousands of proposals that emanate from the European Commission, matters under consideration by the European Parliament.  It is necessary, if this House is to rely on this committee to provide it with proper and up-to-date reports on such a wide range of subjects, that it give the committee the full resources it needs to carry out its functions.</P>
    <P>I should also say that the last committee of the House was only the second one in the history of the joint EEC committee. The first committee, which sat from 1973 until 1977, was confined in its duties to consideration only of proposed directives of the European Community and it reported on its own functions in 1977 and requested the Oireachtas to give it more powers to enable it to act in a more fruitful way for the Oireachtas.  As a result of that the Oireachtas extended the terms of reference of that committee in 1977.  The committee's terms of reference were broadened then and it is proposed that they again be broadened on this occasion to enable the committee to consider matters not directly associated with just the technical legislative end of the European Commission's work.</P>
    <P>I should mention that of the 90 or so reports published by the last committee of the House 15 of those reports were devoted to matters not directly associated with directives but rather concerned policy matters and policy documents published by the European Communities. Some of the reports in this regard include a report on work sharing, a report on energy policy, labour market policy guidelines, community action in the cultural sector, forestry policy, financing in the budget and problems of enlargement of the Community.  I have no doubt but that in the immediate future the new <Col N="144" /> committee is going to have to concern itself with the developments that have taken place in the Community over the past 12 months since the committee last met.  There will have been very many directives published by the European Commission to be considered.</P>
    <P>There have also been some very important developments taking place in the European Communities that this House needs to consider and that the committee will have to consider.  I would like to refer briefly to a couple of these developments which relate to matters of the greatest importance to us.  First of all, developments in regard to the common agricultural policy, and particularly the mandate of 30 May 1980, are of major importance not only to the Irish agricultural industry but to our national economy.  The mandate is now central to the future of the Community and may have very far-reaching effects on the common agricultural policy.  At a time when agricultural incomes have taken such a hammering over the past few years &mdash; although I can see a slight improvement this year &mdash; we need to be very careful that decisions are not taken at European level which will interfere further with that sector.  We also have to bear in mind that in the longer term there is a far more worrying aspect of discussions of the mandate at present &mdash; the proposed cut-backs or limitations in agricultural production.  That is one thing which we cannot under any circumstances tolerate.</P>
    <P>We find ourself in a position where, for all sorts or reasons outside our control, we are a country which is not yet anywhere near attaining full agricultural capacity.  We must consider the risks we took when we joined the European Communities with regard in particular to our industrial sector and the difficulties they had to face by throwing our markets open to foreign industry and foreign sales.  The big benefit we were to gain was supposed to be in the agricultural sector.  Now we are faced with this awful prospect of prehaps having to limit our productive capacity in the agricultural sector.  That is one thing we cannot under any circumstances afford to tolerate.  It is something we will have to fight tooth and nail.  When <Col N="145" /> the day comes and the Irish farmer is told he will have to limit production and cut back on farm development, that will be the day we will have to seriously consider the usefulness of retaining membership of the European Community.</P>
    <P>I will now look at the area of regional and social policy of the Community.  I acknowledge that all Irish Governments since we joined the EEC have stressed the importance of using these policies to eliminate the serious imbalances that exist in different geographic regions of the Community, but we have to seriously question the effectiveness of those policies.  It sticks in my craw to hear the United Kingdom Government, particularly the British Prime Minister, constantly whinging about their problems with the European budget when I see the lack of effectiveness of the regional and social policies in the past several years. There are large parts of the Community which are impoverished when compared with almost any part of the United Kingdom and it is not good enough that a major partner should go on with this type of whinging.</P>
    <P>There are many matters which have to be considered.  So far as our participation in the Community is concerned, this is a time of great trial, and times will get rougher.  There is no doubt that in the heady days of the establishment of the European Communities, and its predecessor bodies, there was a feeling of great importance attached to the reconciliation of the people of Europe and more co-operation socially and economically between the European countries.  Those matters will be put under great threat now because of the economic difficulties with which we are all faced.  It is terribly important that the social policies of the European Communities are borne in mind because they will be of paramount importance in future years.</P>
    <P>The common agricultural policy, which has been of major benefit to this country, is now under attack, and unjustifiably so.  It has achieved its various purposes &mdash; supplying food to all members of the European Communities at reasonable cost and providing farmers with reasonable incomes.  So far as oversupply <Col N="146" /> is concerned, corrective actions taken by the EEC in the past few years have been very effective, so much so that the percentage of the total budget now absorbed by the CAP is a lot less than it was a few years ago.  But we cannot complain about that.</P>
    <P>We have to bear in mind the usefulness of the European Communities in the old sense of reconciliation of the people of Europe and of the importance of co-operation economically and socially.  To do that, the committee will have to be very successful in fulfilling their functions of providing this House with reports on all activities of the EEC so that we may more often discuss happenings in Europe which are of importance to our people. In the difficult times that lie ahead it will be more and more important to highlight to the people what is of value for this country in Europe so that the Irish people will be prepared to take the good with the bad and ensure that in future years the Community can survive economically difficult times and give us all the opportunity to prosper together in the years that lie ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put on record that the Labour Party support this motion.  We are discussing again the motion which was passed by this House and which was returned to us from the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I recognise the belated awareness of some members of the Fine Gael Party, including Deputy Molony, that the EEC was not everything Deputy Garret FitzGerald promised it would be in 1972, particularly in relation to the bonanza for the farming industry.  This committee, and other committees like it, are the only ways parliamentary work of any substance can be done in this House because the set-piece debates we have on the floor of the House do not get behind the real policies and the real issues.  As many Members are aware, I bitterly regretted the fact that this committee was, for a variety of reasons, put out of action for over 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask whoever is responding on behalf of the Government to confirm two things: <Col N="147" /> first, that the inaugural meeting of the committee will take place before the House rises this summer, and secondly, that the Government will maintain the tradition established by the penultimate Coalition Government that the chairperson of the committee shall be from the Opposition side and not the Government side.  The House may recall that Deputy Haughey was the first chairperson of the first Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that I should make my first contribution in this Dáil on the motion to establish the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. Some of the fundamental purposes of this committee will be to ensure that whatever is done at European level is made as relevant as possible at national level, and to ensure that the House, and through the House the members of the public, will be well informed of developments in Europe and, in our capacity as public representatives, to maximise the benefits accruing to Ireland as a member of the European Community.</P>
      <P>When dealing with secondary legislation one can get the impression that one is dealing with a whole range of bureaucratic instruments which, for some reason or other, are engineered by bureaucrats for their own satisfaction.  But it is much more vital than that.  The evidence would suggest that to effectively implement the benefits of membership one has to arrange one's own affairs to maximise those benefits.  I would like to give some examples which might be overlooked. The areas we look to for major developments in the European Community would have been initially argicultural transfers under FEOGA; a second area of great expectation not quite realised would have been the regional fund; and the third area would have been the social fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with the social fund first because it is very important at this stage. In line with the policies proposed by the Commission over the last 12 months in <Col N="148" /> particular, the social fund has increased very considerably.  I do not think it is generally realised that in this year alone the transfers to Ireland from the social fund will be not less than £80 million and last year it was more than £70 million owing to a very major increase in the funds being allocated to Ireland under that instrument.</P>
    <P>It is important that the committee, this House and all responsible at this level ensure that the money is being used effectively and specifically for the purposes for which it was basically intended. Frankly, there is a risk that much of the money could be taken up in administration and that it may to a considerable extent be taken up through public service expenditure.  That is not, of course, the original intention of the fund.  That said, one must acknowledge the role played in this area by the agencies such as AnCO. If we recognise the fundamental need of self-reliance, we must ensure that we do not look at any European funds as being a channel through which we can spend public money rather more easily than would be otherwise possible, having regard to the responsibilities in raising funds at home for public expenditure purposes.</P>
    <P>There is great scope for this committee, under recently proposed policies, to bring a whole new direction to the application of social fund moneys in particular. It is appropriate at this stage that I give only one example of many.  That is in the area of small and medium sized industries.  Hitherto, the social fund has been applied in Ireland in terms of training at what one might call the basic operative level, whether skilled, semi-skilled or non-skilled.  AnCO programmes are being used for employment, re-employment, training and retraining.  However, a gap has appeared, here as elsewhere, in the management area in small and medium-sized industries.  Given the nature of the economy at the moment, it is quite clear that there is a visible, real limit to what we can expect to achieve from external investment in this country.  This derives from two reasons.  Firstly, in the present international economic climate the <Col N="149" /> capacity to invest in other countries is being diminished and, secondly, our capacity to attract external industry is also limited by the budget situation elsewhere&mdash;in other words, the capacity to be as attractive by way of tax incentives as we have been over the period of growth will not necessarily exist.</P>
    <P>The native small and medium-sized industries are, and must be, a crucial element in our continuing growth and particularly in employment.  Management of these small and medium-sized industries &mdash; which may start with a brilliant idea and a commitment, which is in itself a very worthy and commendable thing &mdash; may falter, as it has from time to time, in the complex areas of marketing, cost accountancy and general administration. There is a new area to which the social fund has not been directed under the Commission's recent proposal.  For that reason, this committee, this House and those in charge of these responsibilities at home, either in Government or in the public service, should look immediately to the preparation of programmes for management in small and medium-sized industries.  Incidentally, almost every Irish industry &mdash; over 90 per cent by definition &mdash; will qualify under the terms of small and medium-sized industries as determined by the European Community's criteria.  Particularly in the west, but in many parts of Ireland, weaknesses in management areas have occurred &mdash; for instance in Gaeltarra Éireann, of which we have been conscious and which have concerned the Government for some time.  There is now more scope for redirecting these funds into those areas, in addition to the traditional areas of the shop floor operatives, whether skilled, semi-skilled or non-skilled.  That is one of our great hopes in this new era which will require self-reliance more than anything else. Coincidentally, while we may continue to look to Europe for support in what we ourselves are promoting, we should by definition insist that self-reliance at home be the kernel of our development policies, Europe cannot rescue us, or any other country for that matter, from problems <Col N="150" /> unless we can ensure that we apply self-reliance directly to the purposes and aims of the fund.</P>
    <P>This committee should as a priority try to ensure that most of the funds coming through social, regional or other funds will where possible go directly to the private sector.  There is a risk that in being administered, which it must be, much of the money might be somehow dissipated by administrative costs.  I have given the example of the social fund.  The huge transfer to FEOGA of almost £½ million this year is less than previously, for one reason only, the productive capacity of Irish agriculture.  FEOGA guarantees are not, any more than the social fund, determined by national quota.  The regional fund is.  The only limit on what one will get under the terms of the FEOGA guarantee is our own productive capacity.  It is fairly evident that the productive capacity in agriculture has not been fully realised.</P>
    <P>It is of vital importance that in the areas of training and education, in agriculture as in other employment areas, we have a base of training for the farming community which will indicate that it is not just a matter of inheritance from father to son but of skill, awareness and training in regard to marketing to ensure that those with a role to play in this vital element of our economy, agriculture in particular, will be able to draw more from the guarantee side of FEOGA which is the main and basic element of our benefits from the European Community.</P>
    <P>This matter of very considerable importance I will not dwell on any longer at this point.  However, I could not leave this point on education without mentioning that it is of vital importance that we train and educate people in each area to play an effective role in this new international dimension which we have been given since we joined the European Community. It is overlooking reality to think that people without the experience of the culture or language of another country in which they wish to sell are not at a disadvantage. They are.  If they do not know the habits and styles of their intending customers, they will not produce goods acceptable to those people.  In every level <Col N="151" /> of education, but particularly in the universities, people must be made aware that they are not autonomous within their own regime, fulfilling their own purposes, but that their work must be relevant to the needs and the potential of this country in the era of European and international involvement.  I hope that training will figure greatly in the discussions on education in the committee.</P>
    <P>I would like to touch now on something, which arises from a comment by Deputy Molony&mdash;that is the budget question as such.  It is an element to which we do not tend to pay much attention at home and, in view of the nature of the motion, I will deliberately curtail my contribution, hoping to have a better opportunity on the motion on the developments in the European Community.</P>
    <P>That said, I think we should not leave any European development without pointing to this element particularly. There is unemployment all over Europe. When we look at problems at home we should not imply that the only country in Europe suffering these problems is Ireland because self-evidently that is not the case.  When we see budget deficits growing we should not imply that Ireland is the only country in Europe that has a growing budget deficit.  That is not the case but that is not to excuse the fact that we have a responsibility to ensure that in public expenditure the taxpayer will not be called upon to pay one penny more than he is required to pay in the interests of supplying necessary services.</P>
    <P>Because of the budgetary pre-occupation in Europe during my own period on the Commission we achieved a most important breakthrough.  History will demonstrate this very clearly.  Having got a mandate from the heads of Government in May 1980 asking us to concentrate exclusively almost on the British budget question what they had in mind when they asked the Commission at that time was: solve the British budget question on whatever terms you can dream up.  We in the Commission, and particularly myself because I had special responsibility in that area, did not accept <Col N="152" /> that narrow interpretation of the heads of Government.  As a consequence we said that the problems of Europe can only be solved on the basis of the introduction of new policies relevant to Europe in a whole range of areas.  I can only mention examples without details.  I have mentioned some ways in which we are reprogramming the social fund: there is also the industrial innovation programme where Europe had been very much lagging behind Japan and America, our main competitors; energy&mdash;new energy policies for conservation and for renewable sources of energy which can be of great benefit to Ireland as regards peat development.  I can only touch on these things now.</P>
    <P>There is also the role of small and medium sized industries and export contracts for agriculture which have never before been considered in Europe.  In a world that is starving and short of food it is a scandal to think that the only preoccupation hitherto of heads of Government particularly has been how they can control the level of agricultural expenditure in the Community.  Ironically, the fact is that this year that represents about 60 per cent of the total budget of the EEC where two years ago it represented over 70 per cent.  There is a certain contradiction in the fact that heads of Government are still insisting on concentrating on agriculture as the bad boy of Europe wiping up all the funds when in fact its proportion of the total fund is now considerably less even within two years. During that same period in Europe we have seen unemployment grow from approximately 5 million in May 1980 to over 11 million.  While the level of agricultural expenditure was dropping unemployment was growing considerably so that the facts speak for themselves in this case and they give the lie to those who say that the problems of unemployment and of urban areas in Europe derive from the vast amount of money spent on agriculture.</P>
    <P>Belatedly Governments are now becoming aware of this.  The one element that needs to be considered&mdash;and I hope this committee will give it considerable attention and thought&mdash;is that the problems <Col N="153" /> of Europe self-evidently do not derive from the share-out of the budget as it is now.  In the Commission we suggested that the problem is that the budget is too small, representing only about three-quarter per cent of the GNP of the member states.  Yet heads of Governments spend meeting after meeting in crisis after crisis&mdash;generally at the behest, it must be said, of the one Government &mdash; concentrating on what is not the issue. The issue is our relations with other countries, notably with the US, where the fiscal policies being pursued reach out to every farm in Europe, every worker's home there and every industrialist in Europe.  Does not every Deputy know that one of the great problems we face is the high cost of money which causes lack of investment and that this derives to a considerable extent from the fiscal policies of the US?</P>
    <P>I hope that in the committee in this House we can bring about an awareness of this at home and perhaps abroad through meetings that hopefully we will have with other equivalent committees. As Minister for Finance I was the first Minister at an informal meeting to bring the question of high interest rates before the Ministers of Finance.  I was a lone voice on that first day but I am glad that now there are at least ten voices in Europe speaking together on the need to do something.  What is not being done is to get at the root cause where it really lies in the fiscal policies of the US.  They must be made very much aware that these policies, good and right as they may seem for the great economy of America which is dependent only as to 14 per cent on external environment and is 86 per cent self-sufficent, are detrimental elsewhere. What they are doing and what may seem to be right for them is having a very damaging effect on the economic climate of the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>These are the matters I see the committee as most successfully promoting. There will be regulations and directives that the committee must deal with to ensure that Europe will not be producing regulations that are not appropriate to each member state, for the broader issues are very considerably more important.  I <Col N="154" /> welcome the re-establishment of the committee.  Finally, I hope we can continue the practice that I introduced as Minister for Foreign Affairs and which was very much overdue at the time, that the reports on the developments in Europe get a public hearing.  Up to then I recall that under the previous Government we had at least two years when the report was not debated.  No occasion was provided in this House in two years to actually analyse and recommend on the basis of the report that was before us.  I trust that from now on the Government &mdash; I am sure they will &mdash; will ensure that these reports and debates on them will be used as a basis for testing ourselves as to how we are applying the benefits that are there for better informing ourselves so as to ensure that we can apply the benefits even better in the future.</P>

      <P>This committee are a very necessary part of the functioning of this House particularly in view of the importance we increasingly place on the EEC as regards our input to it and what we extract from it.  The absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs during a debate of this nature has already been referred to.  Incidentally, it is sad that there have been occasions on which he has not been present and could well have been present to speak with benefit to the House &mdash; on the Expediency Motion, the International Tin Agreement and the International Commodity Bill.  If his absence does nothing for the status and importance of this committee which we must all recognise what does equal harm to the committee's standing is the tardy procedures whereby they are set up.  It takes an Expediency Motion not only here but in the Upper House.  Only then can it come back here for a further formalising motion and debate before the committee are finally established.  One can see the tremendous workload placed on the shoulders of this committee.  There is now the fact that it has met perhaps only on a couple of occasions in the past 12 months and one sees the amount of legislation it will have to peruse.  There are the various regulations from the EEC that will have to be discussed and in <Col N="155" /> respect of which recommendations will have to be made.  A tardy procedure does nothing to enhance the prestige, importance and efficiency of any committee.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the great amount of work that has been done so far by the committee.  We have been told that they have had, between the main committee and the sub-committees, more than 100 meetings but we must still ask whether the committee are as efficient as they should be, whether they have the powers they should have in terms of research and so on.  The committee work mostly in arrears.  They deal with legislative enactments that are already part of our day-to-day lives.  As well as perusing those enactments they peruse also draft EEC regulations which have already gone through the mill in Brussels and which are more than likely to become part of European law.  It is important that the committee endeavour to detect trends within the EEC in order to find out whether the school of thought within the EEC is moving in opposite directions to those in which it had moved in previous years.  In detecting those trends the committee would be performing the most important function of all.  The House would then be made aware of trends and changes in Europe and would be in a position to decide what policies would be adopted to meet any new trends.  In this context I am thinking, for instance, of the social fund, the regional fund and the moneys available from those funds. Are we obtaining as much benefit as we should from those funds?  This is an area in which the committee could work with benefit.</P>
      <P>The committee may complain of a heavy workload but perhaps they should hive off much more of the reading that must be done to sub-committees thereby leaving the main committee free to deal with those trends that are detectable within the EEC.  The committee could deal profitably also with the question of whether we could derive greater benefit from the various funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect in which the committee can do much good, not only for this House but for the people generally, is to <Col N="156" /> consider the impact on day-to-day life of the European Court of Law and of the various EEC legislative enactments.  The committee can do a great deal of good in creating a greater public awareness of the impact of Community legislation on the ordinary individual.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question I have raised regarding the tardy procedure by which the committee are being established, we must wait and see whether the House by the manner in which it debates and accepts the reports of the committee will do anything to enhance this important body.  I ask the committee to take upon themselves the extra task of determining where they stand in regard to their powers and in regard to being more effective than has been the case in the past.</P>

      <P>I welcome the re-establishment of this committee.  I was one of the members of the first joint committee and I found the work gave considerable satisfaction.  In general the members of the committee had a great deal to contribute in discharging their terms of reference.</P>
      <P>Since I served on the committee several years ago the terms of reference have been expanded.  I draw attention in particular to the proposal here to include examination of the question of dual membership of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann as well of the European Assembly and also to consider the relations between the Irish representatives in the European Assembly and in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The only observation I have to make in that regard is that I would urge the committee to examine this question as early as possible.  Elections to the European Assembly are due to be held in 1984 so it is important that all the political parties and all Members of both Houses be clear as to what precise role they intend to play in those elections. I would strongly suggest to the committee that they recommend to the House that dual membership should cease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am including <Col N="157" /> Deputy O'Connell in my stricture.  I am talking on an apolitical basis.  If Deputies and Senators are to discharge their duties to the Dáil or the Seanad, as the case may be, while at the same time discharging their duty as Irish members of the European Parliament, the dual membership situation is not sustainable.  For many obvious reasons dual membership is patently undesirable.  Any Member of either House of the Oireachtas who might be contemplating putting himself forward either for re-election to the European Parliament or as a first-time candidate, should have no illusion as to the views of the House.  It is arguable that our legislation relating to the system of election to the European Parliament be amended accordingly.</P>
      <P>The re-establishment of the committee is long overdue.  I wish to pay tribute to the staff who have served the committee down through the years.  They have served with great diligence.  The work is tedious and painstaking.  In some respects it can be interminably boring in terms of ploughing through masses of documentation, in presenting reports to the Dáil, reports which frequently are not discussed by the Dáil, but nevertheless the joint committee is necessary as a review body, a watchdog of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am glad the committee is being re-established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Clare):</i> I should like to refer to what Deputies Deasy and Markey said about the absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Minister is attending a meeting of the EEC Development Council and I am sure Deputies will realise how important it is that he should attend such a meeting.  That is a valid reason for his absence from the House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion asks the House to approve the appointment of a Select Committee consisting of 18 Members of the Dáil, to be joined with a Select Committee appointed by the Seanad, to comprise the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. Each House has recently passed a Motion of Expediency setting up the Joint Committee, <Col N="158" /> and we have now reached the second stage of the process of reconstitution.</P>
    <P>When Ireland joined the European Economic Community a new legal order was adopted, which takes precedence over the national system of law making in the areas covered by the Treaties.  The ability of the Community to enact laws in many important areas results in a limitation of the powers of the Oireachtas and it was against this background that the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation was established in 1973, the object being to allow the Oireachtas to influence Community legislation in those areas where the Houses had surrendered their exclusive powers, and to supervise the implementation of such legislation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the joint committee give the committee authority to examine Community legislation at three stages in the process of its adoption. It may examine legislation at the draft stage, it may examine Community Acts, and it may examine ministerial regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972, and instruments made under other statutes in order to implement our Community obligations.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the work of previous joint committees, all of which have done vast amounts of work with very little public recognition.  Much of the Community legislation is of a highly complex and technical nature, which makes the task even more demanding. The joint committee selects for examination those draft Acts which they consider of particular importance to Ireland, and they examine all statutory instruments made to implement Community laws.  Reports to the Houses of the Oireachtas are then prepared.  Deputies will be aware that the steps involved in reconstituting the joint committee are somewhat complex and cumbersome, so much so that it proved impossible, unfortunately, to finalise the necessary procedures in time for the joint committee to meet during the lifetime of the last Dáil. However, during the previous session, 94 reports were prepared by the joint committee, nine of which were considered by <Col N="159" /> the Seanad.  Of these nine, two were also considered by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The subject of the joint committee was last raised in this House on 26 May 1982. On that occasion the proposed terms of reference of the new joint committee were approved.  In addition to its mandate to examine Community legislation, the joint committee will further undertake the extremely important task of examining the relationship between the national Legislature and the European Parliament.  This will encompass the examination of various suggestions about participation of our MEPs in the work of the Dáil and the Seanad, and their role as regards the joint committee itself, as well as the question of the dual mandate.</P>
    <P>We must remember that although we have, at present, no joint committee, the flow of legislation from Brussels has not been halted.  It is, therefore, extremely important that the joint committee be reconstituted without further delay, in order that it may resume its work and so I ask the House to give its' approval to this motion.  A similar motion may then be introduced in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the establishment of this joint committee.  The debate today highlights the lack of a Minister of State in the Department of Foreign Affairs, something we have pointed out on many occasions.  The attitude of the Taoiseach in regard to this matter is to be regretted.  Some weeks ago the Taoiseach said that the previous appointment by the Coalition Government was superfluous and supernumerary.  Members on this side take grave exception to that remark.  It is a fact of life that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, due to pressure of business, has been absent on all occasions when matters relating to his Department were discussed in the Dáil.  This is the fifth occasion when either a Bill or a motion dealing with his Department were discussed in the House and the Minister has not been present for any of them. That is an indication of the dire need for the appointment of a Minister of State in that Department.  In the second last Government, when Deputy Lynch was Taoiseach, such an appointment was made.  At that time Deputy David Andrews was Minister of State in that Department and he did an excellent job. Unfortunately, when Deputy Haughey took over in December 1979 he did not see fit to fill that post.  He did not seem to think it was of any use.  Unfortunately, the opposite has proved to be the case. There is a serious and definite need for <Col N="163" /> such an appointment.  In the last Coalition Government Deputy O'Keeffe did an outstanding job as Minister of State in that Department with special responsibility for development and co-operation with Third World countries.  It is about time the Taoiseach gave serious consideration to making such an appointment.</P>
      <P>The target which has been set by the United Nations for contributions by developed countries is .7 per cent of GNP.  It is unfortunate that we have not been able to attain that figure or to go anywhere near it in our aid to such countries. In 1981 it was as low as .18 per cent of GNP.  That represented £18 million of aid from Ireland to Third World countries. The Coalition gave a commitment that they would endeavour to bring that contribution from .18 per cent of GNP to a 70 per cent figure requested by the UN by the end of the decade.  In other words, within a ten-year period we were to meet the requirements set by the UN.  In the course of fulfilling that commitment the Estimates for 1982, as set out by the National Coalition Government, contained a figure of £26.335 million which represented .23 per cent of 1 per cent of GNP.  That was the first stage of our promise to meet that commitment.  We have had no commitment from the present Government to an endeavour to continue that progress.  What is required is that in each of the next nine years our contribution to the underdeveloped countries in this world be increased annually by .05 of 1 per cent of GNP. That is not an immense amount of money.  It is a significant amount of money, but surely we should be able to get a commitment from the Government for such an annual increase.  It is only .05 of 1 per cent of our GNP.  We know that times are difficult and money is scarce, but the commitment was given less than six months ago by the previous Government and I fail to see how the present Government cannot continue to set a target for the attainment of aid to the extent of .7 per cent of GNP by 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, one of the major benefits of having a Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs is that there is a great <Col N="164" /> deal of personal contact between this country and those countries which we are dealing with in the Third World.  Deputy O'Keeffe on occasions visited those countries and set up a very worthwhile personal contact.  Nothing is more effective when you are dealing with people and work schemes of such a nature than having a man-to-man situation and personal contact.  That benefited enormously not just aid to Third World countries but also our contact and liaison and it is a pity that liaison is not being continued. There is nothing like a personal relationship to make people feel that they are wanted, to make people realise that you are interested in them, and to see at first hand how the money is being spent. Deputy O'Keeffe made several trips and they were of great benefit to and greatly appreciated by the countries which he visited in Africa.</P>
    <P>When in Government we made a commitment that we would produce a White Paper outlining our intention regarding aid to Third World countries.  No such commitment has been forthcoming from the present Government, nor has any indication as to whether they will continue the work on such a White Paper, which obviously is very badly needed in view of the concern which exists in this country at the state of affairs in those underdeveloped countries.  I would like the Minister here today to give us some word, some promise, some commitment as to whether the Government will produce that White Paper which was initiated by the previous Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe.  Far from being superflous and supernumerary as described here one day at Question Time by the Taoiseach who was badly rattled following the loss of the Dublin-West by-election, Deputy O'Keeffe was a major asset not just to this country but to the most deprived countries in the world, and the Taoiseach showed total disregard in so referring to such an outstanding individual and to a post so beneficial to mankind in general.  I hope that that trend will be reversed.  It is uncharitable and unworthy of any Deputy in this House to make such a remark and to adopt such an attitude.</P>
    <P>The Third World liaison to which I <Col N="165" /> have referred is achieved far better if carried out on a personal basis.  It is sad to relate that the transfer of 70 per cent of the moneys to those countries is done through the agency of multinational organisations.  It would be far better if that money were transferred on a bilateral basis.  Only 30 per cent of it is transferred on a bilateral basis and we would all like to see 100 per cent of that money transferred, donated and utilised on a bilateral basis with a greater personal involvement, particularly between individuals and a Minister of State in this country and senior civil servants and officials in the countries for which it is destined.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute not just to the Minister of State but to those officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and also those people in voluntary agencies throughout the country, particularly members of the Church, who have gone to considerable rounds and considerable trouble to organise the distribution of this money, this aid, in the underdeveloped countries.  Those people have given great and unstinted service and most often at no cost whatsoever to the Exchequer.  All that they do is on a voluntary basis.  No praise really can compensate those people for the work they have carried out.  On a more localised basis I let the House know that in Waterford a project has been in operation for several years past which could be copied with great effect by many other cities, towns and areas here.  Some six or seven years ago Waterford city adopted a very underprivileged area of Kenya known as Kitui and in the intervening years workers in Waterford in every form of industry and every type of work have weekly made contributions to provide aid for that area. This is an example of what can be done on a localised basis to help deprived areas in the Third World.  It would be an outstanding idea if it were emulated in other parts of this country, if various towns and cities sponsored and adopted deprived areas such as Kitui and other parts of Kenya, Tanzania, Lesotho and so on, which are in need of aid from developed countries.  People are much more willing to give their money if they know the <Col N="166" /> specific area involved and the problems that affect that area and if they have a relationship or liaison with individuals in that area.  It is very difficult to induce people to donate money on an impersonal basis.  The degree of contributions to Third World development would be far greater if people were aware precisely of where the money was going and how it was to be utilised.  A great deal is to be recommended in having that type of localised and personalised relationship with areas in the Third World which are in need of assistance.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my party's support for the formation of this committee who, I hope, will continue to do the good work for which they were inaugurated some years ago.  I hope sincerely that the Taoiseach will have a change of heart and agree to appoint a Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for co-operation with developing countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When this matter was before this House on 1 June I made a number of observations on behalf of the Labour Party and I do not propose to delay the House by repeating them.  They had a validity then and they have a validity now and it will be my purpose today to list them rather than justify each of them in turn.  These remarks were explained and amplified in my earlier speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party welcome the establishment of this committee.  I should like, however, to join with those who have spoken about the absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs from a debate involving matters of development co-operation. We have on a number of occasions discussed matters such as the International Tin Agreement which have raised the specifics of our relationship with the developing countries.  My party see development co-operation and our relationship with the Third World in general as an aspect of foreign policy and we believe it should be seen to be an integrated aspect of foreign policy.  In an earlier debate I drew attention to what can happen if we allow what we do in one realm of foreign policy to be clearly in <Col N="167" /> conflict with what we might be doing in, for example, development co-operation. I am not satisfied that we have received a satisfactory reply and that we will see matters of development brought within the general structure of foreign policy.</P>
    <P>It is too easy to say that these are matters to which the committee can quickly direct their attention.  The committee can certainly produce reports but, as happened on many occasions with the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, it may be difficult to find time in Dáil Éireann to debate these reports.  The general issues of philosophy and principle in relation to development aid are overlooked. It is important that development co-operation should be integrated as an aspect of foreign policy.</P>
    <P>The second fundamental point relates to the necessity for a White Paper and I am in agreement with the previous speaker on this matter.  The motion to establish the committee refers in section (1) (b) to &ldquo;the Government's Official Development Assistance programme&rdquo; but I find it very difficult to discern exactly what that programme is.  Most of the discussion on development aid tends to be confined to the total sum allocated. The point has been made that the only time we can concentrate on the total sum actually conveyed is when we have reached the international target which we have verbally accepted.  We have been inclined to neglect other issues.</P>
    <P>I paid tribute in my earlier speech to the work initiated by Deputy O'Keeffe in the area of development co-operation. The real test is that the initiatives which were taken were welcomed by all the people involved in the aid programmes with the developing countries.  That spoke for itself.  It is retrograde to move back from examining the structures of development co-operation.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;the Government's Official Development Assistance programme&rdquo; has meaning only when we have been able to examine the philosophy that lies behind it.  I am speaking about whatever Government might be in power.  The issues which must be addressed within a <Col N="168" /> White Paper would deal with the appropriate forms of Irish aid policy, how that policy fits with the strategies of the EEC towards the Third World, the whole question of how both might be in harmony or in conflict in relation to general strategies of world development, the whole question of development co-operation and the structures which exist within our own State for discussing issues of development co-operation and the formation of Irish personnel in terms of education and experience for participation in the developing countries' economies and societies.  Other issues are the structure of commercial interests and their relationship to developing countries, the role of the public sector in this matter, the whole question of what are appropriate forms of intervention that will acknowledge the basic right of these countries to develop democratically towards just structures, the role of the multinationals, the transfer of technology, the idea of aid to which strings might or might not be attached, and the appropriate forms of education and technological formation for people from the Third World who might want to study in this country.  None of these issues has been debated systematically and properly and they form an agenda of concern about matters that should appropriately be developed within a Government White Paper.  I strongly commit the Labour Party to the demand that we have a White Paper on this matter.</P>
    <P>The other points I wish to make relate to the general principles of development co-operation.  I worry about the answer we received on the previous occasion when we were told that the committee could quickly turn towards examining issues of development co-operation in their own proceedings.  I wonder about that because what happened in, for example, the case of the committee dealing with secondary legislation was that they concentrated on specifics and tended to neglect more general issues of policy.</P>
    <P>In relation to development co-operation, the general issues relate to the structure of the world economy &mdash; for example, the atmosphere that will follow the now almost neglected Brandt Report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="169" /> The question of world poverty needs to be addressed.  It is appropriate to remind ourselves that, while the average income three years ago of the 260 million people in the EEC was $6,000, that of 300 million people in the Third World affected by the Lomé Convention was $330.  That is an injustice in international economic terms and I should like to know what Ireland's attitude is towards a structure of world economic order which allows such great disparities and how we propose to move into the conditions in which we will face the renegotiation of a new world economic order.  Is development co-operation in terms of economic growth to be a different kind of animal to development co-operation in terms of stringency? What are the principles of development co-operation?  We have been told that to appoint a Minister of State is a waste of time and we have not been given a guarantee of a White Paper.  Yet this motion refers to &ldquo;the Government's Official Development Assistance programme&rdquo;. The capital letters used indicate nothing to me but they may be intended to indicate that the Government's programme is different from that of the voluntary agencies.  I am aware of that rather fundamental distinction.  It is offered here without any justification and I repeat the necessity, if we are in any way sincere about development co-operation, for some coherence in our approach.</P>
    <P>There is another issue which arose as a matter of controversy since we last spoke on this matter and it relates to whether development co-operation should be simply assistance or should be involved in what many agencies concerned consider the work of justice.  I have no hesitation in saying that I believe the kind of poverty which exists in the Third World arises as a consequence of specific structures.  The situation in Central America in countries like Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua, before the departure of Somoza, came about not as in the case of bananas which grow in some countries and not in others: poverty has no natural source. For example, the fact that the Somoza family owned 47 per cent of all the land is crucial in understanding the starvation <Col N="170" /> of the peasants in Nicaragua.  It is important that we are free to investigate the injustices and inequalities which flow from structures which are themselves exploitive and repressive.  Every penny that finds its way into the Third World and advances democracy, participation, literacy and facilities for establishing structures which are suitable to these countries is money well spent.</P>
    <P>Nationally our approach to poverty is that we have made a transition from compassion to justice and any transition back in the area of development co-operation would be a retrograde step.  I wish the committee well.  In the international sphere Ireland will be judged on whether it is in solidarity with the needs of the Third World.  Are we, as a small country with limited economic resources but with great possibilities for moral influence, on the side of Third World development and a renegotiated economic order; or are we operating in the shadow of the great imperialist powers, many of them with an imperial history?  For example, what is the difference between the Irish aid strategy and the Belgian aid strategy?  What is the difference between our aid strategy and the West German one?  What is the difference between what we do in bilateral aid projects and what we do as members of the EEC?</P>
    <P>The real test of whether we are offering crumbs or looking at the rights of men and women to live in freedom will be judged by the work of the committee.  I find it hard to believe that we are establishing a committee with precise procedures for what constitutes a quorum and so on and arranging for its reports to come before this House in print and at the same time credit that we did not have an opportunity to discuss the philosophy which might underline our attitudes towards Third World development or the strategy which might implement that philosophy by way of a White Paper.  We have passed the time of waiting for a specific commitment in this area from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he regards development co-operation as a central aspect of foreign policy.  I shall draw the attention of the House in the <Col N="171" /> strongest possible manner on the next occasion to this should we not in the meantime have some assurance from the Minister that he regards development co-operation as an integral part of Irish foreign policy and one worthy of his attention and of debate in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputies Higgins and Deasy in saying how reprehensible I find the Minister's lack of commitment. Perhaps there was a reason why he could not have been here when the expediency motion was before us, but one would have imagined he would have made an effort to be here for this debate. The lack of his presence highlights the point made by previous speakers, that of the lack of a Minister to deal with development co-operation.  Co-operation with developing countries is as integral a part of our foreign policy as our association with America and the EEC.  During the last debate Deputy Wilson sat in for the Minister.  Today we have Deputy Barrett. If we go on perhaps we will have every Minister before we have the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  This would mean they would all have experience of foreign affairs and be able to do the job themselves. The Minister for Foreign Affairs certainly seems happy to delegate his responsibilities.</P>
      <P>We do not know the Government's commitment to the timetable set out by the Coalition Government to meet the 0.7 per cent target in ten years.  In his reply to the last debate, Deputy Wilson stressed that the Minister was very committed to the whole concept of co-operation with developing countries.  However, we were given no facts and no details of their policy.  It was another put off until tomorrow situation.  It is not good enough.  During the seven months of our term in office Deputy O'Keeffe did more for development co-operation by highlighting it and creating an understanding of what it was all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years we all saved our pennies for the black babies.  That was the extent of our understanding of the problems of the Third World.  The teacher in charge of the class wrapped up all the <Col N="172" /> pennies and sent them off and we were told we were buying a black baby.  Thankfully our understanding and commitment to development in these countries has come a long way.  The work done by missionaries and volunteers at that stage was the base on which we had built and have come to the stage where we now have a joint committee of the House to study and discuss our co-operation with developing countries.</P>
    <P>It is easy in these days of financial constraint to say we will forget about helping them.  It saddens me to hear people say we have enough poverty here and should not be sending £26 million to help developing countries.  My understanding is, from speaking to volunteers who have worked in these countries, that we do not know poverty to the same extent as it exists there.  We do not know hunger or homelessness as it is in those countries.  The financial aid we send will reap untold benefits in those countries in comparison to what it could do if spent dealing with poverty at home.  It would be sad if we said that because we were going through difficult times we would scrap our development programme and only help our own people.  It would be akin to a county council deciding that all they would do for the next ten years was deal with housing, roads and so on and forget about developing green spaces and parks.  That would be a foolish and retrograde step.  I hope that the Government's apparent lack of commitment does not mean that they will let it ride for a number of years until they get out of the financial difficulty they put themselves into.</P>
    <P>For a small country our contribution has been enormous.  We have had a lot of spin-off benefit.  Perhaps the reason we should become involved with the development co-operation is because of a Christian desire to help alleviate extensive suffering.  Deputy Higgins touched on the benefits we have received. But for co-operation with developing countries we would not have built up relationships or had dealings with certain countries.  Therefore it is not correct to label what we are doing for those developing countries as pure charity.  We, too, are gaining experience.  Our young engineers, <Col N="173" /> scientists, doctors, nurses and others who go out to help in these countries bring back experience they could not have gained at home, experience from which this country will greatly benefit. Our aid to and trade with developing countries can only stand to our good. Being slightly philosophical about it, it will be character-forming but also it has been and will continue to be good for our economy.  After all, we should remember that it is not so long since ours became a developed country; it is not so long since we had to dig our ditches, dig our wells and reclaim our land.  Therefore we have the fresh experience of having had to pull ourselves up by the boot straps and get going.</P>
    <P>We may not be able in one fell swoop to reach the United Nation's target of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  We may not be able to reach that target for perhaps a decade and, at the rate we are progressing, regrettably it may take longer.  We have a lot more to offer apart from any financial contribution.  We have the manpower and expertise in the various fields.  We have also the dedication and the willingness of our people to drop everything, give up their jobs and go out.  I am sorry the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has left the House because he attended a meeting with me at which Father Michael Cleary spoke.  At that meeting he described his very happy reaction at the effect of a simple article he wrote in a Sunday newspaper, an article which he said had not emanated from any great motive on his part.  He had to write an article on some subject for a column in a Sunday newspaper and he decided to write on the problems of the Third World and its needs.  He said he was bowled over by the immediacy of the reaction of the ordinary men and women in the street, by the enormous amount of money that flowed in, the enormous willingness of people to commit themselves into going out to these countries in order to help, giving a couple of years of their lives.  We must remember that the way of life is not easy in these countries.  That is why the benefit accruing to volunteers who work in them is not something that can be measured in financial terms.  Indeed the <Col N="174" /> money they receive, if any, is minimal and barely keeps them in basic human comfort.  But the benefits accruing to them by way of character-development, of expertise in their fields of operation, of understanding of the human condition which they bring home and put into practice here are benefits we, as a nation, must benefit also.  It is unfortunate that not only has the Minister not been in the House for a number of recent debates in connection with Foreign Affairs but I understand also that since his appointment he has met only once the advisory council set up to advise on co-operation with developing countries.  Perhaps I am doing him an injustice and that he has met them again in the past week or two. But within the few short days I have had the privilege of speaking on this topic it would appear he has not met this advisory council.  Indeed, in many areas advisory councils are not always necessary but certainly they are needed in that of development co-operation.  We cannot all know what conditions are like in these developing countries because of their remoteness from us, because of their different cultures and so on.  Therefore we must depend on our fellow countrymen who have been to them.  We must depend on our experts who have helped in their irrigation systems, their food processing and so on.  We must depend on their help and advice in this respect.  In my capacity as spokeswoman on development co-operation it will be my intention to establish contact with as many of these people and groups who have travelled abroad and helped in such projects, to learn from them and be guided by them on how we can go forward and help in this most worthy and necessary task.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Development Co-Operation will help to bring about a better understanding even amongst Deputies of this House &mdash; and here dare I say that there are probably many, including myself, who, up to recently, had not much understanding of our enormous involvement through various semi-State bodies, private concerns, voluntary agencies and so on with these developing countries.  The establishment of this joint committee should help in the dissemination <Col N="175" /> of this information.  While all Members of the Houses cannot sit on this committee those who do will have a better understanding and, in turn, by conversing with their fellow Members, should ensure a wider understanding of the problems and of the commitments we as a nation must have in this respect.  Indeed such must be stressed to the Government.  If this Government cannot say categorically that they will continue the programme and timetable initiated by the Coalition Government then this country will be all the worse therefor and we shall suffer repercussions around the world.  Indeed we shall suffer internally and it would be a sad day should that happen.  Having spoken to Deputies on the Government benches it appears there are many interested in this subject, who would wish to contribute, to be kept informed and indeed become involved. It would be a shame were the Government not to come out and say where they stand in this respect.</P>
    <P>I endorse Deputy Higgins' request for a White Paper on this subject.  Such a White Paper would bring the whole subject on to the floor of the House where a full open and informative debate could take place.  I urge the Minister present to convey our misgivings and worries about Government commitment to development co-operation to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>The few points I want to make are of such a nature I feel they represent real questions which this House and indeed the joint committee we are establishing must face up to and perhaps answer.  It is to be hoped with confidence that the incoming committee will examine the real questions involved in this whole area of development co-operation. I am not sure whether this or any other Government who have been operating in this field of development assistance &mdash; under either the bilateral or multilateral programme &mdash; have been willing to face up to what are the real difficulties being experienced in these countries.  I do not think we should clap ourselves on the back for merely giving assistance.  Resulting <Col N="176" /> from our history we are perhaps the one country in the world which should be in the front line of giving the maximum amount of assistance in any one year, particularly when it is realised that a survey undertaken showed that on the African Continent 15 countries had had a negative growth rate in the past ten years and that, of the 35 poorest countries in the world, two-thirds are on the African Continent.  I acknowledge the assistance given by any Government under the bilateral aid programme, particularly to the four African countries, Lesotho, Sudan, Zambia and Tanzania.</P>
      <P>The Brandt Report for the first time has brought the central issue in this development co-operation to the front of our minds.  I detect a stagnation over the past 12 months with regard to doing anything about that report.  I detect a certain unwillingness that has very little to do with the availability of finance on the part of any Government in the world interested in this subject.  That unwillingness to give more funds than hitherto may derive from a feeling that the Brandt Report contains very definite hot potatoes for many Western countries.  Many questions raised in the Brandt Report will have to be answered by many of those countries if they are to fulfil what the Brandt Report sets out in its recommendations.</P>
      <P>The predecessor to the Brandt Report, the Pearson Report in 1969, had as its central theme &ldquo;enlightened self-interest&rdquo;. This meant giving more and better aid to developing undeveloped countries and giving more and better private investment.  Those features contained certain advantages for countries which were the givers because they saw in that central theme of enlightened self-interest something from which they would benefit in trade and in other ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Brandt Report was published in 1980 and it had as its theme &ldquo;international social justice&rdquo;.  The book was opened wider than ever before in the Brandt Report to embrace areas of health, jobs, land reform and things which might well stick in the throat of certain countries in the western world. The Brandt Report asked how do all the <Col N="177" /> capitalist countries face up to land reform?  This question arose in the El Salvador situation.  How would we face up to health and treatment of health in very over-populated countries that need development assistance?  The common recommendation of both reports had to do with the colossal debt which those countries experience, their inability to meet interest repayments, never mind capital repayments, on moneys loaned to them by many of the western world banking institutions.  The other common recommendations had to do with assistance, monetary and otherwise, and trade development between the undeveloped and the developed nations.</P>
    <P>The big question from the Brandt Report remains.  Can the whole field of development be taken outside what can be trade, political and even class interests and put into a wider sphere where we can look on it as something which has to be dealt with for its own sake?  I believe that, because the Brandt Report was brave enough to outline many of the issues which would have to be faced up to, that is one of the reasons why there has been a certain slowing down in further debate and discussion on the recommendations of that report.</P>
    <P>I would like the new committee we are establishing to look into exactly what the Brandt Report entails for the western world and for this country.  It is our money which is being given to help those undeveloped countries.  Are we prepared to face up to the issues which will be laid before us if we pursue the logic of giving assistance to countries and have to face up to the problems which development to them means other than purely financial and food assistance.</P>
    <P>I notice in paragraph (2) of the motion that, while provision is made for the appointment of substitutes to act for members of the joint committee who are unable to attend particular meetings, it stops there, as distinct from a similar paragraph in relation to establishing the joint committee to deal with secondary legislation of the European Communities, where there was a provision that members of either House who were not members of the joint committee <Col N="178" /> should be allowed to attend meetings and take part in the proceedings without having the right to vote.  Why is such a recommendation included in the motion setting up one committee and dropped from the motion setting up the committee we are now discussing?  I would like the Minister to clarify that because, as the previous speaker said, it is extraordinary the number of Members of this House who are interested in the whole field of development co-operation.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity here to bring as many Members as possible of this House into that debate, to give them an opportunity, as we have in the case of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  I know this question was raised before and the answer given was that any Members in the House, although they were not members of the joint committee, could regard themselves as visitors and therefore be entitled with the agreement of the joint committee, to be present.  That is not a good enough explanation for Members of the House.  We should not be regarded as visitors like officials from Departments or members of outside bodies who are involved in the whole field of development co-operation, who have to seek the agreement of such a committee to be present at all.  We are members of the primary Legislature and if there is a contribution to be made in the field of development co-operation, as in the important field of EEC legislation, a similar privilege should be extended to Members of this House.</P>
    <P>The field of education, to which a certain amount of money is budgeted by the Government every year, is so important that I believe the committee must use whatever means they can to have the people made fully aware of what development co-operation means and what their money is being spent on.  A survey conducted some time ago by the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation came up with some startling revelations. It not only indicated a widespread lack of awareness among Irish people about the countries which were embraced by our bilateral scheme of aid, but some of them had never even <Col N="179" /> heard of a country like Lesotho, to which their money was being contributed. Lesotho gains by far the biggest amount of finance under our bilateral aid programme. That survey also showed that the Irish public were not well aware of what we do through the other ODA programmes. Approximately 35 per cent were not even aware that we give aid overseas.  I welcome the establishment of this committee and hope that it will examine what the priorities of the country should be in the field of ODA, what exactly development assistance means in our historical context and what ODA should mean to the people of this country. The committee should certainly try to ensure that there is a far greater awareness among the public of what the public's money is being spent on.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Clare):</i> This is the third step in the procedure to establish the Joint Committee on Cooperation with Developing Countries.  The first motion was debated in this House recently and the second stage was passed in the Seanad last week.</P>
      <P>This Committee will provide an important forum in which members of the Oireachtas can consider and discuss the full range of development cooperation problems.  These include the major issues confronting the development organisations including trade, commodities, finance, as well as Ireland's contribution to developing countries through our Official Development Assistance.</P>
      <P>This year ODA will amount to £26.335 million, which is the largest amount ever. Of this, approximately 67 per cent, not 70 per cent as Deputy Deasy said, will be allocated to multilateral aid, including the EEC and United Nations development agencies, while the remainder will be directed through bilateral aid channels. Chief among these is our Bilateral Aid Programme which this year will channel almost £8 million to developing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee will also have an indirect role in relation to development education.  The need to increase interest <Col N="180" /> in and awareness of development problems among Irish people generally, is, I believe, accepted on all sides of the House as a necessary and desirable development. This committee, through its very existence, will draw public attention to development problems and focus public concern on this most deserving of areas.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to thank Deputies for their support for this measure during the earlier debate on the motion of expediency. I believe that the subject of development co-operation commands a great deal of interest and enthusiasm on all sides of this House and the Seanad and I am confident that this will lead to a substantial degree of co-operation and harmony in the work of the committee.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Brandt Report, it has been debated quite often during the past 12 months, at the Ottawa Summit and recently at the Paris Summit in Versailles. At those Summit meetings there was a strong commitment given to implementing the proposals in the Brandt Report.  The main reason for delay is because of lack of commitment by some of the more powerful countries involved.</P>
    <P>The absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, has been commented on.  Perhaps Deputy Owen was not in the House when I explained the reasons for his absence.  Deputy Collins is attending a development council meeting in Luxembourg.  It should be understood that being Minister for Foreign Affairs entails travel and attending different functions and conferences abroad, whether in the UN or the EEC.

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> I hope that this committee will start their work very quickly because those of us who are new to public life on a national level agree, from reading through various Acts and Bills, that it is very difficult for the average man in the street to understand them.  I believe a number of the old Social Welfare Acts were consolidated into a new Bill and there are a number of other areas where this should be done immediately. I ask the Minister of State to assure us that we will organise this committee as quickly as possible.  Those of us who are members of local authorities come across legislation which could be consolidated.  I welcome the formation of this committee and ask the Minister to assure us they will set about their duties as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome the formation of this committee and trusts they will produce some substantial improvements in the present legislative organisation.  It is regrettable that our legislation has developed over the past few decades in a very hotch potch, <i>ad hoc</i> fashion and that the attention that needs to be given to developing our laws and legislation on a comprehensive basis has not been undertaken in any determined <Col N="183" /> or realistic way.  That makes for difficulties, not only for the legal practitioner but also for the ordinary men in the street who needs to have recourse to the law.  There are numerous fields, such as landlord and tenant law, social welfare law and local Government planning and development law where there are a whole collection of Acts.  Many of them are clearly amending measures and it would obviously be very desirable that they would be assembled and consolidated into one whole measure so that a person wanting to refer to the law on a particular subject could refer to one Act and be sure of finding an up to date, comprehensive statement of the law in that field.  In the UK, this area is tackled with considerably more zeal and zest than we have undertaken.</P>
      <P>It also highlights the need for the promotion, possibly through the Department of the Taoiseach or the Department of Justice, of simple text books giving the up to date position on Irish law.  It is a very difficult matter to ascertain what the up to date legal position is.  We have not had the production of text books on anything like the lines that have become available in other countries.  Admittedly, there have been some improvements in the last five or seven years and some text books have been published, but that can only be regarded as a start.  With this new committee operating and some worthwhile consolidation measures being brought before the Dáil, even if they do no more than declare the existing position in a comprehensive manner, it will be a valuable step forward.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputies for their comments and to assure them that we will look into the points raised.  As was pointed out, in the area of social welfare legislation &mdash; an area in which there are changes twice a year &mdash; there was only one consolidation measure since the foundation of the State.  I was a member of the committee dealing with that matter and I saw how legislation could be brought into line to avoid anomalies and <Col N="184" /> contradictions.  It was a time-consuming operation but it was done in respect of an area in which there are many changes.  It should be possible for Ministers to take up the matter and deal with it in an easier fashion in other Departments and I am sure this will be done by them.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Taylor who spoke about the need for updating legislation. At the end of a Dáil session Deputies get a booklet to say what Bills have been passed and giving an outline of them. However, the booklet does not give comprehensive information perhaps this will lead the way towards something that is dear to my heart, namely, that the whole Dáil system be updated.  The problem is that there is so much legislation and so little time.  It is most desirable that committees should be working actively and should be attended by Members.  The committees already in existence find it difficult enough to get quorums and it is up to Members to attend the meetings. At the moment there are six Members present in the Dáil and we could just as well deal with this matter in a small room while the Dáil proceeded with other important Bills.  We seem to conduct our discussions on legislation in a cumbersome and silly way.  I hope that in the time I am a Member of this House we will deal with the matter in a more sensible way.  We should adopt the procedure used in many other parliaments in Europe rather than operate in the present rather silly way.</P>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputies for their co-operation in the matter and to assure them that the points they have raised will be examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> When I reported progress I was speaking of the difficulties that had to be overcome by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  During the years the Department suffered from adverse criticism that was not justified.  It can be said that governments did not give sufficient capital to expand the area of telecommunications along the lines that should <Col N="186" /> have been adopted.  During the years of economic expansion in the 1960s and the 1970s we concentrated to a large extent on industrial development.  The whole emphasis of the then Department of Industry and Commerce was on increasing industrial output and on creating new industries.  This was laudable but the weakness in the campaign then being conducted was that we did not concentrate sufficiently on telecommunications which are vital for economic advancement. I have no doubt that such economic advancement has been impeded because we did not inject sufficient capital into this sector.</P>
      <P>One of the most important developments that took place in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was a review group that was set up by the then Minister, Deputy Faulkner.  This was the first positive step taken to consider the workings of the Department and how they could be improved.  A decision was reached by that review group and within a short time two interim boards were established to consider the setting up of a semi-State body for postal services and also for telecommunications.  These were set up under the chairmanship of Michael Smurfit dealing with telecommunications and Fergal Quinn dealing with the postal section.  The Bill before the House gives effect to the decisions that were made.</P>
      <P>It is my belief that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were starved of capital during the years by successive governments.  In 1979 the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs provided £650 million of capital to allow the Department to expand and to meet modern requirements. The decision taken at that time laid the foundation for the development of the Department for many years and if it is followed through to its logical conclusion it will bring about major improvements in our telecommunications and postal services.  The decision taken will allow the sectors concerned to operate independently.  How the review group reached their conclusion and the decision they took are matters of importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to quote from the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group Report. <Col N="187" /> which is also quoted in the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>Each service is a major commercial enterprise in its own right.  Each service faces grave problems but the problems are essentially different and require different approaches.  The telecommunications services are so seriously inadequate and the problems of development, from the present base, are so formidable as to require the full-time, single-minded, attention of a commercially motivated board and chief executive. Organisational links with a major and fundamentally different service would be a distraction and would also carry the risk of a spillover of problems.  The link also gives rise to risk of cross-subsidisation between the services.  The management of the very large labour-intensive postal service also demands the full-time, single-minded attention of its own commercially motivated board and chief executive. In a sense it faces more difficult problems than the telecommunications service, which will enjoy natural growth for many years to come.  The postal service will require the highest skills of marketing, imagination and innovation in the immediate future.  In the longer term the service faces technological changes which seems likely to have a major impact on its volume of business, and profound implications for pricing, profitability, personnel and marketing.</P>
    <P>That was the basis for the review board's decision to form two semi-State companies. It is the proper policy for an organisation such as this.  I have some idea of Posts and Telegraphs having being a Minister of State there for a few years and it is far more business oriented than any other Department.  It differs fundamentally from all the other Departments.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs are running a business seven days a week; it is in the field of selling and marketing. The telecommunications side is also on the same lines but on a technological basis.  The two boards will have the added advantage of trained personnel who have <Col N="188" /> vast experience in telecommunications and in the postal service.  Because of that these two semi-State bodies will have an advantage over many of the semi-State bodies which were set up down through the years and had to recruit their own staff and train them from the very start. I am convinced that these two boards will do an excellent job and that it was the correct decision to set up two boards.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the difficulties which I thought the postal sector would encounter in the years ahead.  Unless we contain the postal charges the majority of companies, especially industrial companies which take up the largest part of the postal service, will seek alternative ways to do business.  But if the postal service is properly marketed with the outlets that we now have of over 2,000 sub-post offices it can certainly expand and create new business.  That will be the task of the semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>Speaking generally, a lot of progress has been made in the Department over the past number of years.  Some years ago there was closer co-operation between the Board of Works and the Department and about 500 buildings were scheduled to be built throughout the country.  Years ago staff relations in the Department were not as good as they should be.  But these have improved considerably.  There were strikes, but let us not think for one moment that this Department have had excessive strikes.  Indeed, if we look at the history of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs we will see that there were very few strikes.  But after extensive negotiations agreement was reached with the engineering staff which led to greater productivity.  These structures can be carried into the semi-State bodies.  The staff relations section within the Department was understaffed but that was restructured and additional staff allocated. These improvements have been taking place over the past number of years and will be handed over to the new boards and the new boards will be able to benefit from these improvements and carry out further improvements in the whole structure of the organisation.</P>
    <P>In the newspapers I have seen certain doubts expressed by various spokesmen <Col N="189" /> about whether this is the right decision or not.  One spokesman said he thought there should be only one board.  But one board with 30,000 people would be too cumbersome and impossible to manage. Progressive companies will always try to minimise numbers because they know perfectly well that they can be run more effectively.  So the decision to have two semi-State bodies is a practical one.  It would be too cumbersome to have one board because there are two different types of operation being carried out; One is high technology and the other is marketing. Therefore it is wise to set up two boards.  I quote Joseph O'Malley the political correspondent of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, on Sunday, 23 May 1982 in a paragraph headed &ldquo;Telecommunications&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Perhaps the only major decision taken in recent years involving a fundamental change which has been implemented speedily.  In July, 1978 a Posts and Telegraphs Review Group was set up.  A year later it had completed the report which the Government immediately accepted.</P>
    <P>It recommended that posts and telegraphs should be split into two State companies &mdash; the legislation was discussed in the Dáil on Wednesday &mdash; and that an accelerated development programme costing some £650 million (at 1979 prices) should be undertaken. The purpose is to transform the whole telecommunications service and raise it to EEC standards by 1984 &mdash; with the annual rate of connection of 140,000.</P>
    <P>This reform is remarkable for the speed of analysis &mdash; one year; decision &mdash; immediate; implementation &mdash; five years.</P>
    <P>That is an indication of the work that has taken place.  I would like to congratulate the present Minister for processing this Bill so speedily and bringing it into the House at this time.  I do not mean for one moment that there was not consultation with the various interested bodies.  Of course there was.  A Green Paper was issued on this matter in May 1980 and <Col N="190" /> this gave accommodation to all interested parties to make submissions to the Department and this they did.  I understand about 140 submissions were made from the interested Departments.  We had the White Paper setting out the Government's proposals in 1981, more than a year ago.  This means there has been time for consultation.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this was a very difficult Bill to prepare.  When the British Telecommunications Bill was going through the House of Commons it was said to be one of the longest and most detailed Bill ever to go through the Commons. We are fortunate that this Bill has only 105 sections embracing a broad and complex issue.  With this in mind I believe we are on the right track and consultations will have to take place between interested bodies and unions.</P>
    <P>I read Terry Quinlan's statement on this Bill.  I know the unions were expressing their opinions on it over the past week.  If they have any doubts, the Minister will discuss it with them and sort out their fears.  It is of vital importance that we have proper staff relations.  In An Bord Poist there are about 9,500 people employed and about 20,000 in An Bord Telecom.  The Bill guarantees wages, salaries and superannuation of present civil servants.  Many people employed in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have given long and loyal service and it is important that they be given the guarantees they require.  I have no doubt the Minister will iron out all their problems because it is very important that we have good staff relations in these two State-sponsored bodies which will, in the long term, affect the economic and social development of this country.  If we do not have good staff relations we need only look around us to see the consequences of such a state of affairs.  That situation will affect everybody, even old age pensioners, because everybody requires a good telecommunications service.  A telephone is no longer a luxury; it is an accepted part of our lives.  That is why I am so concerned that we will have good staff relations.</P>
    <P>The present civil servants who will be joining the State-sponsored bodies <Col N="191" /> should do so willingly, knowing the companies will be able to pay their way.  That is why I am very concerned about the financing of these companies.  There is nothing so frustrating or depressing for an employee than to read at the annual general meeting that the company are losing money.  When these companies are set up I hope the Government will not have to give them grants beyond what is written in this Bill.  They should be set up with a proper financial structure.</P>
    <P>I note from the Bill that superannuation for retiring employees will be met from current income of both bodies.  I hoped these bodies would not be burdened in this way.  Telecommunications is an expanding industry.  It is the only product of which we do not have an ample supply.  We cannot meet the present demand.  This is a growth industry which will pay its way in years to come. It will need a huge capital investment at the start and there are already sufficient funds provided for their capital requirements.</P>
    <P>As I said, we must ensure the staff willingly join these two bodies and that all their guarantees will be met.  I read recently that Terry Quinlan, Secretary of the Post Office Workers' Union, has reservations about certain sections of this Bill and I hope they will be ironed out to the satisfaction of all.  I did not hear any doubts expressed about the telecommunications section.</P>
    <P>The standard of service has improved considerably over a number of years and there has been a very big increase in the number of phones installed.  It is hoped to have 80,000 to 90,000 installed this year.  Considerable advances have been made in various parts of the country, and these are probably the areas where new telecommunications centres have been established, but I cannot say the same for parts of Dublin.  The number of phones installed in greater Dublin has not matched that in other parts of the country, but I can see the problem as regards laying cables in built-up areas.  There has been a great deal of industrial development in greater Dublin and a very big <Col N="192" /> increase in the number of urban dwellings. This growth has been accelerated more in Dublin than in provincial towns.</P>
    <P>I have had several communications from industrialists complaining they had to wait a considerable length of time for telephones to be installed.  They may have had just one phone, but one phone for a commercial company is not much good; they want a number of telephones and a telex.  This is vitally important for economic expansion.  We must concentrate on that sector.  Down the years we have concentrated on IDA grants for factories but we have overlooked allocating sufficient funds to telecommunications in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. There is no sense in allocating sufficient funds for the IDA without giving an adequate allocation to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs because one cannot work without the other.  A new look was taken at this matter in 1978, when the concept of the allocation of £650 million to semi-State bodies for capital development was considered.  We can now hope for a better service from the postal service.  The problems with the service everywhere, but in Dublin in particular of which I have personal experience, must be solved by an improvement in our postal situation.</P>
    <P>Many people have complained to me of having paid their deposit perhaps seven or eight months ago and still await connection of the telephone service.  The guideline is supposed to be three months, or four at the most.  I find it surprising that people would be experiencing such delays.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> It would be unfair for the Department to keep people's money for up to 12 months without giving them a telephone connection.  I am bringing those complaints to the attention of the Minister now.  Deputies on the opposite benches have a different technique altogether in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated his intention of leaving the method of collecting television licence fees as it is at present. <Col N="193" /> I find it difficult to think of any different way of collecting them.  In the past, RTE have suggested that they set up their own operation of collecting of television licence fees.  The system now operating is that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs stop a certain percentage of each licence fee for the collection service.  A more intensive campaign must be carried out in all fairness to RTE because a substantial amount of money is being lost to them.  A sum was mentioned of between £6 million and £8 million a year, which is a substantial amount for any organisation to lose and we know of RTE's present financial situation.  An Bord Poist will have to improve considerably the situation regarding collection.</P>
    <P>If RTE continue to lose this money we will have imported programmes only on the Irish TV stations.  It is expensive to produce Irish programmes, but money will have to be placed at the disposal of RTE for this purpose, so that we can keep our own identity.  In Dublin and along practically all the east coast, four different channels are competing against Irish television and on radio we have competition from pirate stations.  It is very difficult for advertisers to view the whole situation and see where they should advertise.  To discuss RTE is not within the ambit of this Bill but I am mentioning solely the collection of television licences.  A concerted effort will have to be made against TV spongers so that the RTE authority will have extra funds for their own programmes.</P>
    <P>The philatelic section within the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is seldom spoken about but is a very important section which has been expanding down the years.  It is a unique section whose work mirrors our country abroad. Many of our excellent postage stamps are designed and developed by an excellent committee attached to this section and I hope that this section will not be forgotten. Not alone does their work mirror our image as a nation but it is quite a lucrative business.  This work could be expanded, which requires marketing. This section have paid their way down through the years and will continue to do <Col N="194" /> so.  Considerable interest has been shown in their work.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned that the unions connected with this Department are fully satisfied with the results of the recent negotiations.  There has been some criticism. It is as important to have good working relationships where ten people are involved as, in this case, where there are 30,000.  We will have to ensure a continuing dialogue.</P>
    <P>There was mention of this Bill being rushed through the House.  There is still plenty of room for debate on this Bill. The Green Paper was circulated in May 1980 and a White Paper some time late in 1981.  Nobody can say that this Bill has been rushed through the House.  It took the normal course that a Bill, where so many people are involved, should take. There was a Green Paper which allowed the various organisations to provide their input and they did.  They had reservations about certain parts of it.  A total of 44 submissions, comments and queries was received.  A list of those who made submissions or furnished comments is contained in the appendix.  In general, the submissions either favoured or did not oppose the proposed reorganisation of the postal and telecommunications services into two semi-State bodies. Opposition to the proposed change to State-sponsored status was expressed in one submission.  Others favoured a single State-sponsored body which would be responsible for both postal and telecommunications services.  That was the input by the organisations to the Green Paper. I do not believe that is the end of the story.  The Minister is an easy man to deal with and if there are still reservations by the unions I have no doubt he will deal with them directly and see that any fears they have before the final decision is taken will be sorted out because that is of vital importance.</P>
    <P>I hope that when we look back in years to come we will see those two State bodies, An Bord Telecom and An Bord Poist, functioning for the benefit of the country at large, our industrial expansion and for all the social services that can be given by those two bodies and we shall certainly decide that the decision taken <Col N="195" /> by the Minister, Deputy Wilson, on this occasion was the proper one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to state my position and that of my party on this Bill. We intend to oppose it <i>in toto.</i> We do not accept that this is the proper way to develop our postal and telecommunications services.  What is happening in fact is the closing down of a Government Department and handing it over to somebody else.  This has been a State service since before this State was founded.  I heard the previous speaker talking in terms of how it developed and the great service it gave.  I agree with him; a wonderful service was given by the Post Office and by the telecommunications section by and large over the years.  I know there were complaints and disappointments sometimes but these were due primarily to lack of capital investment by the State in these services.  We are now reneging on our responsibility because since the State was founded the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was responsible to the House for the administration of that Department.  If something in the postal service was lacking in my area I could question the Minister here directly.  Now I will be told that it is a matter for the board.  That will be the situation under this Bill.  I have experience, as has everybody here, of how boards work.  I accept that the Minister who introduced the Health Act some years ago did so in good faith to improve the service.  We know what happened: a huge colossus of administration was set up which did not improve the service but obstructed its operation.  I challenge anybody to deny that the Health Act which set up boards to take over from local authorities the running of the health services has not improved the services but has obstructed the administration of these services.  That is plain to anybody who has studied the matter.  I do not speak now in a political sense because both Governments, although they may have differed slightly, agreed to the setting up of ACOT and agreed to set up boards to operate what was being run directly under departmental guidance by <Col N="196" /> local democracy in the committees of agriculture.  We now see people appointed, at huge salaries, to take charge of these areas, to do work previously done efficiently.  The previous speaker told us about the great service that was provided but he admitted that there has been a lack of capital investment in that whole area.  Yet, he says it is right to break up the existing organisation and set up two boards, even though he boasts about the service given over the years by the previous organisation. I cannot see the <i>rationale</i> of his argument.  I do not know what he means when he says there was a good service, that it was starved of capital and yet says it is right now to break up the existing set-up.  Have we any assurance that capital will be available to the new separate boards?</P>
      <P>The boards are being headed by people of business renown.  Their policy in private business has been to amalgamate, not to set up smaller sections.  Now, they tell us the proper thing is to set up two boards, to establish an administrative colossus twice over.  I see no justification for the setting up of any board.  We are now saying that a State Department is incapable of administrating the services administered since the foundation of the State, and that we will shift the responsibility and give it to the new boards.  Is that what we are really saying?  Is that the situation we have reached?  Here we have 30,000 people directly employed by the State with civil service status being handed over to two State boards set up for the purpose.  We are incapable of running the service ourselves; we will not provide the money for them.  Who will provide the money for the two boards to run them?  Who will pay the separate administrative costs involved in establishing and running these boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand we still have 1,000 civil servants in P &amp; T and we will have a new colossal administration set up by both boards.  This is a retrograde step that should not be taken.  The State enterprise has proved successful.  The Post Office has given us service of which they can be proud.  I am proud of it.  Daily post is delivered I think to every house and person <Col N="197" /> in the community.  That is a service to be proud of.  The service provided by post office clerks and others to people in receipt of social welfare benefit, pensions paid out in post offices, family allowances paid out in the post offices and the general service given throughout the country is something that those employed in the Post Office can really be proud of.  It has not been all that we might have expected but the fault does not lie with the Post Office nor with the people working there but with successive Governments who since the foundation of the State have failed to provide the necessary capital to run the postal services as we would wish them to be run.  Why do the Government think now that all the necessary improvements can be made by handing the postal services over to a board and thereby reneging on the responsibility that falls on us as administrators and on the Minister as political head of the Department? So much, then, for my thoughts on the Bill <i>in toto.</i></P>
    <P>I am opposing this Bill in the strongest terms possible.  Those who have worked so faithfully down through the years in the postal services are entitled to continue in that service.  Because they are recognised civil servants they enjoy certain rights and privileges.  Therefore, we must ask whether the status quo will be continued so far as they are concerned. I expect that whatever rights they enjoy will be guaranteed for now but we must have regard to what might happen in future years when the postal services might be taken over by different boards. Attempts might be made at some future date to rob the staff concerned of their status.</P>
    <P>Another question is whether those recruited to this service from now on will be eligible for promotion into other areas of the civil service on foot of examinations as is the case now.  Will people recruited in the future have the same civil service status as that enjoyed by the staff in that area at present?  The staff have a right to have these questions answered. I understand that the recruitment will still be by way of the Civil Service Commission but I am only questioning whether that will continue to be the case in the <Col N="198" /> future.  We must not have another area in which influence will be brought to bear in the recruitment of staff.  Regardless of anything we might wish to say about how jobs are filled through the Civil Service Commission, I have yet to hear the commission being criticised on grounds of being unfair.  But I am talking about the future.  I fail to see how the integration of these civil servants into a non-civil service union will be effected.  I fail to see how people already in the service will be satisfied with the situation in the future. I know there have been discussions in this area and that there has been a White Paper concerning it, but there has been no agreement on any of these matters between the various unions and the board.</P>
    <P>We are discussing legislation for the setting up of two boards but I understand that there is a big building in this city on top of which appears the words, An Bord Poist.  Because of this, I am confused as to whether the board is already in existence. It seems that we are to run the Post Office service on a commercial basis, that we are to make it pay for itself.  I presume, then, that the other Departments will pay an economic rate for the services provided by the Post Office but I cannot see any gain in that sort of arrangement either for the taxpayer or the Government, who incidentally, have an easy method of providing this service.</P>
    <P>The service needs to be developed.  For instance, the Post Office savings system should be developed with a view to providing a proper banking service.  We have had a lot of talk about nationalising the banks and so on but the post offices should give a proper banking service.  In the Post Office there exists the basis for a proper banking service and the opportunity should have been availed of some time back to expand that service into the various field of commercial banking run by the State for the benefit of the people. I am sure the new boards will contemplate such a move.  However, our experience of boards is that they have not been a benefit to the people.  They may develop as a result of profit-making and that is good but here we are talking about a service that could be expanded to the <Col N="199" /> benefit of the people.  I include telecommunications in that.  Those services have been in existence for years and, as far as they were permitted, have been very successful. It must be remembered that it was up to this House to provide the money for those services.</P>
    <P>There may have been a change of mind since the Post Office strike some years ago.  Since then Ministers may have felt that they did not want to be responsible any longer.  Ministers refused to talk to those who were working under them at that time, they would not meet them and did not want anything to do with them. There has been an eagerness since to get rid of this sector and put it under some other form of control so that the responsibility would not lie where it should belong.  This is too important a service to be messing about with.  It is not clear to me how these areas of public service and those with civil service status will be integrated into these new operations which I am sure will still be carried on by the people behind the counter in the local post office.  In the past where it was not considered economic to retain civil service status for some services they were farmed out to post masters or post mistresses. It appears that in the Bill the Minister will have power to issue licences in certain circumstances to people to operate the service within the area of the post office and I am anxious to know exactly what that means and the services that may be used.  Will it include all post office services?</P>
    <P>I live in a rural area and I am aware that it may pay a local person who must go to town early in the morning to deliver the mail on his return journey.  Is that the type of service that may be farmed out? Is that the type of service that the Minister will be issuing licences for?  The people employed in the post office and those receiving mail are entitled to know who will be granted licences under the new system.  There are many people who would be anxious to take over the profitable part of the Post Office services and I feel that they will be hived off in different directions.  I am sure the Minister will issue licences on the recommendation of <Col N="200" /> the board but I am not sure that I would have full confidence in the ability of the board to do that.  The board may not be above doing certain handy things to hive off certain areas.</P>
    <P>We have been told that the telecommunications and postal services were starved of finance.  We are all aware of that and those of us who have been Members of this House for some time must accept full responsibility for that as must the Governments who have been in power over the years.  However, I should like to know where the investment for the new boards will come from.  Administrative costs will have to be met.  There will have to be an administrative section for each board.  Where do we separate them?  If I need an extra phone I apply to the local post master who is in the postal service but will he be asked to carry out that function for An Bord Telecom?  Will a post office clerk continue to collect telephone account payments?  If that is the case will there be a transfer of money between the two boards?  Such things are important.  Will the two boards run offices side by side throughout the country? The Minister may say that this is an administrative matter for each board and that sounds fine but I am anxious to know if we will now have two services bearing in mind that one service carried out both functions up to now.  It was done at a lesser cost.  I accept that it is difficult to expect people to figure out such matters now but they are practical problems and we must face up to them.  I can envisage the cost of administration of the two boards being colossal.</P>
    <P>A lot of mail is sent by the State annually and a check is kept on it.  An average is worked out but I should like to know if the same system will apply now or will a demand be made for each letter?  If proper payment was made in the past for all the services made available by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs I have no doubt that they would have almost broken even.</P>
    <P>I understand that the new boards will be permitted to borrow a certain amount and that the Minister will provide some funds directly.  The Minister will also have control over what the boards borrow. <Col N="201" /> I am not sure whether this will be borrowed in the public sector or will there be private investment?  If that is not the case the Minister should explain how it is intended to carry out all the improvements that have been mentioned.  It has been assumed that we will have many improvements over-night, that telephones will be available on demand and we will have a quicker method of delivering letters.  I can foresee a different situation arising.  I believe there will be a charge for certain methods of delivery, that there will be a charge that will guarantee quick delivery.  That will happen if, as has been stated, the new services are to be run on a commercial basis.  If that is so we are being hypocritical and withdrawing a service that our people have had the benefit of since before the State was founded.  If that is the case we are doing a nice con job on our people.  I cannot see any other way of making these services profitable.  The services cannot be provided unless we provide the capital. The Minister may say that he can approve of huge loans to improve the service and I accept he can but those loans must be paid for.  Will they be paid for by the boards?  I accept that the Government must provide the security. If those loans must be paid for by the boards where will they get the profit from which to pay that money?  It will not be easy to make a profit unless a different type of service is provided.  We have had experience with CIE closing down sections of the railway because they were unprofitable.  Will we be telling people that they will have to travel 12 miles to town to collect their post because it is not economic to deliver it?  If that is what is intended I will be opposing it.</P>
    <P>I will spell out what I mean by civil service standards.  These people who have been working in the Post Office have a right to promotion within the civil service at present.  Will that continue?  It is a very serious question to me.  It may not be a very serious question for the unions who are responsible for only their own members and that is fair enough, but it is very important that these people retain these rights which have been recognised since the foundation of the <Col N="202" /> State.  The pensions of those people must be borne, as far as I can discern, by the boards.  If that is so, will that be a burden on the boards?  Will it make it impossible for them even to provide, and will they have no alternative but to cut off the services which are uneconomic at that time when the crunch comes?  We have had the experience of the health boards cutting back this year on every side because the Government of the day, whoever they are or were, would not provide them with the wherewithal to keep the services at the standard they had reached.  Will the same apply two or three years hence?  The Government will have dilemmas and priorities and they may decide that the postal service can be cut back.  There will be no responsibility here in the House.  If you ask the Minister any question about cutbacks or anything else it will be a matter for the board.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that the issue of stamps and so on has been profitable and should be developed.  I agree with him also that the service being provided was a good one.  At least that was what he implied and I would like to ask the Minister why, if the service was as good as it could be with the money they got, we want to break it up and employ two boards to do the job.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, we have put £650 million into the provision of lines and telephone equipment over the years.  That is good, and many areas throughout the country are coming to the stage of having telephones on demand. However, at this stage will we hive it off on some people who will say &ldquo;See what we did in one stroke.  It took only a couple of months.  When you had this it was being messed around by civil servants and people like that&rdquo;?  That will be the situation.  They will be showing us how the service has improved since they took it over.  I put on the record of the House now that if I hear such a declaration I will ask the Minister to reconsider the whole concept of what he is doing.</P>
    <P>I will have much to say on the different stages of the Bill, but broadly what I am saying now is that I oppose it.  It may be well meant but I do not think that it will achieve what it claims it will achieve. <Col N="203" /> Nobody will provide the money necessary to develop the postal and telecommunications service in the manner envisaged. What has been invested was well invested, some of it from EEC sources, some from Government sources, and I applaud that, but I do not believe that it was enough.  The postal side was absolutely starved of capital for modern development, buildings and so on.  Post offices throughout the length and breadth of the country have not their full complement of staff and the staffs who were there were working overtime.  Many of the small offices should have three or four more on their staffs than they have, and the Minister knows that.  An embargo was imposed by the previous Government and is being continued by the present Government which means that those people cannot be replaced, yet overtime must be allowed.  We should have another look at this.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Minister is being honest enough, if he sits down to look at what he is doing, to realise that it is not the proper thing to do and that it is not in the best interests of the service which the people have the right to demand and to which they have been accustomed since before the foundation of this State. It is not right because it would increase tenfold the volume of the management and administration costs of the service. At least my experience, and I am sure the Minister's also, is that where boards were set up to run these services which had been operating in a different manner previously an increase in the costs of management and administration was the inevitable result.  That will take place under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The people within the service are very worried about this area.  While we have had consultation and White Papers, we have had no agreement.  I am in communication with people working within the service and they do not know what to expect.  They are confused, they are not sure of what rights they will have or where they will stand when the Minister gets this Bill through the House.  Even if he gets this legislation we will have a transition period of huge confusion.  It is <Col N="204" /> not a simple matter of saying that the civil service are in charge today and the board will be in charge tomorrow.  The Minister will meet many obstacles. Deputy Fitzpatrick said that he hoped that the 30,000 workers in this service will go over willingly, knowing where they are going.  We are on Second Stage of this Bill and I am willing to bet my bottom dollar that none of the people in the service knows exactly what they are facing in this transfer of authority from the State to a State body.  I warn all civil servants in all Departments that this is only the start of the hiving off of the whole civil service area to State bodies and eventually to private enterprise.  Private enterprise will eventually finance these things and will get the power to control them.  When that occurs the people who have been accustomed and entitled to the service will find that it will not be provided.</P>

      <P>I take it the Minister will not avail of that opportunity.  On 3 April last at about 6 o'clock in the evening the Minister made a statement that he intended to close the National Film Studios and put in a liquidator.  The Dáil had gone into recess two days earlier but the Minister could have availed of the opportunity of coming into the House, giving that information and allowing a debate to take place.  Instead he took the unusual step of giving the bad news at a time when the Sunday papers had already gone to press.  At the weekend people are apparently more interested in the football results than in bad news.  There was an attempt to fudge over this bad news at a time when the Dáil had just finished and public representatives could not raise the matter in the House.</P>
      <P>On the following Monday a meeting was convened at very short notice by the workers at the National Film Studios to inform the general public and anybody who wished to attend the meeting of their views on the Minister's decision and to give the Minister their answer to the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth giving the House a little of the background to film making in Ireland so that there will be an appreciation of what has been done by this decision to put the studios into liquidation.  International films are, perhaps, best remembered by people but it is important to point out that there has been an indigenous film industry here since the foundation of the State and even earlier.  The Abbey Theatre players took a major part in many of the locally made films in the early decades of the State.  The first film which I recall being made on a very large budget was <i>Henry V</i> starring Laurence Olivier.  As a schoolboy, I remember that film being made in Wicklow and in Dublin.  The studios at Ardmore had not then been established.  This was the first big film to bring to the attention of the <Col N="206" /> Hollywood magnates the potential of Ireland as a location for film making.</P>
    <P>The National Film Studios were originally set up in 1958 as the Ardmore Film Studios and one of the early films made there was <i>Shake Hands With The Devil</i>, starring James Cagney.  In the sixties a film called <i>The Blue Max</i> starring George Peppard was made on location here.  This very building was used as part of the set for some of the scenes in that film, so even Dáil Éireann has a connection with film making.  Outside we had &ldquo;German soldiers&rdquo; prancing up and down.  Trinity College was also used.  <i>The Lion in Winter</i> starring Peter O'Toole won six Academy Awards.  Surely everybody remembers <i>The Spy Who Came In From The Cold</i> starring Richard Burton and in the seventies we had <i>The Purple Taxi</i> starring Fred Astaire and Peter Ustinov.  I may be reminding Members of pleasant occasions in the past but these films underline the quality of the work done at Ardmore with the services and expertise of the workers there.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Purple Taxi</i> also had a little connection with the Dáil because the then Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, visited the set in Ardmore and I am sure he appreciated the quality of that film.  By some coincidence the pub in that film, which was supposed to be in Galway, was called the &ldquo;Jack Lynch&rdquo; pub.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Great Train Robbery</i> starring Séan Connery was also made in the seventies and the most recent major international film to be made at Ardmore was <i>Excalibur</i> produced by John Boorman, the chairman of the National Film Studios. That film received the best artistic award at the Cannes Film Festival.</P>
    <P>I mention these films in order to underline the quality of the product which Ardmore was and is capable of producing.  I do not want to make a case just for an international film facility at Ardmore because I believe more than that can be done there.  I want the House to understand what will happen as a result of the liquidator being sent in unless this decision is reversed by the Government.  The employment potential was great.  At the height of the film making some 300 people were employed as extras.  That is <Col N="207" /> always possible when a big film is being made whether in Ardmore or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>When Ardmore was set up, initially as Ardmore Studios Bray Ltd. and later as Ardmore Studios International Ltd., it had its troubles.  The film industry has its ups and downs, peaks and hollows, booms and setbacks.  In 1975 it was agreed by the Coalition Government to set up the National Film Studios of Ireland, use Ardmore studios and incorporate it as the basis for the film industry in Ireland.  The then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Keating, brought legislation before the House.  It was unanimously agreed that that should be the location of the Irish film industry.  Shortly after Fianna Fáil came to power, the financial advances made to the film board dropped considerably.  In 1979, £525,900 was made available in grants but in 1980 only £157,000 was made available.  It was not unusual that by the end of 1981 the deficit should be climbing when the industry was starved of the necessary finance it should have had during the intervening years.</P>
    <P>During the 23 years of film-making at Bray, the industry attracted 84 full-length feature films.  If the facilities had not been there these films would not have been made here.  I do not say that all these films were made or serviced in Ardmore but the name internationally connected with film-making here is Ardmore. During that period the total production expenditure on all these films was between £83 million and £85 million.  I do not want to mislead the House.  That was not money that was spent by the National Film Studios but money spent on production in this country.  Since 1975 when the film industry was set up, £12½ million has been spent by international film makers here.  The total losses incurred amounted to 2½ million.  The wages and salaries bill came to £2.2 million.  Although the country benefited to the tune of £12½ million, the studio lost £2½ million.  There is no suggestion or cover-up that this was a highly profitable studio but people who worked in Ardmore and others who were available as extras between them put £2.2 million into their pockets.  As against the <Col N="208" /> salaries paid the loss is identical &mdash; £2.2 million as against £2½ million.</P>
    <P>If films were not made here what would those people have done?  They would be on the dole.  The ESB benefited as did the transport industry and others in the immediate area, for example, publicans, guest houses, hotels and so on.  I did not include in the figure of £85 million the benefit to the tourist industry.  The short-term profit that would be generated by a film being made in an area has been removed because of the decision taken.</P>
    <P>The work available in the Bray area at Ardmore was sufficient for a permanent staff of 46.  This has been reduced to 11 and if the liquidator and the Government have their way they will also go.  I am not talking about the possibility of giving back jobs to 35 people but about the blow the closing down of the studio will be to an industry with a vast potential.  Many famous people have made submissions to the Minister.  He has been bombarded with material from all sides.  The most important group to put a submision forward were the workers.  They compiled a very erudite document and sent it to the Minister for consideration.  It has been made available to all public representatives in the constituency.  Those who attended public meetings were made aware of it.  Contributions were expanded on by those with an interest in the film industry.  I should like to made a few comments on the workers' submission. They told the Minister that Ardmore is a valuable national asset and should remain so for the following reasons.</P>
    <P>(a)  Ardmore Studios is the only film studios within the State.  Its contribution to the country's prestige abroad is enormous and it is an intrinsic part of the cultural life of Ireland in the same way as the Abbey Theatre, Radio-Telefís Éireann, the National Concert Hall etc.</P>
    <P>(b)  The initial concept for Ardmore Studios was to present on film, our Irish culture to the world, utilising the best of Irish technical, craft and acting skills.  The aspirations that motivated Louis Elliman and Major General Emmet Dalton, the founders of Ardmore <Col N="209" /> Studios, can find new life in this generation of Irish film workers and film makers.</P>
    <P>(c)  We must ensure that Ireland retains its rightful place in the rapidly expanding communications industry, with the advent of satellite TV, Cable TV and video production.  It would be a national tragedy if the State were to dispose of our one facility which is geared to avail of these opportunities and place it in the control of private industry.  A restructured Ardmore Studios must be retained within the State sector, possibly in co-operation with Bord Scannán, Radio Telefís Éireann and various other Government bodies.</P>
    <P>That was the reasonable demand made by the workers to the Minister.  The Minister, under the terms of his amendment, would continue the liquidator's operation to dispose of the assets and, in some other way through private industry, bring together some sort of film production team at Ardmore.</P>
    <P>I am pleading with the Minister this evening to revoke the notices sent to the 35 workers.  That is a reasonable request to the Minister, to show his earnest in a real Irish film industry.  Thirty-five is not a great many jobs when compared with the whole of the employment problem at present confronting this country.  For example, it would cost the IDA nearly £20,000 to replace 35 jobs in a factory. We are not asking for that; the facility and jobs are there.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister announced the closure of the National Film Studios a very large production film has been lost to this country &mdash; I want to put this on record &mdash; a film called &ldquo;The Jigsaw Man&rdquo;.  That film would have brought £450,000 per week to this country for 6 or 7 weeks.  I want the Minister to realise that such would have been the yield from that film had his announcement not been made. When my colleague, Deputy Gemma Hussey, raised the matter of the National Film Studios on the Adjournment some weeks ago the Minister said there was no contract for a film.  I am afraid this illustrates that the Minister for Industry and Energy knows very little about the film <Col N="210" /> industry because the people involved do not hawk contracts around from one country to another.  Deals in that industry are made perhaps over a bar counter, perhaps on the back of a piece of paper which is passed on and built on afterwards. While the Minister may have been correct to say no contract was then available it should be realised that that film was known to have been available to this country.  That film with a consequent yield of £450,000 a week was lost to our economy.  When the closure announcement was made 46 jobs were put at risk immediately.  Since the liquidator was aware that that closure would have to be communicated to a number of workers, letters were issued, on 4 June only, to 35 members of the staff.  As a former Minister for Labour I should say that a semi-State body issuing that type of letter to its employees demonstrates little knowledge of the various Bills passed in this House in 1977 about how to sack employees.  It shows little or no knowledge of how properly to go about sacking employees nowadays, when one remembers that employers must comply with certain laws passed in this House.  This letter read:</P>
    <P>Dear Mr. X</P>
    <P>Wages and Salaries:</P>
    <P>Any wages and salaries due to you up until 5.30 p.m. on 4 June 1982 (other than the Labour Court award) will be paid by cheque and sent in the post on Wednesday 9 June 1982.</P>
    <P>Holiday Pay:</P>
    <P>Any holiday pay due to you until 5.30 p.m. on 4 June 1982 will be paid by cheque and sent in the post on Wednesday 9 June 1982.</P>
    <P>Minimum Notice:</P>
    <P>Your entitlement to pay in lieu of minimum notice will have to be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and their award will be paid in full as soon as funds are available.</P>
    <P>Redundancy:</P>
    <P>You should make a claim for your redundancy at the local Department of Labour office.  I will be completing the <Col N="211" /> appropriate forms which are entitled RP1, RP2 and RP3 and forwarding them to the Department of Labour within the next few days.</P>
    <P>This letter was supposed to be handed to an employee who was being sacked and this was to be done on behalf of the State. The letter continued:</P>
    <P>Labour Court Award:</P>
    <P>The Labour Court's award in respect of restaurant, travelling allowance and pay increase has now been approved by the relevant Government authority.</P>
    <P>Pension Scheme:</P>
    <P>Your benefits under the pension scheme are now being calculated by the Trustees and the Life and Pension Company and you will be advised of the options available to you within the near future.</P>
    <P>P45:</P>
    <P>Your P45 will be sent to you by post on 9 June 1982.</P>
    <P>I wonder what would have been the case had an employee died between the time this letter was issued and the announcement of closure of the studios?  I wonder would such an employee's widow be entitled to benefit?  I suppose there would have been some difficulty encountered there also.  The letter ended:</P>
    <P>Date of commencement:</P>
    <P>According to the company's records available to us your date of commencement of employment was 1 April 1974.</P>
    <P>They did not even seem to have available records of their employees.  This demonstrates the haste there was in closing down these studios, haste by a Government barely in office.  Surely this is not an 1982 version of a Fianna Fáil contribution to the economic ills of this country, to close down the National Film Studios.</P>

      <P>The point has been made that unemployment could have been avoided had certain decisions like these been taken.  But since this Government have resumed office, Noritake have let go a large number of their employees on short time, Arklow Pottery also and Arklow/Gypsum when they were in office before, which involved 150 people in December 1980.  Also there were 400 people let go in Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta when they were last in office. Then there were Metal Spinners in Newtownmountkennedy and a factory in Kilcoole. Before we came into office in 1981 a decision had been taken by the then Government to close Avoca Mines with a loss of 147 jobs.  We reversed that decision. Avoca Mines are now working away and that industry's contribution in foreign <Col N="213" /> earnings is considerable.  Since Fianna Fáil have resumed office an industry destined for Rathdrum, one of the smaller towns in my constituency, that of Trek Bicycles, has somehow moved from there and is setting up in a different county.  That decision was taken in the last few months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to hear about the employment situation in Wicklow let me say that one of the unfortunate things about Ardmore Studios was that, in the recent general election, Fianna Fáil won one seat in the Wicklow constituency; there remained three seats, two of which went to Fine Gael and one to Labour.  That was the return.  I think the Minister is taking it out on the people of Wicklow by the litany of decisions taken affecting the people of Wicklow.  It would appear he is, taking it out on their employment potential because they did not return two Dáil Deputies for them. I hope Deputy Murphy will come in to back me up on this sad affair.  He certainly has to bear the brunt of the problem created by the closure of Ardmore. The studio is in his town approximately a mile from where he lives.</P>
      <P>I am making the case for the continuation of Ardmore Studios.  I am not the only one who has done so.  Many eminent people have been in touch with the Minister. The editorial in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 16 April 1982 said:</P>
      <P>Mr. Haughey's encouragement of the arts is well known, something unique among Irish politicians for which he deserves the highest credit. Again, one wonders whether the decision takers involved in the decision to close Ardmore and put a number of very talented and dedicated people out of work was fully teased out with him before a decision so out of character was taken.</P>

    <P>The Government's favourite journal have a considerable query in relation to what was going on there.  People like King Vidor, Carrol O'Connor, Pat <Col N="214" /> O'Brien, Michael O'Herlihy, Dan O'Herlihy, Royal Dano, Iva Goff, Ben Roberts, Meta Rosenberg, Sandy Howard and Dana Wynter have also appealed on behalf of the studios.  There are a number of quotations I could give from people who have pleaded with the Government to reverse the decision which was taken.</P>
    <P>I am pleading with the Minister to reverse his decision, to think again about what he has done to County Wicklow, to think again of what he has done to the industry, to consider that there is another way of going about this, that there is an Irish film industry which can operate from this studio.  If it is possible at this stage, will the Minister remove the liquidator and appoint a receiver?  A liquidator is put into a premises to liquidate an asset, to liquidate a company such as the National Film Studios.  Is it not possible to put in a receiver who will manage the studios while some new arrangement can be arrived at?  If that is not possible can the liquidator not appoint a manager to run this studio for a period while there is a rethink of Government policy on it?</P>
    <P>I know this decision was taken in haste and that there was not enough thinking behind it.  I know there has been a considerable backlash against the Government because of this very thoughtless act. I suggest to the Minister that the studio should remain under Irish control.  I agree with Sinn Féin's amendment that public ownership is the best solution to control the film industry in Ireland.  I suggest that the Irish Film Board, the IDA and RTE could take shares in the new company and control the film studios in Ardmore.  If the film studios are run on a tight budget and on a sound basis they can make money and can certainly break even.  During the period of caretaker management between 1973 and 1975 by RTE the studios were run at a trading profit.  The real reason why losses were made during that period was because of the heavy burden of financial charges.</P>
    <P>I put those proposals forward to the Minister for consideration.  We have the ability over the next few days to think again about the decision which has been <Col N="215" /> made.  I do not believe there will be any loss of face if the decision is reversed. There will be great relief by a number of people who have lost their jobs in the film industry, especially the 35 people who have got their notice, if the Minister takes another look at this matter and agrees to the proposals I have made.  If the Minister says he agrees with the proposals I will be quite happy to withdraw the motion in the name of the Labour Party and to accept an amendment, which will include the proposals I have put forward.</P>
    <P>The Minister must surely say to the House that he will continue the employment of the 35 people who have got notice.  Their expertise and their knowledge of the industry should be maintained for the future of the Irish film industry.  The future of this industry is in danger if people like that are let go.  The only thing they can do is to take the emigrant ship.  There are facilities locked up in Ardmore at the moment which are required.  A company from Britain are hiring equipment from Britain to make a commercial at £500 when the equipment is locked up in Ardmore and could be used.  I do not believe there will be any crowing from this side of the House if the Minister changes his mind and if he continues the film industry at Ardmore.  We will know that he is set on the right course to ensure we have a secure Irish film industry, based on Irish control and Irish-made films, that can make the facilities available to any international operators who wish to use them but that can also be used in Ardmore for the purposes the workers committee put forward to the Minister when he met them.</P>
    <P>I know the interests of the Minister who is here tonight were looked after in the west of Ireland at a much greater cost to the community than the small amount of money which would keep this industry going at Ardmore.  Wicklow is not the wealthy part of Ireland which people west of the Shannon think it is.  There is a great scarcity of industry in County Wicklow. Most of this has been caused by the Fianna Fáil Government, who now have the opportunity to reverse what they have <Col N="216" /> been doing to industry and employment in Wicklow.  I again appeal to the Minister to meet the reasonable case put forward for the maintenance of an Irish film studio at Ardmore.  I assure him that the reasonable people from the studios who met him will certainly be prepared to talk about the future of the plant and equipment as well as the land that is there.  If the sound equipment and the buildings at Ardmore are sold we cannot see a future for an Irish film industry.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;industry&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and the proposed disposal of the National Film Studios of Ireland Ltd. by the liquidator, Dáil Éireann requests the Government to take all reasonable steps to maintain the studio facilities at Ardmore, Bray, County Wicklow.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Government's decision to close the National Film Studios of Ireland Ltd. was taken in the knowledge of the substantial losses that had been incurred by it in the past and that there was no realistic prospect that these could be eliminated. Losses between 1977 and 1981 alone amounted to £2½ million and were projected to accelerate to £¾ million in 1982.  Even operating the studios on a four wall basis in 1982 would have meant a loss of almost £½ million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one considers that the State has invested not only the £½ million purchase price, together with £100,000 in equity investment, and £1.5 million in direct Exchequer grants, it will be seen that, when added to bank borrowings of £1.8 million not much less than £4 million has been put into the company since it was taken over by the State.  An important point to remember when discussing the Company's borrowings is that these were guaranteed by the Exchequer and that there is a statutory limit of £2 million on such guarantees.  Since the bank was unwilling to increase its facilities to the company without such a guarantee, and since the company required in excess of £50,000 per month over and above any <Col N="217" /> commercial earnings to stay in business, it was apparent that NFSI needed some other source of finance to stay in business. Realistically, the only source for that finance was by provision for it in the 1982 Estimates and no such provision was made in the Estimates drafted by the Coalition Government.  Indeed, I am somewhat bemused to note that the former Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Energy is a signatory to this motion, which urges that whatever steps are necessary be taken by the Government to maintain the studios, when, under his stewardship, action was taken totally contrary to the sense of this motion.  I am aware that it has been suggested that the then Minister was going to restructure the board of NFSI.  I regret to say that that would have been a meaningless gesture in the absence of the funds necessary to keep the company operating.</P>
    <P>In assessing the situation, the Government were aware that the relatively massive losses in the studios were due mainly to an inadequate volume of business and that there seemed to be no prospect of improvement in this regard.  The situation in the film industry world wide appeared to be that the vast bulk of small and medium budget films are shot on location and that use of studios' facilities largely arises in connection with big budget films.  Irrespective of the efforts of the film board on behalf of the studios there seemed to be little prospect of ever securing anything like an adequate flow of films requiring the use of the studios' facilities.  In this regard, it might be pointed out that the need to support the National Film Studios and to ensure it some degree of turnover to minimise losses could have led to the absorption of a disproportionate amount of the film board's funds at the expense of the independent film makers who, in any realistic consideration of the matter, must be the source and foundation of a real Irish film industry.</P>
    <P>I think the latter point can best be illustrated by pointing out that it was estimated in 1978 that the attraction of feature film making to Ardmore could cost £350,000 per film.  When one remembers that the film board had £110,000 in <Col N="218" /> 1981 and £390,000 has been provided in the 1982 Estimates, it is apparent that in current price terms the board would not have sufficient to attract even one reasonable feature film per year to Ardmore, and at that would have nothing left for the independent producers.  I believe this was the reasoning behind John Boorman's very realistic assessment of the situation when he recognised that Exchequer moneys are better invested directly in film production and would yield greater opportunities for job creation and the retention of skills in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the perception that the studios had indeed been swallowing all of the Exchequer's resources devoted to the development of a film industry in Ireland had led to growth of a hostility towards NFSI from some independent producers and other factions who actively boycotted the facilities.</P>
    <P>It is also relevant to quote here the Dáil Committee of Public Accounts when reporting in November 1979 on the studios. It had this to say.  &ldquo;It appears to the Committee that public moneys are being spent on keeping alive a business which simply would not survive in the private commercial field.  Furthermore, since it is commonly known that studios of this kind throughout the world are closing down, what is being done in this case could possibly be regarded as more in the nature of a public relations operation than the creation of a viable industry. The question which therefore concerns the Committee is the extent to which public moneys should continue to be spent on prestige and status and it feels therefore that because of the grave doubts as to the viability of NFSI, a speedy decision must be made as to the future involvement of the State in this enterprise.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested that the Government have been too narrow in their interpretation of the financial benefits to the economy from the operations of NFSI and that account should also be taken of the money spent in the country by film makers using the studios' facilities.  A figure of £12.5 million is cited in this regard as having been spent in Ireland since the studios were taken over by the State, and that this should justify Exchequer expenditure to date.  Apart altogether from the fact that some of this money might have been spent in the country if the studios did not exist, and particularly that it almost certainly would have if the studios existed as a private concern, incurring expenditure of almost £4 million to achieve spending in this country of £12 million, and for which it must be emphasised these film makers would have received good value in terms of materials and services bought, makes no financial sense whatsoever.  Although the example might be considered by some as a bit far-fetched, an illustration of the weakness of this factor as a justification for NFSI is that over the years 1976-1980 Bord Fáilte has generated spending in this country of some £1,948 million in return for a State input of £69 million.  In other words, the State got a 28 to one return on its investment in Bord Fáilte compared to a three or four to one return on investment in NFSI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the House will best appreciate the Government's position from the following: in terms of the budgetary needs of the Film Board in the context of extensive operations in relation to NFSI, the stated need for a tax incentive scheme, which, if it were to encourage Irish film-making would undoubtedly have meant a loss of tax revenue, to encourage film-making at Ardmore, the need to re-equip the studios ailing facilities, the cost of servicing existing borrowings and the potential for further losses, it is apparent that the cost to the State of keeping the studios open could have amounted to £2 million per year or a staggering £40,000 per job per annum.  Given the imperative <Col N="220" /> need for available resources to be concentrated to the maximum extent on the creation of self-sustaining employment, this would represent a colossal waste of the taxpayers money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of such substantial sums simply could not be justified on any rational scheme of priorities.</P>
      <P>In the light of the foregoing, the Government had no alternative but to authorise the closure and liquidation of the company at the earliest possible date. They did this in the knowledge that interest had been expressed by private sector parties in acquiring the studios.  The liquidator is having discussions with several groups at present with a view to the sale of the studios as studios, and he is making every possible effort to achieve this objective since we are all in agreement that this is highly desirable.  However, as stated by the Minister for Industry and Energy in the Dáil on 18 May in reply to Deputy Collins' request for an assurance that in disposing of the assets of the company he would ensure that a film-making facility is retained there, a commitment to do this regardless of cost cannot realistically be given.</P>
      <P>It is for this reason that I have proposed an amendment to the motion, which requests the Government to take whatever steps are necessary to maintain and develop the studio facilities.  Such an undertaking would be tantamount to a guarantee that, regardless of cost, studio facilities would be maintained there and that if ultimately necessary it would be done under State ownership.  To accept such a position, after carefully arriving at the exact opposite as the appropriate conclusion, would be both inconsistent and seriously wrong.  Consequently, I proposed the amendment, which I think reflects the Government's strong commitment to the retention of film facilities at Ardmore, consistent with the need to bear the taxpayers' interest in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was listening to Deputy Kavanagh when he suggested that the Minister for Industry and Energy had timed the announcement of the closure so as to <Col N="221" /> fudge the issue for the general public.  I do not think that that is consistent with the form of the Minister for Industry and Energy when making announcements.  It must be borne in mind that the statement was issued in the normal way, was given full publicity and was reported extensively in all the media and newspapers over several days of publication.  It was unfair of Deputy Kavanagh to suggest that the Minister tried to fudge the issue in the way he stated.</P>
    <P>We all accept it was regrettable that this step had to be taken but it was the only option open in accordance with the facts I have set out before the House. Deputy Kavanagh has not put forward any feasible alternative or option except to say that somehow or other we should take back and re-employ the people there without giving them a general idea of where they might be going subsequently.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh listed a number of excellent films produced in the studios during the years and which I know gave great pleasure to many people.  However, I ask him to bear in mind that many of the films made there more than likely would have been filmed in this country anyway.  It is not consistent for him to say that it was because of the facilities that the films were produced here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh referred to the considerable skills of the people employed at Ardmore.  I understand fully <Col N="222" /> that there were people there with considerable skills, but it is important that we understand precisely the breakdown of the skills involved.  I understand that some 46 people were employed over a period.  Out of the 46 people employed some eight of the total workforce would have been involved in camera, electrical and sound work.  They would be the most highly skilled technical people employed at Ardmore.  Eight others were employed in construction work.  From my limited knowledge of construction work in studios I believe these people were joiners, carpenters and other props people.  I understand also that of the total workforce some 14 people were involved in administration work.  I take it that would be the typical type of administration work one would find in such an organisation involving accountancy and other skills necessary for that area.  The remaining 16 people or thereabouts would be involved in security measures and there were some other staff involved with other facilities and general operations.  While all of these people in their own right could be regarded as skilled in one way or another, I think the skills the Deputy was referring to were those connected with electrical, camera and sound operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>All the others are just as much entitled to be considered but from the contribution of Deputy Kavanagh the suggestion seemed to be that we were talking about 46 people who were highly skilled in technical matters as far as film making is concerned.  That is not the case, and the record should be put right in that regard.  I fully recognise that Ireland is an excellent location because of geography and climate and picturesque scenery for the purpose of filming on location.  I agree that every effort should be made by the powers that be and all those connected with film making in one way or another to attract to this beautiful location any films that can possibly be attracted. Deputy Kavanagh is quite right in saying that considerable numbers of people get temporary employment on a casual basis <Col N="223" /> when major films are being filmed on location.  But I would suggest to the Deputy that some of the major films, and one rather major film in my own county in recent years, did employ considerable numbers and, as I understand it, were not involved in any subsequent film making inside in Ardmore Studios.  So the suggestion that if we cease operations in Ardmore we are going to kill off Ireland as a suitable place for filming on location is not quite accurate.  I am quite sure the facilities we have by way of terrain, topography, geography and so on will continue to be an attraction and an incentive to the best and biggest film makers to come here and film on location.  Caithfidh siad sin a chur san áireamh freisin nuair a bhíonn tú ag caint maidir le daoine a mheallú chun na tíre seo chun scannáin a chur ar fáil agus a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>It is incumbent on me to mention a reference that was made because it might lead people to think that the Minister or any of his agents were involved in something not quite human in the way the employees were dealt with.  I would like to correct the notion that perhaps some semi-State organisation sent out letters that caused some concern to the former employees.  As I understand it &mdash; and I will be delighted to stand back from this if I am given good grounds &mdash; the letters referred to by Deputy Kavanagh were issued by the liquidator and not by any of the staff of the semi-State company and I would expect that the liquidator, being skilled in his trade, would know the proper format for sending out such notifications. I presume that these were attended to with all due propriety.</P>

      <P>I am wont to misunderstand a lot of things, but at the same time I would be delighted if at some future date perhaps the Deputy could refresh me on that matter and perhaps put me on the right line.  I understood him to say that it was a casual or inhuman method of dealing with employees.  While I can <Col N="224" /> readily understand the difficulties of a liquidator, when he moves into a situation he has to be not casual but very clear and distinct in what he does with the funds made available to him for the purpose of winding up or other form of activity he may be engaged in on behalf of the State or company and he would have to conform with very strict procedures in dealing with the funds made available to him.  I presume the liquidator, skilled as he is in these administrative matters, did all in accordance with proper procedure. I would be concerned if I thought he did otherwise.</P>
      <P>I heard what Deputy Kavanagh suggested concerning the Wicklow constituency. It was the second thing the Deputy said this evening that I thought was a little unfair and not his normal type of contribution.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when we find ourselves in the minority, which has not happened for some time and is not likely to happen in the foreseeable future.  It was suggested that perhaps because there were two Fine Gael Deputies in the Wicklow constituency, one Labour Deputy and one Fianna Fáil Deputy the Minister was getting back at the constituency for not having done the thing properly on behalf of Fianna Fáil on the last outing.  My <Col N="225" /> reaction to that, on finding myself in the minority situation, would be to do all I could to enhance the prospects of the return of Fianna Fáil to what Fianna Fáil should be in that constituency by the elimination of one Fine Gael or Labour candiate the next time out.</P>

I would ask him to bear in mind that some of the people who were sitting behind him on the Labour benches were very vocal in opposing this.  It is reassuring to hear now that the penny has dropped and that there has been a change of heart in many on the Labour benches, just as there has been a change of heart in many on the front bench of Fine Gael concerning a project which shall be nameless because it is now nationally well known.  I have no doubt that we will be hearing more about it despite the fact that there has been somewhat of a lull in regard to it since the general election. But it serves no purpose now because it <Col N="226" /> is going to be the finest project ever promoted by any Department or agency.</P>

It is not the wish of the Government to do anything to reduce employment levels.  It is regrettable that this step had to be taken.  But it has been agreed by all that there is no way this operation can be made viable.  But, despite all that, the Minister is so concerned that we should have facilities here and that this country should be utilised as a major location for film making now and in the future that he is using all the good offices at his disposal to get an operator involved to continue the studios if at all possible in the private sector and I am happy that this might come about in the not too distant future.  Then we might all be in a position to accommodate the skills of the technicians involved in sound and camera who were employed there in the recent past.</P>

Listening to the Minister's speech which, I am sorry to say, I found difficult enough to listen to, I got the impression we were at a burlesque show. It was a pity a note of what I would describe as derision entered this debate which is very serious for the constituents represented by my Labour colleague and for the future of an Irish film industry, and all the implications that has for those involved in the artistic and cultural life.</P>
      <P>When the Government's amendment came to hand it implied a change of heart. Despite the rather bizarre amendment with a member of the Government to take all reasonable steps&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>To me it seems very strange, whether or not it is normal.  The <Col N="228" /> Government's amendment appeared to imply something quite different from what unfortunately emerged from the Minister's speech, which in many ways resembled the replies given by the Minister for Industry and Energy to the representations made to him in this House by myself and others since this decision was first taken.  I fully agree with Deputy Kavanagh when he deplores the manner in which this announcement was made, late on a Saturday evening.  Such a sudden announcement caused a great deal of shock and distress.</P>
      <P>I approach this matter under two headings &mdash; one as my party's spokesperson in that area and, secondly, as a person who was reared on the road in which the studios are situated.  In the Minister's speech there was no reference to the artistic or cultural benefits of having film studios in Ireland.  This would seem to run counter to the Taoiseach's stance on the arts and to put a question mark over his commitment to the encouragement of the arts.  As was quoted earlier, <i>The Irish Press</i> made that point very forcibly in their editorial which asked for a change of heart in this and two other areas.  They described it as &ldquo;a decision out of character with Mr. Haughey's record of artistic encouragement&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Very strong reaction to the decision came from many people, especially, the studio workers who, since the announcement of closure, have proceeded in a very organised way to make their case.  They were joined by some people the Minister accused of being hostile to the studios &mdash; independent film producers and many bodies involved in film making.  The general outcry surprised the Government and I had hoped that by now it would have made more of an impact than it seems to have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad the Labour Party tabled this motion because it gives us a renewed opportunity to make a case for the very special circumstances surrounding the Ardmore film studios.  I would like to endorse the concern expressed by Deputy Kavanagh when he placed this closure in the context of what the county has suffered through a loss of employment in recent years.  It seems to the <Col N="229" /> people in County Wicklow that not a week goes by but they get more bad news about job losses.  This shock announcement on 3 April had a great effect on them.  I had hoped that this renewed effort on the part of concerned people, particularly the public representatives from the county, would have elicited a more temperate response.</P>
    <P>I would ask also whether the Government had seriously considered the film industry in the context of a newly-established Irish Film Board with a budget of £4 million over four years.  I expected from the Minister of State an outline of what the Government felt was the place of an Irish film industry in Ireland of the eighties and the prospects of such an industry as society, we hope, emerges from the recent sad recession years. Unfortunately, no such light was thrown on that subject or, from an artistic point of view, on whether the Government consider the film an art form.  That is one of the saddest features of the Minister of State's speech.</P>
    <P>When the sudden closure of the studios was announced on 3 April &mdash; which closure was subsequently delayed for many weeks, I believe because of reaction to the unexpected protests from so many sectors of society &mdash; there was general amazement that something so important would have been axed so very quickly. Extraordinarily, this announcement coincided, as far as I am aware, with the first public meeting of the Irish Film Board.  This board met to discuss their role in the future of the Irish film industry when our only film studios were being closed.  My understanding is that the Irish Film Board would like the National Film Studios to remain as a studio facility, as a back-up for a future Irish film industry.</P>
    <P>It is important to say that I would not ask for a re-opening of the film studios as an adjunct to Hollywood.  Everyone, looking at the difficulties which the studios have faced over the last few years, is aware that there is a need for a new look at the structure and operation of the studios.  I do not believe that Deputy Kavanagh was asking &mdash; and I certainly am not &mdash; either for the creation or retention of unreal jobs.  The people working <Col N="230" /> in the studios do not want unreal jobs &mdash; they wish to be part of a lively, growing, profit-making industry.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the Minister's speech omitted any reference to the £2 million a year commercial film making business. Short commercial films have been made extensively at these studios.  The input from commercial film making was not enough, unfortunately, to overcome all the financial difficulties.  However, the commercial film making industry has a spin-off effect on a far wider spectrum than the technical people and others involved in the Ardmore studios in Bray. It involves, perhaps, as many as 100 to 120 technicians around the country involved in the making of commercial films.  Without the facility of Ardmore studios, many involved in that industry believe that it will take itself off to the nearest large centre equipped with the studio facilities needed &mdash; that is, London &mdash; and that that growing industry will be lost to us as well.  I am sorry that we did not discuss the future of that section of the film industry, which is extremely important.</P>
    <P>Nobody would undertake now the building and fully equipping of film studios such as we have in Ardmore.  Those studios are an asset which should and must, be kept for the use of an Irish film industry and the development of film making here in general.  Ardmore studios were expensive enough to build many years ago but they are of a very high standard and it would be the utmost folly and a very negative approach to allow them to disappear.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh mentioned in passing that from 1973 to 1975 the studios made a small profit.  They were then under the caretaker management of RTE.  I believe that it would be possible to return to that situation quite quickly if the Minister would only use his undoubted talents and business sense to look anew at the industry, at the studios and their running.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that the debts accumulated by the studios will be wiped out if they are to be sold to someone who will use them for a film industry.  It is logical enough to suggest that if the Minister <Col N="231" /> is prepared to wipe out these debts he should wipe them out and start the studios again rather than hand them over unencumbered to somebody else.  That aspect was not mentioned at all.</P>
    <P>A very important aspect is the question of the employment of the undoubted Irish acting talent.  For example, the Abbey Theatre has a corps of some of the finest actors in Europe, if not, the world.  The Minister did not complain about the continuing sizeable grants to the Abbey Theatre, which is considered a part of our artistic heritage &mdash; grants which should be much higher.  It is important to consider the film studios, not only as a business &mdash; there are much wider aspects to the question than industrial <Col N="232" /> and commercial.  Unfortunately, the Minister appears to be approaching this question to the exclusion of any other aspects.  The pending unemployment of the actors was one of the reasons why Irish Actors' Equity were so upset about the threatened closure of the studios.  The development of the creative skills of Irish film makers will cease if the film industry is not allowed to develop, using the studios not only as an area for the making of films of commercial value but also for training young film makers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has joined with its partners in the European Community in vigorously condemning the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.  It considers the Israeli action a flagrant violation of international law and has called on Israel to withdraw its <Col N="62" /> forces immediately and unconditionally from the Lebanon, in accordance with Security Council Resolution 509.</P>
      <P>Ireland voted in the Security Council on 8 June for a draft resolution which envisaged a further meeting of that body to consider practical ways and means in accordance with the UN Charter to induce compliance with its earlier Resolutions on the situation.  As Deputies are aware this draft resolution was not adopted.  Diplomatic efforts are however still in train to secure the implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions. The Government will contribute in whatever way it can to these efforts.</P>
      <P>Ireland is at the same time involved in examining, together with its partners in the Ten, the possibilities for future action if Israeli forces do not withdraw from Lebanon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The role of UNIFIL as set out in its mandate is and always has been one of peacekeeping and not peace-enforcement. Ireland is fully committed to such operations and has on numerous occasions underlined its support for the concept of peacekeeping under the control of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Ireland is in continuous discussion with the Secretary-General of the United Nations and with other troop contributing countries as to the future role of UNIFIL.</P>
      <P>In the present very difficult and uncertain climate of the Lebanon it is impossible to predict future requirements. However, we support the view that UNIFIL should remain in the Lebanon as long as it has a peacekeeping role to play.  Ireland would wish to remain a troop contributor to the force in such circumstances.</P>

      <P>In relation to 1982 and for following years, the Health Education Bureau has moved away from the topic-orientated campaign approach to health education which it has used in the past &mdash; for example, in relation to anti-smoking.  The bureau has now adopted a life-cycle model in framing its programme format in an effort to identify key issues, phases and needs in health and illness throughout the life cycle.  The overall aim of the bureau's new approach to health education is to provide the means and opportunities for all vulnerable people to protect, maintain and improve their health as far as educational methods permit.</P>
      <P>Because of the nature of the bureau's revised approach to programme planning which concentrates through its component parts on phases in the life cycle &mdash; for example, infancy, childhood, mid-life and later life &mdash; costings are not readily available for the individual aspects of programmes.  There are in fact ten programmes, each one having a single overall costing figure in respect of its separate core elements.</P>
      <P>I am forwarding a copy of the bureau's programme for 1982 to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In view of my particular concern over the increasing problem of substance abuse generally, including drugs, glue, alcohol, nicotine etc., I allocated an additional £250,000 to the bureau for use in 1982 to enable it to undertake an urgent national programme of counselling and preventive education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1981 the bureau spent a total of £177,809 on positive health promotion and public education in relation to anti-smoking. <Col N="90" /> There was no similar concentration on alcohol in that year and no expenditure on public education in relation to drug abuse.  The bureau also initiated a long-term research study into smoking and drinking behaviour attitudes at a cost of £25,000.  In connection with alcohol, a sum of £12,648 was spent on a seminar, production of materials and publications.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is not qualified for old age contributory pension under the Social Welfare Acts as she has a total of only 58 qualifying contributions recorded to her credit from 1953.  This is equivalent to a yearly average of two contributions in the period from 6 July 1953 to 30 June 1973, the end of the contribution year immediately before that in which she attained pension age. She would require an average of at least 48 such contributions over this period to qualify for the maximum rate of old age contributory pension and a yearly average of from 20 to 47 contributions to qualify for a reduced rate of pension. However, as she was also employed in Great Britain the 58 contributions have served to qualify her for a <i>pro-rata</i> rate pension under EEC Regulations.  This pension has been in payment since 8 August 1980 and the current weekly rate is £2.65, plus a further £2.70 a week living alone allowance.

Their function, set out in section 164 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, is to decide on claims to non-contributory old age and blind pensions on the basis of reports made to them by social welfare officers.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 23 November 1981 to 3 April 1982, after which date he was certified fit to resume work.  He was not qualified for payment in November and December 1981 because he had not the required minimum of 26 paid or credited contributions in the contribution year 1979-80 which governed that part of his claim.  However, from 4 January 1982 his claim was governed by the contributions to his credit in the 1980-81 contribution year and he had sufficient contributions in that year to qualify for payment.</P>
      <P>Payment of disability benefit was made for the period from 4 January to 15 January 1982 but due to an administrative error payment ceased after that date.  The matter has now been rectified and arrears of disability benefit due to 3 April 1982 were issued on 11 June 1982.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 9 October 1980 and has been paid all disability benefit and pay-related benefit due to 19 June 1982.  The first payment on the claim was not made until 20 April 1982 as he was not qualified for payment on his Irish insurance and it was necessary to obtain details of his insurance history in the United Kingdom, where he has been employed for a number of years, before the claim could be authorised.</P>
      <P>As the claimant was in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance during the period 13 October 1980 to 17 April 1982 the greater part of the arrears of benefit due in respect of that period were withheld and refunded to the North-Eastern Health Board to offset the amount of allowance advanced.  A cheque for £701.93 which issued on 14 June 1982 represented the balance of the benefit due to him.</P>

      <P>The person concerned attained age 65 years on 20 September 1981 and <Col N="112" /> claimed retirement pension on 19 March 1982.  He was in receipt of unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit up to 2 March 1982 at a combined weekly rate which exceeded the maximum rate of retirement pension to which he would otherwise have been entitled and, therefore, he was awarded the pension with effect from 4 March 1982, i.e. the Thursday following the date from which his pay-related benefit entitlement ceased. A pension order book containing orders valid for payment from 15 April 1982 was issued to the designated post office and he was notified accordingly.  The arrears of retirement pension due for the period from 4 March 1982 to 14 April 1982, less the amount of flat rate unemployment benefit paid to him in that period, were sent direct to him by means of a payable order which issued on 2 June 1982.</P>

      <P>A recent review of the old age pension of the person concerned has revealed that her means comprising capital and value from a holding have increased substantially since the original investigation of her claim.  As a result of the revised assessment of her means she is now entitled to pension at the rate of £16.45 a week only plus a living alone allowance of £2.70.  A question for reduction <Col N="113" /> of pension from the maximum rate of £34.45 a week must therefore be raised.  In the meantime a pension book at the new rate has been issued to the pensioner.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 30 August 1980 to <Col N="114" /> 14 November 1981 and was paid regularly each week.  At that stage payment ceased because he failed to continue to furnish medical evidence of incapacity after that date.</P>
      <P>An inspector of the Department visited the claimant recently and he admitted that he had not been seen by his doctor since November 1981.  He has accordingly been advised to visit his doctor immediately and to submit medical certificates of incapacity at monthly intervals.

      <P>The provision, by the Government, of an additional £18.5 million in their March 1982 budget brought to £186 million the total allocation for 1982 from the Public Capital Programme for the local authority housing construction programme.

      <P>Payment of a house improvement grant for sewerage facilities will be made if and when it can be established that on or before 21 January 1980, either (a) a contract had been entered into to carry out the proposed work or (b) materials for the proposed work had been purchased.  The Department requested this information in December 1981, but no reply has been received to date.  Under the Housing Regulations, 1980 (as amended), the latest date for completion of work and the receipt of claims for payment was 30 June 1981.  As this statutory regulation was not complied with in the case of the reconstruction work, a grant cannot be paid.</P>

      <P>I should mention that figures of the strength of the anti-drugs squad, as that term is normally used, can be misleading in that the members of the various units of the Drug Squad are not the only members of the force dealing with and having special training in the prevention and control of drug abuse.  There is a continuing and expanding programme of providing special training of members from every Garda Division in anti-drugs work and, while these members are not engaged exclusively in such work, they pay particular attention to the problem of drug abuse.</P>
      <P>The current operational strength of the permanent units of the Drug Squad is 42 but, apart from those already mentioned in the various divisions, there are another seven members also engaged full-time at present in the investigation of drug offences.</P>
