    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance on his appointment and on the introduction of this budget, the third in the short period of eight months. We all know what happened to the budget of 27 January which brought about the downfall of the Coalition Government. Deputy Bruton, the former Minister for Finance, introduced his first <Col N="976" /> budget last July and it had a severe effect on employment and prices.  It was highly inflationary and the cost of living soared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am having difficulty in hearing Deputy Brady because of the noise in the Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the Coalition Government did not learn any lessons from that budget in that only six months later the Minister introduced a budget for 1982 which was even more inflationary than its July counterpart. The Coalition Government went too far even for some of the Independent Deputies, such as Deputy Jim Kemmy, who had very faithfully and loyally supported them.  He could not accept the measures introduced in January.  The most appalling aspect of that budget was the introduction of VAT on clothing and footwear. Independent economists conceded that the measures taken in that budget would have caused an increase of at least 7 to 8 per cent in the cost of living, not 5¼ per cent as envisaged by Deputy Bruton when he introduced it.</P>
      <P>We must remember that those measures were brought in by a Government who came into office with a basket full of promises which conned many of the people, particularly the housewives. Unfortunately, those promises turned sour and were thrown back in the faces of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties because of the dishonesty of the various undertakings given last June.  It is fair to say that, because of the measures introduced in the January budget, the Coalition Government find themselves on the benches on the opposite side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget introduced last Thursday was along the expected lines.  It was probably the most accurately anticipated budget we have ever had.  The lines it would take were forecast many weeks before it was actually introduced.  During the election campaign Fianna Fáil indicated the main measures of the budget and they were discussed throughout the country.  The fact that we gained sufficient seats in the election to enable us to come back into Government indicates <Col N="977" /> acceptance of the proposals by the electorate. It indicates that the electorate were in broad agreement with our proposals which have now been implemented in the budget.  Those who oppose the major items announced last Thursday are once more opposing the views of the people who had their say a few weeks ago.  The measures announced in many respects are very similar to Deputy Bruton's budget, but the direction and the emphasis are very different.</P>
    <P>The budget is designed to reduce our borrowing requirements and to reduce the current budget deficit.  It is also designed to help the less well-off and not to worsen their plight, as the January budget would have done.  Everybody in the House agrees that our economic situation is bad and that it requires very careful attention to bring it back into shape.  In January Deputy Bruton went to great pains to emphasise this, and the Minister for Finance is saying much the same, but that is where the similarity ends.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government preached doom not only to the nation but to the world and implied that receivers of the world banks were not only at the door but were in our living room to take away our goods, credit, currency and independence. They lost sight of our real assets, particularly the large number of young people we have.  Raising finance became the god of the day, but it did not seem to matter one iota how that finance was raised, its effects on the country, industry and jobs.  It did not bother the former Taoiseach, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, Deputy John Kelly or the leader of the Labour Party that more people were losing their jobs every day and that nothing whatever was being done to replace those jobs. The Coalition Government, however, decided to raise more taxes from the people who had just lost their jobs.  I refer to the proposal to tax short term benefits.  Nobody sets out deliberately to lose employment.  There are a few people who do this, but it would be grossly unjust of any Government to penalise 99 people out of 100 for the sins of one suspected <Col N="978" /> person who deliberately wishes to lose his or her job.</P>
    <P>It is a time of trauma and difficulty for the man or woman who loses a job after 15 or 20 years in employment.  That is the time we should give every possible assistance, because that is when it is needed. There are abuses of the social welfare system but we must find another way of tracing the people who fraudulently abuse this system.  Every Government should do everything possible to assist people who have lost their jobs to adjust to the new situation in which they find themselves.</P>
    <P>The Government accept that our economy is not in good shape, but we are determined to solve our problems constructively over a longer period and in a far less disruptive way than the Coalition Government had planned.  Every country in the west has economic problems.  That is the price of the worst world recession we have had since the thirties.  In this climate we should continue to borrow for capital investment to solve our unemployment problem.  The Coalition Government seemed to develop a fierce hang-up about borrowing for capital investment.  What did we find in Deputy Bruton's budget in January?  He planned to borrow £1,661 million.  I am not critical about this.  I am merely pointing to the inconsistency of the previous Government in what they preached regarding borrowing and, about which they had such a song and dance.  They almost succeeded in scaring the daylights out of our own people and in undermining our credibility abroad with investors and financial institutions.  Any person with any experience of business will point to the good sense of borrowing money which becomes available at attractive interest rates, rates which are well below the normal rate of existing inflation.  The fact that we in a small country can borrow easily at attractive rates is, I think, a source of jealousy among many other countries.  World financial institutions will not lend money unless they have confidence in the ability of the borrowing country to develop a sound financial position and be able to pay back the debt. We are dealing with experts in world <Col N="979" /> financial institutions and it is therefore to our credit that funds are so readily available to us.  It is an indication of the goodwill and the reputation we enjoy abroad as a growing economy.  However, it is important to ensure that borrowings are used for capital investment, to create jobs, to develop infrastructure, housing, industry, schools and so on.  That is the only way forward.  This Government will have the courage and the will to reach for these targets.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his budget speech indicated that consideration was being given to a plan for the management of the economy over the next four or five years.  I am pleased that that plan will give priority to what is vitally important for the development of the economy and particularly the development of an employment programme.  I am also particularly pleased that the Minister has given recognition to the need to do something about the serious problems facing the inner city of Dublin.  The north inner city area was part of my former Dáil constituency from 1977 to 1981 and at present I represent that area at city council level.  Therefore I am completely <i>au fait</i> with the problems there.  Most Deputies have to drive through the north inner city from time to time even though they may come from the south side.  They can see for themselves the blighted condition of the north inner city.  It is like an area that had been blitzed and had been allowed to deteriorate for years past.  We have had urban decay of the inner city for several years now on the one hand and on the other we have had rapid growth of suburban areas.  This has all taken place at the expense of the inner city.  Decay has been rampant in the area which has the highest unemployment in the country.  It probably has the worst housing conditions in the country.  The many flat complexes in the inner city are totally over populated with resultant vandalism and crime and all the problems that go with such a situation.  It is a very sorry picture and one may ask what can be done, seeing the situation has gone so far.  The Government's commitment to establish a development authority is a <Col N="980" /> start but if any impression is to be made a major commitment and huge capital will be needed over a long period.</P>
    <P>In 1979 the Fianna Fáil Government issued a programme for the development of the inner city and since then a special committee consisting of public representatives for the area, officials of Dublin Corporation, the Dublin Port and Docks Board, the IDA, AnCO, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, the National Manpower Service, the Confederation of Irish Industry and a representative from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  That committee has been examining various proposals to develop light industry in the city area.  Unfortunately, despite many meetings and many hours of discussion little or nothing has materialised from that committee.  One is prompted to question the real commitment to doing something for the inner city over the past few years.</P>
    <P>The development authority now proposed have a very tough job ahead because of so many different intertwined problems and the number of aspects that need to be tackled at the same time.  To bring about a solution or near solution of many of those problems will require a lot of capital, effort, patience and time.  The proposal to introduce the special tax on derelict sites is very welcome because this is one of the big problems of the inner city: there are too many derelict sites. The city is blighted on all sides but particularly the inner city where old houses have been allowed to deteriorate or decay.  Whole areas have been allowed to run down; they are overgrown; there are vacant sites which are an eyesore for citizens and also for tourists.</P>
    <P>Constitutional difficulties, if they exist, must be overcome as regards planning in the city.  This is an area that has caused much difficulty and many problems at city council level.  Councillors such as Deputy G. Mitchell are fully aware of the many debates and discussions that take place from time to time regarding planning. Most often we run into difficulties in relation to planning laws and legislation. We are dealing in the city centre with many different speculators and the value of various derelict sites increases <Col N="981" /> with inflation from year to year.  If the inner city problem is to be tackled this is one of the first aspects that must receive attention and I hope the Minister will give it priority.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to make £1 million available to install bathroom facilities in a number of houses in the city centre.  From my own experience I believe this will be very difficult if not impossible in many areas because of the condition of premises.  Some of the complexes would probably be better demolished and replaced by modern housing. We have experience of Summerhill, Gardiner Street and the Sean McDermott Street area where the houses were reconditioned around 1948 and we know what has happened in that area over the years which eventually led to the demolition of those houses which has recently taken place.</P>
    <P>The Dublin inner city problem is a very special one, without comparison in any other Irish city.  I am therefore more than surprised at the reaction of various groups to the Minister's decision to tackle the problem and make finance available. Such opposition and criticism can only be interpreted as small-minded politics within a very narrow concept.  It is particularly appalling that Deputies representing that deprived area in both Fine Gael and Labour have confined themselves to questioning and querying why the Government should make additional finance available to tackle the terrible problems of the Deputies' own constituencies.  One would have expected that the former Tánaiste, Deputy O'Leary, and the former Minister for Sport, Deputy Keating, would have welcomed the long-awaited proposals to do something for their own constituents.  It is an appalling situation to hear criticism from those Deputies who should be doing their utmost for their constituents in the neglected part of the city rather than coming here querying what we are doing.</P>
    <P>I suggest that they go back to their constituents over the weekend to get their reaction to these proposals. I can assure those Deputies they will get a hostile reception for their approach to these <Col N="982" /> proposals.  I have heard it said that the former Tánaiste is reluctant to visit parts of his constituency.  That speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the National Economic and Social Council published a report &ldquo;Urbanisation Problems of Growth and Decay in Dublin, 1981&rdquo;.  That report dealt in depth with the decay in the inner city area and the statistics published were very frightening.  In 1926 the population in the inner city area, within the canal range and incorporating four wards, was 268,851.  That figure has fallen.  In 1979 it was 132,000, less than half the 1926 figure, and since 1979 the figure has fallen even further because of the exodus of many thousands from the inner city area. Even the 1979 figure indicated a dying city.  This cannot be good for the quality of life of those remaining.  Employment has moved out of the city, and there are many reasons for that &mdash; transport difficulties, the cost of city property and so on.  Many city areas which formerly provided employment for the people living there have been taken over by office blocks.</P>
    <P>The increased allocation for Dublin Corporation housing to £76 million in 1982 is very welcome and I am sure will be appreciated by Deputy G. Mitchell who unsuccessfully endeavoured to obtain similar funds from the former Government.  The further allocation for additional works will be very good for the city and will enable the corporation to proceed with their programmes as originally planned.  There is also a further £750,000 for housing maintenance which has been badly needed for some time because maintenance of corporation houses and flats has been falling drastically through a lack of finance.</P>
    <P>We can now increase the work force from 150 to 500 under the environmental improvements scheme.  That means an additional 350 jobs, apart from the benefits the environment will receive from this financial injection.  The additional funds are fully justified.  The population in Dublin is almost one million people and most of them work within a few miles of the city.  This in turn puts greater pressure on the resources of Dublin Corporation to provide necessary and essential <Col N="983" /> services.  Our capital should be a city to be proud of.  It belongs not only to Dubliners but to the nation.  Its appearance unfortunately has been allowed to run down over the years.  Successive Governments can be faulted for the failure to provide the necessary finance to keep our capital city attractive.  Tourists normally visit a capital city but what they see here is nothing to be proud of.</P>
    <P>The increased allocation for housing in Dublin is very welcome.  Public representatives in the Dublin area know only too well that the position is extremely bad. The application list for Dublin Corporation housing continues to grow.  At present there are in excess of 6,500 applicants on the new list; there are over 6,000 on the corporation transfer list and there are many thousands of unfit dwellings.  Too many people are looking for corporation houses.  That is understandable when one considers the high price of houses in the Dublin area.  Something will have to be done about this.  The authorities must look at the possibility of providing low cost houses.  They could help the people to buy these houses by providing a scheme which would ensure that the average worker could meet the repayments. This, in turn, would mean these people would take additional pride in the quality and appearance of their houses. We all know that if somebody owns something he will do everything in his power to look after it.  That would be a very good thing for Dublin city.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have always been committed to better housing.  What we are doing in this budget needs to be done urgently. It is not being done because of any special deal, as has been implied by Opposition speakers, and in these circumstances one can justifiably ask what all the fuss is about.</P>
    <P>In any budget, and this budget is no exception, taxation, both direct and indirect, plays a major part.  It is only fair that this should be so but we must ensure that a fair share of taxation is spread across the board.  One of the greatest present day scandals is the massive evasion of tax.  I would like to refer specifically to value-added tax.  Recently a <Col N="984" /> newspaper article detailed huge amounts of money lost to the Exchequer because of the evasion of VAT, and I have reason to believe that the position outlined in that article was understated.  Millions of pounds are lost to the Exchequer year after year because there are so many who are evading not only their share of income tax but also their share of VAT.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated that the realistic loss to the Revenue Commissioners in terms of VAT is in the region of £100 million to £150 million.  This is a huge loss for any Minister for Finance but apart from that, there is the question of so much injustice to those taxpayers who are paying their share under both PAYE and VAT.  It is extraordinary that there is practically no liaison whatever between the customs at import level and the Collector-General.  One would have thought that in this modern age of computerisation, not only would there be liaison but that there would be practical working co-operation between the customs and the Collector-General's office in so far as the importation and subsequent sale of imported goods are concerned. Any importer having a VAT registration number is in a position to import goods to any value without having to pay tax at import source.  What is happening is that many companies and individuals importing goods operate under a number of separate subsidiary companies.  Some of these companies stay in business for a short while and then disappear overnight. Many of them disappear into oblivion without having paid any form of taxation. Recently a couple of cases were discovered which were an eye opener.  In one case the company had been carrying on business since 1973 without making any return whatever to the VAT office.  Other companies have been operating for two or three years without making any such returns.  These are companies which on the surface appear to be very satisfactory and profitable business organisations.  If one is to judge from the value of the imports into those companies, either the goods are being sold or, which is most unlikely, are being buried somewhere, but no returns in respect of them are being made to the VAT office.  This is a <Col N="985" /> disgraceful situation.  One cannot understand why something has not been done in the past few years to tackle such blatant abuse.</P>
    <P>From time to time questions are raised here about abuses of the social welfare system or about the evasion of tax but what we talk about in those terms is mere chickenfeed compared with what has been happening in terms of the large scale abuse of the VAT system.  I understand that some time ago a measure to counteract this abuse was proposed to the office of the Collector-General and that the recommendation was that accountability at import level would be obtained on a bond basis, not seeking payment at the point of import but accountability which would be extended only on the basis of a bond.  This would be very similar to the inward processing arrangement and would not have involved any payment whatever in the payment structure of VAT at that point.  However, those recommendations were not accepted.  In the meantime millions of pounds are going into the pockets of unscrupulous business people many of whom are not Irish.</P>
    <P>The proposed change by the Minister to charge tax at the point of entry will catch most evaders.  For that reason the move is very welcome.  Unfortunately, though, the change will cause difficulties for many legitimate traders.  They will suffer in a major financial way as a result of the change.  According to the Minister the earlier payment of VAT will amount to £140 million.  Might it not have been more feasible in present circumstances merely to make a greater effort to catch the evader?  In this way we would not have been creating any great financial disturbances for the existing legitimate importer who has been paying his way honestly down through the years.  The proposed change will involve many thousands of employers seeking additional finance to pay VAT, to pay for the stocking of goods at importation, for the cost of sale and for the cost of extending credit to their clients.  In addition there will be for them the element of bad debt risk. The genuine importer is worthy of sympathy in this context.  However, I hope <Col N="986" /> this will be a once-off situation in that the Minister will endeavour to devise some method of dealing with the whole question of tax evasion and that at the same time bring about a more even distribution of taxes for everyone.</P>
    <P>In recent years in particular there have been many references to the question of a campaign to bring the tax evader to heel but it would appear that the major culprit, the big evader, has been much more slick and cute than the Revenue Commissioners.  Our laws are not stringent enough in this respect.  There are too many loopholes.  I have heard on good authority that this country is considered a haven for tax evaders.  Perhaps that is one of the reasons why in recent years so many special sales days and fairs have been taking place.  These traders slip in and out.  They issue caretakers' addresses for tax registration purposes. Over a number of years we have seen many so-called cut price traders going to the wall after a few years' trading and owing up to £1 million to the Revenue Commissioners and other creditors.</P>
    <P>As legislators we have a moral obligation to the legitimate traders who give good employment and contribute to the Exchequer to safeguard them from loss of business and bad debts, apart from tax liability, against the too many unscrupulous traders who are filling our cities and towns.  Goods are brought in here called &ldquo;direct from factory to you&rdquo; or &ldquo;slightly soiled stocks to clear&rdquo; or &ldquo;flood damaged stocks&rdquo;.  They are brought in by the methods I have described.  The Minister must give priority to this problem even if it means employing additional tax officers. It must be done, because it will bring positive results and it will be extremely rewarding and satisfying to everyone.</P>
    <P>In recent years as a nation we seem to have taken on the mantle of being dodgers and evaders of tax or any money owing to authority.  For example, this morning we read a report about TV licence evaders.  This is appalling.  According to the report, 160,000 people are not paying their TV licence this year.  That is costing the Exchequer £8 million. According to the report, over the past ten years it cost the Exchequer £30 million. <Col N="987" /> I do not have to go into the nitty-gritty of what we could have done with that type of money.  We do not need to have a vivid imagination to realise that. It drives home to us more and more that methods of collection must be changed, and stronger measures must be taken. The present system is totally ineffective for collecting TV licences.  Some change must take place because the honest citizen is paying for the dishonesty of his brothers and sisters.  This is totally unsatisfactory and it cries out for urgent remedies.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is probably one of our major problems.  It is heartbreaking for parents and soul-destroying for young people who cannot obtain employment. This year we will have in the region of 40,000 young people leaving school.  The Minister will be announcing specific measures, but we all know they will not solve our unemployment problem overnight. Some years ago it was much easier for youngsters to get work in areas such as the civil service, the banks, the insurance companies, the teaching profession, and so on.  In all of those areas good employment was provided for young people leaving school.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to married women staying at work, but at present some consideration should be given to our young people who are seeking employment for the first time by other citizens who perhaps do not have to have two wage earners in the family.  There are quite a number of reasons why it is a good thing for a wife to work outside the home, apart from financial reasons.  We are living in exceptional circumstances.  We are all aware that there are many families where the husband and wife are both at work. They have two cars.  They are buying big homes.  They take holidays abroad every year.  They have all the luxuries one could wish for.  Between them they are earning between £20,000 and £30,000 a year.  We have to ask ourselves is that just when so many young people are unemployed, and seeking employment for the first time and seeking a start in life.</P>
    <P>I should like to extend a welcome to the social welfare benefits provided by <Col N="988" /> the Minister in his budget.  I welcome in particular the availability of medical cards for all old age pensioners.  I hope it will be possible to raise the means limit for other social welfare beneficiaries. Today medical costs are extremely high. Medical attention, medicines and drugs are very expensive.  I accept that a refund of a specific figure on a monthly basis is made by the various health boards, but in the meantime finance and cash are needed by the persons concerned to enable them to pay their doctors and to purchase their medicines, or whatever, from the local chemist.  Many people on social welfare are slightly above the limit for receiving a medical card.  They find it not only difficult but impossible to meet that type of situation.  I hope the Minister will try to see what can be done to help them.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer for a moment to the money being made available for the provision of additional gardaí and for prison services as specified by the Minister in his budget speech.  We all accept that we have a serious problem in Dublin with regard to the breakdown of law and order.  Over the past few years the increase in the Garda strength has been welcomed very much by citizens.  It has been very obvious on the beat.  During the past six months &mdash; perhaps it was just coincidental that we had a Coalition Government &mdash; the strength and the presence of the Garda in Dublin diminished.  There are a number of reasons for this.  Many gardaí have either retired or resigned from the force, or have been transferred to other areas or other duties such as desk work or attendance at the courts.  All this reduces the presence and strength of the Garda on our streets.</P>
    <P>At one time it was unknown for a person to be robbed in broad daylight in a centre city street.  Today, unfortunately, that is a very common occurrence.  Only last week a friend of mine was walking in O'Connell Street at 10.15 a.m.  She was thrown from behind by a youth of approximately 13 years of age, her handbag snatched, the usual procedure.  On reporting the incident to Store Street Garda Station she was informed that that was the seventh incident that had taken <Col N="989" /> place in that area that morning.  That is an appalling situation.  Citizens seem to be reaching a stage at which they are inclined to accept this as the norm.  Every safeguard measure is being taken such as avoiding certain streets, not carrying a handbag openly and so on which is a breach of the freedom of the citizen in our city.  Far from the situation having improved in any way for some time past it has been worsening and at present is at one of its most critical stages.</P>
    <P>We are all entitled to ask what plans do the Department or Garda have to deal with this problem which has been escalating? On the other hand, the Garda have their version as to the limitations on their powers.  We seem to have reached a situation in which there are different urgent requirements in tackling the problem, in dealing with culprits once they have been caught.  The ordinary citizen can see nothing being done in this respect by way of improving the situation.  Fianna Fáil's commitment to increasing the Garda force by a further 2,000 over a period is welcome and constitutes a practical step in the right direction.  At the same time it must be said that the solution will not be brought about merely by increased Garda presence.  While certainly that will help, much more is required.  One must question the courts legislation in so far as many of these cases are concerned because the same people are being brought into Garda stations day after day and week after week.  Yet the same people are to be found on our streets day after day and week after week.  Therefore one must question how this can be.  How can such culprits continue to get away with larceny, other crimes and with instilling fear into our citizens?  It is vital that this matter be tackled urgently because, if not, our city streets will very quickly become no-go areas.</P>
    <P>Certainly I would welcome any additional finance provided to improve Garda presence and the prison services, in respect of which much more needs to be done.  That takes me back to the question about which I spoke earlier regarding the problems of the inner city.  There are there difficulties in regard to housing, <Col N="990" /> unemployment and so on, all of which help in no small way to create further vandalism and a breakdown in law and order.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word regarding the increased PRSI contributions announced by the Minister.  All of us in business are concerned in so far as healthy business creates jobs and employment but there are today extremely high costs incurred by the average employer.  For instance under this budget corporation profits tax is being brought forward three months, the first instalment thereof now being due some seven months after completion of the company's accounts.  The PRSI contributions of both employer and employee have been increased substantially. It must be said that the high cost of employing people nowadays is acting as a discouragement to employers and creating a situation in which more and more of them are employing people on an unofficial basis which, in turn, encourages evasion of taxes, PAYE, PRSI and so on.  Where people are employed unofficially it must be said that in that capacity many are also in receipt of unemployment assistance, leading to a doubling-up situation which is also bad from the point of view of the Exchequer. In so far as employers are concerned today the high costs of maintaining business and employment are becoming more and more discouraging.  Some incentives should be made available to them in respect of continuous employment of additional workers.  For that reason I hope we are now in a ceiling situation in so far as PRSI contributions are concerned. The cost of wages today is extremely high.  The average employer is paying now, on top of an employee's wages, something in the region of 11½ to 12 per cent by way of PRSI contributions. This places severe strain on the capital of many employers and companies.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on what I consider to be a balanced and fair budget and wish him every success in his office over the next four or five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Deputy who has just spoken in wishing the Minister <Col N="991" /> well in his new office.  He has a difficult task ahead of him.  We shall all endeavour to offer him constructive advice, support and criticism where necessary.</P>
      <P>The reasons for the budget of January last, which caused the last general election and which in turn caused this budget to be framed in the more general and real way it has been framed compared with other Fianna Fáil budgets in the recent past, was the state of our economy and the borrowing requirement situation in which the Government found themselves. I should like to place on the record of the House that in January 1977 the national debt stood at £3,600 million and, per head of working population, that amounted to £3,324.  In January 1981 the national debt was £7,900 million, or £6,840 per head of working population. In June 1981, immediately prior to the supplementary budget, the national debt had reached £8,843 million, or £7,690 per head of working population.  By the end of the year the national debt figure had reached £10,000 million, an alarming figure. That is where we pick up the mess which has become the Irish economy of recent years.  At that time the interest being paid, per head of population, was £920.  Probably it is now somewhere in the region of £1,100 per head of working population annually.  When one knocks on constituents doors during an election campaign, or at any other time, and talks to ones constituents, particularly the older members, they will tell one that they always pay their way, they never borrow.  Such people do not realise that for every man and woman working in this country it is estimated that the Government are paying £1,100 or thereabouts in interest.  Therefore approximately 80 per cent of all moneys collected by way of income tax is paid out of the country by way of interest to foreign bankers, sitting back enjoying themselves in Geneva or other European capitals, and very little of which is enjoyed in our capital city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with a number of points raised by Deputy Vincent Brady in the course of his contribution.  He told the House that funds were readily available <Col N="992" /> to the Government, an indication that we have a sound economy.  He implied that we are such a great country that people want to throw money into it. It is like the widow on the low fixed income being asked by a HP salesman to sign on the dotted line and then finding she cannot meet the repayments, leading her into grave difficulty.  Our economy has reached that stage.  There are many foreign moneylenders prepared to make funds available to us, but they have the power to pull the rug and call the tune. Constantly there is an erosion of parliamentary democracy as we know it.  Decisions are being taken not just outside this Chamber but outside the country by people who do not have any responsibility to the electorate.  That is frightening and something that must be rectified.  An effort was being made to rectify it for the first time in a planned way by the last Government.  That Government brought home to us the reality of having to put that situation right.  If it is not rectified now our enormous youth population, the fastest growing youth population in Western Europe, will not have employment in the future.  If we do not take those corrective measures now we will find ourselves in a very difficult situation later.  The last Government, in the best interests of everybody, made us face up to that reality.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment Deputy Vincent Brady on his partial accuracy in the reference he made to the north inner city and short term social welfare benefits. The north inner city will certainly benefit greatly by the deal negotiated between Deputy Gregory and the Taoiseach. In all honesty I cannot criticise Deputy Gregory too much.  All Members are concerned about their own constituencies, but one must ask: is finance to be allocated on a regional basis and, if so, is it done on an economic basis?  In Dublin an allocation has not been made to the south Dublin inner city which is equally as deprived.  That area suffers enormous unemployment, has very bad housing, ugly sites and many other disadvantages. I have represented the area for the last seven months, but those issues were raised by many of my predecessors <Col N="993" /> and they did not meet with any great success.  Suddenly huge sums of money are made available for the north inner city.  In my view that form of financial discrimination is questionable and I do not feel there is any objectivity in those proposals contained in a signed and witnessed document.</P>
    <P>With regard to short term social welfare benefits, I am sure all Members are aware that some people are better off if they take six weeks holidays each year at the expense of the State because the social welfare income they receive, together with the reduced income they receive from their employer &mdash; this is particularly the case of State employment &mdash; exceeds what they get while at work. We must also bear in mind that when they return to work they have an accumulation of tax free allowances with the result that they receive a rebate of tax. That is further encouragement to people to take time off at the expense of the State.</P>
    <P>I do not think reasonable people would argue that that should be encouraged or that it is fair or right.  I had occasion last night to talk to a man who is out of work due to illness and he told me he was in receipt of more money now than he will be when he returns to work.  That man agreed that the system was crazy.  Members on the Government side who contend that we should not tax short term social welfare benefits are talking nonsense. In making that statement I am conscious of the fact that I represent a constituency that is largely working class. I am bearing in mind also that those people will have to pay for this through their PAYE contributions.  If one poses the question to any reasonable person: &ldquo;Do you think it is reasonable that you should be paid more by the State for being out of work than you are paid while at work?&rdquo; I am sure the answer would be &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Our proposals were to tax people in such a way that they would not have more income while out of work than they would receive while at work.  There was not any question of taxing any other benefits such as widows pensions or invalidity pensions.  We wanted to ensure that people were not encouraged to take a <Col N="994" /> number of weeks off work at the expense of the State.  I do not think anybody could argue against that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Vincent Brady also referred on a number of occasions to the fact that I am a member of Dublin Corporation.  I have been chairman of the finance committee of that body for three years.  In that capacity I should like to express my regret at the announcement, by way of circular letter, by the Minister for the Environment that Dublin Corporation will be required to introduce local taxation to raise £2.6 million this year.  That is a considerable amount of money which will have to be raised from a population of about 500,000 &mdash; I do not know the number of taxpayers who live in that area.  In my view this decision amounts to the thin end of the wedge as far as the reintroduction of domestic rates is concerned. That money is to be raised mainly on planning applications.  Annually about 3,000 such applications are made to Dublin Corporation and that figure includes applications for extensions and improvements to domestic dwellings.  If the corporation are to charge £100 per application only £300,000 will be raised. Therefore, presumably the Minister has in mind that they should charge considerably more for those applications.  This introduction of local taxes for the first time is a move we will oppose when the Minister introduces the necessary legislation. The announcement has gone unpublicised and many local authorities have not read those letters because estimates meetings have not been held.  But local taxation by local authorities is now a fact.  The Minister wants Dublin Corporation to raise £2.6 million this year and he has not told us how we should do that.  Certainly, it will have to be done by way of raising the fee for planning applications and by charging more for water use and the waste disposal service.  We will have a lot to say later about that proposal and the manner in which it was introduced.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude on the comments of Deputy Vincent Brady I should like to deal with his reference to the purchasers of medicines and drugs in excess of £12 per month.  Particularly in cases of ongoing <Col N="995" /> illness requiring regular monthly purchases of drugs, there is room for innovation.  The dreadful situation exists in my own area at present where the Eastern Health Board will take into consideration, not just the purchases made in a month, but some person sitting in some office decides, if a person bought £20 worth of drugs in the third week in January, since only a week's supply of those drugs has been used in January, the remainder can be used in the following month.  Accordingly, the remainder is apportioned to the following month, reducing the repayment to the applicant. This is not a satisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health should make arrangements with the Pharmaceutical Society for its members to carry the burden of waiting for the refund from the Eastern Health Board, as many do now on a voluntary basis, the person who purchases regularly from the chemist drugs for his own use for a specified illness paying the chemist the maximum of £12 a month, the chemist awaiting the refund.  He can best afford to do so, having credit from the suppliers for 30 or 90 days, as the case may be.  Many chemists are already operating this scheme on a voluntary basis.  The Minister should take up this matter with the Pharmaceutical Society with a view to formalising such a scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady asks that something be done about the numbers on local authority housing lists.  Something has been done.  The Coalition Government around Christmas introduced the Housing Finance Agency which was opposed by Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>This Housing Finance Agency, which was introduced by the Coalition Government, had as its aim the object of raising funds during the month of April and having funds available for applicants towards the end of May. Application forms had been already issued before the last Government left office.  I implore the Minister to ensure that this agency gets the £50 million which we promised and perhaps a little more, because of the clear interest shown by a huge number of people.  I can speak only for the Dublin region where particular interest was taken in this very imaginative proposal by the Coalition Government in their short time in office.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brady spoke at great length on the subject of tax evasion, and I agree with him.  As an accountant I am only too well aware of the opportunities for tax evasion.  More will have to be done to tighten up in this area, although a lot has been done.  In many cases there is a very thin line between evasion and avoidance. Avoidance is the nice man's legal way of avoiding tax, sometimes very questionably legal.  The Fianna Fáil attitude in keeping the discretionary trust provisions which the Coalition Government had proposed to abolish is an encouragement to evasion by another name, nothing more.  It is to pay off the Fianna Fáil supporters for their party loyalty, the type of loyalty which has this country in its present mess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Brady's reference to vandalism, there is absolutely no provision in this budget &mdash; not one penny &mdash; for additional gardaí, Garda overtime, extra facilities or equipment.  Why are Fianna Fáil talking about the problem of vandalism?  Perhaps the largest single problem facing this city is vandalism, probably as a result of bad housing, unemployment and other related matters. I attended immediately prior to the election a meeting on the subject in my own constituency in Rialto, at which 500 people were present.  A tannoy system was used as people were queuing to get in because of the lawlessness which had crept into that community.  We approached that problem with certain proposals, not making it a party political <Col N="997" /> issue.  However, prior to the election it was made an enormous issue.  We will be pursuing this matter to ensure that the money is provided, unlike last year when the Minister promised an additional 2,000 gardaí and did not provide for as much as one extra salary in the budgetary proposals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady is quite right in referring to citizens being robbed in broad daylight. Some of the budgetary provisions certainly fall into that category.  I have already dealt with the Housing Finance Agency.  We also introduced the Youth Employment Agency &mdash; two very real, specific organisations, in an attempt to come to terms with a growing problem of unemployment which has been facing this city for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>As I said in my contribution to the budget debate last September, to take a constructive view of why we find ourselves in the position of needing such harsh measures at this time, golden economic opportunities which presented themselves to the Fianna Fáil administration were absolutely thrown away by the shortsightedness of politicians greedy for power, who did not take into consideration the real needs of our people.  Those opportunities were wasted because of reckless and totally unnecessary promises. I am speaking about the promises made prior to the 1977 General Election. The National Coalition Government, led by Mr. Liam Cosgrave, brought us through the first real economic recession of recent times.  There had not been many people who could remember that type of recession.  That was the most talented Government in my memory, although I cannot go back too far.  It brought us through the most severe economic recession in modern times and left the country &mdash; Minister Power looks amused &mdash; at the time of the dissolution of Parliament in 1977&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with unemployment at 106,000, an inflation rate of 6¼ per cent, and a current budget deficit of £201 million.  I refer the Minister to the <i>Economic Review and Outlook for 1978,</i><Col N="998" /> published, not by Hans Christian Andersen but by the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>The outrageous promises made by Fianna Fáil to win power resulted in the complete reversal of our steady economic climb and produced a situation where the figures for late December 1981 equivalent to those I have just quoted were: unemployment 124,700, despite the fact that in the region of 25,000 jobs were created in the public service where no jobs existed.  It was a question of luxury unemployment benefit, which continues to have to be paid to this day &mdash; the real figure would probably be more in the region 150,000.  Unemployment rose at that time by 40 per cent during the term as Taoiseach of Deputy Charles J. Haughey.  It is against this background that we must look at the present budget. Whereas inflation was reduced by the Coalition Government to 6¼ per cent, it was 21 per cent in the summer of 1981, the current deficit of £210 million had gone up to £945 million in the summer of 1981 and would have been £1,200 million by the end of this year if the July budget had not been introduced by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Burton.  We must be very clear as to why we are in the present mess.  Certainly there are major international economic factors to blame also, it is not all the fault of Fianna Fáil but my valid, objective point is that the Fianna Fáil administration recklessly threw away economic opportunities, misgoverned the country in economic terms and did not follow the good example of the economic performance of the Coalition Government who were in office from 1973 to 1977.  Instead, Fianna Fáil brought upon us many of the difficulties which we are now experiencing and which could have been solved.  When they left office, the national debt had crept from £5,000 million to £10,000 million. We had not borrowed as much in the previous 25 years as we borrowed during the four years of the Fianna Fáil Government from 1977 to 1981.  That fact cannot be disputed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Fianna Fáil Government approach is, again, a reversal of the honest openness of the previous administration. They are again showing signs of <Col N="999" /> recklessness and are failing to take advantage of opportunities which were presented to them by the outgoing Government. The public know we are in a mess.  There is no point in talking about bloom and boom.  People need a Government which will give real leadership.  That cannot be done by mirrors, public relations, smiling at the press or at Mrs. Thatcher.  It is not a question of finding out where the crowd are going and getting ahead of them, it is about leading people where you want them to go because it is in their interest.  In fairness, one must say during the recent election people were very receptive to the harsh measures which were introduced because they felt they were necessary and the outcome of the election clearly shows that they were prepared to accept that severe measures had to be taken.  There would not have been a change in Government except for a swing in one or two constituencies.</P>
    <P>There is a total lack of honesty in the Fianna Fáil administration.  Some people regard this as smart and slick and showing great political acumen.  Unfortunately the press do not help either in this regard because their objectivity in these matters is increasingly coming into question. The overriding factor is one of profitability for their employers rather than objectivity for their readers, but that is a question for another debate.  Pope John Paul delivered a sermon recently in which he referred to honesty and the way language is abused and used in such a way that the mass of people no longer know the value of what a politician or a public figure says or, indeed what non-political public figures say.  He said the whole question of honesty was being undermined and that this was having an enormous effect on the community.  Nobody knew what was meant by any specific statement.  This is one of the difficulties in which we find ourselves.  I feel that the public do not accept what our political leaders are saying, the business world does not accept it and other political leaders do not accept it either.  This is a small island without the complications of a <Col N="1000" /> large economy and we should be able to straighten ourselves out.  If we have an honest, truthful Government, as was provided by the Coalition, the economy will soon be back to normal.  There will be time to do this as there is no election imminent after yesterday's manoeuvring so we can ask the Government to take on this task and tell people what the situation is.  They are wiser about the situation than politicians give them credit for and they are only waiting for good leadership.</P>
    <P>On the information given in this budget, I cannot say if we have been told the truth.  I mentioned the sermon given by Pope John Paul because it stuck in my mind.  I cannot honestly say that the estimated current budget deficit at the end of the year will be under £700 million as the Minister said.  That is why I brought up the question of honesty because the books were cooked last January and accurate information was not given to the House.</P>
    <P>The undisputed facts can be found in the Official Report in a series of questions which I asked the Minister for Finance and which were answered by written reply on the day the Dáil rose for the Christmas recess, when all outstanding questions were dealt with and an enormous number of questions answered.  It was probably for that reason that the written replies given to the questions I asked lost their significance and were not picked up by the press.  I asked if the Minister would state in respect of his Department the amount by which the January 1981 Estimates under-provided for charges known to have existed at the time of the approval of the Estimates by the then Government and, in the case of the shortfall in provisions in relation to basic pay if he will state the areas in which such shortfalls occurred and the number of weeks basic pay which the shortfall constituted for each such area.  The reply was:</P>
    <P>Minister for Health (Mrs. E. Desmond): The major financing difficulty which arose in the health sector in 1981 was due to the approving of higher levels of expenditure for the main health agencies than was justified by <Col N="1001" /> the provision for Exchequer grant made in the Book of Estimates.  On that basis the under-provision by way of grant amounted to £43.8 millions.</P>
    <P>The books of the Department of Health were cooked to the extent of £43.8 million for Estimates known to have existed at the time of the calculation of the budget but taken out by sleight of hand. That was made up of £20.8 million in respect of pay and £15 million in respect of non-pay elements.</P>
    <P>The then Minister for the Environment Deputy Barry, replied:</P>
    <P>The Estimates for my Department, as approved in early 1981 by the then Government, under-provided to the extent of some £23 million for commitments then known to be arising during the year.  There was no shortfall in provisions in relation to basic pay for my Department.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the other Departments:</P>
    <P>Minister for Defence (Mr. Tully): The provision made in the original Estimate for the pay of the Permanent Defence Forces was inadequate to the tune of £10 million.  This represented the equivalent of seven weeks' pay for NCOs and privates.</P>
    <P>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Kavanagh): In respect of the Department of the Public Service, the under-provision in the 1981 Estimates amounted to £190,000.  This arose entirely on the pay subhead and most of the posts concerned were in the Central Data Processing Services of my Department.  The amount of £190,000 represents 2.6 weeks shortfall in salary costs for the Department as a whole.</P>
    <P>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Professor Dooge): I would refer the Deputy to columns 1068-1078 of the Official Report of 3 December 1981 in which I detailed the amount of under-estimation in the 1981 Estimates for my Department.  With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question the under-estimation in relation to pay <Col N="1002" /> represented 4.4 per cent of the total required for the year.</P>
    <P>They are figures that cannot be disputed. They are on the record of the House. They are in reply to questions which I put down to the Minister for Finance, given in written replies.  They clearly and indisputably indicate that the books were cooked last January, and I am asking if they are being cooked again.  We have no means of knowing &mdash; there is no facility available to me as a Deputy to enable me to find out on behalf of the people who sent me here if the figures are accurate at all.  Has the accountant got his hands on the books again?  Has he done a few little tricks of sleight?  We do not know.</P>
    <P>Since the facilities are not yet available for Deputies, there is a job there for some investigative journalist who has the interests of the community at heart.  It is a significant point which should be pursued.</P>
    <P>In case people get the idea that cooking the books does not occur, I would point out that in the commercial world it is a regular occurrence, so much so that last year the <i>Investors' Chronicle</i> published a guide on how to camouflage company accounts.  Indeed the Consultative Committee on Accountancy Practice regularly issue standard statements on accountancy practice for accountants to follow so that they will not easily fall into accounts window dressing.  I could count umpteen examples of how to camouflage a set of accounts.  If an accountant gives me a set of accounts I can present them in a number of different way so that they can be read by different people to mean different things.  It depends on how you treat certain items in the balance sheet, and it can be made to appear as if the company is solvent or insolvent.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that regular standard accountancy practice statement are issued.  This kind of thing has occurred so much in the past that accountancy bodies regularly review the situation.  One company improved their liquidity by £37.6 million in a very famous case simply by making an adjustment in the balance sheet.  Therefore, it can be seen that an experienced accountant who has the knowledge can very easily cook books <Col N="1003" /> and business can be shown to exist which does not actually exist.  Somebody could take a meaning from figures which they do not mean.  Experienced accountants would know how to arrange that.</P>
    <P>So there is need for us Members of the House to have available the facility to examine and investigate these matters. Members have been putting up with the nonsense for years.  There should be a real attempt to ensure that the Members of the House will assert their authority in regard to public finances.  There is simmering anger on the backbenches of all parties about the total lack of input by Members, many of whom have fewer facilities than the most junior civil servant, in regard to involvement in public finances.  In fairness I must say that the present Taoiseach, now and when the was Leader of the Opposition, as well as Deputy FitzGerald, have shown a keen interest in making reforms in this area.  I hope it will be pursued because many changes are necessary.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with specific budget proposals which I consider to be worthy of critical examination.  I refer to solvency and the camouflaging of accounts.  I suggest that in particular we should examine critically the bringing forward of revenue from next year to the present financial year.  It is another form of borrowing.  We are borrowing from next year's finances. Indeed we are borrowing from hard-pressed industry because we are saying to industrialists: &ldquo;Instead of paying your taxes when they fall due next year you will have to pay this year, and we are going to force you in turn to borrow from the banks and they, in turn, will have to borrow from international institutions.&rdquo; Overall this will not improve the position of the State one iota.  This form of gimmickry is not in anyone's interest.  It is not productive and the sooner we stop messing with figures in this way the better.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister did not see fit to proceed with the tax credit system. If a taxpayer has a mortgage and happens to be paying interest of £2,000 a year, if his tax rate is 25 per cent or 35 per cent, he would get 25 per cent or 35 per cent of <Col N="1004" /> the £2,000 in tax saving.  If his tax rate happens to be 60 per cent he would get 60 per cent of that as a tax saving.  Therefore, the better off the taxpayer is, the higher income he has, the more supplement he will get from the State.  It is a crazy situation which has existed for a long time.</P>
    <P>In the previous budget we took steps to introduce a credit system which would mean that £1,000 tax credit would be equal in the hands of a taxpayer who pays 25 per cent and in the hands of a taxpayer who pays 60 per cent.  Indeed if I had my way it would be biased the other way, that a man paying the 25 per cent tax rate would get a higher supplement.  We aimed at equality, but the Government now have decided that they want to continue the old system, the discrimination against the lower paid taxpayers.  They were the taxpayers who marched through the city seeking reforms.  This is not just and it is one of the things the Government will regret when the marches begin again because they have not seen Fianna Fáil doing anything about tax reform.  Indeed they saw them nipping in the bud the Coalition's commencement of tax reform.  It is one of the most regrettable parts of this budget.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to the low increases for the exempt categories, mainly elderly people and those on low incomes.  The increase is hardly over 10 per cent, whereas social welfare increases are in excess of 25 per cent.  Here we have people on very low incomes, £4,000 for a married couple, and all they are getting is slightly over 10 per cent.  This means that old age pensioners paying tax on a pension &mdash; and most old age pensioners pay tax now because their social welfare pensioners and any retirement pension they might have are added together to form their taxable income &mdash; gets an increase of about 13p a week.  It is an insult to put this proposal before the House.  These are people who have paid taxes all their lives and when they should be having some sort of relaxation and some enjoyment from life they are offered an increase of 13p a week.  The least we could have done was increase the allowance by the inflation rate and increase the <Col N="1005" /> exemption limits.  If we had introduced the tax credit system that would have been better again.  But to offer an increase of 13p a week is the greatest insult of all time.</P>
    <P>Earlier I mentioned the problem of decisions being taken outside this House and the problem of international bankers becoming more and more the people who call the tune.  I regret that we, as Members of this House, have permitted this to happen and have permitted steps to be taken whereby Ministers can announce things outside this House which should be raised here and questioned.  I refer particularly to the unprecedented announcement some weeks before the budget of increases in the prices of beer, cigarettes and so on.  It gave the budget the appearance of something soft.  We should have been told the truth and that we must all manage our financial affairs better.  This is an appalling situation and if I was occupying that Chair as Ceann Comhairle I would call the relevant Minister before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for abusing the privileges of this House in selecting what would or would not come before this House.  I am appalled and I hope that precedent will never be followed in future.</P>
    <P>When one sees people in the 60 per cent tax bracket who have plenty of money in their back pockets getting added encouragement from Fianna Fáil, it is not surprising to see that people in the capital gains tax bracket are also getting a few bob from Fianna Fáil.  We proposed to introduce capital taxes which would have increased income by £6.5 million.  We are the people who introduced a capital gains tax in the first instance to tax gains which up to that time had been totally exempt from tax. When Fianna Fáil came into Government they almost abolished these by the introduction of the time reduction qualification and the multiplier, giving back to these people who were making enormous windfall profits on all sorts of capital deals money which they should have been paying in tax saying, &ldquo;Take it back, thank you very much for your support.  Continue to support us and we will continue to look after you.&rdquo;  When we came into <Col N="1006" /> Government we said that these people would have to pay their fair share and we increased capital gains tax which would have raised £6.5 million.  But Fianna Fáil came back and, with the support of some of our socialist allies, reduced to £2.7 million the £6.5 million that we were going to take from the capital gains tax class.  They have given £4 million to their capital gains tax class supporters just as they have given back money to the 60 per cent tax bracket supporters.</P>
    <P>This is totally retrograde step which, when one takes into consideration the additional reversal of our proposal in regard to discretionary trust which is really a vehicle for tax avoidance, makes one wonder if Fianna Fáil are serving the whole community or only the very well off members of the community.  It seems that that is the case.  These are the people who line the coffers at election time.  The sooner we get around to providing funds in the annual budget for political parties to fund their election campaigns so that they will not have to depend on these people the better it will be for the country. It might mean introducing a supplementary budget.  However, I would ask the Minister to consider introducing into the annual budget of this House a provision to fund the political parties so that they will not have to depend on these characters and therefore will not have to reward them, in this case to the tune of £4 million.  This is a priority and the sooner it is given serious consideration and brought before this House the better.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about how great are Fianna Fáil's proposals to keep down the consumer price index.  The consumer price index needs to be kept down particularly for the poorer classes since the Government have increased the direct tax burden on them.  The import VAT imposition will mean that there will be a great deal of registration and a great deal of income, but many businesses, particularly the freight sector, will be brought to a halt and that will encourage unemployment. I do not oppose import VAT in principle, but now is not the time to impose it.  We should be taking every possible step to see that unemployment is decreased, but these provisions could <Col N="1007" /> have a serious effect on employment. Again this is just a book exercise, something that the Minister for Education, the then Deputy Martin O'Donoghue, came up with during the general election when faced with the problem of where Fianna Fáil were going to get the money to implement their proposals.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to the provision of the £5 million for the National Enterprise Agency.  This follows on the Government's decision not to proceed with the National Development Corporation. The National Development Corporation as we planned it has had its role reduced.  We proposed to provide it with £20 million and we provided for that in the budget.  Fianna Fáil are calling it the National Enterprise Agency and are giving it £5 million.  In these times with such high unemployment, why can we not invest in encouraging industry and other enterprises to create employment?  I cannot understand why on any objective basis the money was reduced.  It was in part a contribution for the extra votes which were bought for the election of the Taoiseach.  I cannot understand why the provision for the National Development Corporation was reduced to £5 million. The Government have further reduced the tax-free allowance for children.  We reduced it last year.  I suppose in time it will be abolished altogether however, the £500 allowance given for incapacitated children has not been increased.  It was one of the few allowances which were not increased.  An incapacitated child does not cost a lot of money to look after.  We have just left the year of the disabled behind us and yet the Minister did not increase the incapacitated child allowance. It could have been increased without costing the Exchequer too much.  I ask the Minister to consider increasing it by 20 per cent at least.</P>
    <P>There are many people in receipt of social welfare child benefits who should not be in receipt of them.  There is no reason why the State should pay allowances on a monthly basis to people with a sizeable income, for example, a Government Minister.  Yet the State, year after year, continues to provide it.  If we <Col N="1008" /> reduce child tax-free allowances because the child social welfare benefit is being increased, that is fair enough, but we should not pay out State funds to millionaire classes who do not need them.  I have an interest in this since my wife gave birth to our first child this week.  These provisions should be made available to those who need them.</P>

      <P>Thank you very much.  The statement the Minister made that there would be no change in the income tax relief provisions in respect of existing mortgage holders requires detailed explanation.  What is happening is that the Government are saying we need to make certain changes in the mortgage interest provisions but we dare not do so to our supporters or to the people we are depending on.  There is no question of whether it is right or wrong but only whether they will lose support.  The Minister should explain this provision. Does it mean that a person with an existing mortgage will continue to enjoy the mortgage interest relief position as it applied prior to the introduction of the budget?  In other words my rate of interest can be relieved at up to 60 per cent, whereas a person who takes out a mortgage now and may be hard pressed to meet repayments will be restricted to the standard rate of tax.  Is this what it means?  If it is, it is discriminatory and does not have a hope in hell of succeeding in the first challenge that is made against it in the courts.  There is no doubt but that it is unconstitutional.  One cannot make a provision for some people and leave others out.  The Minister for Finance is not here but I should like to have this information and ask him to arrange for it to be sent to me.  How will this provision function?  I should like to know if it will be as I suggested. <Col N="1009" /> With regard to the 1 per cent levy on insurance companies, this will further increase the cost of motor insurance which is already outrageously high.  This will have an enormous effect on young people and on the number of people who will not insure their cars and will drive without insurance.  I do not condone this.</P>
      <P>The money for Dublin Corporation is very welcome.  However, the way in which it came about is regrettable.  There is no question of objectivity about it.  Any attempt by the Minister to continue to interfere with the autonomy of Dublin Corporation will be resisted by this side of the House.  The Minister has already caused the roadway proposals made by the Fianna Fáil group in the city council to be reversed in one fell swoop.  This is because of the voting situation in this House.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this budget.  It is not often that we have two budgets so quickly.  I welcome Deputy MacSharry to the position of Minister for Finance and Tánaiste and compliment him on his budget.  It has gained nationwide acceptance and very little adverse comment. One would need to be a nit-picker to find any flaws in it, I am sure the Minister will effect further improvements <Col N="1010" /> in the years ahead as he produces other budgets.</P>
      <P>To make a comparison between the last budget, Deputy Bruton's brutal budget, and the present one, they both set out to do the same thing and give us an indication of the basic differences between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. Sometimes people who do not study politics ask what are the differences between the two.  If one analyses the approach to the budget one will see what the differences are.  In January we had a budget introduced with a long dissertation on the country's ills, a lengthy explanation of the causes of our trouble.  Most of the causes, of course, were attributed on that occasion to the Fianna Fáil Party, and while the diagnosis by the then Minister for Finance may have been right, the medicine he forced us to take was very unpalatable indeed and was rejected.  It was rejected by us, and anyone can understand that because we do not belong to the Coalition family.  It was rejected even by their allies on whom they depended, except for one ally who is still with them and he appears to have a digestive system that would allow him to accept any type of medicine.  Above all it was rejected by the Irish people.  It is fair to note that when you introduce any legislation not alone must it be accepted here in the House but in the long run it must be accepted by the Irish people also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Minister had a very short time to formulate his budget in March 1982, a matter of weeks in fact.  It is understandable that he had to take on board the framework and most of the financial provisions of the previous budget because of the financial and time restrictions that were forced on him, but he adapted and adopted very well.  First we felt we had an obligation to honour the election promises made by our party and we honoured those commitments in full.  We canvassed and we informed people at the doors that VAT would not be imposed on clothes and footwear as far as we were concerned and that we would keep the subsidies on essential foods.  We did not renege on those promises.  We did not make the excuse that when we had a quick look at the books and saw how bad <Col N="1011" /> the country was and how little money was in the coffers, we could not keep those promises.  Those promises were kept in full and we managed to introduce a few nice touches also which will be appreciated widely by the people.  We raised the same amount of taxation.  The current budget deficit is £679 million.  In January last the expected deficit would have been £715 million, so we have gained a little plus there.  We gave the same reliefs to the people as were promised in the previous budget but did it in a different fashion and we kept the overall Exchequer borrowing requirements to £1,683 million which compares very favourably with £1,661 million in the January budget.  That is a difference of £22 million, a very slight minus.  All this is despite the concessions we made on VAT, subsidies and other benefits and despite the loss of revenue which we have suffered because the budget was not introduced in January and had to wait until March or April.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker this morning accused us of sharp practice when we got an opportunity of introducing some of the provisions in the previous budget before the budget proper was introduced in the House.  That was a good book keeping exercise and a very realistic one because any revenue that this country needs at present should be gained as quickly as possible.  Above all else the budget shows a humane, caring approach by Fianna Fáil and it is generally accepted that for some reason or other, maybe practice, maybe luck, we seem to be able to do the job a little better than those who tried to do it in January.</P>
    <P>I agree that the budget had to be tough, but it is a toughness tempered with humanity and reality.  To my mind the January budget was a typical Fine Gael budget born of a rancher mentality.  I know that ranchers and all big farmers are supposed to be interested in grass roots, but the January budget was very far removed from the grass roots and the reality of this country.  Any Taoiseach or Minister for Finance should remember the word &ldquo;acceptability&rdquo;, that the people should accept it.  This budget was not <Col N="1012" /> accepted; it was rejected in the House and subsequently in the general election by the Irish people.  To frame a budget that will be rejected in that way is political suicide.  I understand the Fine Gael mentality. It is in keeping with my opinion of them and their track record up to this. However, I cannot understand how four Labour Ministers sat at that Cabinet table and listened to that budget being framed. What were they doing to allow this draconian, Cromwellian type of legislation to be included in the budget?  Were they sleeping partners, had they any interest at all or were they hypnotised by the theorists?  Were they afraid to voice their views?  It is hard to understand how anyone who had pretensions to membership of what is called the Labour Party and to representing the plain working people of Ireland could have been a party to the recommendations in that budget.</P>
    <P>During the discussions that followed on the night this budget was introduced we on this side of the House were asked to explain our vote in the January budget, and I will endeavour to do so now.  I had not an opportunity on that night, although Deputy Woods, now Minister for Health and Social Welfare, explained his reasons for it.  It is fair to remark that the first vote that happened to come up in the January budget concerned the price of beer.  Our intention was to defeat the budget, to defeat the total tyrannical package presented to us, and we were convinced that we should use every opportunity of doing so.  The first opportunity we had, the opportunity which the whole country wanted us to grasp, was given to us at that time and we used it to reject the total budget package.  We voted against it and others joined us and the people, in the election, condoned our action.  Nobody that I met at any door during the canvass agreed that it was a good budget in any way.  The people did not even say it was a fair or middling budget.  The verdict was that it was a bad, bungling budget and I heard it described as naive, stupid and thoughtless.  I think those terms are correct.</P>
    <P>We were accused by Fine Gael and Labour speakers in the House last week of not being consistent when we put 2p <Col N="1013" /> more on the pint of beer.  We produced an acceptable package here last week and it would be the height of hypocrisy to look at our budget and analyse it on the price of beer alone.  Deputy Woods, now Minister for Health, rose to explain that he could accept the extra tax on beer and spirits because of the good items that were in the budget.  I found it very acceptable because it allowed us to provide the money for other items and enabled us to keep our election promises regarding VAT on clothes and shoes and the retention or restoration of food subsidies.  It enabled us also to allow parents to send their four-year-old children to primary school and to pay for the teachers and the extra places that would be demanded for those children.</P>
    <P>Those are the issues on which we fought the election.  Those were the issues on which Fine Gael fought the election. They were planks in their political programme and people of Ireland rejected those planks.  Even Fine Gael and Deputy Garret FitzGerald himself were prepared to throw these principles overboard in a last frantic effort to hold on to power just before the 23rd Dáil resumed here.  It appears that sacred principles that were defended by poor Deputy Boland, former Minister for Education, as best he could with regard to the four-and-a-half-year-old child, could be thrown overboard when the trappings of power began to slip away.  It appears now that Garret the good, the man with the flawless pedigree and the purest political principles, the straight man, was quite prepared to do U-turns, double U-turns, five-point and three-point turns, and back somersaults and cartwheels if necessary when he felt he might be able to pull the game out of the fire.  It is no wonder that Deputy Burke found it necessary to renounce his Fine Gael allegiance yesterday, retire from local politics and go to Brussels to serve Ireland again as Commissioner there &mdash; indeed, the reluctant attributes that were paid to Deputy Burke here this morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The European Community is a place where one submerges one's party affiliations and places first the interests of the Community and Ireland.</P>
      <P>Mr. Bruce Arnold in today's edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i> accuses Mr. Burke of betraying his party and he, too, seems to be blind to the national merits of the move initiated by the Taoiseach.

      <P>Knowing your appreciation of literature and poetry, I conclude on this point by saying that the obstinate refusal of this journalist to see any apparent good in the new Commissioner gives him a common bond with blind John Milton.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment is the most important domestic problem facing this country. We listed it as a priority but the January budget did nothing to provide one extra job, apart from setting up an agency <Col N="1015" /> whose merits I doubt.  During their seven months in office the only jobs provided by the Coalition were for their cronies and immediate relatives.  It was an example of shameless political patronage. There were front bench occupants who pushed their relatives into jobs as advisers at frightful cost, not only in terms of money but in terms of credibility and honesty.  This disgraceful chapter was commented upon by Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan.  Even his indelicate susceptibilities were offended by the actions of the Coalition, although he is on record on television programmes as supporting political patronage and jobs for the boys, all things being equal.  I can well understand that Deputy Flanagan may not have been too happy with jobs for the girls as well.  The only redeeming feature of this unhappy episode is that these people have had their advisory services terminated and I am satisfied that the various Government Departments will be well rid of them and will get on quite well without them.</P>
    <P>We have made an honest attempt in this budget to provide jobs and I would refer to the restoration of grants under the farm modernisation scheme.  The Minister for Finance has restored these grants to pre-September 1981 levels and the £4 million will be welcome this year. When the percentage was reduced by Deputy Dukes, the former Minister for Agriculture, drainage and land reclamation work came to a standstill in my county and neighbouring areas.  Agricultural contractors who had invested huge sums in machinery were out of work and the machinery was lying idle.  A County Laois firm, Fleming's Fireclays Limited, who produce about a quarter of the nation's needs for land drainage pipes had to close down because their stores were full of pipes which nobody wanted. The restoration of these grants has given hope to these people and they have been in contact with me since.  I know that the Minister's knowledge of farming and his sympathy with the plight of farmers will allow him to update the grants later to current prices.  This will be money well spent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1016" /> One of our greatest resources is the cattle industry and I hope every endeavour will be made to cure the ills of our meat industry, which are principally due to the decline in our herd numbers.  A closure is at present taking place in Munster and there will shortly be another in Leixlip.  Three meat factories in my constituency are on short-time working. Much has been said about live exports and I believe there is a place for a limited amount of live exports but that every incentive should be given to provide jobs here and add value.  Our meat should be exported not only in carcase form but also vac-packed to give the maximum amount of added value.</P>
    <P>The deliberations about farm prices and the long-term view of agriculture should include some type of market security because there have always been peaks and valleys in the marketing of cattle.  It is important that farmers who embark on programmes to build up herds or flocks should be assured of the prices they will get in several years' time.</P>
    <P>Certain remarks were made about our proposition to impose VAT on imports at the point of entry and it was claimed that this would have a detrimental effect of jobs.  It may have some effect on the cash flow situation but in the main people import only what they will sell and the Minister has indicated that firms who find themselves in extreme difficulties can turn for special attention to Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>I wish to give an instance where this measure will have a beneficial effect. There are two knitwear factories in Monasterevin who are finding things difficult, although they are keeping their heads above water.  The provisions of the January budget would have meant that the manager selling £100 worth of goods to the local supermarket would have had to charge them £118 because VAT would have had to be paid straight away.  The same supermarket could have imported goods and not paid any VAT until the goods were sold.  There was an inbuilt assistance to the importation of foreign goods at the expense of home industries. It is no wonder that those people, former <Col N="1017" /> supporters of the party to which Deputy Molony belongs, should have put up their own posters asking people to vote against VAT because of the danger that it would cause the closure of their factory.  This new move will help to preserve jobs at home.  I agree that it may cause cash flow problems to some firms but if we have an opportunity to help people to help themselves at home we should take it within the EEC regulations.  This is a very brave and helpful move.</P>
    <P>There was not anything in the January budget which would be of assistance to the building industry but there are definite amounts of money in last Thursday's budget to provide jobs, particularly in the building industry.  There is no other industry which can provide instant jobs from a green field situation.  The £50 million provided is needed and will help to bring people back to work immediately. Already those involved in the construction industry, suppliers and contractors, tell me that an air of confidence is beginning to come back.</P>
    <P>The record of the Coalition Government with regard to local authority housing leaves a lot to be desired.  Deputy Molony will appreciate that when one is judging anybody one cannot always look up the form book.  In the seven months the Coalition Government were in power there was no money allocated to my county for any new starts.  There was no new house building at all in Kildare except for one big effort which was made. I was a member of a deputation to the then Minister of State, Fergus O'Brien, asking for some money to be given to start some new houses in Droichead Nua. He provided £50,000 to allow approximately 50 houses to be started there.  The fact that se need between 400 and 500 houses is something people may quibble about but the allocation of £50,000 was a start.  It is worthy of note that Fergus O'Brien has decided to opt out of the team and has now gone back to the ESB. I was sorry to see him going because he was quite a good man.  I suppose he knows his own mind best.</P>

      <P>It probably was not as big a shock to Fine Gael when he went to the ESB as ex-Deputy Burke's move was.  I wish them both well.  The only other item the Coalition Government can claim credit for in my county was the erection of 19 isolated cottages scattered here and there throughout the county.  There is a great need for housing and we must do everything possible to provide houses all over the country.  I can appreciate that the Minister for Finance would have liked to do more in the budget than Deputy Bruton hoped to do.  We will endeavour to improve the position.</P>
      <P>The extra money has been provided for the construction of roads and schools. I am pleased that the Department of the Environment will restore house improvement grants where houses are in need of structural repair.  There were no grants for windows, doors or the restoration of roofs under the previous administration.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to some good news in the budget relating to my Department, for the veterans of the War of Independence. I am sure all sides of the House share with me our indebtedness to the people who played such an important role in the foundation of the State.  I regard the veterans of the War of Independence as being in a very special category. It is gratifying that this year's budget contains certain improvements in the concessions to veterans, their spouses and widows available from my Department. Those improvements will become effective from 1 July next and will cost £250,000.  The funeral grants will be increased from £200 to £300.  Those grants were first introduced in the 1969 budget when I first entered the House. They were then £25 and were payable in respect of special allowance holders only. The amount was increased in subsequent budgets and the categories of people in respect of whom those allowances were payable were also widened.  The grant is normally paid to the widow of the veteran but where there is no widow it is paid to the person responsible for the funeral expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before this budget a number of widows of veterans were not eligible for the <Col N="1019" /> allowance of £296 per year because their late husbands never applied for a special allowance.  Provision has now been made to extend the allowance to such widows, subject to certain conditions in relation to means, and also to the widows of disablement pensioners whose wounds were received in the period from 23 April 1916 to 11 July 1921.  It is proposed from 1 July next that a free bottle gas scheme similar to that operated by the Department of Social Welfare will be introduced.  As soon as the details of the scheme have been decided the availability of this concession will be published in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>I am sure we would all like to see more improvements made in concessions to the veterans of the War of Independence and their widows but I am sure the House appreciates that because of the present restrictions it is not possible to go beyond the measures I have mentioned.  Prior to the 1969 budget most Ministers of Finance looked on the Defence Estimate as a means of paring back and when any pruning had to be done unfortunately it was done in that Department.  It is unfortunate it took the troubles in the North and the spill-over down here to make us realise the need for our Defence Forces. We have a very loyal and well trained Army and their good work in emergencies like oil strikes and blizzards can be appreciated by everybody.  Our Air Corps meet the needs of our times and are suitable for a country like this.  The Air Corps do all their work very efficiently. The best way we can show appreciation of their work is to provide funds for them.  I know the Minister for Finance will remember them in his budgets in 1983, 1984 and 1985.</P>
    <P>It can be said that the social conscience of any party or any country can be judged by our attitude to old people and how we treat the less well off.  I would like to commend the Minister for Finance on the fact that GMS cards are now available for social welfare recipients who are old age pensioners.  That is a very humane gesture.</P>
    <P>We all welcome the decision to throw overboard the decision of the Coalition <Col N="1020" /> Government not to recruit gardaí.  We need those extra gardaí on the beat.  Law and order have practically broken down throughout the country and the gardaí are stretched to the limit.  We should do everything possible to bring back respect for the law and give old people living alone a sense of security.</P>
    <P>There has been some talk about the foreign travel tax.  We have changed things in relation to this.  I do not believe the new tax will do any harm.  A fee of £2 on a sea ticket bought here and £3 on an air ticket is not a lot.  I am positive it will not interfere with the flow on tourists into the country because they normally buy their tickets abroad and have return tickets so it will not effect them.  People who do not take the advice of seeing Ireland first or who do not believe they have not seen half of it yet and who want to sample the delights of overseas travel should be prepared to pay £2 or £3 to enable them to do that.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister mentioned decentralisation.  This is a policy dear to my heart, even though I am pretty near Dublin, because I am convinced that it is no help to the overall well-being of the country that Dublin has become so top heavy and that one-third of our population live in the greater Dublin area.  I have experienced difficulties that have been foisted on our own county because of the spill-out over the Dublin border &mdash; difficulties in planning permission, difficulties experienced when planning permissions were granted by a previous Coalition Minister for Local Government who had the audacity to grant planning permissions himself &mdash; this was before an Bord Pleanála came into being &mdash; in Dublin and expected us in Kildare to provide sanitary facilities to accommodate his scheme just across the Dublin border.</P>
    <P>While our programme of decentralisation has not gained the momentum I would like to see, it is a step in the right direction and I know it will be continued and it will help to redress the imbalance created by the congregation of people in Dublin.  We should consciously encourage people to live and work elsewhere. That would mean that we would have to <Col N="1021" /> provide the infrastructure, communications and roads, telephones and telex for industry.  Airports will also be required. These are incentives to industrialists to base themselves away from Dublin.  The fact that we have made the move with some of our Government Departments is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>When I mention airports and infrastructure and some of these items that for social and other reasons we feel should be based away from Dublin, we should discuss white elephants for a little while. It appears that certain scribes think they have some God-given gift that enables them to identify white elephants immediately. It would be well to remember that it is hard to be sure what is a white elephant.  Rather like the Arctic bear or fox, with the passing of different seasons they tend to change colour and what appears white at one stage can be grey or even black at a later stage.</P>
    <P>To take a local example, around 1948 the Government decided to erect a turf burning generating station at Allenwood to use local fuel to provide electricity.  A former Minister for Finance &mdash; now departed &mdash; classified it as the greatest white elephant in the area at that time. Little did he realise when it became operational in 1951 that it would continue to 1982.  It is still continuing to provide electricity and has now become very viable and economic because of the increased oil price in the meantime and it has given generations of people employment in the Allenwood area. People who attempt to identify white elephants could be wrong.</P>
    <P>Another example worth mentioning is that of Shannon.  In the very early days of Aer Rianta and Foynes we were presumptuous enough to think that we could build an international airport at Shannon. James Dillon at that time forecast that rabbits would play on the runways there eventually.  I can understand that he may not have been aware that myxomatosis would come to this country and that rabbits would become scarce.  I think now that Shannon can be classified as the greatest success story this country can show.  Not alone is it a success as an international airport but around it the <Col N="1022" /> Shannon complex grew up attracting clusters of industry and a whole new town giving employment of a very sophisticated and economically viable nature has been created there.  Jobs have been found for people at the mouth of the Shannon where before only mud flats existed. James Dillon, for whom I have a high regard, may have been wrong on this occasion and some of the scribes who now refer to the Connacht Regional Airport at Knock as a white elephant also might do well to think about the situation.</P>
    <P>We once had a Buchanan Report and, if we had accepted that, we would have blindly accepted that only particular areas in the country could have become growth centres &mdash; Galway was one and Limerick another &mdash; but people in Mayo, in Castlebar and Ballina and smaller places would have been condemned for ever to go to Galway for work, apart from the work that could be given locally in a small way on the land and in forestry or perhaps on the sea.  Again, Fianna Fáil thinking proved that we should diversify and that areas like Ballina and Castlebar should also be designated as growth centres and that industry should be attracted there.  I believe that the Connacht Regional Airport at Knock &mdash; I am pleased despite criticisms that we have persevered at that &mdash; will be built and could well emulate what has been done in Shannon.  There is also room there for an industrial complex and 20 years hence we may experience an economic miracle in that area which has already experienced a miracle of a different nature.  Therefore, people who feel so sure of themselves when they denounce projects may make better historians than prophets, because things have a habit of not working out exactly as they might wish.</P>
    <P>I come now to a matter fairly dear to my own heart, the racing industry.  There are 9,000 people directly employed in the racing and bloodstock industry in Ireland.  They make very little noise in comparison to the 9,000 &mdash; which is probably the figure that would apply &mdash; in the fishing industry who seem much more vociferous in their demands.  The racing <Col N="1023" /> industry gets no grants of any kind and the only money the Government are involved in is that taken out of the industry in tax.  We take the success of the industry very much for granted and I think it is time to decide to tread warily now when the first distress signals are to be seen.  The racing industry is our greatest shop window in which to display our wares &mdash; the success of our race horses and bloodstock.  This happens year after year.</P>
    <P>In the year just gone by we saw the success of Irish breeding in Shergar.  I am pleased to note that the Aga Khan has made a financial sacrifice in bringing back Shergar to Ireland where he will stand at stud at Ballymany, County Kildare.  We had a success story as far as Irish trainers are concerned when Dermot Weld trained Blue Wind to win the Irish and English Oaks.  Blue Wind has now gone to the US and I am sure her performances there, while not successful to date, will do us credit in the future.</P>
    <P>Horse racing represents a great industry for us.  It provides jobs with a very good income and it must have a very beneficial effect on our balance of payments. It is an indigenous industry, and very successful, and we should not wait until it goes downhill to take measures necessary to safeguard it.  To own a horse at present one would want to be a philantrophist, have a lot of spare money; because people who own horses, contrary to expectations, do not make money &mdash; they may have money.  It is no harm to get people with money to become involved in and to be prepared to invest in this country.  Eventually, those who own horses finish up with less than they started with.  Prize money and the assistance horse owners get is not sufficient and it is necessary that somebody put back what they take out.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister for Finance had to accept the Coalition budget in most of its forms because to produce something along these line would have taken more time and thought, but I am confident that when he examines the situation, efforts will be made in the next budget to help this <Col N="1024" /> industry which is under the Department of Agriculture.  I hope we set up a commission to look into all aspects of the bloodstock and racing industry, that it will report back soon and then action will be taken.  We already have a very good analysis of that industry done by Professor McCormack and this, if acted upon, would be very helpful.</P>
    <P>I saw a submission recently that a racing training centre should be established in the Curragh.  This would give employment for up to 100 people a year and would provide training for 40 people &mdash; jockeys, apprentices, farriers, stud grooms and those engaged in stud farm management.  The need is there, not alone in the Curragh but in training establishments in Tipperary, Cork and elsewhere. This is an industry we should apply ourselves to because an industry which has its roots in the country is most likely to succeed.  People all over the world appreciate our native expertise in this area.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with training people for jobs abroad but the fact that some of our young jockeys, stud grooms and those engaged in the industry might eventually go abroad is a help to the industry.  Every race meeting, whether it be Cheltenham, Epsom, Aintree or the Curragh and every horse show in the RDS, Aachen, Hickstead or anywhere else is a very good advertisement for the Irish horse.  The people involved in this industry are doing their best and we must show our appreciation.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on the attitude to this budget displayed by Opposition Deputies.  Deputy G. Mitchell laboured the theme that he was not convinced of our honesty, that he was worried about our lack of honesty and that he could not accept we had made honest efforts.  All I can say is that he must be mixing with the wrong people.  Deputy Bruton showed that when he was shorn of his civil service back-up he was a very normal man.  I saw a very big difference between the Deputy Bruton who stood in this House on 27 January and the Deputy Bruton who spoke on Budget Day.  In January he was haughty and confident, with 80 pages to deliver.  Not alone had <Col N="1025" /> he had the time to give us all the bad news but he interlaced it with lectures on how we should mend our ways.  That confidence evaporated when he found himself on the other side of the House.  He even advanced the theory that he would need more warning to comment on the budget. In my view the general performance of the Opposition speakers showed they were hardly able to raise a gallop.  As a doggy man I am sure Deputy Bruton will forgive me if I say his performance appeared as if he had run unsighted.</P>
    <P>Deputy B. Desmond said the budget was a carbon copy of previous budgets and attributed most of the provisions to the Taoiseach.  We all made an input into the budget and I am proud to be associated with a budget into which the Taoiseach had an input.  I would like to know where was the Labour input in the Coalition budget?  Did they feel very proud of their performance?  From what he said it appears that Deputy B. Desmond spent his months in office as Minister of State at the Department of Finance combing the files for pieces of scandal. Such muck-raking is no help to anybody. He would have been better employed if he had done the job he was asked to do. He seemed confident that he had found many things in the file about which we should all be aware.  If he has any evidence he should produce it.  I would like to know about it.</P>
    <P>The Opposition parties must feel shattered by their failure to bring in their budget and by the results of the subsequent election, but it would be better for everyone concerned if they put up a better show.  I advise Deputy Molony to tell his colleagues to pull themselves together and give us a better game because the performance of any Government can only be as good as the Opposition they meet.  If people feel they do not need to play well they are likely to relax and not give of their best.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Wilson when he classified the Opposition performance as nitpicking.  They mentioned taking VAT off books.  They had the opportunity to do something about that, as we did, but they did not do anything about it.  Now we have got around to it and the VAT is <Col N="1026" /> off books, particularly school books.  We had pharisaical platitudes as to what was a missal, what was a missalette; what was a pamphlet, what was a magazine?  We had this type of grudging tribute.  Deputy Shatter wanted to know the difference between a cot and a pram and referred to demountable moses baskets, or carriers people took into the house after taking the wheels off.  That type of criticism does not do any good.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to tell the House that this was a good budget, and if the Opposition were honest they would admit it.  It has helped to restore confidence at home and abroad, as the people who are genuinely interested in the good of this country agree.  For too long we have been listening to such things as &ldquo;we will all be ruined Mrs. Hanrahan if the rain don't stop&rdquo; and it is high time the Coalition dropped that attitude. Thank God this ocón agus ocón is over and the sack cloth and ashes and the rending of their garments by these political pharisees is settled.  We heard their swan song last January.  Now light and hope have dawned and the people are glad Fianna Fáil are back in office, that the country is back on the rails again, and that the hand on the helm can be trusted. I welcome the budget and hope the Minister will have equal success in all the budgets he introduces in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to comment on some of the points made by the Minister for Defence.  I was astonished to hear him refer to what he described as the U-turns adopted by the last Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, in an attempt to stay in power.  When one considers the Gregory deal in all its aspects and the efforts made by the present Taoiseach to grab power earlier this month, one readily appreciates the thirst for power that exists on the Government benches.  I am sorry to see Deputy Power leaving the House because I would like to refer him to certain other U-turns in Fianna Fáil policy that were highlighted in this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall the promise of the 1977 election to do away with car tax.  It was not done away with It was reintroduced at £5 and <Col N="1027" /> increased by 200 per cent, and they were perfectly happy to adopt the Coalition's position on that.  There was never any explanation of their change in policy or why car tax was not to be justified.  In 1977 they said it was a penal tax, hard on young and hard on everybody.  In 1982 such arguments did not apply.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to hear Deputy Power speak about Knock Airport.  He did not say whether he supported that idea and I find it hard to discover which side he is on.  Many people in Fianna Fáil have expressed grave reservations about the building of Knock Airport, while some are totally opposed to it and others have expressed total support for it.  There is no doubt that one cannot compare Knock Airport with Shannon Airport or Knock Airport with some of the projects he referred to.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that, already, certain difficulties have arisen in regard to legislation being passed in this House, for example, the rent question which is the subject of legislation at present?  Difficulties have arisen with regard to legislation from clauses in the Constitution, such as the clauses in Article 43.  Does the Taoiseach accept that there is need to amend the Constitution in many vital areas concerning <Col N="1033" /> people living in the Republic?  The Taoiseach's predecessor, Seán Lemass, accepted the need for this a long time ago.  Would the Taoiseach accept that the case is well proved in certain areas, such as legislation dealing with the anomalies concerning tenants who believed themselves to be living in rent-controlled dwellings?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Changing the Constitution is fairly fundamental and not to be lightly embarked on.  I think the Deputy would agree that, in areas like this, very often when one contemplates change, one has to be sure that one is not doing more harm than good.  It is very important that if one is going to change the Constitution, one improves rather than disimproves the situation.  I would hope that on the matter to which the Deputy referred, the legislation dealing with rent restriction, the Bill we will be bringing before the House will meet the constitutional requirements.  In fact, I have always felt that there should not be any great difficulty in framing legislation which would protect the rights and the interests of tenants while, at the same time, meet the obligations of the Constitution, particularly when one takes into account the social principles enshrined in the Constitution.  A reasonably broad interpretation of our Constitution should enable us to meet any particular exigencies which would arise in this area.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach still see no merit in an all-party committee of this House being given an opportunity to review the Constitution with a view to bringing a report before this House, bearing in mind that many Bills have been referred to the Supreme Court either by the President or by individual citizens in recent years?  This practice is increasing with ever-greater momentum and therefore, there is an urgent need for a constitutional review, not just on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, as we go along.  Does he still see no merit in that proposition?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The administration of which the Deputy was a very important member did not have an all-party committee <Col N="1034" /> review of the Constitution.  They opted for a review by a special committee which was, in fact, a committee of lawyers. The question of an all-party Oireachtas review of the Constitution is entirely different.  It would be a major undertaking for politicians from different sides of the House to review the Constitution, and it would require a great deal of thought.  The Deputy will remember that the last such constitutional review did not achieve very much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Does the Taoiseach agree that certain proposals to amend the law, some of which are very necessary, seem to be running into difficulties with the Constitution quite frequently, such as bail which I mentioned here previously, the implementation of the Kenny Report and the Rent Restrictions Act?  Does the Taoiseach not think it is becoming more apparent that a general review of the Constitution is necessary to modernise it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like people to lull themselves into a false sense of security by thinking a review of the Constitution would solve all our problems in regard to legislation in the future.  If we are to have a written Constitution, the <Col N="1035" /> process whereby certain legislation finds itself in conflict with that written Constititution is inevitable.  Perhaps what is inherent in what some Deputies are suggesting is that we should not have a written Constitution at all, and that we should let Parliament be supreme.  That is another major step which would require very careful consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I should like to go back briefly to one particular point.  Surely the Taoiseach agrees that the present position regarding bail in criminal cases is quite unsatisfactory, and that the law should be changed and, if necessary, the Constitution, in order to give a wider discretion to the courts in regard to bail in criminal cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and I had this argument before.  It is relatively simple for any Deputy to pick some particular point and say we should change the Constitution to enable this or that to happen. The Constitution is the fundamental document adopted by the people.  To change it in a material respect would be a very important and fundamental matter. I am not sure that to keep rushing to the people in referenda every time we feel the Constitution is a bit inconvenient is the best way to conduct our affairs. There is a lot to be said for having a fundamental law, namely the Constitution, which is fairly permanent and in regard to which all our citizens know where they stand.  It is possible to do things in haste which might have unforseen repercussions.  I merely throw out these thoughts to indicate that it is not simply a matter of making life easy for Parliament for ever more by making changes in the Constitution every time we run into some difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Does the Taoiseach not realise that some of these difficulties arose from interpretations by the Supreme Court?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No-one is suggesting that for trivial reasons we should rush into changing the fundamental law.  No-one <Col N="1036" /> is suggesting that the certainty of law should be displaced.  There is no reference in the social clauses of the Constitution to the changed status of women in Irish society, and the equality between men and women which is now accepted on all sides.  Would the Taoiseach agree that too often when it came to dealing with the Constitution, the House dealt with its less important aspects?  This House has shown an inordinate interest in the method of election to the House. Would the Taoiseach agree that proportional representation has pre-occupied the House in relation to consideration of the Constitution.  Would the Taoiseach agree that when we have reached the stage at which social legislation required in the House encounters difficulties in the courts &mdash; because of their interpretation of certain constitutional clauses &mdash; the case has already been made in the daily lives of people that the Constitution is in need of review?  Is it not a fact also that the Taoiseach's predecessor accepted the need for this a long time ago?  This is not to displace the certainty of law but there is a need now in the Republic to amend the Constitution in certain vital respects. Its effect on Northern Ireland is peripheral to this.  Would the Taoiseach agree there is need now in the Republic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the principle that if there is need for the sake of our own affairs we should make those changes in relation to our own affairs. But I feel that there is in this House a somewhat over-simplistic view of the question of change in the Constitution.  It is assumed that we can change the Constitution in such a way that will overcome difficulties.  That is not so.  In any particular instance the framing of a particular question which will have to be put to the people would require very careful thought.  If we are to take out some particular Article of the present Constitution we have no certain guarantee that the Article we put in in its place will ultimately result in an improvement in the situation.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's replies in general I should like to <Col N="1037" /> ask him which of the two options he has presented to us he would favour as his initial reply would present the option of a static society and the other would present the option that he himself described as unattractive, which was rushing back to the electorate at every moment with referenda.  I ask this particularly in the context of the area of child care which encompasses two major areas, the area of illegitimacy and the area of adoption of children who are abandoned in homes with no entitlement to a family life, destined to that by our Constitution.  Is the Taoiseach telling us that we must either accept the static view of society with no change, or are we going to accept as a principle of operation this constant holding of referenda?  I would prefer the second option to the first rather than constantly going back to the country with referenda on these very important issues.</P>

      <P>I wish to take the Minister of State to task on this.  I was very unhappy with a reply I received to a question I asked last week and I want to ask him two questions now.  First of all, is he aware that the annual report last year of the federated services for unmarried parents expressed supreme concern about the delay in publication of statistical data in respect of our unmarried mothers?  Is the Minister aware that they further stated that the age of mother and the number of illegitimate births is vital for planning services?  Would the Minister <Col N="1041" /> of State get those figures as soon as possible?  I find it difficult to understand why they are not available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said I propose to circulate the details.  Following a question last week I circulated all the information on illegitimate births from age 15 to 20 and thereafter, in the age ranges set out.  The information sought today was to give the number of those under the age of 20 in the years 1978, 1979 and 1980, in other words of births to people aged 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19.</P>

      <P>I cannot because we will not be here next week.  May I ask the Minister of State if he is aware that in Britain it is possible for the same federation <Col N="1042" /> to telephone statistics offices and get information within one year about Irish women who have babies in England? Why can we not have the same kind of statistics available as quickly here because there is considerable concern felt amongst the health authorities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I can help the Deputy by saying that arrangements have been made to incorporate in the future detailed analyses of the births by age of mother, that is, showing all the ages from 15 to 48 together with under 15s and over 49s on the basis of year of registration.  This will be done in future issues of each December quarterly report.  An additional analysis in relation to the number of previous children will also be included.  The figures for 1981 will be included in the December 1981 quarterly report which will be available by July 1982, about seven months late, but it is quicker than what the Deputy mentioned about Britain.</P>

      <P>The specific information requested by the Deputy is not available. However, in the 1979 Labour Force Survey a question on nationality was included.  On the basis of the information on nationality received in that sample inquiry, it is estimated that there were about 31,000 United Kingdom nationals, <Col N="1043" /> aged 15 years and over, usually resident in the State in May 1979.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, I should like to know why the information is not available.  Is it because of the free movement between Ireland and Britain without passport controls?  Presumably, if I asked a question about the number of French nationals over 18 resident in Ireland I would be given an accurate answer because of passport controls. My question is very relevant to the question of voting rights.  We do not even know how many citizens of the United Kingdom are here because we already have a very open arrangement of free movement between the two countries. Will the Minister tell the House why he does not have that information?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that my question refers to doctors' surgeries. Is the Minister aware of the seriousness of the situation that arises because a busy surgery accommodating three doctors has but one telephone line?  Is it not possible to install overhead cables to provide a service so as to prevent serious problems arising in emergency cases?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Deputy's information I should like to state that at present there is only one telephone line at that address.  Two additional lines were applied for on 14 January 1981 and on 2 September 1981 each of the three doctors applied for an external extension from that address to their homes.  Provision of the required facilities, including lines at that address, is dependent on completion of cabling work to serve the area. Because of the volume of engineering work on hands requiring attention in the Dublin district it is unlikely that it will be possible to provide a service for about a year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 17 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>Service is offered to applicants when the main work necessary to enable service to be given has been carried out. Payment of the connection fee and advance rental is requested at that stage in accordance with the provisions of the Telephone Regulations, 1980, so that further expenditure which would be necessary if the offer of service was declined will not be incurred.  It is necessary in the interests of efficient organisation of the work to have a reasonable volume of accepted offers of service on hands at all times.</P>
      <P>When making the advance payment, customers are informed that provision of service may take up to three months, but in the vast majority of cases service is provided well within this period.  A refund of the payment made is usually offered where service is delayed beyond that.  Applicants in the 01 area may apply orally, or in writing, for a refund of their advance payments to the Manager, Dublin Telecommunications Office, Cumberland House, Fenian Street, Dublin 2.  Those outside the 01 area should apply to the appropriate commercial office, particulars of which are contained in the preface to the telephone directory, Part Two.</P>
      <P>The necessary cabling, installation of exchanges and other work to enable existing applications in South Dublin to be met will be carried out progressively over the next two years.  It is expected that the majority of these applications will be met within the next year and the remainder over the following year or so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that when they get this refund they have to go to the bottom of the list of applications, or have to make application again?  Does the Minister not feel that it is very unreasonable, having made this payment, to have to wait four months for service to be connected up, having the instrument already installed in their houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>There are 31 circuits from Clifden to Galway and 27 circuits in the reverse direction.  The area is served by overhead cable and much of the route is over exposed country leaving the cable particularly liable to damage during bad weather.  There is therefore a high incidence of faults, particularly in recent months, and the number of circuits in use can vary appreciably from time to time.</P>
      <P>Planned improvements in the Clifden area include the provision of a new digital radio link to Galway and the conversion of Clifden and its dependent exchanges to automatic working.  However, having regard to the size of the programme, it is unlikely that all these works will be completed until 1984.  In the light of the frequent disruptions in recent months my Department are considering urgently what interim measures can be taken to improve the quality of service as quickly as possible.  I will write to the Deputy as soon as this examination has been completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it fair and just that a whole section of countryside should be deprived of telephone communication at such regular intervals and for such long periods? There is no worthwhile telephone service in the west Connemara area and there has not been any for the past year or so. The service that is allegedly available is a farce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give a guarantee that the automatic programme that is in train will be brought forward to 1982 and completed before the end of this year, because this is an area where unemployment is way above the national average and the little industry which is there is being crippled due to the lack of a telephone service?  It is an area which is dependent on tourists, mostly foreign, who cannot contact their homes and therefore will not come to the area.  It is having a detrimental effect on the whole economy of a very large section of my constituency.  I appeal to the Minister to take immediate steps to accelerate the provision of the automatic service which is already under way.  Could it be brought forward for completion before the end of this year?</P>

I will ask my senior technical staff, in the light of what the Deputy has requested, to seek a possible alternative to ensure that there will be continuity of service.  At this stage I am not in a position to give an undertaking as to when the programme will be completed but I will try to have it done as quickly as possible.</P>

Is he aware that it is usual to have a delay of this kind in providing a service for senior citizens' complexes, something I find very difficult to understand? Does the Minister not accept that senior citizens have a particular need for communication, both for the likely occurrence of illness and its consequences and for the need for security, which is a major problem, especially in built-up urban areas.

      <P>I assure the Deputy it is my concern and the concern of the Department that the least possible damage will be done to that beautiful place where the ship was wrecked.  Unfortunately, already 292 tons of fuel and gas oils have been dispersed in the area and I cannot assure the House that there are no traces of that oil, although for the most part it has been broken up.  I will ask my surveyors to go there again to make all possible preparations to ask the owner to remove the wreck.  If it was in a harbour, the harbour authority could remove it.  If it was in the harbour or in a shipping lane, the Commissioners of Irish Lights could do it.  I am trying to have the owner identified.  I will ask him to have it removed so that the least possible damage will be done to the area which Deputy Begley and others appreciate so much.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputies should be reasonably familiar by now with the problems facing tenants of dwellings controlled under the old rent restrictions code.  This is the fourth piece of legislation to come before the House in the last 12 months on this subject and I hope that this time we have produced a Bill that strikes a fair balance between the rights of landlords and tenants and is at the same time constitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need to introduce new legislation to protect tenants arises out of a series of court decisions on the constitutionality of laws controlling rents and restricting the rights of landlords to recover possession of their property.  The Supreme Court's judgment on 29 June of last year declared Parts II and IV of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, unconstitutional.  This had the <Col N="1118" /> effect of removing, from an estimated 30,000 tenants, protection from rent increases and from eviction.  In essence the Supreme Court held that these parts were an unjust attack on the property rights of landlords in that they were contrary to Article 40.3 of the Constitution. That article requires the State in its laws &ldquo;to protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Immediately following this judgment the previous Government introduced the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1981.  That Act made rent increases unenforceable and provided tenants and their families with protection against eviction for a period of six months in order to allow time for an examination of the Supreme Court's judgment.  The legislation was extended for a further three months by the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) (Continuance) Act, 1981, and is due to expire on 25 April next.  I think there is broad agreement on all sides that new legislation is called for and that it must be enacted before the temporary legislation runs out.  Only by doing this can we avoid a major social upheaval affecting thousands of persons, many of whom are amongst the poorest and most vulnerable in our community.</P>
    <P>In December last year the previous Government introduced and had passed by the Oireachtas the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981, which sought to provide permanent controls for this area.  Many constitutional questions were raised by that Bill and indeed Deputies on both sides of the House expressed the opinion that it should be tested in the Supreme Court as soon as possible.  In the event, the President did refer the Bill to the Supreme Court in accordance with Article 26 of the Constitution. On 19 February last judgment was given that section 9 of the Bill was unconstitutional. That section included provision allowing for the phasing-in of rent increases over a five-year period.  The provision was considered an unjust attack on the property rights of a landlord as it deprived him of part of his just and <Col N="1119" /> proper rent for the periods specified in the Bill.  The Supreme Court could find no justification for so depriving landlords of their rent and accordingly found the provision to be in contravention of Article 40.3 of the Constitution.  As a result of this decision the Legislature is faced once again with the urgent need to enact law to prevent the dire consequences, recognised by all, that would occur if the legislative vacuum that has been created is not filled.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House follows the broad outline of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981.  Important changes have been made to take account of the most recent Supreme Court judgment and allow for certain amendments put down by me during the passage of the 1981 Bill through the Dáil, including a provision for assistance to tenants for whom payment of increased rent would cause hardship.  There are also a number of drafting and consequential amendments to the 1981 Bill.  The Government have examined carefully the Supreme Court judgments and the legal advice available to them is that the amendments made meet the Supreme Court's objections to the previous Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have an opportunity during Committee Stage to examine the Bill in detail.  For the moment I intend only to set out the most important provisions and the significant changes from the 1981 Bill.  The present tenant of the dwelling and his spouse are given the right to retain possession of a previously controlled dwelling for their lifetimes. This is in line with the earlier Bill.  A member of the present tenant's family who succeeds to possession is given security of tenure for twenty years from the commencement of this Act.  Where such a person becomes the tenant towards the expiration of the twenty years, a right to retain possession for a minimum of five years is given.  This provision is in line with an amendment I put down during the passing of the previous Bill.</P>
    <P>The rent to be paid for the dwelling will be for settlement between the landlord and the tenant and, in default of agreement, the amount the District <Col N="1120" /> Court considers a just and proper rent having regard to criteria set out in section 13 of the Bill.  This formula requires the court to take account of, amongst other things, the nature, character and location of the dwelling, the means of the landlord and the tenant, the date of purchase of the dwelling and the amount paid for it and the length of the tenant's occupancy of the dwelling.  This is an important change from the 1981 Bill.</P>
    <P>The second major change concerns the inclusion in this Bill of a provision enabling the Minister for Social Welfare to make regulations providing a system of rent allowances to tenants who might otherwise suffer hardship as a result of increases in their rents.  The Minister for Social Welfare will announce details of this scheme of rent allowances in due course.</P>
    <P>Apart from the absence of any provision for the phasing-in of rent increases, which falls as a direct consequence of the Supreme Court decision, the remaining provisions of the Bill are substantially the same as before.  The gross rent, where set by the court, will take into account improvements carried out by the tenant and the rent is subject to five-yearly reviews.  The tenant is entitled, on quitting the dwelling, to compensation for improvements he has done.  He may also be entitled to two year's rent of alternative accommodation if the landlord obtains an order for possession to carry out a scheme of development, to house a member of his family or somebody bona fide residing or to reside with him, to house a person in his employment or in the interests of good estate management. The same provisions as previously regarding the right of a landlord to recover possession in certain circumstances are included.  The landlord remains responsible for the tenant's costs where the landlord applies to the court to fix the rent, subject to the court considering this reasonable.  The Minister may make regulations for the registration and standards of all rented dwellings and, in a change from the earlier Bill, rent books can also be required.  As the Deputies will see there are a number of minor changes in the text and the format is <Col N="1121" /> somewhat different but these can best be examined on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>During the passage of the 1981 Bill through the Oireachtas considerable disquiet was expressed in both Houses about the use of the District Court to fix rents. It was felt by many Deputies and Senators that the volume of cases arising out of this Bill would swamp the District Court system, so leading to unacceptable delays.  There was concern that the formality and cost of court proceedings could prove unnerving for persons who may never have been in a court in their lives.  In considering the options open to me to set up a system of arbitration between landlords and tenants I have been very conscious of these difficulties. To ensure that the District Court will be able to cope with the increased volume of work that will be involved the Government have decided to appoint additional district justices to cope with the extra workload.  This should ensure that rent cases are dealt with as speedily as possible without, at the same time, overloading the District Court system generally.  With a view towards making the proceedings less formal and consequently less intimidating, it is intended that the new district justices will, particularly in the Dublin area where the greatest problems are likely to arise, sit in accommodation separate altogether from the existing court buildings.  The Government will ensure that the District Court will have the necessary facilities to deal with the volume of cases coming forward for adjudication.</P>
    <P>The possibility of having rents determined by using rent tribunals instead of the District Court was examined.  In the time available it is simply not possible to set up such a system of arbitration, however one might favour it.  It would take quite some time before rent tribunals could be fully functioning.  This could not realistically be done in time to deal with the volume of cases that will arise immediately this Bill becomes law.  I should also mention that quite apart from any administrative difficulties there are also a number of legal and constitutional problems associated with the setting up of rent tribunals that need to be resolved. Once the problem of the controlled sector <Col N="1122" /> has been dealt with, I intend, as one of my priorities, to have all aspects of the setting up of rent tribunals looked at and examined in a comprehensive and constructive manner.</P>
    <P>Legislating in this area is one of the most difficult tasks to come before this House in recent years.  The matters to be dealt with are complex, highly sensitive and have far-reaching social implications. Both landlords and tenants have rights which must be protected in the legislation and the balance between what are essentially conflicting rights is not easy to determine.  In the final analysis, however, the Government must fall back on its obligation under Article 45 of the Constitution &ldquo;to safeguard with especial care the economic interests of the weaker sections of the community&rdquo; and generally &ldquo;to promote the welfare of the whole people by securing and protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which justice and charity shall inform all the institutions of the national life.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With these objectives before us, I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The nub of this problem is contained in Article 45 of the Constitution which was read by the Minister, &ldquo;to promote the welfare of the whole people by securing and protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which justice and charity shall inform all the institutions of the national life&rdquo;.  It is because of that we are debating this legislation. Last week I agreed to facilitate the passage of this legislation through the House because something must be done before 25 April if many people are not to be exposed to the shattering experience of having their rents increased by enormous amounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ask if this is the right Bill and if it does that.  Will it be effective in protecting tenants' interests?  This House and the Seanad must have two primary concerns when they are debating the legislation. One of these is to protect the tenants.  We are at a disadvantage in that we do not know how many people will be affected by this legislation.  The other concern is that the Bill must take into account the two decisions of the Supreme <Col N="1123" /> Court which seem to say that landlords are entitled to a market rent and to get possession of their premises.  The previous Government tried to draft a measure which would be acceptable to the Supreme Court and, at the same time, go as far as possible to protect the rights of tenants living in rent-controlled premises. That substantial Bill was introduced and there have been two temporary Bills since, one of which is due to expire on 25 April.  We are up against an exact deadline. The Dáil rises tomorrow night and I presume the Seanad will be recalled.</P>

      <P>The Seanad dissolves on 20 April and the temporary legislation goes out of existence on 25 April.  We have a difficult job to do in the next 24 hours.  I know the Minister appreciates the thin path he is walking on and the danger that this legislation may be referred to the Supreme Court.  If that happens what will be the consequences for tenants on 25 April?</P>
      <P>Controlled rents have existed since 1915.  However, the 1967 legislation which controlled rents was found to be unconstitutional.  The difference is that that legislation sought to control rents permanently, whereas the 1915 legislation was introduced as a temporary measure. The Blake-Madigan case finally brought down the 1967 legislation.  It did so on the basis, <i>inter-alia,</i> that permanent control was being affected which arbitrally identified certain properties as being controlled and left others as uncontrolled. For example, property was defined as being controlled or uncontrolled by reference to the date of construction. This would not happen today because it is very obviously of an arbitrary nature and was one of the faults found with the legislation by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While in Government we sought to deal with this legislation which was found to be unconstitutional this year.  That Bill was referred to the President under Article 40 and broadly contained the classification which was formerly listed but only for the purpose of phasing it out. <Col N="1124" /> That is the essential difference between what the Minister is now doing and what we sought to do.  It was agreed that this perpetuation of the classification with consequent interference with the rights of landlords on the open market rent was justified because legislators were faced with the existing state of affairs which was the result of the operation over a prolonged period of time of rent-fixing legislation which also provided security of tenure for certain tenants.  The fact that this legislation had been in existence and approximately 30,000 dwellings had been affected by it could not be ignored. It was a fact we had to face up to and the Oireachtas had to take it into account when we were dealing with it.</P>
    <P>It should be the primary concern of this House and the Seanad that approximately 30,000 dwellings are affected by this legislation.  There are people living in fear at present of what will happen to the rents which they enjoyed, perhaps at too low a rate, for a number of years.  In some cases sympathy must be extended to landlords who owned property and who were very badly off and yet had people reasonably well off living in dwellings with a totally uneconomic rent.  Such rents did not allow the landlord to maintain the dwelling in the condition it deserved nor did he have an economical rent from the dwelling.</P>
    <P>We must look at this legislation, as I have said, from two points of view: what does it do to protect tenants and does it conform with the Supreme Court judgment of 19 January last?  Many tenants affected are old and have been in the dwellings for a long time.  Many are living on social welfare benefits and none of them could readjust their budget at this stage to take on an increase in rent which might be of 1,000 per cent.  For that reason the State has an obligation to ensure that whatever rent increase is imposed on these tenants as a result of the Supreme Court decision, there is some form of subsidisation introduced to help them over this.  Section 23 of the Bill sets out how the Minister proposes to deal with that.  It states:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare <Col N="1125" /> may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make regulations for the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of allowances to the tenants of dwellings to which <i>section 8(1)</i> relates who would otherwise suffer hardship by reason of increases in the rents of their dwellings.</P>
    <P>The correct way to do this is through the Department of Social Welfare even though there has been some suggestion that a separate section of local government should be set up to do it or there should be some other means of identifying such people.  In the end it does not matter whether the Department of Social Welfare, the local authorities, the Department of the Environment, or some other institution pay the subsidy. The important thing is that tenants should know that on 25 April, if they are faced with an increase in rent, as a result of the decontrolling of the rents of the houses in which they now live, that subsidisation will be there for them.</P>
    <P>We decided to include in the Estimates for 1982 a sum of £6 million for that purpose.  That sum was arrived at on the basis that our Bill intended that rent increases should be phased in over a five year period.  This meant that in 1982 tenants would suffer an increase in rent to the tune of 40 per cent for a period of eight months.  The Supreme Court said that phasing in was unconstitutional. Therefore, obviously the rents will be increased on and from 25 April.  The Government have made no provision to increase the sum of £6 million.  The sum they are providing is demonstrably inadequate to give the tenants a sense of security.  It is a very important part of our function here today to give tenants a sense of security, that on 25 April when their rents are decontrolled the Government will tackle seriously the problem of subsidisation.</P>
    <P>As I said, we intended that the only rent increase to be faced by tenants in 1982 for a period of eight months would be 40 per cent.  In other words, if a rent of £5 per week went up to £25 per week as a result of a court decision that that <Col N="1126" /> was a fair rent for that house, 40 per cent of £20, which is about £8, would be the increased rent payable by that tenant in this year.  Under this Bill, if the court finds that the rent is subject to an increase of £20, all of that £20 will be due by the tenant from 26 April.  This must have been pointed out to the Government by the Department of the Environment, the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Welfare.  They must also have pointed out the basis on which the figure of £6 million was arrived at, but the Government have made no effort to include extra money to bridge the gap between the 40 per cent and the 100 per cent with which tenants will now be faced.</P>
    <P>This is a serious defect in this Bill.  It is a serious defect in the Government's attitude towards these unfortunate people who will be exposed to vastly increased rents from 25 April.  The Minister must give the House an assurance that a Supplementary Estimate will be introduced and that money will be provided to tide over these tenants.  They need an assurance that they will not be faced with eviction or extremely high rent increases.</P>
    <P>I suspect the Government are engaged in precisely the same exercise which the previous Government led by Deputy Haughey were engaged in in January 1981, that is, paring down the figures in the Book of Estimates to give a false picture of their budget deficit.  It is quite obvious from the Supreme Court decision that £6 million is not adequate to subsidise the rents after 25 April.</P>
    <P>Anyone who thinks the tenants of these houses are unaware of what is happening should have been looking at the RTE &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme on Monday night.  The tenants in those houses are living in fear of what their position will be after 25 April.  They wonder will they be dispossessed.  Will their rents go up by an extraordinary amount of money?  If their rents go up, will they be subsidised?</P>
    <P>That brings me to the second point of difference between this Bill and the 1981 Bill, that is, how these rents will be fixed. Section 13(1) of this Bill provides:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> Where the terms of a tenancy are fixed by the Court under section 12, the rent of the dwelling shall be the gross rent reduced by an allowance for any improvements, and any such allowance shall be such proportion of the gross rent as is, in the opinion of the Court, attributable to the improvements.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) is the weakest chain in this legislation.  It provides:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of subsection (1), the gross rent shall be the rent which, in the opinion of the Court, would be a just and proper rent having regard to the nature, character and location of the dwelling, the other terms of the tenancy, the means of the landlord and the tenant, the date of purchase of the dwelling by the landlord and the amount paid by him therefor, the length of the tenant's occupancy of the dwelling and the number and ages of the tenant's family residing in the dwelling.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be a very loose method of assessing the rent of a dwelling. It will not be applied uniformly throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The court is asked to define the rent having regard to certain factors, many of which were detailed as being potentially relevant in the Madigan judgment.  The court is not directed how it is to take these factors into account. What happens if there is an impecunious landlord and an impecunious tenant? Who will bear the burden?  To what extent is State subsidisation to be taken into account?  What happens where the nature and the location of the property suggest that it should have a very high rent and the tenant is unable to afford any increase whatsoever, whereas the landlord is a quite wealthy man?  What happens when a wealthy tenant with 17 children is living on the Kerry seaboard in a house owned by a poor landlord, or where a wealthy tenant with two children <Col N="1128" /> is living in a house in Dublin owned by a very badly off landlord?  How are we to get uniformity of rent?</P>
      <P>This section may be unconstitutional. I do not know.  One landlord has said already that he will challenge it.  I believe it is unworkable.  It is a lazy handwashing exercise by the Minister who is passing the problem over to the courts which are ill-equipped to deal with a situation like this.  He has said that outside the physical structure of the courts he will set up extra district courts.  I suppose that would be a help in one way, but it is not the solution to this problem.  When we asked the District Courts in the 1981 Bill to take on this task we defined precisely what they were being asked to do in section 6 (2) which reads:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of subsection (1), the gross rent shall be the rent which, in the opinion of the Court, a willing lessee not already in occupation would give and a willing lessor would take for the dwelling, in each case on the basis of vacant possession being given, and having regard to the other terms of the tenancy and to the letting values of dwellings of a similar character to the dwelling and situate in a comparable area.</P>
      <P>That is not something that came off the top of my head or that of the Attorney General or anybody within the Department. This is the precise legal definition which has been used for decades and with which the courts and lawyers are familiar. Its application would be a relatively simple matter and the courts would certainly understand how it should be applied.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) of section 13 is being substituted for the foregoing and states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the gross rent shall be the rent which, in the opinion of the Court, would be a just and proper rent having regard to the nature, character and location of the dwelling, the other terms of the tenancy, the means of the landlord and the tenant, the date of purchase of the dwelling by the landlord and the amount paid by him therefor, the length of the tenant's occupancy <Col N="1129" /> of the dwelling and the number and ages of the tenant's family residing in the dwelling.</P>
    <P>This is a matter on which a court cannot easily adjudicate and a district justice in County Kerry will not give the same adjudication as his counterpart in Donegal.  Different adjudications may be given in two areas within the one county. Last week when the Minister kindly gave me a copy of this section I told him I could not see the section standing up.  I have no legal training but even from the point of view of a layman it seems that section 13 (2) is questionable.  For that reason we will table an amendment on Committee Stage providing for the establishment of a fair rents tribunal.  This is essential so that there should be a uniform application of this section throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is unsatisfactory and there is a danger that it may be referred to the Supreme Court.  For that reason I urge the Minister to bring before the House tomorrow a temporary measure to protect tenants in the event of that happening before 25 April.  With all its faults, I should prefer to see this passed rather than see tenants go through a further period of fear and uncertainty.  I know that many lawyers will tell the Minister that a third temporary provisions Bill would not be acceptable and the same advice is being given to me.  However, I suggest that it would be far more acceptable to have a third temporary Bill than to have a situation where tenants are unprotected after 25 April.  I appeal to the Minister, no matter what the lawyers say, to substitute another date and I give my personal guarantee that the measure will be passed immediately.  The Minister must ensure the protection of tenants after 25 April in case anything happens.</P>
    <P>We will be introducing an amendment proposing the setting up of a fair rents tribunal.  We have doubts about the section to which I have referred.  We will, however, facilitate the Minister in getting the Bill through this House tomorrow evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is atrocious legislation <Col N="1130" /> and yet again the House is being forced into the atrocious position of trying to defend the indefensible and pretending that we are doing it with clean hands.  I admire the way in which the Minister has tried, with the political skill which he and his party undoubtedly have, to slide over the problem but the function of Opposition Deputies is very clearly to stake out where substance deviates from fact.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, according to the Minister, is to avoid the undoubted social chaos that would occur after 25 April if this Bill were not enacted.  That social chaos has already started.  The terrorisation of tenants by landlords has already begun and Deputies such as Deputy Fitzpatrick of Fianna Fáil who represents a constituency similar to mine can testify to this.  This Bill will not be a substantial comfort to many of the tenants anxiously awaiting the outcome of our deliberations.</P>
      <P>It is useful to ask why we are now debating the fourth Bill dealing with this matter.  It is because the Supreme Court decided on 19 February that the previous legislation in the absence of any constitutionally permitted justification clearly constituted an unjust attack upon property rights.  Speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, I believe that members of the Supreme Court have disgraced themselves in so partially interpreting the Constitution because, as the Minister stated, all the Articles of the Constitution place certain obligations upon the State and upon individuals.  At the end of his speech the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>In the final analysis, however, the Government must fall back on their obligation under Article 45 of the Constitution &ldquo;to safeguard with a special care the economic interests of the weaker sections of the community&rdquo; and generally &ldquo;to promote the welfare of the whole people by securing and protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which justice and charity shall inform all the institutions of the national life&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this conservative Government can effectively quote in their conclusion that <Col N="1131" /> Article of the Constitution, how can five members of a Supreme Court with their accumulated wisdom say:</P>
    <P>In the absence of any constitutionally permitted justification this clearly constitutes an unjust attack upon their property rights.</P>
    <P>We could be coming back to the House day after day with different Bills trying to get around the Constitution.  As long as we have Supreme Court judges so biased in their defence of property rights and in defence of people who own property we will always end up with this kind of situation.</P>
    <P>The nub of the problem is not the legislative inventiveness of the civil servants, the Opposition or the members of the Government.  The nub of the problem is not even our Constitution but the bias in the property interpretations of members of the Supreme Court.  On whose behalf and in whose interests are the Supreme Court interpreting the Constitution? How can they say &ldquo;In the absence of any constitutionally permitted justification this clearly constitutes an unjust attack upon their property rights&rdquo; when our Constitution, riddled with all sorts of reservations quite clearly in Article 45 states that the Government have obligations to the weaker sections of the Community?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am challenging some of these traditions.  There are at least 4,000 people in my constituency who will be directly affected by the decision of the Supreme Court, who do not have the <Col N="1132" /> secure incomes and pensions that judges have.  If the House focuses attention for some time on that particular problem all of the secondary problems generated by this Bill will cease to have the scale of importance we are attaching to them.</P>
      <P>Section 13 of the Bill is quite likely to be thrown out by the same group of conservative class-biased judges who threw out section 9 of the previous Bill.  There is no reason to believe that there has been some extraordinary transformation in regard to social concern in the Four Courts that will bring about a realisation that Article 45 of the Constitution actually refers to the constituents I am trying to represent in the House.  There are 4,000 of those people in my constituency, as far as I have been able to estimate, out of 30,000 in the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>Deputy Peter Barry is correct in saying that this Bill is substantially the same as the previous one with the exception of sections 13 and 23.  When one looks in detail at section 13 one sees that the Fianna Fáil Government have effectively abdicated any responsibility in trying to establish what might constitute a reasonable or just rent and have dumped it all on the shoulders of the over-worked and unskilled justices who have no particular expertise in this field.  Section 13 (2) reads very nicely on the surface.  It states:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of subsection (1), the gross rent shall be the rent which, in the opinion of the Court, would be a just and proper rent having regard to the nature, character and location of the dwelling, the other terms of the tenancy, the means of the landlord and the tenant, the date of purchase of the dwelling by the landlord and the amount paid by him therefor, the length of the tenant's occupancy of the dwelling and the number and ages of the tenant's family residing in the dwelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his Minister of State must surely recognise that such an interpretation by a district justice within the framework of the conservative interpretation of the Constitution that we now have direct experience of would be <Col N="1133" /> deemed to be an arbitrary and unequal interpretation of property rights and must be construed by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional.  We are right back again to where we are now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, without a safety net. That is the reason why I strongly support Deputy's Barry's suggestion that the Minister should come in tomorrow morning with two Bills, this one and the safety net of a further temporary suspension of an effective decision.  This would give us another three or four months.  That is good advice and I am not too fussy if it offends lawyers' sensibility or if it means the Supreme Court judges sitting through the summer.  I am not challenging the right of the Supreme Court to make those decisions; I am merely criticising it.  If the Supreme Court was more representative of all the class interests in our society we would not get the type of decision we have in front of us.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to try to avoid the social chaos which will undoubtedly occur if something effective and constructive is not done by this House and the Seanad.  The Bill is attempting to say that if it is enacted it will avoid social chaos.  The Labour Party's criticism of it is that it will not do that for two reasons.  The mechanism of the District Court is totally inappropriate and overburdened to enable it to function assuming section 13 is interpreted in the manner the Minister suggested it would be. It simply will not work and the Minister knows that because in his speech today he talked about increasing the provisions for district justices.  There is no mention of this in the Bill so it simply goes on the record as good intentions from the Minister. It is not worth anything to any of the tenants who are involved in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that he would increase the number of district justices and that there would be new premises for them in which the courts would operate. How many district justices, permanent or temporary, do the Government propose to appoint?  When do they propose to appoint them?  Where will the new courts <Col N="1134" /> sit?  What are the arrangements for increased staff?  What locations have already been selected?  We are talking about three weeks from now when all of these things can take effect.  What provisions have the Government made in last week's budget to pay for them?  The answer is that the Government have none.  This is an attempt to say in the classic words of the Minister for Agriculture: &ldquo;No problem, boys, we will see you are all right on the day&rdquo;.  There is a problem and the Government have no solution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry quite rightly pointed out that the Estimate for the Department of the Environment, given that section 9 of the 1981 Bill allowed for only 40 per cent of the gross rent to be paid, was approximately £6 million for 1982.  That has not been changed by the change of Government because the take-off date was 25 April.  That is for a nine-month period, not a full 12-month period.  The Minister of State is aware that on his desk is a revised Estimate which states that in the event of section 9 of the 1981 Bill being struck out by the Supreme Court and full market rent being granted by the District Court, the Estimate is for £13.85 million, but there is no provision in the Estimates for it.</P>
    <P>If I or Deputy Fitzpatrick meet constituents in our clinics we cannot honestly tell them there is money available to prevent people being put out on the street, because that money has not been made available.  Less than half the money estimated as the sum required to prevent social hardship, calamity and chaos, which we all wish to prevent, has been made available in this budget.  As Deputy Barry Desmond said on the budget last week, it is a dishonest document to that extent as it does not tell the whole truth in regard to the actual cost the State will incur in the coming year.</P>
    <P>At the risk of some repetition I want to give the House the profile of the kind of person I believe is directly affected by this legislation.  These tenants are in the main, at least 60 to 70 per cent of them, elderly people, widows or couples but frequently single, elderly people living on pensions or fixed incomes in dwellings <Col N="1135" /> they have occupied for many years, who are now aged 60 or over and who have no economic possibility of increasing their incomes.  They are people who have paid their way all their lives and never owed a penny.  They have lived in constant fear and uncertainty, if not terror, since last June when the Supreme Court made its first decision in the Madigan case.  Many of them have never been in a court and have no desire to be there. They would reject as the final insult of their lives the suggestion that they avail of the supplementary welfare allowance in order to pay their rent as an alternative to being made homeless.</P>
    <P>If the Bill goes through in its present form my estimate is that at least 3,000 people in my constituency will be faced with being taken to court by their landlord and hearing the district justice say: &ldquo;In the absence of any alternative other than the law in front of me I have to fix the gross rent at a sum which manifestly is above what you can pay.  I am sorry for your trouble.  I suggest you see your local welfare officer.  Here is the address of the nearest Eastern Health Board office and perhaps they will be able to help you&rdquo;.  For the first time ever these people will now in their own eyes and in their world be forced to take charity in order to live on in their own homes, in a house they have looked after for many years when they could not find the landlord to do the essential repairs, in a house for which they have paid rates when the landlord could not be contacted. Amid neighbours and friends they suddenly find themselves, in the final years of their lives, brought to this situation. If this House gives effect to this legislation, that is what it is now deciding it wants to do.  On whose behalf?  For whom are we doing this?  Are the Fianna Fáil Party totally committed to bringing in this legislation?  Do they want to do this on behalf of a group of landlords?  If so, how many of them are there?  Why are we forced to do this?  Why is the House again deliberating this kind of legislation? I think it is outrageous.  I have heard no justification from the Minister for it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> The Labour Party opposed this legislation in principle because it is as naked an attack on the weaker classes in our society as has ever manifested itself here. It is doubly outrageous that it was supported by a biased interpretation of the Constitution by members of the Supreme Court who have clearly come down on the side of property as against people.  In the Seanad before Christmas, when I spoke on the 1981 legislation before the February 18 decision of the Supreme Court on this point, I said:</P>
    <P>There has been a view stated that even the miserable attempt to delay giving the full market value for a period of five years as set out in section 9 will itself be taken to the courts, argued with great skill for expensive thieves by all of the professional classes &mdash; my own included; I make no distinction. At the end of the day the Supreme Court will take the holy document of our Constitution and say that notwithstanding that clause which talks about the exigencies of the common good and all the lovely, flowery Articles that talk about the rights of people, notwithstanding that remarkable Preamble that proclaims us to be a Christian nation, when the chips are down, we have no choice because &ldquo;private property rights rule OK&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is exactly what is happening.  We have no reason to believe, seeing how section 13 has been framed, that there will be any change by the Supreme Court if this document is referred to them, as in all likelihood it will be, by the same landlords with property interests who precipitated this crisis in the first place.</P>
    <P>Surely we should be in this House, as we were not more than two hours ago, talking about amending the Constitution or perhaps replacing the members of the Supreme Court in such a way as to make this kind of legislation unnecessary.</P>

      <P>Two hours ago the Taoiseach was explaining why there would be only one referendum and why it was not possible to amend the Constitution in any other regard, particularly in regard to private property rights, so that there would be a proper balance between the rights of people and property.  For everybody's sake there must be such a proper balance. Unless we have that we shall be in the same situation very soon again.  We must take cognisance of that fact: otherwise, the House is being dishonest and misleading the people into thinking that this can somehow resolve their problems. Having made what I think is a core argument about the context in which this legislation has again been introduced, I say on behalf of the Labour Party that, warts and all, we shall be attempting to make it better.  We have submitted a series of amendments which will be circulated in due course.  It is not clear when the Committee Stage will be taken&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Then perhaps the Minister will have the night in which to reflect on the merits of the amendments we are putting forward.  The same applies to all Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, we say that the District Courts alone should not have this responsibility. We recognise that the setting up of a fair rents tribunal is a complex and comprehensive procedure and cannot be done overnight.  Surely the Minister will accept in the context of the comments I have <Col N="1138" /> made that in the initial stages provision should be made under this Bill to enable the Minister for the Environment at a future date to establish a fair rents tribunal and to have it referred to in this legislation, so that we begin with the courts and the provisions of the Bill can, in time, be transferred to the fair rents tribunal by ministerial order.  I think that is a reasonable proposal and that it meets the spirit of the views expressed with such passionate vigour by Deputy Burke in this House just before Christmas when he was Opposition spokesman for the Environment.  I do not expect there has been a great transformation in his commitment over the last few months. Therefore I will welcome his acceptance of this amendment tomorrow morning.</P>
    <P>I am mentioning these amendments so that Members will have time to reflect on them because the normal process does not occur.  Another point I want to raise is the way a district justice will have to try to do the impossible, that is establish a fair rent.  The district justice is being asked to have regard in the establishment of the gross rent to eight different categories of conditions, such as, the nature, character and location of the dwelling, the other terms of tenancy, the means of the landlord and the tenant, the date of purchase of the dwelling by the landlord and the amount paid by him therefor, the length of the tenant's occupancy of the dwelling and the number and ages of the tenant's family residing in the dwelling. We propose to submit an addendum so that the district justice, when establishing a fair rent, will also take into account the prospects of suitable available accommodation being provided by the local authority in that area.  We are doing that because it would be an admissible defence for someone to argue in a court that if the district justice sets a rent, having regard to all the factors listed under section 13 (2) and does not take into account the housing supply in that area, and if that person is unable to pay the rent, he will effectively be made homeless.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of this legislation the district justice should be able to hear a statement from the legal defence of the <Col N="1139" /> tenant, or a public representative acting on behalf of the tenant, that the housing authority do not have the capacity to house that person.  I know from experience that in cases where the controlled dwellings legislation does not apply, landlords have said in court that it is the responsibility of the State or the local authority to house people and if the person in question cannot pay the rent he should present himself to Dublin Corporation.  It is right and proper that the justice should inform himself of the shortage of such accommodation and take it into account when determining the rent.  A number of minor amendments arise but I will argue them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about the substantial difference between this Bill and the 1981 legislation, although the intent of the latter was substantially the same.  I want to refer to section 23.  In my view, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Environment have succeeded in winning a private battle behind closed doors with the Department of Social Welfare over the question of who gets to carry the can in administering this inadequate sum of £6 million.  This battle has been fought with great vigour over a very long time.  I can understand why the relevant Departments were very anxious to dump this on any Department other than their own.  They know in their hearts that £6 million is not enough and that the administration of the scheme will be extremely difficult.  They also know that homelessness is an emotive question and will produce a lot of constituency pressure. It would be far easier for the Minister for the Environment or his Minister of State, notwithstanding the reality of collective responsibility, to be able to say that that is a problem for the Minister for Social Welfare and that while he would like to be able to help, in the circumstances he is unable to do so.  I can anticipate the situation where the Chair will have to rule certain questions to be disallowed or to be the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare because even though these are housing matters and the Department of the Environment have <Col N="1140" /> responsibility for housing, where a person is about to be made homeless it is a matter for the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>This is the stuff great novels and television serials of a political nature are made of, but Deputies must remember that the pawns in this game are innocent people who are going to be made homeless. I know from studying the situation that the most obvious way these tenants should be subsidised is through the Department of the Environment, but there are two arguments against that.  The Department do not like taking on extra responsibility and resisted the landlord and tenant legislation over many years. That resistance is still there.  The Department of Finance, who played a silent role, are even more anxious to control this scheme through the supplementary welfare allowance system because their economists have put on the table of the relevant Ministers of the day that this subsidy scheme, and the implications of this legislation, are a bottomless pit in terms of the money that could be required to be paid out by way of subsidy to prevent tenants from being made homeless.  We all know that is the truth. Why not accept and recognise it?</P>
    <P>At best, we have a crude estimate that the number of people involved is 30,000. Let us take one of the 4,000 involved in my constituency, say, somebody from Pembroke Road or Rathmines, an area where there is a high demand for flats, who is currently paying something like £20 a week or even £5 a week, which would be high for some controlled rents. The rent fixed by the District Court, even making allowances for certain improvements and alterations that have been made, could be an extra £30, bringing it up to £35.  This legislation suggests that a private individual presents himself each week to the social welfare officer to get the supplementary welfare allowance to pay the balance.  In some cases that supplementary welfare allowance will be larger than the old age pension or widow's pension that person is receiving. The sums involved will constitute a major security problem for social welfare officers <Col N="1141" /> and the administration of the scheme will be very difficult.</P>
    <P>The whole area surrounding section 23 is a veritable can of worms which the Department of the Environment, for the time being, have successfully foisted on the Department of Social Welfare.  The net social consequences of this are potentially disastrous.  The Department of Social Welfare, operating through the health boards, do not have the necessary expertise in the area of housing to deal with this problem.  They have said this in public and in private.  Yet we are being asked to put into law something which the people involved in implementing this scheme have repeatedly claimed they are unable to do effectively.  That is the makings of very bad law.  This time round, having regard to the change of Government, no one can claim to be uninformed in advance.  None of us can come back in six month's time and say we did not anticipate this would happen when the legislation was going through.  That is not the case; we do know.  We know the Department of Social Welfare cannot operate under section 23 satisfactorily, and they are bitterly opposed to this scheme being foisted on them.  I suggest that if that is not the case the Minister should deny it but in the absence of any such denial I will take it to be the case.  Having regard to that, will the Minister be able seriously on Committee Stage to stand over section 23?  I ask the question because at this stage the private tenants associations and the individuals who will be affected directly by this legislation are not concerned with the private property arguments of our Constitution.  They are simply concerned as to how they will survive after April 25.  Their problem is the question of how they are to pay the increases in rents that are being demanded of them. They are anxious to know what this Government and the previous Government mean by the assurance that undue hardship will be avoided by means of the moneys made available in the budget. That is the concern and the fear of these people but neither in the Bill nor in the Minister's speech is there any suggestion that those fears can be allayed.</P>
    <P>It is a sad day for this country that we <Col N="1142" /> are here attempting to manoeuvre our way around the effects of a Constitution which a minority of the people of this State took upon themselves in 1937 and that as an independent State we are finding ourselves more constricted by our laws in relation to property and class than was the case under the laws of a foreign power, mother England.  It is an extraordinary indictment of the Republican traditions in this House that the provisions of the de Valera Constitution are creating a new generation of gombeen landlords who will have greater security of legal power to exploit the weaker sections of the community than was the case in respect of those laws which England foisted on us.  It is extraordinary that with our own economic and political independence this is the kind of millstone we have strung around our collective necks.</P>
    <P>The House should ask itself some questions. In whose interest are we acting today?  Where are the thousands of landlords, where are the quotas of landlords' votes that are involved in imposing this kind of legislation?  Where are the myriads of property-owning people who have interest in the Supreme Court sufficient to bring about such a distorted interpretation of our Constitution and where are they now that they can force the republican party to bring in this legislation?</P>

      <P>I am prepared to take my chances anyway.  The judgement of the Supreme Court set out that in the absence of any constitutionally-committed justification, the 1981 Bill clearly constitutes an unjust attack on property rights.  The Minister for the Environment quotes Article 45 of the Constitution and says that the Government must fall back on their obligations under that article to safeguard with special care the economic interests of the weaker sections of the community and generally to promote the welfare of the whole people by securing and protecting as effectively as possible a social order in which justice and charity shall inform all the institutions of the national life.  It may be that because I am not a lawyer my criticisms are more stark and naive than might otherwise be the case, but I venture to suggest that the Supreme Court did not get as far as Article 45 before making their decision but stopped at Article 40&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> I am sure Deputy Quinn appreciates the importance of our having some legislation on this matter through before 25 April.  Only a few months ago I was speaking from the Oposition benches on the Bill brought in by the then Government. We were all hopeful then that that <Col N="1144" /> Bill would be constitutional but as we know now certain sections of it have been found by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us now is an improvement on that other Act and those sections which were found to be repugnant to the Constitution are not included.  We hope, therefore, that on this occasion the Bill will be found to be in accordance with the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court decision has resulted in much hardship and distress to that section of the community affected by such legislation.  We know that the legislation will affect the most vulnerable section of the community.  It is all right for Deputy Quinn to criticise the Bill but I am sure that if he could suggest amendments that would improve the Bill and still allow it to stand up in the Supreme Court, the Minister would consider favourably any such amendments.  However, we are bound by the decision of the Supreme Court and they in turn must have regard to the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Criticism might be levelled at some landlords in this town and perhaps in other places who have moved hastily in regard to notifying the tenants of increased rents.  I am aware personally of letters from various landlords to tenants indicating that increased rents would be required of them and asking these tenants to submit details of their annual income and of their entire family circumstances. I know of a few instances in which increased rent has been demanded.  This was a high-handed approach on the part of some landlords.  They moved before the holding Act expired and before the enactment of this Bill.  Those landlords should know that they have not the right to act in that way.  It is obvious that they have terrorised tenants and caused undue hardship to them.  The tenants we are talking about are people who are not in a position to defend themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will go a long way towards meeting the requirements.  Undoubtedly the landlords will, as they have said already, challenge certain sections of it.  I listened to people the other night stating <Col N="1145" /> that their intention was to do so.  Whatever happens, we are dealing here with a section of the community who certainly will not be in a position to pay market rents for many of the houses they occupy today.  The history and background of these people can go back 50, 60 or 100 years and in many cases the fathers and grandfathers of the present occupants of the houses lived in those houses.  Therefore, these people differ substantially from those who occupy uncontrolled rent dwellings.  The average person moving into an uncontrolled flat has the intention of moving from it as quickly as possible. It serves as a temporary measure, but especially if such people are young married couples their intention is to move out at the earliest possible moment and put a deposit on their own home.</P>
    <P>The people in rent-controlled dwellings look on these houses as their homes. Their grandfathers and fathers were there before them and so, naturally, they have settled into a community and have become part of that community.  Now they find that because of a Supreme Court decision all their security is dismantled. They could become homeless or a landlord could demand rent which would be entirely beyond their means to pay.  That is what we are trying to regulate in this Bill.  It is very difficult to get a perfect answer to this complicated problem. I am not sure of the exact number involved, but I am told that it is between 35,000 and 45,000 dwellings, which is a substantial number.  The majority of these houses are in urban districts and probably in the larger cities.  Quite a substantial number are in Dublin and many more are in other cities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I suppose the two most important sections in the Bill are those dealing with fair rent and security of tenure, and one is as important as the other.  We want to make sure that those who occupy such dwellings together with their spouses are guaranteed the right of tenure during their lifetime.  This is as it should be.  The section also makes provision as regards sons and daughters, and anyone reading the definition of what constitutes a family will realise that it is fairly broad and <Col N="1146" /> embraces all degrees of relationship. However, in certain cases people who may not be related, strictly speaking, to the tenant have lived in a house for perhaps 15 or 20 years and the section does not go far enough to embrace that category of person.  It confines itself strictly to relations.  That may cause problems for people who have lived with certain families through the years, perhaps all their lives, and maybe in the evening of their lives at 50 or 60 years of age they find that they have no guarantee of tenure under this Bill as it is at the moment and are unable to pay the rent.</P>
    <P>When the former Bill was going through the House I hinted that I was not too satisfied that the District Court would handle the number of applications and decide what were fair rents, taking all the clauses of this provision into consideration. It will cause problems, particularly in the District Court in Dublin.  I am glad to hear the Minister's indication of a fair rents tribunal.  Undoubteldy we will have overcrowding in the courts and an avalanche of applications from various landlords who will be seeking to have their rents adjusted at an early date.  A considerable number of personnel will be necessary in the courts to do research, work out what constitutes a fair rent and assess the background of all the applicants. It will be important also to ensure that the tenant is equipped with proper personnel and backup services.  Many the tenants of my acquaintance certainly could not handle their applications without some professional advice.  Many of them have never been in court previously. I am glad that the Minister intends to remove this out of the element of the courts to some environment which will not cause such harassment to some of these people.  However, they will still require professional advice.</P>
    <P>Many landlords have very sophisticated operations.  Some in this city, such as Folio Homes Ltd., Associated Properties Ltd. and so on have no problem in presenting their case well documented to the courts and proving why their rents should be increased.  The same type of services should be available to the tenant. Many tenants are completely ill-equipped <Col N="1147" /> to make their application in a positive way, to state what their input was into the home during the years, what repairs they carried out and so on.  This will require expert advice from an engineer, architect or costing expert who can present the account to enable such tenants to put forward an argument why the rent should not be increased to a named figure.  Whether we like it or not, the district justices will adjudicate these cases and they will have to look at the facts put before them by both the landlords and the tenants if they are to arrive at a fair judgment.</P>
    <P>A section of the Bill puts liability for costs on the landlord if a landlord brings a tenant to court, but in the majority of cases probably it will be the reverse and the tenant will be taking the landlord to court seeking a reduction in a rent which he considers excessive.  I do not see any provision whereby the landlord will then be obliged to pay the costs.  Therefore I hope to see some provision whereby this can be operated through free legal aid.  I am not sure whether the tenants can apply for free legal aid or whether they can get advice from the Free Legal Aid Committee as to their rights, how they should process their applications and matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>Many of these houses, especially in the inner city, were bought many years ago at a very reasonable price by many of these landlords.  We all know of the Artisan Dwellings Companies which provided housing in this city at a reasonable cost.  It must be said that they fulfilled their obligations admirably over the years.  Now this company ceases to exist, at least many of their properties are no longer held by Associated Properties.  I would hazard a guess that something in the region of 1,500 houses were affected and taken over by Folio Properties within the past 18 months.</P>
    <P>When deciding what is a fair rent I would hope that any judge would have regard to the length of time the property has been in the hands of the landlord. That fact will play a major part in determining what rent should be charged on houses such as these, because it must be <Col N="1148" /> remembered that Folio Properties have come into possession of these houses within the recent past.  Therefore I would hope there would be a reasonable adjustment of the rent, basing any decision on the fact that these houses were purchased at a very reasonable price by that company. In that regard a reasonable adjustment should suffice in giving a reasonable return to landlords on what they paid for those houses.  There are many such cases on which a court will have to adjudicate.</P>
    <P>Of course there are also other cases which will be even more complicated, cases where tenants or their families may have been in occupation of the houses for 50, 60 or 100 years.  These are the complications I foresee arising in the District Courts.  That is why we will need qualified personnel to ensure that the tenant gets a fair deal.  It is the tenants about whom we are concerned here.  We are aware from personal experience that many tenants can ill-afford the adjustments that would have to be made when establishing a market rent.  We are aware also that the value of property has far exceeded the rate of inflation and the consumer price index in the past ten years.  There have been many contributory factors, such as short supply coupled with ample demand, but one could not take the market price of a house today because that does not relate in real value.</P>
    <P>These are the types of criteria the District Courts will have to use when deciding what is a fair rent.  I would hope that these courts would take into account the length of tenancy and the means and ability of the tenant to pay rather than applying the market value or rent.  Many tenants of whom I am aware could not possibly afford to pay market rents at today's going rate.  There is no doubt that the State has an obligation in this respect under the Constitution to look after the weaker sections of our community. It will indeed be a complicated calculation to establish the proper subsidisation of such people so that they may be helped in this respect.</P>
    <P>I note that there is in the budget provision for £6 million for this purpose.  It is extremely difficult to ascertain how much such an exercise will cost at present, <Col N="1149" /> because all tenants' cases will be judged individually, and laying down a blanket figure for subsidisation at this point would be impossible.  We shall have to await the decision of the district justices, taking this section into consideration, on what is or constitutes a proper rent having due regard to the nature, character and location of the dwelling and other provisions, the tenancy, means of the landlord, the date of purchase of the dwelling by the landlord and the amount paid by him.  As Deputy Quinn said, subsidisation will be substantial in some cases if account is taken of the value of the property, the area in which it is situated and so on.  This will be a complicated exercise, but to run away from it would be futile.  We must legislate for the situation.</P>
    <P>I believe that we in this House have no choice but to ensure that some Bill is implemented before 23 April.  I sincerely hope this Bill stands up constitutionally. However, like other speakers, I feel it would be advisable to make some provision in the event of it not doing so.  We know what would be the situation if no legislation existed at that time.  It is obvious that landlords could move ahead, uncontrolled by any legislation whatsoever, and take possession of their dwellings, something that must be stopped at all costs.  Certainly I should like to see some holding operation to ensure that some legislation obtains in the event of this Bill being deemed unconstitutional or being challenged by the Supreme Court.  What the President may do at this time is a matter for him. Bearing in mind that the House will be in recess for Easter, it would be advisable that some such measure be on hand to ensure a holding operation in the event of this Bill being deemed unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>There is an organisation in this city called the Private Tenants' Action Group, with headquarters in Gardiner Street, who have carried out research into the type of tenant likely to be affected and what they feel would constitute requirements to meet the difficult problems many of their members will encounter or are encountering at present. <Col N="1150" /> Probably they have lobbied many Deputies on their views and the problems their members face.  I have received documentation from them over the past 12 months.  Naturally they are concerned, because they have carried out a fairly intensive survey of the tenancies of many of their members, their incomes, age, background, work and so on.  The picture they draw is not very promising as regards their members' ability to pay any substantial increase in rents.  The majority of their members are old people who have lived in the area for a long time, quite a number of whom are pensioners, in the lower income category.  They have made certain submissions to me, some of which are included in the Bill, some of which are not, and which I might read out for the benefit of the House.  They specify five or six provisions which might meet their requirements.</P>
    <P>The letter is from Mr. Murphy, secretary of the Private Tenants Action Group, St. Francis Xavier Church, Gardiner Street, Dublin.  The first request of the group is that a fair rents tribunal be established consisting of a judge and six other members.  When the original Bill was going through the House I made that suggestion.  Today the Minister said he was sympathetic towards the establishment of such a tribunal and I am aware that he is committed to looking into the question of establishing such a tribunal. There are complications involved but I have no doubt that the Minister will deal with this matter speedily.  The secretary of the action group points out that they are anxious that the landlords' and tenants' economic circumstances and the character and situation of the house or dwelling be taken into consideration when rent is being settled by the court.  That is covered in the Bill.  The group also propose that in cases of hardship created by increases in rent State assistance be provided and not only for old age pensioners.  I take it that the group are anxious to cater for those on a low income.</P>
    <P>Another proposal of the group was that the term &ldquo;member of family of a tenant&rdquo; be extended to include any other person who has resided with a tenant for a period of five years for the specific purpose of <Col N="1151" /> providing domiciliary care and attention. As I mentioned earlier, that is not contained in the Bill.  The group also propose that a member of the family of a tenant who dies be entitled to continue the tenancy for a period of 20 years beginning on the commencement of the Act or five years from the death of the tenant or spouse, whichever period is the longest. They also suggest that the terms of the tenancy shall not be enforceable by a landlord until he has issued the tenant with a rent book, in cases where this has not already been done, and for the purpose of recording each payment of rent rent books shall remain in the tenants' possession.</P>
    <P>That group submitted those requests to me and I am sure other members received a copy.  A majority of the suggestions are contained in the Bill.  My view is that the ruling of the court on rents will be important.  A survey was carried out in Dublin and other centres of the age and circumstances of tenants involved.  It was found that 50 per cent of the tenants involved are more than 66 years of age, that 27 per cent are between 51 and 60 and 10 per cent under 50.  The majority of the tenants are not in a position to meet any additional costs.  Many of the tenants are widows who live alone.</P>
    <P>Down through the years in this city we did not develop the full concept of rented accommodation.  We have concentrated on getting people to buy a house.  We will have to concentrate on providing more rented accommodation.  Of course, what will follow from that will be a prices spiral, because demand will be greater than the amount of accommodation available. I accept that the National Coalition endeavoured to encourage the provision of such accommodation in cities and large centres of population.  In Dublin, particularly when the university year commences, there is a great problem about rented accommodation and that has encouraged landlords to increase their rents substantially for students.  That problem has been neglected by all sides and we have failed to cater for such expansion.  As a result those who have had the benefit of controlled rents up to <Col N="1152" /> now will have to pay the full market price. I am sure many of those people, if they had not been living in controlled rented accommodation, would have moved out and bought their own homes.  Many of the pensioners would have moved out and sought accommodation from local authorities.  The fact that they were living in controlled rented accommodation encouraged them to stay on and it is unfortunate that in the evening of their lives they must face this problem.</P>
    <P>A fair rents tribunal consisting of professional personnel is needed in the long term, because we will have this problem for many years.  More than 35,000 houses are involved and, undoubtedly, many disputes will arise between landlords and tenants.  The tribunal would be the best body to resolve the many difficult arguments that will arise between landlord and tenant.  It will be difficult for those who have been living in dwellings for many years to establish exactly their input in the house.  I have no doubt that but for such input many of those dwellings would be derelict.  In the centre of this city some landlords have allowed such buildings to go into decay, but many of the dwellings that are in good condition have been maintained at considerable expense by the tenants who looked upon them as their homes.  Many of those tenants would like to be given the opportunity to purchase such dwellings and I hope that a scheme will be devised to help them to do so at a reasonable price. They should be given an opportunity to purchase, just as are tenants of local authority houses.  It would not be difficult to devise such a scheme.  Other Bills will be necessary to regulate this matter and I hope the Department of the Environment in the meantime will introduce a scheme to encourage landlords to sell such property to the tenants, taking into consideration the length of the tenancy and the amount of work carried out by the tenants down the years.</P>
    <P>I hope the substance of the Bill will stand up in court.  If it does not, we will be back to square one.  This will create greater hardship for the tenants, many of whom do not know exactly where they stand at present.  They are certainly worried <Col N="1153" /> by rumours which in my opinion, have been circulated prematurely by some landlords.  Many landlords have notified their tenants of their intention to raise rents.  I know of a few cases where a claim was actually put in for a raised rent which in the case of one old lady was astronomical&mdash;more than her income for the week.  How could she possibly try to meet that demand?</P>
    <P>I trust that the Minister will tell some of these landlords that they have no right to increase their rents until such time as a proper Bill goes through this House and makes provision for this.  That is of vital importance.  I have seen letters to this effect received from Associated Properties, which is a reputable company, a company which should know exactly the implications of this Bill.  We are all concerned and wish to be fair to both sides.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn criticises the Bill as having no substance.  If he could bring into this House within the present Constitution a Bill which would be better than the present one, I am sure it would be very welcome.  If we are going to move in the direction which Deputy Quinn advocates, we must consider some type of referendum to try to change the Articles of the Constitution.  That is another day's work.  We are trying here to be fair and bring in the best possible Bill under the present circumstances to make sure that the tenants are fairly protected.  Without some such legislation I do not have to spell out the consequences of the actions, not by all landlords but by some&mdash;the advantage which would be taken of the weaker section of the community which cannot protect itself and which the courts cannot protect either without some such legislation as this.  I am quite convinced that, if the section dealing with the rents is considered and interpreted fairly, it will go some way towards regulating and keeping rents within a reasonable limit, taken in conjuction with the tenancies.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the fair rents tribunal, some holding operation in the event of this Bill not being successful and the protection of the tenant when the legislation is eventually processed in the courts.  Wherever we find the money, we cannot allow old age pensioners, people <Col N="1154" /> of little means, to be thrown out on the streets.  I do not believe that anyone in this House would allow that to happen. I know that £6 million has been already earmarked.  That may be a start.  I do not think anybody in this House could now be positive about the total cost involved. Everyone in this House will agree that every measure should be taken to ensure that those who can ill-afford these exorbitant rents will be protected by this House, whether it is by way of the health boards, social welfare or the Department of the Environment.  I am not sure how this scheme will operate.</P>
    <P>We have a problem on our hands which must be resolved to the satisfaction of all. I certainly am coming down on the side of the tenant &mdash; to try to protect him or her.  Many landlords are well equipped to carry disadvantages which may accrue to them by virtue of the interpretation of a reasonable rent to the tenant.  They are more able to carry this burden than many of the unfortunate tenants known to me now, who are worried out of their wits wondering if they will have a home next year, or be able to afford it, or be evicted. I would like to see their fears allayed as quickly as possible by this Bill.  When it is properly processed, I hope that it will give the necessary guarantees and security to these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Following the judgement of the Supreme Court in the Blake and Madigan case and the judgement of the same court on the Rent Restrictions Act of 1981, as from 25 April next, unless a valid law in accordance with the Constitution is introduced, the position will be that there will be no restriction on what rents may be charged. The legal rent will be the contractual rent.  There will be no restriction on the right of the landlord to recover possession, which he will be able to do at will. I need not spell out in this House the enormous hardship which that will present for thousands of our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That situation has arisen out of the interpretation by the Supreme Court of the Articles in the Constitution dealing with private property and with social justice. One might think that the Supreme <Col N="1155" /> Court, in its judgement, was dealing with fair rents &mdash; nothing could be further from the truth.  It did not set out to do that; it was not asked to do that.  It was asked to interpret the Articles in the Constitution protecting private property, as they are affected by the social Articles of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I will preface my further remarks by saying that I practised as a solicitor for many years, but have not practised as a solicitor since 1973, nor have I any interest in a solicitor's practice, my former practice or otherwise.  Having said that, I deplore, and disassociate myself and my party from the unwarranted, unfair and quite superficial attack made by Deputy Quinn on the members of the Supreme Court.  That attack, in the long run, will do no good but a great amount of harm, to the very people whom Deputy Quinn seeks to protect.  In the ultimate, our courts stand between might on the one hand and weakness on the other, between wealth, power and influence on one side and poverty, loneliness and lack of power and influence on the other.  If we were to indulge in this House in judge bashing &mdash; whether it be against district justices, Circuit Court, High Court or Supreme Court judges, or if we were to downgrade these offices, we would be doing a bad day's work for the poor, the defenceless and the weaker sections of our community.  About that I have no doubt.</P>
    <P>Nobody is infallible.  The Supreme Court judges were interpreting certain Articles of the Constitution, particularly the Articles which protect the rights of private property.  They delivered a judgment on that subject having regard to all the other relevant Articles of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn claimed he could solve the whole thing off the top of his head. He said the judgment was biased, partisan and class-influenced.  As a layman and a public representative, I would not be discharging my duties if I did not disassociate myself from that and denounce his attack.  The courts can only administer the law as we make it and send it to them. If the law is at fault the courts are not to <Col N="1156" /> blame, it is the fault of the Oireachtas.  If the Constitution is fettering the discretion of the judges and we do not agree with that, then let us amend the Constitution or invite our sovereign people to amend it.</P>
    <P>We were told today at Question Time, in friendly exchanges I had with the Taoiseach, that there was no proposal to change the Constitution and no need to change it unless perhaps in the long term In that situation how unfair can you be? I regard the Supreme Court as a liberal court and I think it is so regarded by everyone.  To attack it in the way which was done today is most unfair and unhelpful to the poorer and weaker sections.</P>
    <P>The law in relation to rent control and rent restrictions goes back to the First World War.  The Acts were introduced about 1919 when there was a great scarcity of houses and a tendency to exploit tenants.  Again, in the Second World War, other rent restrictions Acts were introduced, all of a temporary nature, but rents are at present being fixed by the courts by reference to rents that were prevailing in 1914.  One section of one class of rents is fixed by reference to rents that were charged and payable in the forties, fifties and up to the middle sixties.  Of course, the value of money has changed enormously since those dates and inflation has completely and utterly changed the rents that were payable in those times, so much so that it could be said that the rents fixed by reference to those criteria were meaningless and, if they were meant to be realistic, are absurd.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on the Government to tackle a twofold problem which has been presented to them by the Supreme Court judgements.  The first problem they have to deal with is to introduce and enact a Bill which will, as far as possible, relieve the unfortunate tenants from the hardships inflicted by the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court.  They can only do so if the Bill which they introduce is constitutional. The Government will not be helping anyone, <Col N="1157" /> least of all the tenants who need help and protection, if the Bill which they introduce and seek to enact is unconstitutional because if it is, it will be held to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and will have no effect.</P>
    <P>The Government must also relieve the tenants in question, tens of thousands of people, from the hardship that will be imposed on them as a result of the change in law.  Rents will go up drastically unless the Constitution is changed.  It is the duty of the Government to protect tenants from this hardship, particularly tenants who cannot afford the rents to which they will become subject.  It could be argued that over the years as a result of the change in the value of money, inflation and the rents being tied to 1914 and 1941 rents, successive Governments have been discharging their social obligations to one section of the community by enforcing another section of the community to carry that burden.  There are some landlords who got in on the act, so to speak, who bought these houses knowing they would be controlled and hoping they would be decontrolled.  I have no sympathy for that class of landlord and I hope the law can provide that he will not make a quick buck on houses which he bought for little or nothing because they were controlled in the hope that they might be decontrolled.  He should be prevented from reaping a rich harvest and the Minister will have my support and, I believe, the support of this party in any effective proposals he has to deal with that problem. There are rich and poor landlords, more rich than poor, but there are perhaps widows who were left with houses which they had hoped would give them an income for the rest of their lives but which, because of rent restrictions, bring in no income.</P>
    <P>This is a rather limited debate by agreement and I do not want to keep out other speakers.  The problem here is twofold. First, we have to introduce a Bill that will be constitutional and alleviate, as far as possible, the hardships that the law as it now stands will inflict on tenants.  Second, through the social welfare code we must compensate tenants for the increases in rent that will be inevitable.  This Bill proposes <Col N="1158" /> to do these two things.  But we have to look at this Bill in the light of the judgments that I have been speaking about, the judgment in the Blake and Madigan case on the 1960 Act as amended and the judgment of the Supreme Court on the 1981 Act.</P>
    <P>The most important section in the Bill is section 13 which fixes the rent.  Under the law as it now stands the landlord is entitled to the market rent.  If there was any doubt about that following the judgment in the Blake and Madigan case there could be no doubt about it following the judgment on the 1981 Act because the judgment on that Act dealt briefly with the proposal to phase in the increase in rents up to the market rent.  The judgment said that the just rent is the market rent, that it was proposed to keep the landlord out of the market rent or the just rent in law for four or five years and that that was not on.  Without more ado the 1981 Bill was rejected by the 1981 Act.  That is the law as I understand it. Here in section 13(2) it is proposed:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of <i>subsection</i> (1), the gross rent shall be the rent which, in the opinion of the Court, would be a just and proper rent having regard to the nature, character and location of the dwelling, the other terms of the tenancy...</P>
    <P>If it stopped there it would be strictly in accordance with the Supreme Court definition of what a just rent should be but it goes on to say:</P>
    <P>...the means of the landlord and the tenant, the date of purchase of the dwelling by the landlord and the amount paid by him therefor, the length of the tenant's occupancy of the dwelling and the number and ages of the tenant's family residing in the dwelling.</P>
    <P>While all those considerations may be desirable in order to get what would be a fair rent for the tenant, they have nothing to do with fixing a rent in accordance with the Constitution.  Let us stop talking about the Supreme Court and talk about the Constitution because the Supreme <Col N="1159" /> Court was only interpreting the Constitution.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of introducing into this definition the means of the landlord and the means of the tenant?  It is for the purpose of fixing some sort of equitable rent.  But that is the very thing that the Rent Restrictions Act has been trying to do, to fix a rent less than the market rent, and that is why it was shot down by the Supreme Court.  What is the purpose of introducing the date of purchase of the dwelling by the landlord and the amount paid by him?  It is to decide what would be a fair return to the landlord on the money spent by him.  Again, that is very desirable but it has nothing to do with the constitutional provisions for protecting private property.  I do not know what the length of the tenant's occupancy of the dwelling means.  The number and ages of the tenant's family residing in the dwelling is also included.  That is another highly desirable thing, obviously put in for the purpose of deciding what the tenant can pay, what the tenant's obligations are, how much of his family income he can pay in rent or what it would be fair to ask him to pay.  Again it is very desirable but, having regard to the judgment on the 1981 Act, it has nothing to do with fixing a just rent for the premises in accordance with the Constitution.  I have no doubt that that section of the Bill will be rejected by the Supreme Court at the first opportunity.  I would even go further and say that the Supreme Court, in dealing with that section, will be bound by its decision in the Madigan case and its decision on the 1981 Act.  I do not pretend to be a constitutional lawyer.  I do not pretend to be highly skilled in law.  But I do profess to have a general knowledge and a bit of common sense and I would not mind betting that that will not stand up.  If it does not then we are back to square one; we start all over again.  It is like dealing with the revenue commissioners in a smuggling case.  One offers them £100 as a fine and they do not take the £100 but they will not tell one what they will take and then one has to come again and offer them £150.  It is that sort of an auction.  That is the sort of position <Col N="1160" /> we will be in here.  If that section is shot down by the Supreme Court then the whole Bill will fall and we will be back to square one.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to section 23 which proposes to compensate tenants affected by increases in rent by way of rent allowances. It is the vaguest thing I ever saw. It says:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make regulations for the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of allowances to the tenants of dwellings to which section 8(1) relates who would otherwise suffer hardship by reason of increases in the rents of their dwellings.</P>
    <P>There is no obligation on the Minister for Social Welfare, after consulting the Minister for Finance, to compensate these people, and there should be.  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be substituted for the &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  On the one hand we note that the rents will go up unless the law is changed, and that might take a referendum. Even the Bill as it stands visualises the rents being increased.</P>
    <P>As regards compensation, there is an indefinite promise made to do something about it.  It is far too vague. I would go further than some of my colleagues and say there is no chance of section 13(2) standing up in view of the Supreme Court judgment.  I am 100 per cent in favour of those who say a Bill should be introduced tomorrow to extend the temporary provisions Act which will freeze the law as it is and prevent rents being increased or tenants being ejected for a reasonable time.  That should be done.</P>
    <P>A sum of £6 million has been provided in the budget for section 23 of this Bill. I am told it would take £25 million to meet the Bill that would be presented under that heading.  I agree with those who spoke about a film they saw the other evening.  My approach to this problem is a realistic one.  There is no point in standing up here and spouting out pious platitudes that we wish to help the unfortunate tenants if we know we are hammering our heads against a stone wall and that <Col N="1161" /> the only effective way in which we can remedy the situation is by changing the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There is no point in Deputy Quinn making a speech that might read very well to those who do not understand it. There is no point in him attacking judges and saying they should fix a fair rent when we present them with a Constitution which says they may not.  There is no use in attacking judges&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was for the reason that we might have an attempt at the defence of judges that the Chair reminded Deputy Quinn that it was not in order for him to proceed in the fashion that he did.  I ask the Deputy not to establish here a court of judgment on judges or their decisions.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> What I am doing is explaining the false premise on which Deputy Quinn was attacking them.  I wanted to point out that judges can operate only within the law and the Constitution.  I am making the case that, if we are not satisfied with the machinery available for controlling rents and the Constitution which controls the laws we may enact, then we should change the Constitution.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I do not stand for exorbitant rents.  I saw a film the other evening on certain flats in the city and these were a positive disgrace, unfit for human occupation.  Surely there must be enough machinery available to housing authorities to close these places down.  They are health hazards both from the point of view of being infested with rats and bringing about disease. They are structurally unsound.  The way to deal with the problem is not through rent control but through closing these places.  That might or might not suit landlords.  There should be an obligation on housing authorities to house these tenants elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As my namesake and colleague, Deputy Fitzpatrick, said, as years go by <Col N="1162" /> we will want more rented dwellings instead of fewer, because the cost of private housing has gone far beyond the capacity of people to pay for it.  The only solution is to provide more rented dwellings, perhaps more flats&mdash;but do not let them be 12 and 13 storeys high.  They should be of a reasonable size.  This would be an expensive solution.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to make a flowery speech and say this Bill or a more favourable one should go through.  That will not get us anywhere if we know it is not in accordance with the Constitution.  It will not solve anyone's problems.  It would also be very easy to be misrepresented as being on the side of Rachman type of landlords or landlords who exploit people.  I am not in favour of quick buck landlords.  I am not in favour of people having to pay a rent which it is beyond their capacity to pay or being condemned to live in unhealthy or unhygienic hovels. I am not in favour of make-believe, or of putting Bills through that will not solve the problem.  It may be said that the 1981 Bill did not stand up.  I accept that.  While there may have been some doubt before the judgment on the 1981 Bill there can be no doubt now as to what the Supreme Court means by a just rent.  A just rent is the market rent payable as from now and not by instalments over five years.  That is what a Government of which I was a member proposed in the hope that it would stand up.  However, it did not and was shot down.  I believe this will also be shot down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree that the need for this legislation arises from Supreme Court decisions.  This Bill hopefully, and I say &ldquo;hopefully&rdquo; with reservations, will be constitutional this time because of the need to protect the rights of landlords to a fair rent and the rights of tenants to a fair rent and security of tenure.  I noticed that in correspondence about the situation since last June reference was made to restricting the right of landlords to recover their property.  I represent tenants in Cork North-Central and, when the decision of the Supreme Court which found the Act was unconstitutional was handed down, unscrupulous landlords <Col N="1163" /> immediately tried to take advantage of their tenants.  I know of a group of tenants who were visited by their landlord and asked for an abnormal increase in rent. The alternative was to pay up or get out. In this case the getting out might suit the landlord because the property was acquired some years ago at a very nominal price and the ground on which these houses stand is now much more valuable to the landlord for speculative purposes. When I speak about one landlord I can use the analogy for many more such landlords. The ground is more valuable to them and they are not even thinking about their social or moral obligations to their tenants.</P>
      <P>I hope that this legislation will succeed because since the decision of the Supreme Court in the Madigan case tenants in the type of rented houses we are talking about are living in actual terror of what might become of them.  I know of that from talking to them in my constituency, and I believe from what they tell me that they are not sleeping at night.  By this legislation here and by having it in accordance with the Constitution we must put these people's minds at ease and ensure for them security of tenure.  I lay some emphasis on that as well as on the rent question.  We have cases where the landlord did not succeed in evicting the people or frightening them into getting out of their houses when they did not pay the several hundred per cent rent increase demanded, and the action of such unscrupulous landlords is that since last June they have not collected a penny of the rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about a group of people who are moving on in years, who pay their way and who never owed a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; to anyone.  These are the sort of people who are being hounded by some landlords. Many of these tenants will express freely that the rents they are paying are uneconomic but they are fearful of any proposals or legislation that could make rents impossible for them to pay.  We have heard here already this evening of a demand from some people greater than their total income, and in this respect it behoves us all to ensure that these long-established <Col N="1164" /> tenants will not come under that sort of pressure.  I am pleased to see that because of the likelihood of that happening, particularly to people in the social welfare bracket &mdash; many of the people we are talking about are in that bracket &mdash; the Minister is proposing to provide through the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Finance a subsidy to ease the situation for these people.  I hope &mdash; and in this regard I sound a little note of warning because it has been the experience of all of us as public representatives &mdash; that whatever rules we bring in to help people, particularly in the social welfare code, we do not see them being abused to the detriment of the common good.  We here and everybody concerned have a responsibility to ensure that this facility being introduced to help people will not be abused and that it will be of good use to as many people as possible.</P>
    <P>It is awful to note that we may &mdash; and if some people have their way we certainly would &mdash; hear that word dreaded in Irish history, eviction.  Some of our unscrupulous landlords are thinking along those lines.  We must ensure in so far as we can that that unwholesome word will not be put into effect in regard to any of our tenants.</P>
    <P>Fair room is left in the Bill before the House for repairs and maintenance done by tenants over the years and that is as it should be.  May be because of uneconomic rents in many cases, the landlords could not afford to do repairs, but those who did some repairs discovered a handy little ruse for raising the rents in a controlled rent situation.  I will give the House an example.  If the landlord put in, say, a new front door for a tenant, the door costing at the time £20 to £30, the landlord would decide that the tenant would pay 5s a week extra &mdash; 25p now &mdash; for the new door.  Lo and behold, when the tenant had paid the £20 to £30 at 5s a week the landlord retained the extra on the rent.  If subsequently the tenant had a window fixed or a slate put on the roof there were all these little additions.  So much for controlled rents. That is why we must be very vigilant in <Col N="1165" /> regard to legislation and so forth which is intended to protect people.</P>
    <P>When the former Bill was going through the House I supported an amendment for the provision of a rents tribunal rather than have these matters go through the District Court for a decision as to what was a reasonable rent. Without intending any disrespect to the district justices &mdash; and I am not getting into the same realm of thought as Deputy Quinn on the Supreme Court judges &mdash; the judge would know about law.  To make a decision he would require the services of specialists in the field of housing, estate agents, architects, engineers, to name but a few of the professions involved.  The sort of tenants we have been speaking about would not be in a position to avail of the services of these people.  Most of these tenants have never been near a courthouse and shudder at the thought of it.  On that basis I strongly supported the proposal made by my party last year for the setting up of a rents tribunal.  I have not changed my mind on that point but I accept totally the Minister's decision that it would not be possible to establish such a tribunal by 25 April. In the interim we must accept the use of the District Court but I commend the Minister for indicating that he will examine the matter.  In the course of his speech he stated:</P>
    <P>Once the problem of the controlled sector has been dealt with, I intend, as one of my priorities, to have all aspects of the setting up of rent tribunals looked at and examined in a comprehensive and constructive manner.</P>
    <P>I welcome this commitment by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Another important matter is the registering of landlords with local authorities. Many tenants do not know who their landlords are because they have never seen them or communicated with them. In many cases they do not know in what countries they live.  Estate agents and solicitors &mdash; I mean no disrespect to these honourable people &mdash; act as fronts for landlords, not perhaps by their choice but by the choice of the landlords.  I welcome the provision whereby landlords will be <Col N="1166" /> registered and thus made liable for income tax.  These faceless people should be flushed out and made to pay their just taxes in the same way as their tenants.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year that the District Courts are overloaded and many months behind in their business.  In the Cork area litigation is so far behind that every so often, perhaps once a month, a district justice comes for a couple of days to help clear the backlog.  The volume of work will be such before the tribunal is established that it may be necessary to bring in a third district justice from Dublin or perhaps employ some local district justices, if they are suitably qualified.</P>
    <P>Some form of legal aid may have to be considered although the Bill provides that a landlord is liable for the cost of taking a tenant to court.  Some tenants would do anything rather than go to court and I hope the situation will not arise.  It is also my hope that this legislation will be found to be in accordance with the Constitution and will be operable by 25 April.  If this is not the case there will be an uncontrollable situation and I would be fearful of the outcome for the tenants. There is a possibility that in many cases landlords and tenants will agree on a fair rent and this would be most welcome. Tenants must be reassured that the Government and the Oireachtas are concerned for their welfare, at the same time recognising the rights of all citizens. Whilst we may have good landlords, a landlord is a landlord.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it is recognised by all sides of the House that there is a need to provide for a balance between the rights and interests of tenants and the rights and interests of landlords.  This is the second occasion within a very short period when the House has had to consider this matter.  Many of the comments I could make about this Bill have been made by other Members of the House so I want to avoid repetition as far as possible. I would like to refer in a general way to some of the provisions in the Bill and also to some of what I regard as the more serious omissions from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Minister, like his predecessor, was anxious to provide the House <Col N="1167" /> with a Bill which would be constitutional and workable but I believe there are many amendments which could be made to it that would render it more efficient. There are also other changes which could be made which would make it a more understandable measure.  There are some instances where both landlords and tenants could be provided with greater protection than they are given and provided with other remedies to deal with the situation they find themselves in besides the remedies provided in the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>This Bill is concerned essentially with trying to provide a mechanism whereby tenants living in former rent controlled dwellings can re-negotiate a rent with their landlords or, in the event of not negotiating a rent with their landlords, have that rent determined by the criteria set down in section 13.  The Bill is only concerned with the question of rent and tenants' rights and landlords' rights on the basis that the dwellings the Bill is concerned with remain as rented dwellings. A criticism of the Bill is that it could have looked at other ways, in addition to maintaining the rental situation, of dealing with the problem.  Most landlords would like to see some return on their asset and whatever Members of the House feel about that the reality is as a result of the Supreme Court decision.  I believe the view which has been taken by the Supreme Court is that landlords are entitled to a form of market rent or certainly proper and adequate compensation for ownership rights.</P>
    <P>I believe some of the tenants who were living in former rent controlled dwellings or dwellings within the terms of this Bill would probably prefer to purchase those dwellings than be confined to a rental relationship.  I believe this only applies to a minority of tenants.  The Bill provides a mechanism for the position of the tenant who decides he wants to purchase his rent controlled dwelling, who has a landlord unwilling to sell and who is thereby confined to a rental relationship.  The Bill could have provided a mechanism to enable a tenant to purchase on the basis of requiring a landlord to sell a premises, <Col N="1168" /> the price being agreed between the landlord and the tenant, or, on failure to agree, such a price being agreed by a court or tribunal decision as to what the proper value of the dwelling or property is.  Something could have been included in the Bill and provided for.  If it had been it would have provided an alternative way of dealing with the existing problem for some of the tenants, probably not the majority of them.  The majority of the tenants will be concerned with attempting to re-negotiate a rent.</P>
    <P>I would like to come back to what has been said by other speakers about section 13.  We will be dealing with that section on Committee Stage but a general comment should be made about it at this stage.  Before we get to Committee Stage the Minister might reconsider some of the contents of that section.  I accept the Minister means well in relation to the provisions contained in that section and is trying to maintain the type of balancing act the House will have to maintain to walk the tight rope of constitutionality.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Fitzpatrick from this side of the House, I have my doubts about whether section 13 (2) is constitutional. It is difficult to give a final judgment on that because I believe, with the greatest respect to the Supreme Court, if you take the two judgments delivered so far in this area by them you could give different interpretations as to how the courts might view section 13 (2).  There is a possibility that this Bill, like its predecessor, could be referred to the courts for a decision about its constitutionality.  If that happens a minimum of 60 days will elapse before we know if the Bill is valid constitutionally and we will be long past 25 April when the present temporary provisions Act ceases its life spell.</P>
    <P>I, like speakers on both sides of the House, urge the Minister to introduce an additional Bill to the House tomorrow, a temporary provisions Bill, extending for a further minimum period of three months the life span of the temporary situation we have at the moment.  If the President, on the advice of the Council of State, decides to refer this Bill to the Supreme Court for a decision about its constitutionality many tenants will find <Col N="1169" /> themselves in a sort of legal limbo in which they will not know what their rights are, what protection they will have and if there is a possibility they could be put out of their houses.  There will be a rush of cases heading into the courts and there will be confusion in the courts.  They will not know if they should wait for the decision of the Supreme Court on the constitutionality of the Bill before deciding some of those cases.  There will be endless problems unless a new temporary provisions Bill is introduced whose life span should carry us for a further three months period to allow time, if this Bill is found to be constitutionally unsound, for the House to introduce a further measure.  I was surprised that when this Bill was published it was not accompanied by a temporary provisions Bill to deal with that eventuality.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the possibility of a constitutional challenge succeeding on section 13 there is another problem in relation to the criteria the Minister has set for determining the rents.  I believe this is well meaning but it is unworkable.  I will give some illustrations of my reason for this.  In determining what the rent should be, the courts are asked to take into account, in the context of a dwelling, in respect of whose future rent there is a dispute, the means of the landlord and of the tenant.  If the courts or the tribunal are dealing with this how will they do that?  Will a tenant have to come to court and give full evidence about all his means, earnings and capital assets if he has any?  That will not be a problem with the majority of tenants because we know that they are pensioners and their means are quite simple.  They will have a contributory or a non-contributory old age pension.</P>
    <P>How will the courts assess this in the context of landlords?  Some landlords will be private individuals.  Many people in the House may say that they should be required in open court to reveal what their means are.  Possibly that should not be the case &mdash; that an individual who owns property, in order to reach an agreement as to what rent should be paid for that property should not necessarily have to give full evidence about every <Col N="1170" /> aspect of his income in court, particularly when that aspect of income has no relevance to the property itself.  Different Deputies will have different views on that, but the workability of it for the court is a major problem.</P>
    <P>What happens when the landlord is a company?  What happens if a company owns a variety of different properties? What happens if you have a parent company that has a number of subsidiary companies, each subsidiary owning one or two houses that are rent controlled? How are the courts to determine what the means of the landlord is?  In those circumstances are we to have company accountants coming into court giving dissertation on the state of the company's finances?  I think it is unworkable.  The Minister means well.  I know what he is trying to do &mdash; produce a balancing act between social needs and positions of tenants and landlords.  As we all know, the vast majority of tenants affected by this Bill will have real difficulty in meeting any substantial increase in rental payments. Let us not through this House pass a measure meaning well that will either be struck down by the Supreme Court as being unconstitutional or, if it escapes that, will find itself in the District Court or before a formal rent tribunal &mdash; which I shall come to shortly &mdash; with criteria that neither the court nor the tribunal can apply or interpret in the real world in determining rent.  I fear that is what this provision does.  I do not believe it is a workable provision however well it is meant.  The Minister should look seriously at the possibility of amending it to provide criteria that can be applied in the case of conflict between landlord and tenant as to how much rent should be paid.</P>
    <P>An additional criterion I believe should be applied under the provision.  It is one that should interact with section 26 of the Bill, which provides for the making of regulations to set minimum standards for residential dwellings that come within the terms of the Bill.  That is something long desired and necessary, not just in the context of residential private dwellings that are let and come within the confines of this Bill, but I believe there should be statutory powers to have such <Col N="1171" /> regulations enforced generally in respect of residential dwellings.</P>
    <P>I welcome that provision in the Bill.  It is very similar to a provision in the 1981 Bill; but that provision in this Bill does not, I believe, provide tenants with the protection they should get.  I said a similar thing in the context of the 1981 Bill.  How that section can interact with section 13 is something I shall come to shortly.  Section 26 effectively confers power on the Minister to make regulations prescribing minimum standards and confers power on the local housing authority, the local authority, to enforce those regulations. The local authority can do that effectively by serving a notice on a landlord to comply with the regulations and, if he fails to do so, the local authority can do one of two things: they can do the work themselves on the dwelling and subsequently sue the landlord for a contract debt in respect of whatever work has been done, or the landlord can be prosecuted by the local authority.  There is a problem in that.  Our local authorities at present are overstretched.  They do not have the presonnel or manpower to meet many of the statutory duties already imposed on them.  They will not have the personnel or manpower to enforce the provisions of section 26.  There is no provision in the Bill to provide additional funds for local authorities to enable them to establish a form of housing inspectorate or rented dwellings inspectorate to ensure that such minimum standards will be complied with.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is serious in wishing to implement minimum standards for rented private dwellings coming within the ambit of this Bill he should confer a right on tenants to enforce those minimum standards.  That is the obvious thing to do.  The tenant will be living in the house and will know what is wrong with it.  If the minimum standards are not being complied with the tenant will have an obvious interest in ensuring compliance. Section 26 itself should be amended to confer a right on a tenant to serve notice on a landlord requiring him to bring the property up to minimum standard. If the landlord fails to comply with <Col N="1172" /> the notice an additional right should be conferred on the tenant to sue the landlord for compensation.  I do not know why that was not done.  Not only would it ensure that the regulation enforcing minimum standards would be better complied with but it would take the onus off local authorities that I do not feel at present they have the capacity to meet. The reference to minimum standards in section 26 is to some extent window dressing because I see no way in which these would be enforceable at present.</P>
    <P>As to how section 26 could interact with section 13, not only do we need to provide a tenant with the mechanism for ensuring that minimum standards are complied with, but let us provide the landlord with a carrot for meeting the minimum standards.  Should not one of the criteria to which the court or tribunal fixing rent should be obliged to have regard in determining the rent a tenant should pay be the condition of the property or dwelling at the time when the determination of rent is being made &mdash; not simply the condition of the property but the condition of the matters that are going to be regulated by ministerial Order to ensure minimum standards?  In other words, if a dwelling does not comply with minimum standards, the body determining the rent that should be paid should be allowed to have regard to that also.  So, if a landlord has not complied with the minimum standards and if the rent is coming up for review after a five-year period, he will know that he may lose out on rent.  That will provide a real incentive for landlords to comply with regulations and standards which the Minister may feel should be imposed and which he has power to impose as a result of this legislation.</P>
    <P>In the context of the legislation and of section 13 I reiterate what I and other Members have already said.  I do not accept the Minister's view that it is not possible within the time span allotted to provide for a form of tribunal to deal with determinations under this Bill.  The Minister acknowledges that the Bill when it comes into operation, be it this Bill or a further Bill after a further constitutional case, will result in a large number of <Col N="1173" /> tenants and landlords coming to the courts looking for relief.  He acknowledges that the courts at present do not have the capacity to provide that relief. He refers to the necessity to appoint additional district justices.  Just as additional district justices can be appointed, so can a form of private rented dwellings tribunal be established.  Just as there is the need in this area for whatever criteria will ultimately be applied in determining the rent, there is need to ensure a uniformity of approach in applying those criteria right across the country.  I do not believe it is possible, certainly within the context of the criteria to be applied under section 13, first, for the district justices in effect to apply it; and, secondly, for there to be that uniformity of approach.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the appointment of one or two temporary district justices will provide the additional courts we need to determine applications under this legislation. I agree with what Deputy Fitzpatrick (<i>Dublin South-Central</i>) said.  Many tenants will be terrified at the prospect of having to go into a formal District Court situation.  There are District Courts operating in very strange places at present &mdash; dance halls, rugby clubs and in Rathfarnham the District Court operates next door to the gents' toilets &mdash; and the size of the court is not very different from the size of the toilets.  The courts are not equipped to deal with some of the work they already have, and they certainly will not be equipped to deal with the massive number of applications which will come before them under this Bill.  Temporary or new district justices are unlikely to have the necessary expertise to apply the criteria under this Bill and, even if some of them do, there is very little likelihood that within a short period there will be the type of uniformity of approach that is desired by all.</P>
    <P>This Bill affords the Minister an opportunity to establish a rents tribunal, a private rented dwellings tribunal, or whatever one likes to call it, whose activities would primarily be to determine the amounts of rents payable under the Bill and to determine disputes between landlords and tenants about the landlords failure or non-compliance with the minimum <Col N="1174" /> standards the Minister may enforce under section 26.  It would also provide him with a unique opportunity to see how such a tribunal would operate in one area prior to the introduction of comprehensive legislation to deal with all private rented accommodation.  I urge him to consider amending this Bill on Committee Stage, or to accept amendments from this side, to establish such a tribunal.  It would be in the interests of tenants because it would provide an informal setting, an inexpensive forum within which such disputes between landlords and tenants could be speedily determined.  Many landlords would also welcome it because it would provide a less expensive and more expert forum to resolve the problem. Also it would lessen the burden of legal costs on everybody involved.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal adequately with the problem of legal costs.  It is true that the vast majority of landlords will not have that problem.  They can afford the legal costs incurred in bringing an action in the District Court to determine rent. Under the criteria in this Bill the landlord may have to bring into court his accountant to give evidence about the state of his finances, an estate agent to give evidence about the type of rent he should be receiving, and he may have to bring all his children into court to give evidence of their ages, but he will be able to do that.  On the other hand, the majority of tenants will not be able to pay the estate agents' fees for carrying out a valuation of the rent they should be paying on their tenancy and to pay his fees to attend court to give evidence.</P>
    <P>If there was a rents tribunal the personnel would have the necessary expertise and necessity for these professional people trooping into the tribunal would be obviated.  Whether we have a tribunal or a District Court, I believe it is essential that tenants should be properly legally represented in a matter as vital as determining the context in which they are going to retain the roof over their heads.</P>
    <P>Our present legal aid scheme is totally inadequate; it is not statutorily based but it is based on ministerial <i>diktat.</i> As there is no reference to free legal aid in this Bill, I ask the Minister to get in touch <Col N="1175" /> with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, and ask if it is his intention to amend the existing legal aid scheme and to specifically extend its application to all disputes between landlords and tenants under the provisions of this Bill.  When we come to Committee Stage tomorrow I hope we will have the Minister's undertaking that his colleague will extend the legal aid scheme.  In so doing, I hope he will ask his colleague something else: in the context of tenants who are badly off and whose means are such that they are entitled to free legal aid, will the legal aid scheme bear the cost of getting an estate agent or other qualified persons to appear in court on behalf of the tenant?  There is no point giving a non-contributory pensioner free legal aid if he has to provide £200 to cover an estate agent's fee to give evidence in court.  It is not just an extension of the free legal aid scheme that is required, but an assurance that the type of evidence any responsible solicitor would tell a tenant he should have in such disputes be made available to the tenant. We must ensure tenants are not disadvantaged because they do not have the means to pay for such professional services. I hope the Minister will be in a position to give us that additional assurance when he comes here tomorrow when we are dealing with the Committee Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have referred to section 13, the imprecise nature of its terms and the danger that it could be regarded as unconstitutional. I would like to turn now to section 23, which deals with social welfare provisions, with the side heading &ldquo;Rent allowances for tenants&rdquo;.  There is a problem with this section.  I take it that the Minister means well in the enactment of this provision, but this section does not tell us what the rent allowances will be. If all Stages of this Bill are passed tomorrow and it goes through the Seanad unamended, and if a constituent tells me his landlord increased his rent and then asks how much he will get by way of assistance each week towards paying the rent, my answer will be that I do not know, and every Member who is asked the same question will give a similar <Col N="1176" /> answer.  If the Minister has a scheme for the provision of rent allowances, be they paid through his Department or through the Department of Social Welfare, could he not give a more detailed statement as to the nature of that scheme and the criteria that will apply?  Will there be an upper limit on the amount of money made available to the tenants?  I believe this is a very unsatisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>If we take the Supreme Court view that landlords are entitled to the market rent, the other side of the balancing act is that we must ensure no tenant loses the roof over his head because he cannot afford to pay the rent he is judged to pay pursuant to a decision made under section 13.  We do not know what financial assistance will be available to tenants under the provisions of this Bill.  I hope the Minister clarifies that point and spells out the nature of the financial provisions, tell us to whom tenants will have to apply for such financial support and for what length of time this support will be available. Will it be available for the first year or two of the operation of the Act or will it be available on an on-going basis?</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy E. Desmond on 30 March 1982:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to proceed to establish on a statutory basis the Agency to Combat Poverty and to provide the necessary Exchequer funds.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;welcomes the decision of the Government, as announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement, to provide £2 million in 1982 to establish a National Community Development <Col N="1177" /> Agency which will incorporate and expand the work of the Agency to Combat Poverty proposed by the previous Government and for which only £250,000 had been provided.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I was explaining last evening that I do not have a £2,000 fur coat.  I was speaking in the context of our taxation policy and the amount of criticism evoked by the tax that we proposed to impose on clothing and footwear.  I accept that such a tax would create particular difficulties for those on very low incomes but in the whole context of budgetary planning, of family income supplements and of social welfare payments that tax was seen to be a progressive tax.  My general point in relation to the entire approach of the previous Government to the serious and fundamental problem of poverty was that our policies were very much more progressive than are the policies of the party now in Government. This was agreed by many outside observers and commentators, including Sister Stanislaus Kennedy who is one of the best known spokespersons for the poor. Of course it is kinder to people to say, &ldquo;We will not tax you now&rdquo; or. &ldquo;We will give you so and so&rdquo; but the long-term consequences of such an approach are increased unemployment, increased strain on our resources, inflation and consequent devaluation of the money in one's pocket.  That type of superficial nice-guy approach is doing a lot of damage and is a betrayal of the genuine and best interests of the people we are elected to serve.</P>
      <P>To return to the more specific matter we are discussing, there are some questions that I should like the Minister to answer when he is replying.  I should like him to indicate the kinds of areas that are intended to benefit from the agency he is proposing.  The term, &ldquo;community development agency&rdquo; is somewhat wide.  May we have an assurance that some form of criteria will be used by which the areas that would be entitled to apply for support under the scheme would be entitled to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister also elucidate what <Col N="1178" /> will be the position of Sister Stanislaus Kennedy?  She was named by the outgoing Government as the chairperson of the agency we proposed.  Sister Stanislaus has consistently voiced her concern for the needs of the poor and she has done so at times when few others were prepared to speak in the same vein.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister indicate also the range of personnel to which he will be looking in terms of this agency, the types of organisations that he will be looking towards in this context and the kinds of talents and expertise that he would consider should be involved in the work of the agency?  It is our concern that a full range of talents be sought, talents ranging from those experienced both in the ground work and in the field of research. My view about the previous programme is based on my direct experience as a public representative in an area in which there are pockets which under any criteria would be deserving of aid from any agency of the kind proposed.  My view and it is a view that is shared by the review group is that community work approach is extremely valuable, that these communities have a great deal of potential but that they need a little more support than is needed by middle-class communities of comparative size who have resources available to them naturally. The poorer communities need this extra support to enable them to take advantage of existing help.  The review group in their comments indicated that the bulk of the community work undertaken in the course of the programme was innovative and potentially valuable but that its strategy is time consuming and difficult to operate in terms of personal and community development and is likely to be long-term.  We are concerned that the aims of the agency will not be the short-term grant aiding of various activities but that the kind of projects the agency will support will have long-term benefits in the deepest structural way possible.</P>
    <P>The group found it difficult to decide on whether this work could be engaged in on a national scale.  I am glad that the agency proposed has the potential of such development.  I am confident that while <Col N="1179" /> society spends a great deal already on social and community amenities, the communities that are taking advantage of that expenditure are the well-off and already adequately catered-for communities. I would be concerned that in a struggle for resources the more deprived communities would lose out.  That may be the case in terms of what is available already.</P>
    <P>If the questions we have asked are answered to our satisfaction during the Minister's reply we shall not vote against the amendment.  I am glad that an agency of this kind is being included but I would not expect from Fianna Fáil the kind of fundamental changes that we should like to see&mdash;the fundamental examination of overall Government strategy, the fundamental commitment to the elimination of poverty on a wider planning scale.  Having said that, I am glad that as a result of the famous negotiations with Deputy Gregory the commitment to continuing the work of the combat poverty committee is being followed through.  We shall be interested in the terms of reference that the relevant legislation will contain.</P>
    <P>We should like to have some indication also as to when the legislation is likely to be before us.  It should be a fairly straightforward piece of legislation for the establishment of the agency.  We had legislation ready on leaving office so we would expect the Government's legislation to be dealt with fairly quickly and the agency being able to go into operation during the next Dáil session.</P>
    <P>We will be an active and constructive Opposition in ensuring that when the legislation is before us the terms of reference are such as to enable the agency to be of maximum benefit to those it is intended to serve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Gallagher, Mayo West) Denis Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Gallagher,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Mayo West</i>): I listened carefully to the speeches made by Deputy Desmond and Deputy Flaherty and, of course, the Minister last night.  We accept on all sides of the House that we have a problem about people who are not well off, and who might be described as living in conditions which <Col N="1180" /> are not what one would like to see.  It is agreed that down through the years Governments have used the resources available to them to the best of their ability in an effort to cater for the less well-off sections in our community.</P>
      <P>I should like to dwell on the position in rural Ireland as opposed to the position in the urban and built-up areas.  We have seen tremendous improvements in the standard of living of our people in rural Ireland generally, particularly since the introduction of the social welfare system, which we know as the farmers' dole, and the benefits which have come to rural Ireland as a result of our entry into the EEC.  Subsidies and grants of various kinds have been made available to rural communities which have helped to improve their standard of living.  The change in the method of assessing people for unemployment assistance has not in any way interfered with the other benefits they get from the State.</P>
      <P>When we talk about the conditions in which people live we think about housing, education, the health services, the social welfare services, and so on.  In my own county we have seen tremendous advances in housing.  To give the House an idea of what has been happening, last year the sum made available for rural dwellings was £1.521 million or roughly £1½ million.  On grants for disabled persons £430,000 was spent, and on grants for essential repairs to houses £120,000 was spent.</P>
      <P>While I am talking about housing; tig liom focal a rá faoi tithe sna Gaeltachtaí. Tá deontais bhreise á fáil ag muintir na Gaeltachta agus tá sé le feiceáil ar fud na nGaeltachtaí ar fad an deis maireachtála agus an deis atá ar thithíocht de bharr na ndeontas seo atá curtha ar fáil ag an Stát le blianta anuas &mdash; rud a chabraigh go mór le saol na ndaoine sna ceantracha sin.  An rud atá fíor i Maigh Eo tá sé fior i gConamara, i gContae na Gaillimhe, i gContae Chiarraí, i gContae Dhún na nGall agus sna Gaeltachtaí eile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to come now to the benefits available under the health services. Last night my Minister dealt with a number of them, but there are other areas which he did not include in his speech <Col N="1181" /> which are well worth mentioning.  The extension of the public health nursing services, the home help services, the inclusion of social workers working under the health boards and the building of welfare homes have all made a major contribution towards improving the lot of old people in the community, improving their way of life and giving them confidence where confidence is needed.  Those benefits have all been very well worthwhile and, to a great extent, they have improved the lot of these people in the community.</P>
    <P>Large sums have been expended on the provision of regional water schemes and group water schemes.  We are now talking about community development. The provision of group water schemes is a real example of how communities can come together to help themselves.  As a result of all this, a better standard of living has been provided for our people. They have facilities which they did not have in the past.  It is good to see that they have responded to the grants made available by the State to improve conditions for them.</P>
    <P>Rural electrification has reached practically every home, and we can boast that people living on the islands have similar conditions to their brethren on the mainland. It would be hard to overstate the benefits of free education in rural Ireland.  People can avail of the benefits of second and third level education and qualify for State jobs.  Under a scheme in the Department of Education, community centres are being built.  In the main, the effort is coming from the communities themselves.  It is tremendous to see the response we are getting to matters of this kind.  Playing fields and dressing rooms are being provided as a result of leadership in the community and the fact that the State has recognised that these grants are of benefit to the communities. The State is answering the call of the communities by trying to provide money to help them to get these projects off the ground.</P>
    <P>In rural Ireland, and in particular in the west, we had the problem of emigration. Over the years wives and children were deprived of having their husbands <Col N="1182" /> or fathers with them for most of the year. In my parish very often the father was away from his family for nine or ten months of the year.  That has changed as a result of Government policy down through the years.  Employment has been provided in Ireland.  People no longer talk about emigrating.  They may not have the jobs in their own parish or where they want them at home, but at least they have jobs in Ireland and are able to return to their families most weekends.  This has been a tremendous step forward and something which is to be welcomed.  To emphasise the point I am making I should say that when I went back to work in my own parish in 1946 I can recall on a summer morning in June four busloads of young people heading for the boat taking them to Scotland for potato picking. Thank God free education has done away with that.  The situation now obtaining is one in which all of that has ceased and we no longer talk of the emigration ship. This means also that we have live communities helping themselves and doing something worthwhile for their members. Many travelling people also have been integrated into housing schemes and are playing a role in society which constitutes a tremendous advance.  There has been a tremendous job done in this respect in my county.</P>
    <P>I often wonder if we are not laying too much emphasis on poverty in relation to some sections of the community when one thinks of the people who, in my opinion, constitute the new poor in society today.  They are the people in the lower and middle income groups who must face the payment of mortgages, who are trying to give their families second and third level education, who pay for all of the services about which we talk here but who cannot avail of any of them.  We know of many such people.  We should think a little more about these people and not place all the emphasis on people who may not have made the efforts we might have expected of them to improve their lot in life.  There was a suggestion emanating from the far side of the House in relation to the economic aspect of this. It appeared that speakers were suggesting that economic progress automatically <Col N="1183" /> led to a rise in the standard of living of everybody.  We do not entirely accept that argument.  Measures must be, and already have been taken over the years to devise a better re-distribution of increased prosperity for every section of the community.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the fact that Deputies on the other side of the House were unable to produce any fresh information about the complex problem of poverty. Estimates produced in 1971 are still being quoted.  Neither has any new information been produced about the categories of people in poverty, those at risk of poverty or the reason that poverty, as they describe it, exists.  One would reasonably have expected a pilot programme to have gleaned more precise information about these categories of people and how they could be helped more effectively.  I am not saying that the programme did not produce results in certain areas but the committee themselves admit that they failed to co-ordinate such research as they undertook in useful policy documents.</P>
    <P>Deputy E. Desmond put forward the view that many of our agencies are not properly geared to dealing with the problems of the poor.  I think we would all agree that there is now and always will be room for improvement in the services we provide for the poor.  There must be provided better accommodation for people awaiting interviews, better information services and so on.  We shall examine these matters and hope to secure substantial improvements.  However, I fail to see, as the Deputy suggested, how these problems can be solved by restoring the combat poverty committee or any similar body.  These problems must be tackled on a much wider scale by all of the agencies concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty asked a question in relation to central social planning.  The Taoiseach has announced already that over the next three months a comprehensive economic and social plan will be prepared in consultation with employers, trades unions, farmers and other interests with a view to obtaining a better and fuller life for all our people.  This plan <Col N="1184" /> will form the ground work for our future measures in the economic and social fields.  The Minister has assured the House already that the new agency will have a statutory basis and I hope that assurance satisfies Deputies who raised this question.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to some of the benefits that have emanated from successive Governments in relation to helping the poor and communities in general. Last evening the Minister gave an outline of the role and function of the proposed National Community Development Agency which it is worth repeating.  The new agency will research the causes and extent of poverty and inequality.  They will advise on new policies and programmes, indentify areas of high social deprivation, will foster community indentity and activity and facilitate the mobilisation of self-help in the community. They will conduct local pilot action projects and research programmes.  They will support and encourage voluntary organisations, promote greater awareness, acceptability and co-ordination of social services and basic rights and appraise Government social spending, making appropriate recommendations. The National Community Development Agency &mdash; I think the House will agree &mdash; have been given a full and creative role to play in pioneering new ways of meeting social needs and providing models of the best practices to be adopted by statutory and other agencies.  Because of their independent status and the extent of the funds available to them the agency will be in a position to intervene rapidly in response to social problems.  They will be the voice of the under-privileged and deprived.  They will draw the attention of bodies with statutory responsibilities to the needs of deprived communities and will harness the enthusiasm and commitment of local people to solving the problems of their communities.  As I see it, this is the essential difference between the two agencies.  While the combat poverty committee tended to tackle poverty in the narrow sense the National Community Development Agency have a much broader dimension with special emphasis being placed on the importance <Col N="1185" /> of fostering community identity and activity.  Community Development is about self-help.  When we talk about community development we are talking about development of largely self-reliant communities, about giving people a sense of self-worth.  The philosophy encompassed in this approach is being adopted in industry, in education, in agriculture and in many voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>Deputy E. Desmond pointed out quite rightly last evening that the continuing incidence of poverty can change the other social and economic problems that create a sense of powerlessness amongst those in deprived areas.  It will be the task of the new agency to change matters and create opportunities for people to participate directly in identifying and articulating their needs and aspirations rather than having them interpreted and filtered through a super-structure of agencies and committees.  I know there are a number of existing agencies which have a community development approach &mdash; I am thinking of Muintir na Tíre, Macra na Féirme, Foróige, local social service councils, local development associations and various other community associations and councils.  These agencies have much to offer in any national plan.  Much has been learned from the poverty programme and the EEC-sponsored Muintir na Tíre projects which must not be ignored.  What is being proposed now will not discard in any way what has been achieved already or the lessons learned from experience.</P>
    <P>There were a couple of points raised by Deputy Flaherty to which I should like to respond.  She was concerned that the new agency would in some way be restricted or limited in the scope of activities it would undertake.  I should like to assure the Deputy that the agency will be free to engage in whatever programmes and projects they consider necessary having regard only to overall financial and staffing constraints.  This will be clearly indicated in their terms of reference.  The Deputy welcomed the decision of the Government to establish the agency on a statutory basis and pointed out the need for independence and freedom of such a body.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> I was interested to hear Deputy Flaherty speaking about community development. The Deputy highlighted the basic difference between what the Government are about to establish and what her Government proposed to do.  We consider that the community development dimension was not adequately covered, if at all, in the terms of reference of the National Coalition's poverty agency. We are very committed to this and we will foster and develop the idea of community development to the full extent. Deputy Flaherty seems to have some doubt as to the nature and status of the agency.  As the Minister stated, the new agency will be set up on a permanent and statutory basis and the legislation necessary to do this will be brought before the House early in the next session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Has any effort been made by the different agencies operating at national and local level to identify the real causes of poverty?  There is poverty here and it is a terrible reflection on our society that we have one million poor. That need not be the case.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to the anomalies in our system.  In some areas farmers are paid dole on the basis of a qualification of many years ago when the valuation of their property was assessed. At that time the valuation was low because the land was so bad that they could not make a living from it.  Since then those farms have been developed but those highly organised and modernised farmers are being paid dole.  That is happening in certain designated areas while at the same time the sons and daughters of working class people who pay PRSI are subjected to a means test. Such people are assessed on the family income even though they do not gain anything from their parents.  In most cases the father is the only breadwinner in that house.  That should be changed. Is it right, if we have identified the fact that there is poverty, that wealthy people can get children's allowances?  Why not increase the amount of the allowance for those who look forward to the day that the allowance is due?  That allowance supplements the family income in such <Col N="1187" /> cases but, on the other hand, wealthy people invest that allowance for their children.  That is not right.  I have heard of a case where a person who collected £200 stated that it did not matter whether she drew the money or not.  She stated that she was putting the money into an account for the children.  The unfortunate woman who was standing beside that lady did not have enough to buy essential food commodities for her family.</P>
      <P>Is it right when assessing a person's income for eligibility for health services that the amount paid in income tax or PRSI is not deductible?  Such a person may be disallowed full eligibility even though he may be only a few pounds over the limit.  I know of people who were refused such medical services and the mother had to pay for prescribed medicines. That situation could be rectified. The issue of not having tax deductible for the purpose of assessing a person's eligibility is unjust.  That matter should be looked into.  Is it right that there are people waiting for payments from the Department of Social Welfare?  Who can justify that?  Today five people who have been waiting for up to six weeks for payment of benefit from the Department made representations to me.  They have not been paid one penny and the local community welfare officer will not pay them a supplementary welfare allowance. That is not right.  The Department of Social Welfare must put their house in order and bring payments up to date so that people get the benefits they are lawfully entitled to within the time allowed, one week after they apply for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such things are unjust and it is no wonder that people are really poor.  The scene has changed a great deal in recent years and people cannot go into the local shop now and get food items on credit as they could some years ago.  Organisations such as the combat poverty agency or the new body being set up by the Government will not alter the real deprivation for tens of thousands of Irish families. Although laudable in themselves such groups make only minor reforms in isolated cases.  The only serious way to tackle poverty is by restructuring the <Col N="1188" /> economy to provide employment and housing for all our people.  The poor do not need charity; they need work.  Ireland is not a poor country.  We have great resources of wealth, land, minerals, hydrocarbons and industrial expertise. The banks and the financial institutions are making record profits while land speculators make millions overnight and millions are lost to public funds by tax evasion and VAT economy fiddles.  In those circumstances it is an insult to tell one million of our people who are living below the poverty line that their deprivation is their own fault.  What is needed is for our economy to be run for the benefit of our people rather than private profit for the small and greedy class of exploiters.  They are the policies of Sinn Fein the Workers Party and the growing support for our party shows that they are also the policies of an increasing proportion of the Irish working-class people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have waited for some time to speak on the problem of poverty and the role of the combat poverty agency and its new suggested alternative.  I welcome this opportunity this evening.  It is appropriate, at the beginning to straighten out a few distinctions.  Houses of Parliament have been talking about poverty for a long time.  Indeed, the subject of sociology, with which I have been associated for some years past, began with a concern for poverty.  The first poverty studies in Britain led originally to the passing of the old age pensions legislation which gave an old age pension for the first time. There is an uncanny similarity in the conduct of the public, Houses of Parliament and those who have power to deal with the problem of the poor.  The poor are discovered and then some suggestions are made about the problem of poverty. When explanations are perceived as insufficient, and policies fail, usually there is a fatalist moan that the poor you will always have with you.  The poor are <Col N="1189" /> forgotten again, to be discovered decades later.</P>
    <P>In the Irish case, we have gone exactly the road of the United States and of Britain.  In the sixties, <i>Fortune</i> magazine of the United States proudly, in a fit of hubris, in its editorial said: &ldquo;There are now no poor Americans.&rdquo;  Six months later, it discovered millions of poor Americans.  In 1964, the American war on poverty was declared.  It began the predictable stages of the cycle.  How many people were poor in the United States, the research scientists asked. These were measured and estimated. What then should we do about the problem of poverty within particularly urban areas?  Policies were devised and then, after a few years, when the programmes were being wound up, the suggestion was made &ldquo;Well, really you are talking about black families, and black people have different family relationships.  The role of the mother is different.  The child-rearing practices are different and you will always have a problem like that.  No matter how much money you spend on the poor, they will insist on being poor.</P>
    <P>Britain had a similar programme &mdash; a community development programme, very like the Government's suggestion. It, too, went through the cycle of discovering the poor, devising policies; the policies failed and the suggestion was made that poverty was something endemic in their lifestyle.  The poor made love differently, we were told, and the relationship of mothers to their children differed and so forth.  It is some features in the lifestyle of the poor themselves that are usually blamed.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a humane man and one to whom I have often paid tribute in this House in many respects.  However, the speech I have heard from him today is one which I would have preferred not to hear, this &ldquo;state of Irish affluence&rdquo; speech.  We went through the motions of discovering the poor.  In 1971, in Kilkenny a number of papers were read to the Conference on the Poor.  The Economic and Social Research Institute on 18 April 1972, decided to give a whole day to the poor and published the results of their deliberations in a broadsheet in <Col N="1190" /> October 1972, Research Priorities in Poverty Research in Ireland.  Thus it went on.  We formed a programme and implemented the programme.  The programme was, of course, attacked and I will turn in a few moments to the reasons why. Then, in 1980, the Government of the day scrapped the programme.  It was a waste of time.  And on we go, to wait a few more decades until it is time to take out the subject of poverty again.</P>
    <P>One of the speeches I heard made reference to the absence of new information since 1971.  I was one of the authors, in 1974, of the Labour Party's policy document &ldquo;Poverty in Ireland&rdquo;, three years after the date mentioned.  There is ample evidence available as far back as 1977 on the extent of poverty here, whether one is talking about farm incomes, categories, different kinds of amenities and so on. All the information is there.  There is no shortage of information.</P>
    <P>In 1974, speaking about the topic of poverty &mdash; and here I agree with the previous speaker &mdash; I said: &ldquo;It is impossible to talk about the problem of poverty unless you are willing to talk about the problem of inequality.  Inequality is the real base of poverty.&rdquo;  In a debate such as this it is time that we faced up to some fundamentals about our own attitude to the poor.  I read the Minister's speech last evening and listened to the speech this evening about the change which has taken place in rural Ireland, with its rural electrification, the children going to school, the people not emigrating but applying for grants and everyone moving about in greater conditions of prosperity. This is a bland description of an uncaring society for the most part &mdash; and the judgment is not mine.  The European Commission in studying and examining attitudes to poverty in Europe found a very interesting and schizophrenic fact about Irish attitudes to poverty.  We were high on compassion when we knew who the poor were and we had them there, kept poor, but we were low on justice.  Less than one person in six believed that the poor for example, were poor because of any inherent injustice in the system.  We were good on compassion, low on justice. That is the characteristic of all Government <Col N="1191" /> statements on this topic over the decades.</P>
    <P>If, for example, a Government, as we heard last evening, were to say &ldquo;We are the party that brought in this level of benefit, or increased this level of benefit, or extended it,&rdquo; and so on, what is the attitude that lurks behind that?  Can you truthfully say that if you use phraseology like that, you believe in a concept of rights within the society, that people are entitled, as a right, to a decent standard of housing, of employment, of education and so on?  It sounds better to be concessionary: we are the people who gave this, that or the other, identifying with the State.</P>
    <P>Now it is time for me to tell the reason why the combat poverty approach has been attacked over the years by people who were a mixture of ignorance and prejudice and had a deep commitment to inequality.  The combat poverty approach had three principles in its pilot project.  It set out to create the concept of rights within welfare.  It had a welfare rights project.  It set out to change the demeaning term &ldquo;home assistance&rdquo;.  Its most important point and the one which was to bring the wrath of different people on it &mdash; was its community action research projects.  These projects set about breaking dependency and in doing that, opposed inequality and drew attention to the extent of inequality within communities. Let us hear an answer to this question when we hear further discussions on this new agency&mdash;is it suggested that within communities at the moment there is equity and an attitude which can be extended to include everybody, that incorporates the notion of justice?  I would argue that, in the concept of community in Ireland there lie great power differences that systematically discriminate against the weak and the poor.  The action research projects opposed inequality and they also opposed brokerage &mdash; something I have written about elsewhere as gombeenism.  It suggested to people receiving benefits from the State that they were entitled to them as a matter of right.  It suggested there was something wrong with people playing the <Col N="1192" /> game of being political saints, intervening between the needs of the people and what the State was distributing in its meagre allotments in health, social welfare, and so on.  It drew the wrath of brokers who attacked the Community Action Project every month of every year it was in existence until, finally, they succeeded in getting it scrapped in 1980.  It was not accidental that that great party of brokerage, Fianna Fáil, were the party who wound up the Combat Poverty Scheme.</P>
    <P>Let me be generous in acknowledging the sources from which the attacks came on the pilot schemes.  It attacked bureaucracy.  It said there was something wrong with a society in which a woman would wheel a push car into a housing office, go to the counter and be told by some person he was sorry but that there was nothing for her.  That is no way in which a public official should deal with someone who has a real housing need. The action research projects, working within the community, upset politicians, bishops and bureaucrats.  These, in turn, responded as one might expect: they criticised the combat poverty programmes and asked if it was necessary to be stirring up all this trouble and drawing attention to the sources of oppression within bureaucracy, to inequality and the abuse of the relationship between the State and the individual that is brokerage.  Of course, you could do something neat. You could scream murder when the blood flows out under the door.  When the poorest people are in great distress, there is something comfortable about handing out this little bit and judging your contribution to the evolution of the Irish State by saying &ldquo;We gave a little more&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These were the sources of attack on the combat poverty programme from the very beginning.  My party will give this new agency a chance.  We welcome anything that will come to the relief of people who are suffering and in great want.  It is not our business to stand in the way of any constructive suggestions which will come forward, but it is appropriate for us to look at the basis of what were the guiding principles of our own approach. We never said that an approach towards <Col N="1193" /> assessing the nature of poverty or eliminating poverty was the same thing as measuring the degree of distress.  If you say you are in favour of distress, you put the State into some kind of relationship with the public of being a kind of alms giver.  Perhaps that is the relationship which some people in this House want. But those of us who always argued for an effective poverty programme said it must address the question of the distribution of power and resources in society and that it must be free to speak of the extent, the nature and the sources of inequality. That was why the community action projects had their particular character.  There is a cosiness to the relief of distress that is an unnecessary discomfort in approaching the problem of poverty.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate in this National Assembly that we face up to some more hyprocritical attitudes that are frequently expressed in the media in relation to the poor.  I have heard people saying there is no real poverty now.  What do people want by way of proof to show that there is poverty?  Of course, there is poverty across all the different categories, from old people living alone on fixed incomes to very large families living on inadequate diets and who cannot afford to attend school and to women who are breaking down because of the economic and social strain put on their households.  We do not want to recognise the extent of poverty today.  I have news for people who might hold such notions.  Even people who agree that there is poverty express a fashionable explanation that it is their own fault.  When I hear of this programme being placed under the Department of Health rather than under the Department of Social Welfare, I ask if this is an indication that poverty is some kind of a pathology or a sickness.  Poverty is about inequality and has to do with planning and the distribution of resources.  There are only two explanations of poverty to which I would like to draw attention.  One is that when you had met enough poor people you would find basic characteristics which were common in their situation and that after a while you would identify the reasons why these people made themselves poor.  That had a good long innings <Col N="1194" />&mdash; the stuff about helping people to pull themselves up from degrees of need. That is rhetoric.</P>
    <P>I defy anyone on the other side of the House to produce one scientific shred of evidence to show it is not the dominant opinion of sociologists and economists that poverty has to be approached by way of structural explanation.  You have to look at the structure of the economy to find out who is made wealthy, unaccountably, without paying just taxation, and who is made poor by the distribution both of income and of life chances and opportunities. It is that which is missing in these vague notions about community development, because that enables one to gloss over the inequalities of structure, power, privilege, wealth and of the unequal distribution of resources.  It enables one to escape altogether the question of dependency, and it is dependency that is important.  It is very interesting that the developing countries are telling us they want the aid given to them to be structured in a way that will not encourage dependency.  Here we are in our State with every penny we spend on the services suggesting the people feel dependent.  I am not saying there is anything wrong with people trying to cut through public representatives and bureaucracy, but it is time we asked ourselves what will people feel in their personal relation with the State when they have to have relationships mediated for them.  It is time we faced up to what that tells us about ourselves.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this question of explaining poverty there are a few other points I would like to make.  To all those who might be hankering after the idea that there are some people who have made themselves poor and keep themselves poor by the possession of some characteristics, the Economic and Social Research Institute have published research which shows that the poor are not a simple, homogenous population, that people move in and out of poverty through their life-cycle.  For example, some people are on a high disposable income for a certain time and, suddenly, because of large families, there is a considerable demand on their incomes and <Col N="1195" /> they become poor.  Perhaps, later on, when their families have moved away or assist the household income, they are not within the acute categories of the poor. But the poor are not a simple population. Poverty is something we do: it is something we create through inequality.</P>
    <P>In the time that is available to me I shall turn to another aspect of the question of poverty.  We can approach the question objectively through an anlysis of the sources of inequality within the economy and in society, but there is another side to poverty which is also important.  It is its attitudinal basis.  A report of a vague kind of research is being published which suggests that some people feel that if they have not a colour television set they are poor.  I am not interested in these vague indicators. What I am interested in is the very worst kind of poverty which extends a psychological attitude to the poor by the majority of the population.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves what is it that props up the basis of our ethical vision in society, a heavily privatised view of the world through which our emphasis is on personal security deriving from notions of private property, that looks at the poor as a problem when we should be able to include them in our vision as individuals who are entitled by right to participate equally in our society.  Let us be clear about that point on participation.</P>
    <P>Participation is crucial.  If you are unemployed you begin to lose levels of relationships with your family.  You have devalued relationships with your children. The level of relationship possibly moves on into medical problems.  It creates difficulties for you in relation to housing.  When we have a combination of these characteristics we compound the problem of poverty, and such a combination would be in a budget, for instance, which allocates millions for the building of prisons so that we can lock up the children of the poor.  We regard it as a great problem if some youngsters are involved in acts of vandalism and we have not got prisons to send them to.</P>
    <P>Surveys in the inner city areas will show <Col N="1196" /> us very clearly that 85 per cent of the children in one year had not the experience of either parent working consecutively for three years &mdash; unemployed for three to four years.  Instead of trying to understand the manner in which bad housing, unemployment, poor educational prospects, diminished diet, the whole question of nutrition, all hang together to remove these children from equal participation in society, our response is prison.  I remember a Deputy from that side of the House travelling to the other end of the country to have his photograph taken opening a children's prison, arms stretched wide beholding this great monument to ignorance and prejudice against approaching the question of children in trouble instead of intervening at the level of the source of the poverty that created the difficulties for those children, for their fathers and their mothers.</P>
    <P>That is what is important.  When we talk about being poor it is not about having shillings in your pocket; it is not even about being able to buy enough to eat or to pay your rent.  It is about your relationship to all parts of society.  Can we say truthfully that when people come before the institutions of the law that the poor can participate equally?  Of course they cannot, and their children cannot, and that is the difference involved in a community programmed against poverty as designed by people like Deputy Eileen Desmond and, before her, Deputy Cluskey. The project then designed would have been able to look at every facet of participation in society, and where there was diminished participation as a function of being poor, be it in relation to jobs, housing, to the consumption of health services, to social welfare, to the law, we could have examined every one of these.  There is one hell of a difference between such an approach and a lecture on self-help, on pulling yourself up and breaking the inherent goodness of the middle class to those who have unfortunately missed out.</P>
    <P>I find offensive these celebratory notions that everything is fine in the Irish community if only we could extend its shadow to include the problems of people <Col N="1197" /> who are poor.  It is rooted in inequality, in backwardness in political terms; it hangs on and stinks of brokerage.  It has all the old notions of giving out bits and pieces and telling people they should be happy.  It contains nothing to encourage respect for our people.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister do we want to change the whole relationship in regard to the participation of the poor in the labour exchanges.  If you go in to buy a house from an estate agent you can sit down in a plush chair, but if you go in to say your life is wrecked, perhaps suddenly, by your employer telling you that your job has gone, you have to stand up and wait outside a shutter.  Do we want to end all that in society?</P>
    <P>That would be doing something about the poor.  It is not about money but about equal participation in society.  For example, in relation to legal aid, and the whole question of the inadequacy which people feel when approaching the law, do we want to ask not how poor people will meet the demands of the legal profession but how the legal profession will meet the demands of the poor?  Do we want to face the medical profession and say to them that it is a gift to be able to train to heal and that it is time we want people who have taken these resources from society to use these facilities and this training to help the poor?</P>
    <P>That would be doing something about the poor, and it is not the difference between £1.6 million and £200,000.  It would be one hell of a difference because it would represent a revolution in thinking. For example, will we say that we want to change the whole thing, the structure, for instance, of our well-staffed and highly dedicated civil service and say that it is rather curious that the pattern of promotion within that civil service consists of moving back, up and away from access to the public?  Very often it is the most inexperienced people who get to pull the shutters to deal with the public.</P>
    <P>Do we want to change all that &mdash; change, for example, the question that it should be an offence under law for a public representative to say to anybody in need that he has got him a particular benefit?  If a person could present an <Col N="1198" /> affidavit to say that a representative said to him, &ldquo;I got you the pension&rdquo;, that should be an offence by the public representative. Do we want to change that? That would not cost money but it would mean changing attitudes if it meant looking at our fellow citizens as equals.  As long as we refuse to recognise that we will not do anything about poverty.</P>
    <P>I should like to respond to the theory that the previous programme was narrow and that this new agency will be wide and generous in its terms of reference.  Every facet of participation in society could have been covered if the existing agency had been allowed to succeed.  It would be inappropriate of me if I did not pay tribute to fine people like Sister Stanislaus Kennedy who put work into the previous pilot project and who were willing to serve in that agency.  I hope the work and commitment of Sister Stanislaus will be recognised by the people in charge of administering the new programme.</P>
    <P>That previous programme was wide and generous.  I hope that the philosophy that will inform the new agency will take some account of the wider perspectives, the wider aspects of poverty and that it will not become something like an accounting agency for the poor, something whereby we will say at the end of the year &ldquo;last year they got this; this year they got that; next year they will get a little more&rdquo;.  As long as we think like that it is our own minds that will be poor and it is not the poor who will suffer but ourselves and our political system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words and to welcome the Government's decision to establish the National Community Development Agency.  The former schemes were not just abolished or run off the face of the earth.  A select committee comprising people who held very senior posts in the former agency, the research officer from the IPA, the director of the former agency to combat poverty, officials of the various Departments, made a conscious decision when they said, following their pilot programmes and examinations, that three <Col N="1199" /> things were obvious: that widespread poverty existed; that it was largely the result of inequalities, and that to eliminate poverty structural change was necessary. They recognised the need to change the existing agency.  It was not that the previous scheme had totally failed; it was just that it was necessary to extend and to broaden the agencies and the statutory structures to combat poverty.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker who was eloquent as always and put forward his views in an excellent way seemed to indicate that no-one on this side of the House knew anything about poverty.  I know that it has been his deep interest over the years and I acknowledge and accept that there is a problem, that the reasons for those problems are high unemployment, lower than average incomes, high dependence on State benefits, poor health and poor housing.  All these matters are things that the Government must try to tackle.</P>
      <P>I am not trying to be contentious but I would say to the Deputy that some of the things that most hit the poor were brought in by the last Government.  I know that the Deputy would certainly not have supported them.  But to say now that extra money is not part of the cure would be totally wrong.  It is not just a matter of the money to set it up; it is a matter of essentials that affect the poor. It is not unfair of me to mention that clothing and food subsidies are important as well as increases in social welfare benefits. I know the previous speaker probably would not have supported their views, but he was a member of the party that introduced only a short time ago in this House measures that hit the poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a more constructive note, the whole idea of a new agency is to help communities.  I represent a constituency that has higher crime rates, poorer housing conditions and higher unemployment than most constituencies.  This Government, in a short time, have put forward &mdash; and have been criticised for doing so &mdash; emergency plans to cater for some of the areas that are in greatest need. Whether it is an anti-poverty agency or <Col N="1200" /> a poverty committee or the new agency, it is welcomed.  I would imagine that the Opposition parties would not be objecting to this and would not be voting against our amendments tonight.  It is not yet clear whether they will or not but I cannot see how they could because it seems a very constructive move, in line with the decisions that have already been made by the people involved, in line with what the people who are more deprived and who suffer these inequalities and the injustices of poor housing want.  It would be gross hypocrisy to turn around and vote against this agency.  I hope the last speaker who will be winding up for the Opposition parties will make it clear that this will have their wholehearted support.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the battle against poverty is a long, hard one.  A lot of money must be switched from the wealthy to try to improve to some extent the inequalities of our society.  A large step has been taken in recent months.  Large allocations of money are being put into these areas. Any criticism by the Opposition parties of this Government and their performance in the last few weeks would be grossly unfair.  Some of the points made by Deputy Higgins would indicate that he sees some merit in this.  When the legislation comes before the House he will again have an opportunity of putting forward his views.  I will support this Bill when it comes before the House.  We must work to make it an effective Bill that will operate in the best interests of those people who are deprived.</P>

      <P>At the opening of the debate last night I made the point that this subject is of very great relevance. The biggest problem we have is the poverty here which is a reflection on all of us who represent the people of this country.  It is a problem that has merited too little of our attention in the past.  We have had three hours of debate which has been very useful and we have heard some very interesting, thoughtful contributions such as the one we have just heard from my colleague, Deputy Higgins, who has a great personal involvement and commitment in this area.  The three hours have been well spent in debating this. <Col N="1201" /> I was glad to hear that the agency will be set up on a statutory basis and that it will have the influence and authority that a statutory agency would have.  It was difficult to be sure from the terms of reference read out to us by the Minister whether they were precisely the same as ours.  They seemed to be broadly in line with the terms of reference we had in mind for the agency that we were on the verge of setting up.  In this party we were deeply concerned to ensure that an agency of this sort would be set up as quickly as possible.  We are worried about the title of the agency but that point has been dealt with effectively by my colleague here this evening.  We do not know that the agency is of the kind that we want but we are prepared in the circumstances to give it a chance.  We are prepared to accept the amendment and we are hopeful that in accepting it we will have the assurance of the Minister that the legislation will be before the House very soon.</P>
      <P>It is important that there be no delay in bringing the legislation before the House.  The terms of the legislation are set out, the heads of the Bill are there already, since before the Minister came into office.  From listening to the Minister it seems that there is no difference other than the title.  That worries me slightly and gives me some slight reservations. But I will keep them in mind and live with them until we see the Bill which I hope will be before the House early in the next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Minister that we will be reading it line for line to make certain that it is the type of agency and has the kind of powers and has the terms of reference that we would want for an agency whose job is to combat poverty.  It is important that the staff of the agency be drawn from among the many people who have experience and a commitment in the area.  The chairperson that we had nominated for the agency we had in mind is the single person in this country who is most associated with the elimination of poverty.  It would certainly give me some confidence in the agency the Minister proposes to set up if I were again to see her as chairperson in an agency of the <Col N="1202" /> sort that she would think would allow her to act as chairperson for the next term.  I know there are many people whose commitment is beyond doubt and I sincerely hope that when the Minister is establishing the agency and setting up the board he will remember these people.  This is very important.  We are very committed in this area.</P>
    <P>We are prepared to accept the amendment on the understanding that this Bill will come before the House shortly.  It will give us an opportunity to examine it in greater detail.  The Minister's speech was short on the kind of detail we wanted. However, we are prepared to accept the amendment and sincerely hope that our fears will not be realised but that it will do the job it is set up to do.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this issue.  I heard the precise alarming details last night on the news that 150 workers in the Albatros Fertiliser Company in New Ross which produces 25 per cent of all fertiliser used by farmers, is to lay off within weeks &mdash; the word used was &ldquo;imminently&rdquo;&mdash; 150 people.  Not only that but 35 workers in Graves &amp; Company Limited under the Dockrell Group, which is a builders providers, is to lay off 35 workers.  To be honest we knew in the constituency that Albatros would lay off some workers but we did not know that it would be at this unprecedented level. We thought at most it would be 50-60 people.  Between these two lay-offs, the unemployment figure in New Ross will be pushed over 1,000.  This is unprecedented. The town of New Ross has a population of 5,000.  This will have an extraordinary effect not only on the companies and families involved but on all the service sectors, in the shops and on many other businesses in the town which depend on the incomes of these wage earners. <Col N="1203" /> The Minister can deny my figures if they are untrue but we are now talking about 20 per cent of the people being unemployed in the New Ross area.  It would not be fair to say that New Ross is the only area that has this problem.  I was speaking to the assistant regional director of the IDA today and the figures for each section of the county were released.  The up-to-date position for the county is: Wexford town.  2,063 unemployed Enniscorthy, 1,335 unemployed and Gorey, 716 unemployed.  I am glad to see Deputies Browne and Byrne present tonight. They were present with me at a public meeting in Gorey for the unemployed. The message which came across to us from that meeting was the despair and frustration of those who face the prospect of having no hope of getting a job.</P>
      <P>Albatros employed 360 people.  In a few weeks they will only employ 210 people.  I am told that the reason for this is rationalisation.  This brings me to my first request.  The company are transferring from manufacturing to blending and are going to automatic bagging.  If this is to be successful, it is essential that the IDA provide the necessary grants for this change in production and ensure that the remaining 210 jobs are safe.  I am told &mdash; perhaps the Minister can add further to this &mdash; that the reason for the lay-offs is due not only to a drop in the amount of fertiliser used by farmers, which is understandably due to their income crisis, but also to the intolerable situation of American imports and dumping of fertiliser. Any request made by Albatros to any of the State agencies would be modest in view of the type of subvention NET received from this and previous Governments. At present they are requesting £37 million.  I believe the request from Albatros would be in the region of £1 million.  I hope they will be treated as generously as NET.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the New Ross area the IDA own a 30-acre site.  This is prime land for development for advance factories and industrial development.  My second request is that this land should be serviced immediately. Money should be made available <Col N="1204" /> and an advance factory to give some hope to the unemployed should be provided for.  It should be of the order of 40,000 square feet.  This is not an unreasonable request.  The IDA have awaited sanction for this for a number of years and it is a matter of top priority in view of the pending situation.</P>
    <P>When speaking of New Ross it would be wrong not to make reference to the Ross Company Limited.  This company for many years provided the backbone of employment in New Ross.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am bound to accept your ruling and I will, but it would be wrong of me to mention Albatros Fertilisers Limited in isolation in view of the widespread unemployment in the New Ross area.  My next request to the Minister would be that, along with Wexford town and Gorey town, which the IDA allege have worse unemployment problems, New Ross town can be regarded as a disaster area and be put on the special priority list that the IDA have prepared for many counties.  That would ensure that this area would then be given the type of attention I am speaking about. Also I would be most grateful if the Minister would use his good offices to influence other aspects of Government policy such as the finance that must be available from the youth employment levy and ensure that some of this money would be directed to New Ross.  It would be remiss of me not to make that appeal to the Minister now. <Col N="1205" /> In summing up I make a number of direct requests in regard to each of which I hope the Minister in this short debate will give me some response.  I ask him to declare New Ross a priority area along with Wexford and Gorey, that he declare County Wexford a disaster area for unemployment, that the 30-acre site in New Ross be serviced and that an advance factory be sanctioned.  I ask for real action with the Ross company, that the grants requested by Albatros Fertilisers Limited be forthcoming and that the rescue division of the IDA do everything possible to assist other ailing companies in this area.</P>
      <P>In raising this matter in the House today I do not in any way wish to make it a party political issue.  The concern I have is felt by the other four Deputies from County Wexford and by everybody in that county.  I do not believe that the Minister and his Department can solve the unemployment problem in New Ross and in County Wexford but I would like finally the assurance that, to whatever extent money can solve the problem, that money will be forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as a former holder for a number of years of the office that you hold with such dignity at the moment, I appreciate and realise that I must keep strictly to the terms of the question before the House and that we are dealing completely with Albatros Fertilisers Limited and the loss of employment in that company.  Naturally there is the temptation to roam over the whole issue of unemployment in the Wexford constituency and certainly I would like to do that.  However, very briefly, I join with my colleague on the far side, Deputy Yates, and with the other Deputies for Wexford in making any appeal that we can make to the Minister here tonight to do everything in his power to try to remedy the position that has arisen in Albatros Fertilisers Limited. They are one of the major fertiliser companies in the country, probably the second largest of the four fertiliser companies that we have.  They are a subsidiary of a well known Dutch fertiliser company. They have been in New Ross for <Col N="1206" /> approximately 20 years and over that period they have given excellent employment in the town.  Their industrial relations are probably the best of any firm not alone of their kind but of any industrial concern in this country, and I must say that I, for one, was really shocked over the past two or three days when I heard that they were about to lay off 150 of their staff.  Most of the lay-offs, naturally as happens in most of those concerns, will be of unskilled workers in the firm.  That figure represents a very serious lay-off.  We had heard over recent weeks that Albatros Fertilisers Limited would be cutting down on their staff, that they would be laying off some 40 or 50 employees, but when the total number of lay-offs came to our attention it really was a shock to all of us.  We were aware that Albatros Fertilisers Limited, like most fertiliser companies in this country and indeed in the British Isles, were in serious financial trouble over the past four years. Their losses have gone from about a couple of hundred thousand a year to half a million and I think they were close on half a million in the first two months of the present year.  Albatros Fertilisers Limited naturally were faced with an impossible problem for which they had to produce some remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of large redundancy payments, State benefits and so on, I feel that those people to be laid off there, like employees to be laid off in other companies all over the country, will not feel the full effect of the laying off for quite some time, but I am really worried about the permanent loss to the town of New Ross of 150 jobs.  That is what really concerns us and is the immediate problem that arises there.  The loss to a small progressive town like New Ross, perhaps one of the most progressive towns in the south-east, is very serious.  I ask the Minister to discuss this matter with the IDA to see in the first instance if anything can be done to improve the position in Albatros Fertilisers Limited and to provide the necessary finance that will enable the company to restructure and improve their whole operation and possibly in the short term to take back quite a number of those people who are now being laid <Col N="1207" /> off.  We would look to agriculture and to the restoration of confidence in the agricultural sector to bring about a much greater purchase of fertilisers which would help this and other fertiliser firms. I have been told that the company have been in consultation with the IDA who have heard their case sympathetically and considered it.  I feel that the IDA would be prepared to do anything they can to help the company.</P>
    <P>Finally, I repeat that the permanent loss of 150 jobs in a town the size of New Ross is a very serious matter for that town.  I join in the appeal that has been made by Deputy Yates to the Minister and to the IDA to do everything in their power to substitute other jobs for those now being lost and do their very best in the first instance for Albatros Fertilisers Limited and, following that, for the town of New Ross itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I join in asking for all possible consideration for the town of New Ross because of the situation which arose yesterday.  It is well known that consultants have been involved with Albatros Fertilisers Limited during the past three or four months and the writing has been on the wall.  I have been in close contact with the company, and everybody, including the work force, was aware that some drastic measures were about to be taken.  The decision to bring in the consultants was made during the term of the Coalition Government and it was brought to their attention that 170 jobs were at risk.  We asked that jobs be provided in the area in the immediate future in order to compensate for this severe loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We asked that the IDA should acquire the site mentioned by Deputy Yates to build an advance factory.  What has happened? That 30-acre site has been let to a local farmer and is now ploughed up for tillage.  This was done during the last days of the Coalition Government.  The <Col N="1208" /> people of New Ross are very disappointed that no effort will be made in the near future to find jobs for these people. However, the buck rests on this side of the House now and we must encourage the Minister to provide new jobs for these 170 people.  The unemployment figure in the area is now over 1,000 and in my opinion it is a disaster area.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure a return to a reasonable employment position in New Ross.  The workforce there are very progressive, as are the local farmers.  I know he will look favourably on our appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. L. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my three colleagues in bringing to the Minister's attention the job losses in New Ross.  During the past 18 months or two years some 500 jobs have been lost and the unemployment situation there is unprecedented.</P>
      <P>Albatros Fertilisers Limited have enjoyed excellent labour relations.  It is unfortunate that the decline in farm incomes has meant that farmers have not been buying fertilisers.  We hope, however, in the months ahead to restore to Irish agriculture the confidence which has been lost.  This loss of confidence is responsible to a major degree for the job losses in this company.  Graves of New Ross are another farming-related company and they have let go a considerable number of men.</P>
      <P>The Minister might ask the IDA to look at Wexford county as a whole because it now has the worst unemployment figures in its history.  I would ask him to see what can be done to encourage industry in the four major towns and to consider making available the extra grants which have been given to counties in the west so that Wexford can get back on the road to progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern for people in New Ross who have been given notice of losing their jobs because I know the shock this can cause in an area where there is an unacceptably high level of unemployment.  Nevertheless, it was not unexpected and the difficulties in the fertiliser <Col N="1209" /> market have been well known for some time.  There has been a depressed demand for compound fertilisers due to the downturn in the agricultural sector. NET in Arklow have also been affected.</P>
      <P>The board of Albatros must be complimented for going as far as possible in their efforts to save the jobs of the total workforce.  It is worth recording that their losses to 31 December last were £3 million and it was clear that they had to restructure the company.  Already the IDA have had discussions with them regarding this restructuring and every aid necessary to secure the jobs of the remaining workforce will be forthcoming. The IDA are awaiting a submission from Albatros so that they can proceed with a restructuring package.</P>
      <P>I will take up the points raised by Deputies in relation to the situation in the Wexford area generally.  It is worth recording that in 1981 800 jobs were approved for County Wexford under the IDA's new industries scheme and 200 jobs were approved under the small industries scheme.  While Deputy Yates may say that Wexford is a disaster area, I am happy to tell him that action is being taken in the area.  The situation in that area was gloomy when his party were on this side of the House.  I know that Deputy Yates is reasonable in this respect, as are the other three Deputies who spoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He mentioned the youth employment subsidy scheme.  Certainly it will be looked at in relation to Albatros, but the fundamental problems of the company must also be considered in the restructuring process.  We have a situation of decreasing demand and pressure from imports, and even before my period in office the Department were monitoring the import of fertilisers.  We cannot take any action in regard to the import of fertilisers from countries within the EEC. Imports have also come from Sweden which is outside the EEC but they, too, have a special arrangement under EFTA rules and there is nothing much we can do in that situation.  The Swedish imports were inspected to see if they were below quality or if there was any way in which <Col N="1210" /> we could complain.  Unfortunately, efforts there were not successful.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates referred to dumping of fertilisers and asked what action can be taken.  Under the EEC rules if there is dumping and the industry can establish that it is taking place from America or anywhere else it is a matter for the industry to make the case in Brussels under the anti-dumping regulations.  We will assist them in that, but primarily it must come from the industry.</P>
    <P>There is considerable scope here, with the upturn in agriculture which we hope will come in the near future, for fertiliser production here.  Deputy Yates and the other Deputies will appreciate that a very small amount of fertiliser is being spread in recent years.  I saw reference made to imports and I want to record for the information of everybody here that imports as a percentage of the total sales of fertilisers have dropped from 18.2 per cent in 1977-78.  There is a declining market and there is a reduction in the percentage of imported fertilisers.  That is not relevant, but commentators have referred to it.</P>
    <P>The Deputies can take it from me that the IDA will be very active in that area and will intensify their efforts.  We will be looking at the 40,000 square feet factory proposition.  I heard Deputy Byrne say that this land has already been let.  If that is the case we will not be in a position to go in on it as quickly as Deputy Yates suggested.  Planning permission could be applied for as soon as the people who have the land leave it.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the need for employment in the New Ross area.  There is a buyer coming to New Ross to look at the shipyard there.  I hope the workers will be sensible and not try to take any action during his visit which might turn him away, as happened in the past.  Jobs are needed.  We want to preserve existing jobs.  Every effort will be made for New Ross and County Wexford if everybody adopts a sensible attitude.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 1 April 1982.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 31 December 1980 and was paid for 52 weeks from 3 January 1981, fourth day of incapacity, to 1 January 1982.  Payment ceased after that date as she had less than the required minimum of 156 paid contributions from date <Col N="1067" /> of her entry into insurance under the Social Welfare Acts in 1972 to the date of commencement of her illness to qualify her for further payment of benefit.</P>
      <P>In the meantime her entitlement to invalidity pension has been investigated and it has been established that she is in fact qualified for such pension.  An application form has been issued to her for completion and on its return arrangements will be made to pay invalidity pension to her from 2 January 1982.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 27 June 1981 to 11 July 1981 and from 3 November 1981 to 28 November 1981.  She was not entitled to payment on either claim as, according to the records of my Department, she had not the required minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution years.  She was requested to furnish details of her insurable employment in these years but in her reply indicated that she was only employed in 1980-81.  As the contributions paid in that year are not reckonable for benefit purposes in 1981, they did not serve to qualify her for payment on these claims.</P>
      <P>She again claimed benefit from 29 January 1982 and qualified for payment from 2 February 1982, fourth day on incapacity, on the basis of contributions paid in the 1980-81 contribution year which governs payment of disability benefit claims from 4 January 1982.  All disability benefit due to 27 March 1982, date of the latest medical evidence received, has been issued.</P>
      <P>Her title to pay-related benefit is being investigaged and payment due, if any, will issue on completion of inquiries.</P>

In order to determine whether the person concerned can be regarded as permanently incapable of work arrangements have been made to have her examined by a medical referee of my Department on 1 April 1982.

He did not indicate on either the claim form or the medical certificate that his incapacity was due to an accident at work.  My Department did not become aware of the fact that he contends that his incapacity was due to an occupational accident until September 1981. Inquiries as to the origin of the incapacity indicate that there is a conflict of evidence with the employers regarding the alleged accident and further investigation is necessary before a decision can be made on the entitlement to injury benefit.</P>

      <P>The arrangements for signing for unemployment payments are governed by regulations which require daily attendance on every working day in the case of persons living within two miles of the <Col N="1095" /> nearest employment exchange or branch employment office, and somewhat less frequent signing in the case of persons living more than two miles away.  Relaxations in the normal arrangements have been introduced from time to time where the situation in the local office did not allow of their full implementation, for instance, the size of the live register in the area and the accommodation available at the local office.  Daily signing, however, is in operartion in almost half of the Department's 124 local offices and is widespread throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The frequency of signing at local offices is kept under constant review and modified from time to time where circumstances so require.

      <P>There was delay in the payment of benefit in respect of the first week in March 1981 due to the non-receipt of a medical certificate but the cheque which issued following the receipt of the medical certificate dated 11 March 1981 included the amount due for that week.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit from 5 February 1974 to 19 September 1981.  Payment <Col N="1098" /> of benefit was disallowed after that date following examination by a medical referee of the Department who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work. He appealed against the decision to disallow payment and was again examined by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
      <P>The claim was then referred to an appeals officer who, following an oral hearing of the appeal, decided on 10 February 1982, that the claimant was incapable of work for the period 21 September 1981 to 10 November 1981, and was entitled to payment of disability benefit for that period.  In the meantime he had claimed unemployment benefit and following necessary inquiries as to amounts paid by way of unemployment benefit a cheque in payment of the arrears of disability benefit due was issued on 30 March 1982.</P>
      <P>He again claimed disability benefit on 16 February 1982 and all benefit due to 30 March 1982 has been paid.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to answer Questions Nos. 356, 357 and 358 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any suggestion that the accommodation at the venues in question is unsuitable for the High, Circuit or District Courts.  The extent to which courtrooms are used varies from year to year depending on the volume of business to be transacted.  The following information relates to the year ended 31 July 1981, except in the case of Tralee where the courts only returned to the newly restored courthouse in September 1981 after an absence of nine years.</P>
      <P>Cork courthouse has four courtrooms, two of which have jury rooms attached. The High Court sat there during 1980-81 on 55 days, the Circuit Court on 163 days and the District Court on 235 days.  On 91 of the 235 days there were, in fact, two simultaneous sittings of the District Court.  In addition the facilities were used on a total of 83 days for a variety of other purposes such as income tax appeals, inquests and employment appeals tribunal hearings.  As well as the courts offices the building also houses a Garda records office, the offices of the city and county sheriffs, a law library and the Cork Archives Council.</P>
      <P>In Limerick courthouse, which has two courtrooms, each with a jury room attached, the High Court sat on 19 days, the Circuit Court on 50 days and the District Court on 153 days.  The premises were also used on 38 other days for such purposes as income tax appeals, inquests, hearings of the employment appeals tribunal and meetings of Limerick Corporation. No part of the courthouse accommodation is allocated for non court-related purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two courtrooms in Ennis courthouse, one of which has a jury room attached to it.  During 1980-81 the High <Col N="1114" /> Court sat there on five days, the Circuit Court on 39 days and the District Court on 47 days.  The courtroom facilities were used on 16 other days for purposes such as Land Commission hearings, employment appeals tribunal hearings and inquests.  The courthouse is also used as its headquarters by Clare County Council which occupies for its own purposes all available accommodation not specifically allocated for court or court office use.</P>
    <P>The newly restored courthouse in Tralee has two courtrooms, one of which has a jury room attached.  The High Court has sat there only one day since the premises were opened in September last but it is expected to sit there again in October next.  The Circuit Court has sat there on 13 days so far in the current legal year and is expected to sit on a further 16 days before the end of July next.  The District Court has sat there on 20 days to date.  The facilities have not been used so far for non-court purposes but one day in May next has been allocated for income tax appeals.  None of the accommodation in the courthouse has been allocated for non court-related purposes.</P>

      <P>There have been no adjournments of such trials for the reason stated.  However, in the Michaelmas Term 1981 and the Hilary Term 1982 a number of chancery cases had to be put off because, although advance lists had been arranged on the usual basis of availability of two Chancery judges, a staffing difficulty produced the result that there was only one Registrar available to service the Chancery lists and consequently only one Chancery judge could sit.  This situation, which lasted from 3 November 1981 to 12 March 1982, resulted in the adjournment of 36 cases which had firm dates of hearing fixed and 48 cases which had provisional dates for hearing fixed.</P>

      <P>The population of the State, or of particular areas of the State, is not specifically taken into consideration in determining the need for appointing additional judges of the High Court, though, presumably, an increase in population would be reflected in an increase in the volume of business coming before the courts, which is the principal factor taken into account when assessing the need for the appointment of additional judges.  The total number of judges of the High Court now sitting is 15, including the President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the function of the President of the <Col N="1116" /> High Court to arrange the distribution and allocation of the business of the High Court and it can be taken that in doing so he takes into account the needs of particular areas.</P>

      <P>As a result of the working of the special purchase scheme provided by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978 some suggestions have been made for changes that might in some cases make for improvements in the scheme and I am having them examined. The matter raised in the first of the questions falls within this examination.</P>
      <P>As regards the second question, an extension of the life of the purchase scheme could not be effected by ministerial order but would require amending legislation.  While naturally some extension of its life cannot be ruled out, I do not think it is necessary to try to reach a conclusion on that point at this stage.  I believe that it is in the interests of ground rent tenants to avail themselves of the scheme &mdash; which has been found to be an excellent one &mdash; without too much delay and I consider that it would be undesirable to say anything which might have the effect of encouraging them to keep on deferring their applications.</P>
