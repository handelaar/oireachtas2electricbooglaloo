        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I should like to ask the Tánaiste if the Government would agree to make time available for a debate on the common fisheries policy in view of the fact that, at the end of this year, the derogation in favour of Irish fishermen will come to an end.  Unless there is a common fisheries policy, fishing will be permitted right into our shores.  This is a very serious matter for our fishermen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw attention to the fact that this is the fourth time in the past month when we have had a matter of development co-operation before the House and on each occasion the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is directly responsible for these matters, has not seen fit to grace the House with his presence.  Last week when we were dealing with a similar matter we were told the Minister had a commitment elsewhere and no doubt we will be told the same today.</P>
      <P>A number of important matters arise from this and I should like to be told something more than that the Minister has a commitment elsewhere, as we were told last week and the week before.  I want a commitment or some indication that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be prepared to come before the House to discuss matters on development co-operation. I want a clear indication on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect that arises from the non-appearance of the Minister on matters of this nature is the apparent decision of the Taoiseach not to appoint a Minister of State with responsibility for development co-operation.  Deputies will recall the Taoiseach's attitude in regard to this question some weeks ago when he suggested that such an appointment would be superfluous and supernumerary.  Is it an indication of the lack of consideration given to these matters by the Taoiseach that the Minister responsible in this area, or somebody from the Department of Foreign Affairs, is not here today?  We have a development co-operation programme and an official budget, to be raised by ourselves, of £26 million.  It seems to be a budget which is nobody's <Col N="744" /> baby because nobody at political or Government level seems to be taking the slightest interest in it.  There are substantial funds and major policy decisions to be taken but we have not got the Minister for Foreign Affairs to take the slightest interest in these matters.  Indeed, we have had the indication from the Taoiseach that there will not be a Minister of State to deal with this.</P>
    <P>This is an indictment of the present Government, this manner in which they are handling development co-operation, and I protest on behalf of my party that this very important area is being handled in this fashion.  Having registered that protest, I am glad the Government have decided to continue the decision of the last Government to appoint a Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries.  When I decided to establish the committee last year I took the view that it was of primary importance that Members of the House should be fully briefed on these issues, so that they could contribute to policy making in regard to overseas aid.  Of course the committee would have another function, that of development education, and that is of great importance because it is clear that many Members of the House have not had an opportunity to be briefed on development aid and therefore do not understand the type of work that is going on and the type of improvements that might be effected in that work.  It is my opinion that a joint committee consisting of 18 Members of both Houses will be of considerable benefit from the point of view of disseminating information, and this will be of considerable importance because both Houses will be familiarised with the position.</P>
    <P>The committee will be one step along the road towards development co-operation, but we want to ensure that in regard to development co-operation funds there will not be any political argument. I wish to see acceptance of the UN target but, more important, of the means and the timetable in regard to the achievement of that target.  In that respect it is clear there is absolute commitment by my party and I know it is fully supported by Labour.  From discussions <Col N="745" /> I have had with members of The Workers' Party there is commitment there in regard to the achievement of the UN target and the timetable in that regard.</P>
    <P>It will be somewhat of a problem to take development co-operation issues out of politics until we have a similar commitment from the Government.  In the past we had a vague commitment which ended up as no commitment at all. At all times there was an assurance that we would fully endorse the UN recommendation of. 7 per cent and aim to reach it.  Then the qualifications appeared &mdash;&ldquo;as soon as resources permit&rdquo; was the favourite and &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; was another such vague qualification.  What is lacking from the Government benches is a specific commitment such as that which was given and implemented by the last Government, that is, a phased increase year after year so that the UN target can be reached by a specific date. Our commitment was that it would be reached by the end of this decade.  The figure at present is abysmally low.</P>
    <P>When we came to office last June the figure was approximately .18 per cent. We provided in the Estimates to increase that to .23 per cent, the increase being from £18 million to £26.335 million.  We were committed to further increases each year of .05 per cent.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister for Foreign Affairs was here to give a similar commitment on behalf of the Government.  I have not seen the full statement he made to the advisory council last week but, as I understand it, the text of the statement indicated a vague possibility that there may be increases in the future.  We had the same old claptrap which avoided any specific commitment.  We want to know from the Government where we stand.  Is there a commitment or not?  If there is not, why not?  We have enough vague obfuscations from Fianna Fáil in this area and from now on we want specific answers to specific questions.  I do not expect the Minister who is taking the motion to be in a position to reply to this point.  It is not his area, no more than it was the responsibility of the Minister of State who handled the other development co-operation <Col N="746" /> issue which came before the House a few weeks ago.</P>
    <P>Speaking on behalf of my party and of all those interested in this issue, the time has come to demand a clear statement from the Government.  We will have to have a debate to clear up these issues.  As regards the question of money and the UN target and our commitment or lack of commitment to it, there are many other issues and policy matters to be discussed. When I was Minister of State with responsibility for development co-operation I decided it was necessary to have a Government White Paper which would outline where we are going and what exactly our policy was in relation to development co-operation.  We had a tradition, resulting from the fact that we did not have a bilateral aid programme until the first Coalition Government in the last decade, that any overseas aid went through multilateral agencies.  Despite the fact that we started the bilateral aid programme in 1974, up to last year the amount of funds made available to multilateral aid as opposed to bilateral aid was of the order of 70 per cent to multilateral and 30 per cent to bilateral.  I feel strongly that we should have more control over the funds being made available and should reverse this figure to some degree at least, if not totally.  We made a start in the 1982 Estimates by increasing the amount available for bilateral aid to 37 per cent.  I was struck by the figures which were available from Scandinavia and other countries who have a good record in this field.  The percentage of funds available for bilateral aid is 70 per cent, almost the reverse of our situation.</P>
    <P>That is a question which needs to be discussed and is an area where we need to have a policy.  Should we aim to switch our priorities to place greater emphasis on bilateral aid?  I do not think this is a political issue but it is important.  I feel we should be aiming towards greater emphasis on bilateral aid.  The survey carried out by the advisory council indicated that the majority of those who participated felt we should have a greater emphasis on bilateral aid as opposed to multilateral aid.  That is significant.  I was struck by the cost-effectiveness of the <Col N="747" /> projects carried on by the Department directly in the bilateral aid field and even more so by projects carried on by voluntary agencies, which are known in international terms as NGOs, non-governmental organisations.</P>
    <P>Part of our bilateral aid programme was by way of co-financing the operations of the voluntary agencies and, in some cases, of missionaries involved in development activities in overseas countries. There is another policy issue here which must be faced: to what extent can the funds available from official sources be increased to co-finance such work? Naturally the Government would not have any part to play in the funds being raised independently by voluntary bodies, which are quite significant.  Last year the figure was £6 million.  Co-financing is one of the policy issues which must be discussed.  I just mention these points, but there is a multitude of others which need to be discussed.</P>
    <P>I asked the advisory council to indicate by way of headings the type of questions we should address ourselves to in the context of drafting a White Paper.  The type of questions raised by the advisory council were such as surprised even myself, who thought I was getting to know something about the problems involved in this area. There are literally dozens of questions that must be faced from the point of view of having a clear policy on the part of this Government, indeed on the part of this country, in the area of development co-operation.</P>
    <P>That raises the point as to what is happening in regard to the White Paper and on which I want a clear answer from the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The preliminary work on the White Paper had been done.  But there remained a lot of further work to be done, including an invitation to different organisations and individuals involved to make submissions on what they felt might be included.  As far as I can ascertain the preliminary work done on the White Paper has been brought to a full stop.  Does this indicate that the present Government do not intend to carry on this work, that they are going to <Col N="748" /> allow policy issues in the development co-operation area either to drift totally or be decided on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis as they arise?  It would be very wrong to allow that happen.  It is something that must be prevented at all costs.  I would encourage the Government to continue the work on this White Paper because I must emphasise again that the ultimate aim must be not to have this White Paper as a Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or Labour one but rather one representing this country's policy on which, as far as possible, there should be all-party agreement on the manner in which the objectives are to be attained.  There should not be political divisions on questions arising within the context of this White Paper.  From that point of view I had hoped that the Joint Committee would have been of help in reaching an all-party concensus.</P>
    <P>It is proper for me to take this opportunity on behalf of the Opposition to pose the question: why is it that the work on this White Paper appears to have come to a full stop?  Is it occasioned by a total lack of interest on the part of the Government or is there some other reason?  One way or the other this House is entitled to know if this Government have stubbed the issue, attempted, as it were to throw the White Paper into the waste paper basket.  If that is the case then at least let them say so, then we would know where we stood.  That is another important aspect requiring the consideration of this House.  Again, we are not afforded that opportunity because the Minister responsible is not even present.</P>
    <P>I might now strike a more positive note by welcoming the fact that of all the advances made by the previous Government in this field at least this particular baby of mine has been saved and it appears that the Government intend to continue with our proposal to establish a Joint Committee.  That Joint Committee can play a major role in shaping our policy in the field of development co-operation. It will be important also that that committee have the backing and support of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or whoever will have responsibility for development co-operation, and that he be available to the committee from time <Col N="749" /> to time to discuss various aspects of policy. It will be important also that this Joint Committee &mdash; as I had intended &mdash; will have a real function to perform and on which people on the Opposition side of the House can make constructive proposals, not just Fine Gael or Labour proposals but proposals in the interest of the country generally and of having a better overseas aid policy.</P>
    <P>There is a further small point I must raise here, something that cannot be repeated too often and from which hopefully, by repetition, we might find some results flowing.  I believe that the procedure we have for establishing joint committees is utterly cumbersome.  We have before the House today an expediency motion.  My understanding is that there will have to be a similar expediency motion before the Seanad, followed by a further substantive motion in this House, followed by yet another in the Seanad. Surely we could devise a better system of quickly and effectively setting up joint committees without going through all this rigmarole.  I mention that merely in passing. But, bearing in mind the growing feeling in this House that there should be more committee work, we must devise a better system of getting that work under way.  That situation has been highlighted even more by the position with regard to the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EEC which, again because of the cumbersome steps that had to be taken by the last Government, ended up in that committee never having met during their term of office.  The delays entailed in that cumbersome procedure meant effectively, in that situation, that so much in the EEC field was allowed go past without receiving any consideration at all.  That is something that should be examined by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges with some changes being affected as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Generally, I welcome the appointment of this Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries.  So far it would appear that it is the only thing salvaged in this area from the progress made by the last Government, at least something for which we can be thankful. <Col N="750" /> I believe that this Joint Committee will prove to be an important and effective one.  I suggest that the present Government might consider the precedent set in regard to the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EEC by having the chairman of this latest committee appointed from the Opposition side.  That is merely a suggestion but it is something that appears to have worked well in regard to the EEC Joint Committee and might be a good headline to set at the initiation of this committee.  That our proposal to establish this latest Joint Committee has been salvaged is a step in the right direction.  While welcoming that fact I should say it is absolutely imperative that we avail of the opportunity to highlight the fact that this constitutes only one small advance made by the last Government which has been salvaged. That fact highlights all the more the need for the present Government to indicate clearly their policy in the whole area of development co-operation, indicate also their commitment or lack of commitment, and ensure that these issues are discussed in this House.</P>
    <P>I conclude with a final plea.  If the Minister for Foreign Affairs accepts responsibility for development co-operation we should be given a chance in the House to debate the matter.  He should give at least some slight indication of interest in this area if it is to be left with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As spokesman for Foreign Affairs for Labour I welcome the establishment of this committee.  I assure the Minister that our party will facilitate the establishment of the committee.  The remarks I have to make this morning will be brief but there are a couple of points which need to be made, one of which flows logically from Deputy O'Keeffe's speech.  It is important that we see development co-operation as an aspect of foreign policy.  If we fail to do so a number of things will suffer.  An impression is created that development co-operation is one aspect of the State's relationship to the developing countries that is discreet and separate from general issues of foreign policy.  Nothing could be further <Col N="751" /> from the truth.</P>
      <P>The issues of developing co-operation which involve complicated relationships on the theme of development with the developing world are closely connected with decisions that are taken by large institutions such as the international financial institutions and also connected with aspects of trade, for example, from members of the European Community. There is no way in which you can syphon off and present these as distinct issues of development co-operation from the central thrust of foreign policy.  It is appropriate to have the Minister for Foreign Affairs present in the Dáil when we are discussing relationships with the Third World.  I join with the Deputy in making this minor point that we are discussing within a very short space of time another issue of relationships with developing countries.  We discussed the international tin agreement last week and we are discussing these matters in the absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  This is unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I want to make, which deals with questions of omission, is that it is necessary for us to tease out the issues of development in a White Paper. I believe all of us gained when, for example, we had a motion in Seanad Éireann to discuss the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in Nairobi. That debate gave a tremendous impetus to interest in and concern for the developing world.  The publication of a White Paper would do the same.  I urge the Minister, who is present here this morning, to convey to his Cabinet colleague our feelings in this regard.  In discussing the establishment of this committee on development co-operation it is important that we record the origin of the idea.  It flowed originally from a seminar organised by CONGOOD through the co-operation of my predecessor as spokesman on Foreign Affairs among others, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, and Tony Brown. They decided it was necessary to take up the impetus of the Brandt Report, to have a public discussion.  One of the ideas which flowed from that seminar and that public discussion was the idea of a committee <Col N="752" /> on development co-operation.  I welcome the Government's intention of pursuing this idea.  I believe they will be thanked for it.</P>
    <P>The Brandt Report, or to give it its full title, the Independent Commission on International Development Issues under the chairmanship of Willi Brandt, which published its report early in 1980, drew attention to North-South differences.  I suppose it could be summarised rather crudely by saying it suggested the renegotiation of a new world economy order. When it was introduced here by way of public debate the debate was contributed to in large measure by a number of people who had very practical experience of working in developing countries.  We all gained from that debate.  The idea of the committee came out of that debate.  The committee was established but due to political events had not an opportunity of meeting during the last Administration. I feel that the committee which has been established now will have an amount of very important work to do.</P>
    <P>I believe the committee would be strengthened by having a White Paper.  I want to be as positive as I can in commenting on the terms of reference.  I mentioned in relation to the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities the difficulty in securing time for public debate in this House for a report on the work of the committee.  There have been about four occasions on which over 90 reports were discussed.  When this new committee meet and discuss important issues they may have difficulty in securing time for debate in the general assembly of the Dáil.  I believe one of the ways that interest can be secured, that Dáil time can be secured and the interest of elected Members secured, is by the publication of a White Paper.  The White Paper would tease out options and models for development co-operation, it would set out the terms of the debate that the committee could look at earlier on and, in so far as the Members of the House would have participated in that debate, they would have a greater interest in the reports of the committee.</P>
    <P>The point I stress about the integral <Col N="753" /> relationship of the development co-operation to foreign policy is perhaps the most important point.  I am very worried about our participation in international financial institutions.  I know our influence is very limited but those international financial institutions are often not assisting the countries who are in the greatest economic difficulties.  I would like the Minister for Foreign Affairs to be present to hear me state for the record that I believe this country should be doing much more about breaking the economic blockade and the international financial blockade of Nicaragua where there has been such an immense loss of life recently and where, long before the present disaster, there has been tremendous opposition mounted by international capital abroad to the new Nicaraguan state.  I would have welcomed a statement from the Minister about his efforts.  I would like to thank the people in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the people in the different State agencies who met the first mission from that country who visited Ireland a few weeks ago.  That is just an example of how one's participation at the most general level in international institutions affects and casts a shadow over development aid.</P>
    <P>I would like to say something positive and, I hope, cheerful in relation to this matter at a time when we need to say positive and cheerful things about some aspects of politics.  It is encouraging to have in the House this morning the establishment of this committee.  It is encouraging to sense, I hope, a consensus that we will, independently of our domestic conditions, make progress towards achieving the United Nations target figure for aid to the developing countries. It is in striking contrast to, for example, the attitudes of institutions in other countries.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting that the Trade Policy Research Centre, under the chairmanship of Lord McFadzean, Dean of Kelvinside, published last autumn a report commenting on the Brandt Report under the title of &ldquo;Global Strategy for Growth&rdquo;.  Their response to the Brandt Report was to suggest that it did not take into account sufficiently the contribution <Col N="754" /> that private enterprise had to make in the developing countries.  When the report comes on later to discuss the international monetary institutions on page 84 it says:</P>
    <P>The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have their part to play in the transfer of resources and must be permitted enough flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances, but in the process the central role of these institutions must not be forgotten.  In the case of the IMF, that role is to remain as a watchdog over the shortterm economic policies of their clients and as an impartial source of advice.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that neither institution should be allowed to become either just another bank or a provider of very easy money for developing countries.  This comes from one of the most important research bodies in British industry.  It is their response to the Brandt Report. They go on to say that if private investment is to take place in developing countries there must be security for such investment.</P>
    <P>I note much more generosity in this House by way of response to the Brandt Report, to the formation of this committee and to the work they will do.  This indicates clearly a difference between two separate groups of people in two different isles.  I note a growing consciousness of our interconnections with the whole world and of our responsibilities for aid.</P>
    <P>In relation to assistance for those other countries one hears less nowadays of the old argument that money given for works abroad, either through voluntary bodies or to bodies assisted by Government, was in competition with aidable projects at home.  This represents progress.  Our generosity in giving to issues abroad indicates a compassion and that is important.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the recent emphasis of regarding the work of the Third World as work undertaken in the pursuit of justice. This is helpful.  It is a logical development that we express solidarity with the suffering world.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me on the occasion of the establishment of this committee <Col N="755" /> not to pay tribute to the many people who have worked in the different agencies concerned with the Third World. From speaking to people who have worked abroad in this capacity I have noticed the generosity of vision they have.  This clearly demonstrates the point that in the work of development co-operation one is not giving anything away, that one is not creating something in the developing countries but that the growth that takes place at home, in a community and among the workers and among the people who assist them, is often much greater than the objective tangible relief that is conveyed to countries that need it. It is important, when those of us who speak as socialists use the word &ldquo;development,&rdquo; to explain what we have in mind. We are not speaking about a relationship between a country that is in possession of greater goods with one that is backward. When we use the word &ldquo;development&rdquo; we are expressing our belief in the universality of responsibility and the universality of life and we accept the responsibility of affording countries that very often have been kept backward as a function of market development by the developed economies an opportunity of finding a new place in the world arena.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on the record that it was a matter of much personal gratification to me to note the interest Deputy O'Keeffe took in this area while he was in office.  He was harnessing a new interest that had grown up among our people but it would be a matter of great disappointment now if the momentum which flowed on from the very positive reaction which the Brandt Report and reports of other development agencies have got here, were to be lost.  The establishment of this committee will help but there are two missing links.  One is the publication of a White Paper in which would be laid down the principles of our relationship. It is crucially important that this be done and equally it is important to integrate in foreign policies centrally this aspect of relationship with the developing countries.</P>

      <P>I shall not delay the <Col N="756" /> House very long.  I am extremely pleased that this committee is being established. The legislation is long overdue but I am confident that the 18 Oireachtas members will be able to play a very important part in continuing to forge our relations with these other countries.  We have a very good reputation as a nation in terms of the efforts of many individuals and of voluntary groups in helping Third World countries but it is good that we are putting these efforts on a more secure footing. The committee will have the opportunity of bringing before the House issues which are of vital importance to the world in which we live.  We speak often of many mundane matters but sometimes because we become involved in much bureaucracy and with many matters that are important in their own right, we forget the plight of many people in the world. There are so many people who suffer from starvation, from malnutrition that there is need for continuous and immediate aid response to help them to survive. There is need also for short- and medium-term planning to allow people to become somewhat self sufficient.  If this committee deal with aspects such as this &mdash; and I am confident that they will &mdash; and continue to focus attention through dáil Éireann on these issues, the people will continue to respond as they have always responded to such matters.</P>
      <P>Much progress has been made down through the years in our official development assistance programme.  The opportunity to discuss Third World development and our involvement with the developing countries has arisen only in past years as a result of the various food aid protocol programmes and so on. The reports that will come from this committee will afford an opportunity for further discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity of paying tribute to the many voluntary organisations who have played a very important part in helping people in the Third World to survive and in continuing, by their efforts, to offer hope to the peoples of these countries.  I have spoken with many of those who have helped in this way. They do not regard their work as a personal giving but as an aspect of a mutual <Col N="757" /> sharing and as an approach by which they are giving of themselves for the benefit of others.</P>
    <P>I trust that the new committee will get off the ground soon.  I am pleased that neither a member of the Government nor a Minister of State can be a member of the committee.  It is vital for the successful work of the committee that those who will offer to serve on it will participate fully so that issues can be dealt with expeditiously and attention focussed on the many aspects that plague this world.</P>
    <P>There is a general acceptance of north-south mutual interdependence. This is something that must be developed further through many channels.  In this respect the committee will be a very useful forum.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the welcome that has been given to this committee and I endorse the remarks of Deputy Higgins when he indicated that this country, through the Government and through the voluntary agencies, is expressing solidarity with the suffering of the Third World. The scale of the problem of the Third World was highlighted in the Brandt Report.  The cure pointed to by the Brandt Report in terms of structural changes in the Third World posed problems of a huge magnitude.  The Brandt Report was also quite horrifying in the evidence it produced of the numbers of people who are dying from hunger and disease.  The most urgent role for a country like ours, whose resources may be substantial in internal terms but as far as the scale of the problem is concerned are comparatively insignificant, is to ensure that the money is spent directly and immediately on easing the positive human suffering of those afflicted by chronic malnutrition, hunger and disease which is curable.  We should make a positive decision and commitment to ensure that our comparatively scarce funds are spent directly on relieving hunger and suffering.  We should discontinue deluding ourselves that our comparative pittance is going to have any effect whatever in bringing about political or social changes of the type which the Brandt <Col N="758" /> Report states are ultimately necessary to cure the suffering of the Third World.  It is a delusion if we think we can do that. Too much Government money and money collected by the voluntary agencies is being spent in fostering that delusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government and private agencies should think about how best to spend Irish money in the Third World.  We are agreed that the Third World is suffering and we should ensure that our contributions go directly in ease of that human physical suffering.  I received in the post recently a document from Trocaire entitled Development Co-operation Programme. What that report has to say is opposite to the debate and to what I have just said.  Trocaire is an institution established by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to collect money on a systematic and comprehensive basis.  The main sources of collection are the schoolchildren of the country and their parents.  I have no doubt that the contributors to that fund are by and large under the impression that they are contributing to a fund which will go directly to the relief of hunger and disease.  Yet, when one looks through the list of projects funded by the pennies collected from the school children of Ireland one sees some extraordinary final destinations for those pennies.  The money is distributed, or one might say, dissipated through Africa, Asia, Oceania, Latin America, and, to use a phrase in the report, &ldquo;international&rdquo;.  The report also states that the money is also distributed by sector.  Reading down the various sectors one sees that there is leadership training, adult education, health and welfare, agricultural and rural development, programmes to promote human rights and combat racism, community organisation, small industries and co-operatives, programmes for the advancement of women, development structures, research and evaluation, regional development funds and small project funds, the Kampuchea reconstruction programme, and the emergency relief programme. They total £2.37 million.  That amount of money is available for distribution after deducting 20 per cent of the collection for development education in <Col N="759" /> Ireland.  Whatever the Trocaire bureaucracy costs on top of that I do not know but there is £2.37 million for distribution to express, as Deputy Higgins so eloquently put it, our solidarity with the suffering of the Third World.  That is a sentiment with which I concur.  We should express that solidarity but I believe it can be best expressed by directly aiding those who are dying and suffering from hunger and those who are enduring the ravages of curable diseases which have been eliminated from this part of the world.</P>
    <P>When we look at that distribution by sector we see that of the £2.37 million only £382,000 is going for health, agricultural and rural development.  Where does the remainder of that money go?  It goes to a myriad of quasi-social political projects and I should like to indicate some examples.  In Brazil we spend £10,000 for legal aid and £7,000 to make an educational film for landless peasants. The school children in my parish who contributed to the Trócaire box did not have any idea that their money would end up making an educational film for landless peasants in Brazil.  We sent £8,400 for awareness raising and leadership training programmes for women in Brazil and yet in Tanzania we spent £5,715 on the provision of water supply, less than we spent on making an educational film for landless peasants in Brazil and less than we spent on making an educational film on ethnic minorities at a cost of £7,000 in the Honduras.  How crazy can one get when one is frittering and dissipating scarce resources on projects such as those when there are people dying of hunger and disease?</P>
    <P>If the Catholic Hierarchy want to promote social and political revolution in the Third World and effect the changes the Brandt Report says are necessary in order to bring about the justice in the Third World that we all want to see, they should say so.  They should tell the people specifically that they are collecting for that purpose and that the money is going for that purpose and not for the relief of hunger and disease.  I feel strongly when I read the horrifying figures in the Brandt <Col N="760" /> Report of the scale of famine, human suffering and disease that every penny we can produce for the Third World should be spent directly in alleviating those problems.  I urge that institutions such as Trócaire, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Exchequer, who are spending money on these social-politico objectives, divert every penny directly towards combating disease and easing hunger.  It would be far more economical if all this was done through an efficient agency.  We have two such efficient agencies, Gorta and Concern.  If the money that is available for expressing our solidarity with the suffering in the Third World was given to those practical people it would have far more effect than being dissipated and frittered on some of the nonsense I see in the Trócaire report.</P>

      <P>Táim buíoch do na Teachtaí, ceathrar ar fad, a labhairt ar an ábhar seo ar an moladh atá roimh an Teach.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with the points made by Deputy O'Keeffe.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs regrets that he cannot be present.  From the tone of what Deputy O'Keeffe said one gathers that he thought the Minister for Foreign Affairs was deliberately absenting himself from the House, but surely the Deputy realises more than most that it is the nature of his Ministry that he would be absent more often than most Ministers from the House and in being absent is about his business.  There is no indication at all of the deep commitment that the Minister has for the problems covered by the motion before the House to set up this committee.  I assure the House that the Minister's commitment is as strong as the Deputy's own commitment is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe welcomed the setting up of the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries.  He mentioned a White Paper in this context.  I will not make any comment on that.  I think a parliamentary question was answered recently&mdash;I speak as one less wise in this matter&mdash;indicating the Minister's present position on it.  All the requests that the Deputy made will be conveyed to the <Col N="761" /> Minister.  They are on the record of the House anyway, but I personally will convey to the Minister what Deputy O'Keeffe had to say in the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins also welcomed the expediency motion and mentioned the desirability of a White Paper.  I am sure both Deputies will have an opportunity to hear the Minister on that in the future. The whole matter of how it was important to regard this as an aspect of foreign policy was raised by Deputy Higgins.  No doubt both in the committee and in this House when the proceedings of the committee are being discussed there will be an opportunity to discuss all these matters and in particular what has flowed from the very extensive Brandt Report which can give rise to a clash of ideologies. This should make the operations of the committee all the more interesting. Deputy Higgins paid a tribute to those who work in developing countries and was insistent that we should take cognisance of the fact that this international activity is an aspect of foreign policy not unconnected with fiscal and financial policies, and I am sure they will all provide an opportunity for serious debate in the committee and in the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy also welcomed the expediency motion and I know he was doing this as one who matched his present words with former deeds in the Third World or in the south part of the country of the north-south axis which was mentioned in the Brandt Report.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney took the subject on to a somewhat different plane and I do not intend to make any comment on his analysis of where the money went for a certain private organisation, but again I am sure he has given food for thought to everybody in the House who is interested and that that thought will issue in debate later.</P>

      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Go léifear an Bille an Dara hUair.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The present authorised share capital of the B &amp; I Company is £35 million, which is held in its entirety by the Minister for Finance.  The main purpose of the Bill is to increase the company's authorised share capital by £25 million and to enable the Minister for Finance to take up this amount in additional shares in the company. The Bill also provides for an increase of £25 million in the maximum amount of the company's borrowings which can be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will no doubt be aware, the B &amp; I Company are at present encountering severe financial difficulties. The company recorded losses of £1.1 million in 1979 and £2.8 million in 1980 and, notwithstanding an increase in turnover from £66 million in 1980 to £73 million in 1981, the loss in 1981 jumped to £7.54 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trading conditions in which the B &amp; I have had to operate in recent years have been very difficult, given the depressed environment for tourism, the general economic recession and serious cost inflation.  The B &amp; I's difficulties have been aggravated by a significant increase in borrowings and lease obligations resulting from an expansion of capacity from 1978 onwards.  Severe competition on the Irish Sea, which has forced the B &amp; I to hold down fares, has also seriously undermined the company's financial position.  Industrial disputes both here and in the UK have cost the <Col N="763" /> company a total of £5.9 million in the years 1979 to 1981 inclusive.  In 1981 alone disruption of one kind or another, many of which disruptions were completely outside the company's control, cost the B &amp; I in terms of net loss £2.6 million.</P>
    <P>The Government's reason for purchasing the B &amp; I from private UK interests in 1965 was basically the strategic one of having an Irish presence on the Irish Sea which would at the same time operate on a strictly commercial basis.  Following the take-over the company began an investment programme to replace old ships, to introduce multi-purpose car ferries and to mechanise cargo handling facilities and since then the B &amp; I have made a major contribution to the development of modern and efficient transport services between this country and the UK.</P>
    <P>In 1977, the B &amp; I decided on a large-scale investment programme.  This programme was designed to meet the requirements of the company in the light of technological changes and expected growth in trade and tourism.  The total cost to the company of the investment programme, which has since been completed, was approximately £72 million. The main investments were: the replacement of two older car ferries; the introduction of the Jetfoil on the Liverpool route; the termination of the Dublin-Liverpool Lo-Lo service, which was being scaled down since 1975, and the introduction of a Ro-Ro service to Fleetwood; the introduction of a new short-sea service on the Rosslare-Pembroke route.</P>
    <P>The new car ferries, m.v. <i>Connacht</i> and m.v. <i>Leinster</i> were built in Verolme Cork Dockyard at a cost of IR£40 million. The orders for these vessels enabled employment to be maintained at Verolme during a period of very severe world-wide difficulties in the shipbuilding industry from 1977 to 1981, and brought the volume of business given by the B &amp; I to Verolme since 1967 to almost IR£60 million.  It was recognised at the time that, because of subsidies and incentives available to other shipyards, these ships could have been built abroad at significantly <Col N="764" /> lower cost.  The Government, therefore, provided additional share capital to the company, £20 million in all, to partially finance the construction cost of the ships involved.</P>
    <P>A further part of the B &amp; I investment programme was concerned with the development of a short-sea route strategy. This had been a long-standing ambition of the company because of the inherent advantages associated with more intensive asset utilisation and lower unit costs &mdash; a factor which had become even more important with the increase in oil prices in the seventies.</P>
    <P>The introduction in 1980 of the company's short-sea route, Rosslare-Pembroke, involved the B &amp; I in capital development commitments for the construction of a ferry terminal at Pembroke in South Wales.  The introduction of its other short-sea route, Dublin-Holyhead, earlier this year did not involve additional capital expenditure due to a change in Sealink policy regarding the use of its port facilities at Holyhead by other operators.</P>
    <P>The current problems of the B &amp; I are due in large measure to the fact that the increased traffic and revenue budgeted for under the 1977 plan failed to materialise. In this situation the servicing of new debt has become a burden beyond the company's capacity to carry unaided. The company's financial charges have increased from £2.6 million in 1979 to £7.6 million in 1981.  At the end of 1981, the company had term loans of the order of £27 million as well as obligations relating to leased assets.  The share capital of £35 million has been eroded by accumulated losses of over £12 million.  Furthermore, the company's cash flow position has deteriorated to the extent that an injection of equity working capital is now urgently required.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I have been pursuing a policy of retrenchment in an effort to reduce costs and improve their trading position. The company's strategy for 1982 is based, <i>inter alia,</i> on a rationalisation of services including the introduction of the Dublin-Holyhead service and a corresponding reduction in frequency on the Dublin-Liverpool route.  The company <Col N="765" /> have also terminated the jetfoil service and are investigating the possibility of a sale or long-term charter.</P>
    <P>The jetfoil operation was conceived as a fast and comfortable passenger operation, linking as it did two major conurbations, Dublin and Liverpool.  It was unfortunate that the introduction of the service coincided with a contraction in passenger demand on the Irish Sea and that the viability of the service could not have been tested in more favourable circumstances.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the company's rationalisation measures has been the reorganisation of services on the southern corridor, including the servicing of the Cork-Pembroke and the Rosslare-Pembroke routes with one instead of two vessels.  This move will help the company's finances to the extent that the surplus vessel is available for disposal and that there will be greater utilisation of the vessel on the combined route.  I am very concerned about the deterioration in the B &amp; I's financial performance and I am glad to note, therefore, the steps which the company are taking to rationalise their operations with a view to achieving economies and improving productivity. I am in full agreement with the B &amp; I Board on the need for these economy measures, which should help to improve the B &amp; I's trading results and create a more stable employment environment for the company's employees.</P>
    <P>I should mention that a detailed examination of the affairs of the B &amp; I is being carried out under the aegis of my Department.  The examination has revealed that the company cannot continue to operate without immediate assistance from the Exchequer.  In the circumstances, the Government have agreed that the Minister for Finance should take up additional equity in the B &amp; I, not exceeding £8.7 million, during 1982.  This should help to relieve somewhat the heavy burden of financial charges which represent a substantial proportion of the company's overall loss.</P>
    <P>While it will be necessary to disburse a portion of these funds as soon as the legislation has been passed to enable the company to meet their immediate obligations <Col N="766" /> arising from the seasonal down-turn in their cash flow, I will be expecting the company to demonstrate to me that satisfactory progress has been made in the rationalisation of their operations before I shall agree to recommend any further disbursements from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In recommending this Bill to the House, I am conscious of the representations made both to myself and my predecessor by representatives of B &amp; I workers setting out the company's record of good industrial relations and highlighting their participation in the affairs of the company over the years.  I feel sure that the general body of workers in the B &amp; I are as committed as the board of the B &amp; I to restoring the company to profitability as soon as possible.  I expect the company to make substantial strides towards this end in the current year.</P>
    <P>I have recently discussed with the chairman of the B &amp; I the progress which has been made to date towards the implementation of the company's cost reduction measures and the need for further measures.  He has advised me that while there has been broad acceptance among employees of the action which is being taken there are still some difficulties to be overcome.  It is essential that these difficulties be overcome quickly in the longer-term interests of job security.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to comment on the present unofficial dispute which has led to the suspension of all B &amp; I services, beyond saying that industrial disputes of any kind are not in the long-term interests of either the B &amp; I or their workers.  I should like to express my regrets, however, to the travelling public who, as the holiday weekend approaches, are seriously inconvenienced by the effects of the dispute.</P>
    <P>Because of the Government's general concern about the deterioration in the B &amp; I's position, I have arranged that the company's performance will be continuously monitored by my Department during the remainder of 1982 so as to ensure that the Government will be kept fully informed of the progress of the company towards the elimination of losses <Col N="767" /> and a return to profitability.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I concede that the company was originally purchased by the State in the mid-sixties primarily for strategic reasons. The Minister's predecessor, the late Erskine Childers, told the Dáil in March 1965 that the company was being purchased to achieve a greater measure of Irish participation and control over cross-Channel transport, to ensure that the development of these services would be in line with Irish interests and that the B &amp; I services would not be allowed to run down or disappear in a situation of declining profitability.  Undoubtedly the objective of achieving a greater measure of Irish participation and control over <Col N="768" /> cross-Channel transport has been gained. It is true to say that the development of these services by the B &amp; I has been in line with Irish interests.</P>
    <P>The third objective, to ensure that the services will not be allowed to be run down or disappear in a situation of declining profitability, has been maintained but, on the situation as hinted at by the Minister, something drastic will be required if the services are not to disappear in a situation of declining profitability. The loss for 1981 at £7.54 million is very substantial but the Minister has been very short on information to the House as to the precise make-up of that loss.  He did not say how much of it is due to the unfortunate capital position of the company and how much is due to operating losses in the various sectors of the company. We would have to know that information. We would also have to be given some information as to how the company's capital structure will be geared following the changes that will be a consequence of this Bill.  I do not think we will get that information.</P>
    <P>There is the statement that the Government propose to put up immediately £8.7 million but we do not know how that will be paid over to the company, in what stages and in what sums.  If part of the company's difficulty is a wrongly structured balance sheet, a crazy gearing to provide the extra equity in dribs and drabs, as the Minister has implied, will not rectify that basic defect in the company's structure.  It is unfair to the company in the sense that they will never get out of the financial mine they are in unless capital is put on a proper footing.  It is also less than a vote of confidence in the board of management of the company.</P>
    <P>One has to read between the lines but it would appear that rationalisation measures are in train.  This House is being asked to vote an extra £35 million by way of capital for this company and also to provide for increases in the borrowing levels and it should be told in broad detail, subject to any constraints of commercial confidentiality, the rationalisation measures being proposed.  We <Col N="769" /> should know what progress has been made towards achieving them, what difficulties are being encountered in achieving them totally, whether there is an end date for their final implementation and, above all, we should know what difference the rationalisation measures will make to this year's and the following years bottom line.  None of that information is in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to increase substantially the equity of the company making provision for further substantial borrowing, although what advantage that will be to a company already seriously over-borrowed I do not know.  We are being asked to do all these things without any information about the future of the company.  Will they be able to achieve the objectives set down by the late Erskine Childers in 1965, to ensure that B &amp; I would not be allowed to be run down or the services disappear in a situation of declining profitability?  We seem to be getting perilously close to that situation, only being saved from it by this injection of further equity.  It is proposed to give the equity in dribs and drabs.  We have no figures from the Minister to show us what effect this will have on the balance sheet or on the rationalisation measures being proposed.  Neither have we been told if the company have any surplus assets they can dispose of other than one vessel.  There is no indication of what the vessel is likely to realise, whether there are any surplus shore-based assets that could be disposed of and what they are likely to fetch.  There is much information that we need.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I think we are stuck with the strategic necessity to maintain this line.  It is particularly clear this weekend that the other carrier on the Irish Sea does not, as of now, have the capacity to take all the traffic that is available at a peak time.  It is very unfortunate that there should be an unofficial dispute taking place in this company at the moment because the one bright spot in the operations of the company over the years has been the loyalty and co-operation of the staff in pulling their weight. The staff have willingly co-operated in new work practices, they have postponed <Col N="770" /> wage increases and they have contributed towards the cost of buying new vessels. Generally the level of co-operation and participation by staff in the affairs of the company has been one of the most heartening features in the whole industrial relations scene.  It is a pity that this good record is now being spoiled by an unofficial strike at this critical weekend.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the parlous state of the company, I would be so bold as to suggest that unofficial strikers cannot be conceded to.  I think we have to realise that the rule of law must apply in industrial relations as well as anywhere else. Otherwise chaos results.  I presume there is a rule of law in a set of procedures for solving disputes.  Perhaps they do not solve them as quickly and as satisfactorily as the people concerned would like, but they have to put up with that in order to ensure that the rule of law is maintained and that chaos is avoided.  The solution of this dispute cannot take place outside normal negotiating procedures.</P>
    <P>I suppose the particular timing for this weekend was deliberately chosen.  It is an unfortunate aspect that very often unofficial disputes are timed to cause the maximum public inconvenience to the innocent travellers in the hope that their protest will exert some sort of blackmail on the Government or the employers to concede the claim.  It is reprehensible that a good record is being so seriously damaged this weekend.  I hope that on reflection the people concerned, who I am quite sure are as loyal to their company as any other section of employees, will see the damage they are doing to the company.</P>
    <P>I suppose, because it is a semi-State company and the Exchequer is available and there is this strategic consideration of maintaining an Irish presence on the Irish Sea, that there is probably an underlying belief at all levels in this company that they will be bailed out irrespective of everything.  I suppose that belief is well-founded.  I do not wish to imply that the company have been careless or negligent in running their affairs.  Whether they have always had the wisdom that hindsight would give us must be questionable. The venture into the jetfoil was <Col N="771" /> particularly unfortunate.</P>
    <P>They have been unlucky too in so far as there have been two critical factors for a number of years which have been adversely affecting their trading position. The first was the fare war that was operating on the Irish Sea.  That depressed income very severely.  The consumer benefited. But in so far as the consumer is an Irish taxpayer he is paying one way or the other in the long run.  I would be glad to hear from the Minister when he is replying if that difficulty which the company has experienced over the last few years has been eased or is disappearing and a more rational approach to fare structures by all the carriers on the Irish Sea is now being adopted.  I presume that it would have to be so as a consequence of the admission of B &amp; I to Holyhead.  It would be crazy beyond words if two companies serving essentially the same route were to be engaged in a fare war with each other.  I presume that commonsense has now prevailed in that regard.  Again we would like to know what effect that is going to have on the overall position of the company.</P>
    <P>The other area in which the company has suffered has been the drop in tourist traffic from Great Britain to this country. There will always be a certain amount of passenger traffic coming from Great Britain consisting of people of Irish birth or Irish descent coming back here for social or business reasons.  That amount of traffic is guaranteed.  But that amount of traffic by itself is not sufficient to generate the type of revenue that is needed to make this a profitable enterprise.  B &amp; I, as much as Sealink, also need the pure tourist traffic and unfortunately that type of traffic has been scare in the last number of years.  I am seriously apprehensive that this year it will be virtually nil due entirely to the recent outbursts of Anglophobia that have been manifested here, I regret to say, by the Government institutionally in their approach to the Falklands dispute and the position in the EEC and specifically by the quite horrifying demonstration of that by the Minister for Defence.  That Anglophobia is a real disease here at the moment.  It is a great pity <Col N="772" /> that we cannot grow up and rid ourselves of it.  There have been various manifestations of it that I might advert to.  One of these is in the news broadcasts in Radio Éireann.  In the English bulletins the islands in the South Atlantic are referred to as the Falkland Islands.  In the Irish bulletins they are referred to as the Malvinas: perhaps Malvinas is the Gaelic for Falklands.  But it is a symptom.  Likewise over the last two days we heard repeated bulletins that the Argentines claim that a British carrier has been sunk.  One gets the impression that this is being repeated with a certain amount of satisfaction and the very categoric denials of the British Ministry of Defence were not given the same prominence at all.  We are in the grip of a dangerous bout of Anglophobia and that is having severe commercial repercussions on the whole economy and specifically on the fortunes of B &amp; I and will have very severe repercussions for B &amp; I in this year.  So in regard to the two main factors that contribute to the difficulties, the crazy price structure and the downturn in traffic, we will be glad to hear from the Minister his views as to what B &amp; I think their position is going to be this year.  Have they rationalised the fare structure with Sealink?  How do they see the tourist traffic, as opposed to the Irish people coming back on their holidays or on business?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, on this side of the House we see the need for this Bill.  We see the need for increased share capital of B &amp; I. But we are disappointed that the Minister has not given us more specific figures in relation to how the B &amp; I capital structure is composed, how the equity ratio will be after this injection of capital, how it is at the moment, what proportion of revenue has now to go on interest payments. We are disappointed that he has not given us projections for the next few years.  In particular I find it puzzling that, in regard to a company that appears to be in a seriously imbalanced capital position and is having to meet huge debt repayments, the Minister proposes to take up the additional equity on the basis of not more than £8.7 million in 1982, and there is the implication that it will only be disbursed in dribs and drabs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> The Minister says that he will be expecting the company to demonstrate that satisfactory progress has been made in the rationalisation of its operations before he agrees to recommend any further disbursements from the equity. There is a certain logic about that, but he should know in advance if the gearing of the company is such that it is a contributing factor to its present difficulties and decide to put that right and have confidence in the board of management of the company to implement the rationalisation measures proposed.  We do not know what they are, but I am afraid this Bill is a vote of no confidence by the Minister in the B &amp; I company.  I do not think that the company deserves that vote of no confidence.  There were possibly management decisions that one would criticise with hindsight, principally the jetfoil decision.  Clearly that was a dubious decision from day one.  But many of the management decisions which were made and which resulted in a large amount of capital spending over the last number of years were made on certain assumptions which I think were reasonable assumptions, and all management decisions have to be made on assumptions.  As it turned out they were unlucky in that the upturn in passenger traffic did not occur and once that did not occur there was a fatal loss of revenue and, because of the improper gearing of the balance sheet, all that compounded into ever-growing losses with the result that this year we have a loss of £7.54 million.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give us an indication of the board's prognostications for 1982, 1983, 1984 and so on, and a full financial statement of the position of this company.  I suppose it is illogical to say that we agree to this measure without having that information.  But I will be illogical and say that we do agree to it because, for strategic reasons, we have to have an Irish presence on the Irish Sea.  What we all want to achieve is that that presence will be operated in the most efficient manner possible and achieve, as near as possible, a commercial result.  We cannot assess that from the Minister's speech so to some extent we are giving <Col N="774" /> assent to a pig in a poke.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us is really an indication of the sad state of affairs regarding trade on the Irish Sea, be it freight or tourism.  This is affecting us right across the board.  It makes pathetic reading.  It indicates our madness, if I may use such a strong word, with regard to our relations with Britain.  As a nation we seem to be hell bent on self-destruction, and I am afraid the B &amp; I's troubles are just the tip of the iceberg.</P>
      <P>In today's national newspapers &mdash;<i>The Irish Times</i> in particular &mdash; we see evidence of that economic madness, never mind the injustices and the vindictiveness of our policies in recent times or the rights and wrongs which should be paramount. This Bill involves money and commerce. We are adopting a most stupid short-sighted policy and we are paying for it dearly and in years to come we will pay much more dearly.</P>
      <P>We all know that the decline in the B &amp; I's fortunes stemmed largely from the decline in the British tourist trade through the seventies.  If that state of affairs continues in the eighties, I can see a significant decline in the volume of trade between the two countries.  The front pages of today's <i>Irish Times</i> and <i>Irish Independent</i> illustrates the difficulties people in industry are experiencing at present and which they fear they will experience to a greater degree in the years ahead.  If our commerce is affected to such an extent, the fortunes of B &amp; I can only continue to worsen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Monday I made a statement which, it could be said, had a bearing on today's Bill.  Part of it was picked up by the <i>Cork Examiner</i> and Bord Fáilte, but they misinterpreted what I had to say maybe because I did not express myself too clearly.  I endeavoured to say that the British tourist trade has virtually disappeared, only a small trickle remains, that it will probably decrease even further and that we confuse the different types of tourist.  I was trying to distinguish between the Irish emigrant and his family who return home on annual holidays &mdash; that trade will continue &mdash; and the British tourist who has no ethnic connection with <Col N="775" /> Ireland.  In my view the latter trade is infinitesimal.  To get a true reading of the situation we should distinguish between these two groups.  It is a sad state of affairs, but it is a fact that that trade is getting smaller.  That is having a major effect on our economy and on our tourist trade and we must try to rectify the position.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Cooney said, our stand on the Falkland Islands has not done anything to help; it has worsened the position. In answer to a parliamentary question tabled yesterday I was told the latest figures available show there are 955,000 people in Britain who were born in Ireland and over two million people who have one or both Irish parents.  That indicates a vast potential for our tourist trade and at present constitutes the bulk of those coming here on holidays from Britain.  Of that I am convinced.  As I said, it would be most interesting to get a true picture of the number of tourists coming here who have no ethnic connection, but I am afraid the number is getting smaller every day.  This is contributing to the present financial difficulties being experienced by B &amp; I.  I do not see how B &amp; I can get out of the wood.</P>
    <P>This is essentially a Bill to prop up that company and we will have to continue to prop them up as time goes on.  We will have to spend enormous sums helping them because they cannot be viable in the present political and economic climate that exists between the two countries. The Minister spoke about the depressed environment for tourism and the general economic recession, and I would add the poor relations that exist between the two countries as a source of further decline in the tourist trade.</P>
    <P>I asked the Government to get sense, to wake up to reality and to do something to stop this madness which is alienating us from the British public and which is costing us dearly.  We cannot afford this type of financial loss.  I am asking for fair play.  Surely that is not too much to ask. At the risk of being classified as pro-British, I say it is time to call a halt to our stupid policies.  We seem to be vindictive, <Col N="776" /> hateful, bloodthirsty and wishing evil on the British race.</P>
    <P>The first specific instance visible to this House are the losses being incurred by B &amp; I and the need for vast sums of money to keep this company in operation. We are entitled to be independent, we are a sovereign State.  However, we must not lose sight of the fact that we are dependent on our neighbours and must co-exist in a convivial atmosphere if this country is to prosper.  That is not now the case.  It is imperative that we get it across to every sector of the British public that we do not wish them evil, that they are our friends and that we want to see them coming back to this country in large numbers, as was the case in the fifties and particularly in the sixties, the boom years in tourism.  The type of action which we have taken lately has alienated those friends.  I think I have made my point.</P>

      <P>Let sanity come back to this island and particularly into the political scene.  Let us stop this madness.  I am not sure what Deputy Cooney means by anglophobia, but suspect that I know.  I think it is the alienation of which I have spoken.  This is something we can do without.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I apologise to the Minister for not being present for his opening speech and also to Deputy Cooney. This was due to a misunderstanding on my part and no discourtesy was intended.  I will be very brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the injection of new capital into the B &amp; I.  We could have anticipated the difficulties which that company have been experiencing over a period of time, taking into account what has been happening in this island in the last 12 years and the obvious effect which that would have upon our tourist trade.  That trade <Col N="777" /> has been affected in differing degrees, depending on the violence to which the people of this Island have been subjected, particularly from the Provisional IRA.  That, combined with our inflation rate and some of the less desirable features of our tourist industry which were referred to last week by the Minister for Health, undoubtedly would affect a company such as the B &amp; I and make it necessary and desirable to have this type of capital injection.</P>
    <P>We very often hear of State and semi-State bodies here, a number of which have been the subject of very severe criticism. We very seldom hear of the number of State and semi-State bodies which have made a very considerable contribution to our economy and to job creation. The difficulties being experienced by B &amp; I and other companies because of a combination of factors, some of which I have outlined, will no doubt be used as another vehicle by those who are against expansion of the State sector, to wit the State sector.  A great, co-ordinated attempt at attacking State enterprise is being made by people with vested interests. Every time a difficulty arises in that sector it is pounced upon to try to spread the smear over the whole sector.  They deliberately lose sight of the fact that there are very many successful State enterprises and semi-State enterprises here.  These have contributed to our economy and, in particular, have provided employment, which the private sector over the decades have failed to provide.</P>
    <P>Unlike those who attack the State and semi-State sectors, I am not attacking the private sector for their failure.  In fairness to them, it is not their business &mdash; and they have stated so publicly &mdash; to provide employment.  They have stated publicly that their business is to provide profits. They did that in 1977 when the former Deputy Jack Lynch as Taoiseach introduced a very substantial packet of incentives for the private sector, stating that he then expected them to go ahead and provide a number of jobs.  Almost simultaneously with putting the packet of incentives into their back pockets, they <Col N="778" /> stated publicly that they were not going to be saddled with job creation, that that was not their function.  They said that was the function of the State and the Government, that their function was to make profits.  We have no comeback on the private sector.  They quite clearly stated their position.  If that is their attitude, however, as they publicly stated, who will provide employment, except the public sector?  What has been the response of this Government to the public sector and job creation?  To abolish the National Development Corporation which to me was the only real vehicle for job creation, not solely in the public sector but also in co-operation, where feasible and desirable, with the public and private sectors together.</P>
    <P>I will not delay the Minister, but another aspect has been raised in this debate, particularly by Deputy Deasy.  It is the effect of the Government's stand on the situation in the South Atlantic and the question of sanctions imposed against Argentina by the EEC.  Deputy Deasy and other prominent Members of his party have criticised the Government for their position; I do not.  I support the Government in that decision.  I criticise them for the way they handled the situation in the initial stages.  It was disgraceful. I am convinced the decision was made in the Taoiseach's office and that the Department of Foreign Affairs were not alerted to it and could not take the necessary steps to put across our point of view in the various embassies around the world.  We gave the British a major opportunity to bash the Irish on that decision.  That decision was the correct decision for a neutral country to take. What motivated the Taoiseach in taking that decision is a separate question.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cluskey is an experienced Member of this House.  I know he will accept from me that we cannot hold the Minister for Transport responsible for the Taoiseach's motivation.  I understand that reference has been made to this aspect.  The Chair will be tolerant of superficial references to it but I hope we will not delve too deeply into the Falklands situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that fully, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I will try to relate my remarks directly to the B &amp; I Company and its effects on travel by B &amp; I, by other steamship companies or by air, from Great Britain to this country. Inflation and criticisms about accommodation, restaurants and other aspects of the tourist trade have had their effect. The way the British press have played up our assertion of our independence and neutrality has had a direct bearing on the difficulties facing B &amp; I.</P>
      <P>The speeches being made by members of the Fine Gael Party who have been most vocal on this matter are not in the best interests of this country, while they may score great party political points. They are giving credibility to the most scurrilous statements in the British press about our being anti-British and about our motivations for what we are doing.  It is suggested that our sole motivation is to get the boot in to the British.  The speeches emanating from the Fine Gael Party are giving credibility to that.  They are doing us no service and they are doing no service to our neutrality.</P>
      <P>About 18 months ago in this House I spoke about neutrality.  At that time my fear was that Irish neutrality was being bartered by the then Fianna Fáil Government in exchange for some commitment on Northern Ireland.  Whatever motivated him, now that the Taoiseach has come out and made it clear before the world that not only are we neutral but we will assert that neutrality, he is entitled to support.  It is in the best interests of this country that we should support him. Of course, in the situation existing in the South Atlantic and with Britain's involvement there, we will have to pay some price for our neutrality.  It is worth paying that price.  If the type of speeches we have been hearing against it and against the decision on the sanctions are to continue, the price will be higher for the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the injection of capital into the B &amp; I Company.  I do not want to go in any detail into the other problem because I do not know what is happening to try to solve it.  As we all know, there <Col N="780" /> are no B &amp; I sailings at the moment because of the strike.  The Minister and his colleagues in Government should make every effort to have sailings resumed as soon as possible in the interests of the tourist trade and of trade in general between this country and the UK.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputies who contributed to the debate for their various suggestions.  Apropos the word &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo; used in my speech, Deputy Cooney asked what steps towards rationalisation were being taken. I can reply briefly by referring to the statement made by the Chairman of B &amp; I at the annual general meeting. The commencement of a daily short sea service between Dublin and Holyhead in conjunction with a Dublin-Liverpool service.  That is a change, cutting down the service to Liverpool by half and introducing the new short distance service between Dublin and Holyhead. The operation of a fork service from Pembroke servicing Cork and Rosslare with one ship; groupage services in Cork were stopped and whatever assets are there are to be sold; the suspension of the jetfoil service which, as the House knows, has already taken place.  I regret very much that had to happen because I used that service and I found it very comfortable, fast and convenient.  I am very sorry, indeed, that it was not successful. Deputy Cooney cast doubts on the wisdom of it from the beginning but, if the three factors mentioned, namely, the decline in the number of tourists, the general recession and the steep increase in the price of fuel, had not combined against it at the wrong time, the original decision would be seen in a different light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another part of the rationalisation is the sale of one car ferry released by the operation of the fork service in the Cork, Rosslare, Pembroke context.  There is an overall reduction of B &amp; I personnel by about 200.  Unfortunately this is also part of the rationalisation programme.  A pay pause was negotiated and about 90 per cent of the staff accepted it.  I should like <Col N="781" /> to say how much in agreement I am with all those people who have praised the staff of B &amp; I over the years for their involvement in the company's affairs and for their total commitment to the success of the B &amp; I Company.</P>
    <P>They are among the most important elements in the rationalisation programme about which Deputy Cooney inquired.  Paying tribute to the staff also calls for a mention of the unofficial strike which is unfortunate and which I hope will end quickly and will not unduly damage the trade in a very sensitive period of the year.  Deputy Cluskey when speaking also referred to this.  The analysis of the drop in the tourist business which affects the activities of B &amp; I given both by Deputy Cooney and Deputy Cluskey were a little too simplistic in my opinion. The House must realise that there is an international depression, that trade, which is also involved in B &amp; I activities, and tourism in general are in decline, and that there is a general international depression both of which facts impact upon the earnings of the B &amp; I company. I reject very strongly any implication that there is anglophobia either in the Government or outside it.  In my own constituency and area over many years a very important section of our tourist industry comes for coarse fishing and they are coming again this year on bookings they made last year and they came last year on bookings which they made in the year before.  I hope to see that continue. They do not all read the cheaper propagandistic journals that try to persuade them not to come here or that they are not welcome here.  In the strongest words I can command I reject any implication of anglophobia either in Government policy or in the country generally.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House, far from being a vote of no confidence in the B &amp; I company is a vote of confidence in it, in its chairman, its board and its staff. The House will agree as will those who spoke in the debate that the company has an excellent record.  In part at least this has been admitted and praise has been duly given by Deputy Cooney and other speakers.  The idea that there should be an Irish presence in the Irish Sea was <Col N="782" /> emphasised by Deputy Cooney.  In consultation with B &amp; I we have brought this Bill before the House in aid of B &amp; I because operating their rationalised programme and with the aid they are now getting, the prognostications called for are reasonably optimistic.  To use the word with which Deputy Cooney finished, it is the objective that it should be a commercial proposition.  The chairman, the chief executive and members of the board would agree to that wholeheartedly. In no way would they want to be in a position of an ailing company looking for annual subventions from the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney asked me for the debt-equity ratio which I give as 1:2.68. If the corrective measure had not been taken the board would have substantial losses throughout 1983 and 1984.  If we get full implementation of the corrective measures, and provided there are no unforeseen circumstances &mdash; we all know these can arise &mdash; the company should steadily improve its position.  We are hopeful that it will be in a profitmaking situation by 1985.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy practically chose the one theme of our relations with the UK. I have dealt with that briefly.  He was much more gloomy and pessimistic than any other speaker and spoke of the B &amp; I troubles being only the tip of the iceberg.  I do not think I can accept that.  I am not so naive as to believe that we will not continue to have troubles in trade and tourism but I do not think they will be any greater than in any other country in similar circumstances.  Neither do I believe that there is any significant impact being made on them by the policy being pursued by the Government in the South Atlantic.  With the passage of time both the British Government and the British people will see that the Irish Government in the stance it had taken in support of the United Nations resolution was helpful towards Great Britain and had no other intention.</P>
    <P>I know the importance of any ethnic trade for the operation of companies such as B &amp; I.  From talking to the chairman and chief executive of the company I know that they are determined that they should pay their way.  If there is one thing <Col N="783" /> at the core of their philosophy it is that. This is very heartening.  They are first to admit that the international recession in both trade and tourism &mdash; I emphasise trade as much as tourism although it was not mentioned at all &mdash; will cause trouble. Deputy Deasy said he feared he might be dubbed a West Briton for the attítude he was taking or the words he was saying; I do not think anybody would place him as a Briton either east or west.  I am sure that as he examines events as they unfold he will come to a more balanced opinion about Government policy and its effect on tourism and the activities of the B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey welcomed the new capital injection and went on to extol the role of the State sector in our economy.  I find myself in total agreement with him. I think the people who examine the activities of various State or semi-State companies in the Joint Oireachtas Committee would be in general agreement with the philosophy that Deputy Cluskey outlined. Only a couple of days ago I had the privilege of addressing the 21st anniversary meeting of Bord Bainne, a very successful State company which has a serious role to play in my own constituency and area.  I mentioned that to indicate that I am in agreement with the Deputy when he says that there is no reason to attack the State sector or for any concerted philosophical attack on the State sector.  That is not to say that there is not a role for the Government in keeping under very close surveillance the activities of the semi-State bodies in the interests of the country and the taxpayer.  He went on to deal with deficiencies in private industry and what semi-State and private bodies got by way of incentives.  Both have their contribution to make and I do not think that all private industrialists would subscribe to the belief that they had no other role in society than that of making profit.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that Deputy Cluskey is of the opinion that the Government, in support of Resolution 502 of the United Nations, were following the right line.  I agree with him that the effect on tourism and business for our companies will not <Col N="784" /> be what some people say it will.  I appeal to everyone in public life to refrain from bringing about the result which has been forecast in speeches.  There are some balanced newspapers in the UK who would not dream of trying to dissuade people from using the B &amp; I, or from buying the best agricultural produce available to them in their market but there are others which will do so.  We have had experience of that in the past.  It is as well if this House assures visitors who will use the B &amp; I that they are very welcome.  I have met some of them in my own constituency and they know they are very welcome.  It is our business to see that however they travel and wherever they stay, they will get value second to none.  I thank the House for the contribution to the debate on Second Stage.  I want to say to Deputy Cluskey that we shall make every effort to see that there is no disruption of services in the B &amp; I.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I gave the background to the different approaches that have been taken towards combating poverty in Ireland.  Today I propose to address myself briefly to some of the precise proposals in this Bill.  My remarks last evening could be summarised by saying that I felt the theme of inequality, which I believe to be rooted in the structures of society, was important and should not be neglected.  I said studies of poverty in other societies have foundered on the basis of having neglected that and that approaches to poverty in the absence of the pursuit of inequality as a theme led <Col N="785" /> one to develop piecemeal approaches which might, in time, be abandoned.  The volume of the poor is measured by any one of a number of indicators that I discussed. It could increase and this might be followed by a retreat from the problem altogether.  I had given the history of our own approach from the seventies on.</P>
      <P>I want to concentrate this morning on some precise applied matters which arise because of the Bill.  I was discussing last evening the programme when the pilot schemes were in progress and which was addressed to the issue of establishing projects on welfare rights.  I asked if this emphasis would be retained within the agency when it is established.  It did valuable work in changing the nature of home assistance and seeking to destroy the poor law ethos that surrounded the old forms of assistance, both in their nature and in the terms of delivery.  Will this be extended?</P>
      <P>There were a number of action projects which I believe established real linkages between the agencies of the State and individuals in remote communities and got past some of the more debilitating aspects of brokerage.  I would like to think that this work can continue.  The agency will have my support and that of my Party.  The Bill will have our good wishes and support on Second Stage in its statement of principles.  Where we disagree is in regard to the strength of the terms of reference.  Section 4 of the Bill, which lays out the terms of reference quite precisely, should be strengthened. If one addresses oneself to the missing theme of inequality, one will allow the later sections of the Bill to have much more force in terms of research which can be carried out, the reports which can be prepared and the policies which can flow in turn from the reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are questions I want to raise concerning different sections of the Bill. I read the Minister's speech with interest. While I disagree very little with the theme of his speech or any of the principles, there is a fundamental disagreement concerning the existing structure of community and whether its existing structure can produce, through simple voluntary effort, a redress in the experience of our <Col N="786" /> poor, as I described them last evening.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that my view is not an academic one.  It is based on the reports of social workers over the years, on review of programmes in other countries and is not something which is abstract. There is a very large amount of literature available in this area.  American programmes have been written about, the British experience has been assessed and there is no reason why we should have to go down the paths of the mistakes of other countries.  I hope we do not.  The question of specifics does arise.  Perhaps the Minister might want to qualify his emphasis on self-help which has been given such a central part in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill and in the Minister's own speech.  It is a term that is much abused.  I know the Minister said that people would not be left solely reliant on themselves but would draw on other community resources.  It is important that the concept be distanced from the notion that one is poor as a result of individual characteristics or the inability to pursue strategies of development which are under the control of the individual. I spoke at length last evening on how one aspect of poverty feeds into another, reducing the individual in terms of capacity to participate within society and to take decisions or even to avail of the resources of the State.  If one does not define self-help and community development, a question arises in relation to section 18.</P>
    <P>The National Social Service Board are to be abolished and their staff resources are to be moved to the new agency.  If this is so, are we clear on what the National Social Service Board staff and resources will be doing within the new agency?  Will they be abandoning the functions they already had and taking on new functions or are the functions of the National Social Service Board to be continued as they are now within the new agency?</P>
    <P>When staff and functions are being moved around, I suggest there should have been consultations before the Bill was drafted.  There are other matters about this legislation that worry me. Many sections of the Bill refer to the <Col N="787" /> promotion of greater understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty, but the mechanisms by which this greater understanding is to be achieved are not very explicit.  I may be told that this is a matter for the agency, and I welcome the idea of the agency establishing this, and it will have our support.</P>
    <P>Section 17 deals with the disclosure of information by a member or an employee or a consultant adviser to the agency, and the section prescribes a maximum penalty of £500 on summary conviction.  I am worried about the publication of research and the difficulties that might arise in regard to information that would be the property of the agency and to which the agency might acquire property rights, such as the discussion that arose in regard to patents which is now a European issue, and information of research results into public activity and employment.  In an area like this it is important that there would be maximum freedom to publish research because experience shared in these matters is of importance not only to ourselves but to other countries.</P>
    <P>There is the matter of the proscription on being a candidate for either House of the Oireachtas.  This is archaic.  Anybody who, for example, has had experience within the agency and decides to participate in public life deserves encouragement rather than difficulty.  If somebody who has worked and has had experience of administering poverty programmes decides to take a step into the realm of public debate he is to be commended. This century demands encouragement for such people rather than discouragement. This has been the experience in the US.  It is interesting that people of the stature of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who wrote one of the major works on the poor in the US, is now a distinguished member of the Legislature there.  Who knows the type of people we might encourage?</P>
    <P>I do not quibble with the overall intentions of the Bill.  When we moved our motion in the Dáil we were not so hungup on our own Bill in its exact form that we insisted on it, and when the Minister assured us in the House at the end of March that the Bill now before us would <Col N="788" /> contain the matters at which we were aiming, we said we would welcome it, but that we would insist that the Dáil would address the term &ldquo;inequality&rdquo;.  We would have preferred if &ldquo;poverty&rdquo; had been put into the Title of the Bill and that there should be action-oriented mechanisms in the Bill rather than references to prescriptions and discussions and expressions of concern.  The attitude of my party is that we will agree to the Second Stage but we intend to table amendments for Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MyraBarry" hpid="Miss M. Barry Miss M. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that this Bill is too timorous to be worthwhile.  The concept of the National Community Development Agency is very worthy.  For far too long successive Governments have not given due recognition to the work of voluntary organisations in any concrete way.  In the materialistic and consumer age in which we live it is important that we enliven and kindle a spirit of community development throughout the nation.  Perhaps this Bill goes a long way to foster that community development spirit of which we are all very proud.</P>
      <P>However, I am disappointed that the Minister did not see fit to consult local voluntary bodies before introducing the Bill here.  The name the &ldquo;National Community Agency&rdquo; is one thing.  The aims of the Bill are twofold: first, the agency will have wide-ranging powers to promote and to support community development, self-help and community activity; and, as indicated by the Taoiseach in reply to a question on 22 March last, the agency will carry the work which would have been performed by the Agency to Combat Poverty and second, to develop community spirit and the other to combat poverty.</P>
      <P>The aim of our Bill was simply to combat poverty.  We all know that a million people in Ireland are in the poverty range out of a population of three-and-a-half million.  To try to overcome this level of poverty is an enormous task in a Christian country such as ours.  It will take all the efforts and energies of an agency with a sum of £2 million to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> However, that is only to be part of the agency's work.  Its overall aim is community development.  What the Minister is doing is setting up a wave to swallow odd fish.  He is doing it to appease the people on this side of the House.  He does not want the symbol of poverty but at the same time he speaks about community development.  I would welcome two agencies, one to combat poverty and the other the agency the Minister is setting up in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister can tell us that we have not the financial resources to do both.  I accept that, but I ask him where his priorities lie: is he more interested in poverty, a major problem here, or in community development?  He should state clearly the objectives the agency will have.  One is further confused when one reads the functions of the agency. The Bill contains one title, two aims and 11 functions.  The functions are very general. Five of them are to advise the Minister. There has been sufficient research into poverty in Ireland.  We know plenty about it.  The Minister saw a lot of it in Dublin West in the last few weeks.  There is no advice like practical advice.  Why do we waste time setting up committees and having reports and research facilities when we already know a lot about the problem?  There is plenty of information available in the Minister's Department. Are we honest with ourselves?  We are spending £2 million of taxpayers' money and I do not think we know clearly how we will spend it.</P>
    <P>This is supposed to be an umbrella organisation for community and voluntary bodies.  In this country, umbrella organisations begin and end in Dublin. The £2 million could be spent buying an expensive site in Dublin, having a grand office, getting a chief officer and a staff of 12 people and paying them £X thousands. We would then have another bureaucracy.  We are tied up with bureaucracy and we seem to be furthering it every day.  I cannot see the £2 million reaching Cork, not to speak of Galway or Donegal.  It will be an office for the elite who will reckon that they are experienced in community development <Col N="790" /> and that those on the ground who have been involved for years know nothing. Their knowledge and experience will not be tapped.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was interested in community development and had £2 million to spare, the best way to have dealt with this, and the one that would have the most constructive results, would have been to increase the funds available to existing organisations such as Muintir na Tire, National Youth Council, Trocaire and the boy scouts and girl guides.  In that way, some of the money would have reached country areas as well.  But no, another new nice office building, new letter heading and a new car for somebody. Muintir na Tire are the only body who are being involved in international community development.  They are very sore because the Minister did not see fit to communicate with them before introducing the Bill.  They regard the spending of the money as wasteful.  The National Services Board, which will become part of this agency, have no experience whatever in community development.  Many local and voluntary organisations are funded through the health boards in a worthwhile manner.</P>
    <P>We speak about decentralisation and centralisation but nothing is ever done about them.  If offices are decentralised they work better.  Health boards are doing a good job funding local and voluntary organisations.  Will this funding be stopped as a result of this Bill?  It is my contention that it must continue.  I am worried that the Minister is not serious about the poverty element of the Bill.  I would prefer if he would stand up and say honestly whether he is or he is not.</P>
    <P>There are one million people in the poverty trap.  Is this another effort to run away from the problem?  It is only a small endeavour, £2 million and one million poor means £2 per person.  We know it will not be enough to overcome the problem but it is the very least we can do.  The Bill reflects the structure of society; the better and the more articulate can help themselves.  Our Bill would have helped the poor only but it seems as if those who can help themselves will benefit further by this Bill.  The poorer sections of the <Col N="791" /> community will be left out in the cold as usual.</P>
    <P>When he is setting up the office and staffing it, the Minister should consider locating it outside Dublin.  I suggest that it be in Cork but I will not be selfish about it and if he sees the Midlands as the better place to site it, let it be so.  I get confused about which Department have responsibility for what.  I always understood community development was mainly the responsibility of the Minister for Education and that all community and voluntary organisations were the responsibility of that Department.  However, they are now the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  Health is one thing but this is another.  The Minister for Health's responsibilities are large enough without this.  He has an onerous task in trying to keep a healthy nation.  Would it not have been better to put community development under the aegis of the Department of Education? That Department have wide experience of community organisations and voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>Poverty is not something which should be looked down upon.  There is no reason why the Department of Education could not cope with it.  Part of the problem begins with the educational system.  From day one at school, the expectations of the poor child are low.  The poor child does not develop as much as other children.  If our educational system was geared towards the needs of all people, we could tackle one aspect of the problem.  The Minister spoke about self-esteem and self-help.  If the educational system is only geared towards the 17 per cent of the population who go on to third level education, what of the other 83 per cent?  We are keeping them in the poverty trap.  If they are failures in school, as 82 per cent of them are, it is very hard for them to have self-esteem.</P>
    <P>As regards housing and planning, we have failed to take the needs of the poor into account.  We have set up ghettoes for the poor instead of having the better off and poor mixed together.  Any attempt to solve the problem will only touch the tip of the iceberg to such a small extent <Col N="792" /> that unless the terms of reference of the Bill are changed I cannot see it achieving anything worthwhile.</P>

In this instance why was that practice not adhered to?  Surely if that practice had been implemented consistently this question would be down to every relevant Minister who had made outrageous promises in Dublin West over the last couple of weeks?

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will amend section 14 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, to remove the powers of An Bord Pleanála to grant permission or approval on appeal to applicants in cases where such approval or permission contravenes materially the development plan or any special amenity area order of the relevant local authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. Brady (Dublin South-East) Mr. Brady (Dublin South-East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> In dealing with appeals, An Bord Pleanála are required to have regard to the same criteria as those prescribed for the planning authority, including the requirement that regard must be had to the provisions of the development plan or the provisions of any relevant special amenity area order.  This does not mean that the provisions of the plan or order have to be adhered to in every case &mdash; even where, for example, the circumstances relevant to a case have changed materially since the plan or order was made.  The planning authority may themselves grant a permission which materially contravenes their plan in certain circumstances and it would <Col N="806" /> be inappropriate that the board should have a lesser discretion.  I do not, therefore, intend to amend section 14 of the 1976 Planning Act in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in the case of a local authority who have the advice of professional planners available, and where every five years they establish a development plan, it is simply belittling local representatives to allow the planning board to override a development plan and that great care should be taken to ensure that local representatives are seen to have powers?  In this case there is obviously a diminution of those powers.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I appreciate what the Deputy is saying but, irrespective of what personal feelings there might be, we must act in accordance with the law and the law as outlined in my reply stands.  I suppose that the sensitivity of local representatives is something that must be taken into consideration, but it must be done within the framework of the existing law.  I do not agree that this would be interpreted as a diminution of the authority of local representatives.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would develop further the thinking in that part of his reply where he said that, as a planning authority have power to contravene materially their own development plans, it would be inappropriate for the appeal lobby not to have similar power?  On reflection, would the Minister agree that that statement is not well founded, that it is one matter for a planning authority to modify a development plan but that the functions of the board should not necessarily be similar but should deal with appeals within the context in which the appeal is put forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. Brady (Dublin South-East) Mr. Brady (Dublin South-East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I appreciate what the Deputy is saying and in the interest of clarification I am prepared, if the House so wishes, to have an in-depth hearing on the matter.  The basic criteria for dealing with planning applications are set out in section 26 of the 1963 <Col N="807" /> Act.  These criteria, which apply equally to the planning authority involved and the board, involve consideration of the proper planning and development of an area having regard to the development plan and to any relevant special amenity order made.  A planning authority, as I have said, may grant permission which contravenes materially their own plan provided they follow the procedures set out in section 26, subsection (3), of the 1963 Act, as amended.  This requires an authority to publish notice of their proposals, to consider any objections or representations received within 21 days after the notice is first published and to pass a special resolution requiring that a decision to grant permission be made.</P>
      <P>Similarly, section 14 (8) of the 1976 Act makes it clear that while the board must have regard to development land and any relevant special amenity area order it may decide to grant permission or approval even if the proposed development contravenes materially the development plan or any such order.</P>
      <P>Following its normal procedure the board will make a decision only after all parties, including the planning authority, have been given an opportunity of making submissions in writing or orally.  Section 14 (8) was included in the 1976 Act to put it beyond doubt that the board would have full discretion in dealing with appeals and would not be constrained to an unreasonable extent by the provisions of development plans or special amenity area orders.  In dealing with appeals the Minister operated in this way and granted permission even where a material contravention was involved.  It is difficult to accept that legislation should be enacted under which the powers of the appellant tribunal would be very significantly less than those of the authorities from whose decisions appeals were being made.  I can elaborate further if the House wishes but I believe the matter is clear.  We are acting within the law and I do not see any contradiction at all.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the actions of An Bord Pleanála are within <Col N="808" /> the present law but the Minister was good enough to read out the very stringent conditions that apply to variations from development plans on the part of a planning authority.  No similar provisions apply on the same scale or in the same order to An Bord Pleanála.  Does it not seem that it would be worth reconsidering the power of An Bord Pleanála to ignore the development plan because the same safeguards do not exist where it does so, while for the planning authority it does?  In view of the visibly unhappy consequences of the exercise of this discretion in many cases is there not now a case for reconsidering the law recognising that all that has been done so far is within the law?</P>

      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Burke, on the Order of Business this morning gave a commitment to bring in legislation to legalise the extension of the extended years' remission in relation to the withering of planning permission. Therefore, the House will have to deal with an amendment to the 1976 Act within the next couple of weeks.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a recent court decision, referred to in planning circles as the &ldquo;Pine Valley decision&rdquo; which impinges directly on the question of a higher authority contravening materially a development plan.  I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister the information conveyed to the House yesterday in relation to the enormous number of appeals going to An Bord Pleanála largely by people who attempt to get the development plan changed effectively by the back door because they know that when they apply for planning permission to the relevant local authority they will not get permission because it is <Col N="810" /> outside the frames and the development control standards of that authority.  Does the Minister agree that the crucial point here is, contravene materially and not alter slightly?  Will the Minister give the House an assurance that he will issue to An Bord Pleanála, as he is empowered to do, a guidance circular requesting the board to respect the spirit of development plans, which is the democratic point raised by Deputy Collins, or, alternatively, alter the legislation in the next two or three weeks?</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> The first part of the Deputy's question which relates to a statement by the Minister is a separate matter.  The second part relates to the Pine Valley case.  The right of a Minister for Local Government who dealt with appeals prior to 15 March 1977 to grant permission in material contravention of a plan was questioned in that case.  In February 1982 the Supreme Court held that the Minister did not have such power.  It should be emphasised, however, that the Minister had no notice of that case and was not a party to it and was not given an opportunity of arguing the point at issue.  It is not accepted that the Pine Valley judgment made by a court of three judges rather than the full court is the end of the matter and because of the serious implications of the judgment the earliest opportunity will be availed of to have the matter reviewed in the Supreme Court.  In relation to the final part of the question by the Deputy I can give him an assurance that the matter will be examined further.  I can assure the House that I will bring this matter to the attention of the Minister.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that his repeated analogy between the local authority and An Bord Pleanála is a little unjust because the former, the local authority, are publicly accountable while the latter are not in the same way? In fact, both bodies operate by different sets of criteria.  Does the Minister accept that his repeated statements that the existing situation, even though there is implicit dissatisfaction expressed by the Minister with some aspects of it, is in <Col N="811" /> conformity with law is a bad <i>rationale</i> for not improving the law, if that needs to be done?  Does the Minister accept that there is growing dissatisfaction with the unusual nature of some of the decisions made by An Bord Pleanála?  In that regard the Minister should be looking again at the manner in which the board have been operating and, perhaps, re-evaluate it in the light of the number of years experience now at the disposal of the Minister?</P>

      <P>That is what I thought the Minister of State said, but it is a most extraordinary statement to make in the House.  The Supreme Court decided a constitutional issue and I understood that it was the end of the matter.  It would seem impertinent of any Government to seek to modify that not by constitutional amendment but by going to the Supreme Court and demanding that they reverse it themselves because the Government do not like the decision.  I am not a practising lawyer but I have never heard of such procedure before.  It is astonishing that the Minister should propose this course of action to the House.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I am aware that there is a considerable problem in regard to defaulting developers in housing developments.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the enforcement of planning control under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 and 1976, is, however, a matter for the planning authority concerned. Various powers are available to planning authorities to take action to secure the satisfactory completion of housing estates and the position in this regard was considerably strengthened by the 1976 Planning Act.  I have advised planning authorities to make full use of these powers to ensure that developers comply fully with the terms and conditions of planning permissions given.</P>
      <P>In order to enable progress to be made in intractable cases, a scheme was introduced in 1981 to enable local authorities to make grants to meet two-thirds of the cost of completing estates where all other possibilities of achieving this, including the legal processes, have been totally exhausted.  To date almost £630,000 has been allocated to local authorities under the scheme.</P>

If we allow this to continue the grant which will be sought will become bigger and bigger.  Surely an amendment to the Planning Act authorising local authorities to insert conditions regarding the completion of estates by a certain time and providing for penalties if this is not done would be an appropriate step.  Also if local authorities could refuse permission to a developer who failed to complete an estate, the State would save money and the development would be completed more quickly.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to place more emphasis on the poverty aspect and I suggest that there be a greater balance between community development and combating poverty. There is no need for the Minister to seek further advice on facts or on statistics regarding poverty.  All the facts are available to him.  For too long we have had reports and fact-finding committees.  The facts are there for all to see.  We know there are one million poor in this country. I ask the Minister to get on with the work. He should use the £2 million to ensure that when this agency is put into operation we will succeed in some small way in combating poverty.  Even though the first step will be a small one, it is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>The Minister should not let the community aspect swamp the poverty aspect. On the next Stage we will put down an amendment to ensure that the poverty aspect will be included in the Bill.  We have the means to create a greater awareness of the problem.  I ask the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to my suggestion.</P>

I should like to assure Deputies that the functions which were included in the draft Bill initially are included in this Bill also.  They have been broadened to ensure that the agency will be capable of undertaking the measures which it deems necessary to combat poverty, to develop programmes and undertake research where necessary.</P>
      <P>On of the difficulties which arose in the discussion was with regard to differences between the administration and the legislation. The purpose of the legislation is to provide enabling powers for the agency and the matter of administration of that agency subsequently will be a matter for the board.  I appreciate that many of the points made by Deputies will have to be addressed to the board in the first instance when it sets about its tasks. It is our duty to establish an agency that is sufficiently broad in its terms of reference to enable the new board to work out its own programmes.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that the agency has lost its teeth.  From what I have said it is clear that all the functions are included.  Indeed, one might say that the teeth of the draft Bill had some cavities but they have been given gold fillings in this Bill.  Instead of spending £250,000 in a year, as the previous Government had intended, we will be spending £2 million in a year.  That is a dramatic increase in the funds available.</P>

      <P>The quality of the work will depend very much on the board and the way it approaches its work and I have great confidence in that matter.  The amount of money being provided is very important because for the first time we will have a board with significant backing in financial terms to undertake its tasks.</P>
      <P>I was a little surprised at the reaction of the Opposition to the Bill.  I had presumed that a measure which is aimed at improving the lot of the poor and the disadvantaged would have received unambiguous support in this House.  I want to make it clear that everything of substance contained in the previous proposal has been carried forward into this Bill.  However, that is a matter that can be taken further on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been criticised on the ground that it has relegated poverty to a minor position and that it has promoted the position of community.  Of course that is not true.  The elimination of poverty and inequality remains the primary objective of the Bill.  A number of Deputies raised the question of the absence of the word &ldquo;inequality&rdquo; in the functions of the agency and they tried to suggest that the Government do not accept that inequality exists in our society.  I want to reject that suggestion.  The Government are well aware of the great differences that exist between the haves and havenots in our society.  It was in recognition of that fact and of the need for a co-ordinated national programme to tackle inequality that led us to propose the establishment of this agency.  It is only fair to point out that our party have always accepted the reality of poverty and inequality and have worked consistently to bring about their elimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the major social welfare advances of our time were made by Fianna Fáil.  We gave everyone the opportunity to avail of free second level education.  We abolished the out-dated dispensary system and introduced the <Col N="873" /> choice of doctor scheme.  We developed the pay-related social insurance scheme and brought about substantial improvements in all social welfare benefits.  It is against this background that the proposals to establish this agency were developed. The ultimate objective of the agency then is quite clearly to eliminate poverty and social deprivation and to ensure equal opportunity for all in so far as this is possible.</P>
    <P>It is clear from what I have said that inequality is at the very root of poverty and social deprivation.  I would like to assure Deputies that the omission of the word &ldquo;inequality&rdquo; from the Bill is not an oversight, nor is it due to any sense of complacency or lack of commitment to the elimination of inequality.  The term has not been used because I am advised that it is too vague and ambiguous to be enshrined in the legislation.  I am sure it is for this reason that the word &ldquo;inequality&rdquo; did not appear in the draft scheme of the combat poverty agency Bill which was being prepared by the former Coalition Government.  Presumably they were also advised of the unsuitability of the word in the drafting of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that nowhere in the functions proposed for the Coalition's agency did the word &ldquo;inequality&rdquo; appear and I am sure that Deputies Flaherty and Desmond can confirm this.  The changes in phraseology between the Coalition Government's proposals and the Bill before the House today are due to two main reasons.  The Coalition's proposals were still at drafting stage and had not been subjected to the normal tidying up process which is required by the parliamentary draftsman.  Our Bill has been through this process and the way in which the functions are expressed has had to be altered to obviate any misunderstanding or looseness in drafting.  The second reason is that we have adopted a different approach to the conduct of the agency's work.  The Coalition were content to allow their agency to operate in a vacuum. We are determined that our agency will have the full support of the community and that it will work with and through communities and that it will help to <Col N="874" /> develop communities and community activity where this does not exist already. This is an area in which there was considerable difference of opinion about the intentions of the Bill.  It is certainly our intention to use, as far as possible, local community based effort and to encourage and foster that effort and to promote it because we believe that this will be one of the most substantial and important factors in overcoming poverty within our society.  Indeed it reminds me that a number of Deputies raised the question of poverty being mentioned in a limited sense and not wanting to involve it with community development.  But one of the mottoes used by those who work in Third World countries has been that if one gives a man a fish he will live for a day but if he is taught how to fish he will be able to supply himself for the rest of his life. Obviously the question in community development is to encourage and support people in helping themselves &mdash; this is where self-help comes in &mdash; and to assist them in overcoming their difficulties.  As Deputy Higgins made quite clear, I also pointed out in my initial speech that this was not to suggest that one would solely rely on that method and that in many instances it may be necessary to use other direct approaches.</P>
    <P>Deputies have suggested that the agency will spread their energies instead of concentrating them on the most deprived areas.  This, of course, is not the intention.  I intend that the agency should concentrate their efforts in the most deprived areas as a matter of priority. But I would not agree with limiting their functions so that they cannot extend beyond that because the communities involved may be communities of elderly people.  Here again Deputy Higgins recognised this point and welcomed it in the Bill.  The communities being talked about may not necessarily be localised communities but may be communities of the elderly spread throughout society generally or communities of the disabled or other kinds of communities.  It is certainly our intention that priority will be given to the most deprived groups and the most deprived areas.  Indeed, section 4 (1) (c) gives the agency the task of <Col N="875" /> identifying these areas and groups which have a high level of poverty and social deprivation.  That is actually one of the tasks which was set into the functions to identify and specify these areas so that the resources can be channelled in that direction.  It clearly follows that the agency's activities will be directed at the most deprived areas.  This is what the Government's intention is and that is what I, as Minister, will ensure in the operation of the agency.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies drew attention to the fact that there was no direct reference to combating poverty.  Deputies Desmond and Flaherty were concerned at the omission of reference to the functions of the agency, to the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty. I would like to point out that as their very first function the agency are required to advise the Minister on policies and programmes in relation to poverty and in so doing they would be completely free to make whatever studies they consider necessary so that they may advise the Minister and the Government on the programmes which are necessary to combat poverty.  In that respect the agency will be free to draw on the work of the combat poverty agency and on any other experiences or research when formulating their advice.  I do not, therefore, feel that it is necessary specifically to mention combating poverty in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would also like to make clear the fact that as Minister previously, before the change of Government, I had already set about a process of changing the nature of the National Social Services Board. Shortly before we went out of office we had introduced the National Social Services Board and had reduced the size of the board and strengthened it and it was our intention to go on in that direction and, ultimately, to give it a statutory function.  Now this agency will give the full satutory powers to the body and it is a further step in the process which was already taking place before we left Government.</P>
    <P>The pilot schemes to combat poverty grew out of the EEC movement to eliminate poverty at both Community and <Col N="876" /> local level.  The Deputies here will be aware that the EEC programme came to an end in 1980, having been extended two years previously to November 1980 and it again got a further extension to December 1980 when it came to an end finally.  It was I who suggested, at the meeting of Social Affairs Ministers in the EEC, that a review should be carried out of the work which had been undertaken by the combat poverty groups in the different member states and that on the basis of this review the Community should decide what its future policy would be in this area.  That suggestion was accepted and that review has been got under way.  The Council very recently discussed a report from the Commission and decided that a full examination should be made both at national and community level of the various assessments and guidelines which had been contained in the work previously done.  The Council then directed that a report of the examination be undertaken at Community level and should be back to the Social Affairs Ministers as soon as possible.  That is the position as of just a couple of weeks ago and the situation is still progressing.  I would certainly hope that the European Community, through its social affairs committee and the Council of Ministers on Social Affairs, will proceed with further assistance and aid in this area and that the new agency will be able to avail of this assistance in carrying on the kinds of work involved in combating poverty in the different member states.</P>
    <P>The commission's report provides a sound basis for the development of the next phase in the battle against poverty. A further anti-poverty plan will emerge which will benefit from the lessons learned from the first five years of the anti-poverty programme.  This cannot fail to be more effective than the first programme, having learned from the experiences and shortcomings of that programme.</P>
    <P>There is still a lot of work to be done, but the war against poverty and all forms of basic social inequality and deprivation can be won provided there is sufficient political and administrative determination. It is not just a matter of legislative <Col N="877" /> proposals; it is also a question of the political commitment, the administrative ability and the ingenuity of the administration. I hope the new agency will be innovative in their approach, that they will not be afraid to undertake new methods and approaches and that they will be administratively effective in the way they approach these problems.  It is the administrative effectiveness which ultimately will have the biggest effect on the usefulness of the agency as a whole.  That is something we cannot legislate for.  It depends on the board of the new agency, the management, board membership and staff.</P>
    <P>In this society it is not merely a question of a conflict over values or philosophies. All parties are agreed that we should urgently take steps to combat poverty and undertake programmes which will improve the lot of those in poor circumstances, but we must decide how to go about this in the most effective way. Therefore, it is more a matter of administrative organisation and the manipulative skills of those who challenge the system and seek change.  I would like to applaud the EEC's further initiatives. This country will be playing a leading part in structuring and implementing the new programme the EEC are working on at present.</P>
    <P>It has been asked why this agency should be under the aegis of the Department of Health.  There are many good reasons why this was done.  I was surprised that Deputy Mitchell did not seem to realise that a good deal of welfare work is carried out through the health boards under the aegis of the Department of Health.  The Deputies who were critical of our approach may not realise that in my first term as Minister for Health I established within the Department a new welfare division, headed by an assistant secretary, which has responsibility for developing policies for the whole range of disadvantaged groups within our society &mdash; the poor, the deprived, the elderly, children, the disabled, travellers, victims of family violence, single parent families, unmarried mothers and other groups who through no fault of their own find themselves in difficult circumstances.  I find it <Col N="878" /> strange that a number of Deputies should suggest that this agency should be attached to another Department.  Policies and programmes in relation to poverty span the whole range of Government activities.  In my view, and for the reasons I have just outlined, the Department of Health are the best organised and the best equipped to co-ordinate activities in this area.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of confidentiality and queried the need for section 17, which deals with confidentiality.  This is a standard provision in Acts establishing bodies of this nature.  The saver clause of section 17(3) clearly provides that the agency's day to day work will not be affected or restricted in any way.  The purpose of the provision is not to hinder but to facilitate the agency.  Much of the work of the agency, especially in the area of research, will be concerned with the development of Government policy and the analysis of existing State services.  If the staff of the agency are to be given access to sensitive information, it is necessary that they should be subject to the normal requirements of confidentiality.  If this section were to be removed there is the danger that some agencies would be reluctant to provide the new agency with the information they require.  As I see it, this section will help rather than hinder the agency in the performance of their functions.</P>
    <P>Two points have been raised concerning the National Social Services Board &mdash; first the question of the consultation with members and staff and, secondly the desirability of transferring the functions and staff of the board to the new agency. As regards prior consultation, I informed the chairman of the National Social Services Board what was proposed before the circulation of the Bill.  At the same time officials of my Department briefed the director of the board.  However, I felt obliged to request the chairman and the director not to disclose the proposals until the Bill had been presented to the House.  In the same way I feel it is my duty as a legislator to come before the House and discuss the proposals before I enter into consultations with <Col N="879" /> the staff.  I have indicated already to the chairman and director of the board that I will be very happy to enter into consultations in relation to the staff once the Bill has passed through the Houses.  I made it clear in my opening speech that the existing terms and conditions of the staff will be protected and that the new arrangement will provide them with a greater degree of security than they have enjoyed up to this time.</P>
    <P>The proposal to assimilate the board into the agency is designed to obviate any duplication of effort and any ambiguity between the functions of the board and those of the agency.  The two principal functions of the board at present are, first, to support community information centres and, second, to act as a resource centre for the development of voluntary social services.  Both of these functions are clearly appropriate to the agency if it is to help people to understand and avail of the services and supports which are available to them, to assist groups to develop their areas and to improve the position of the underprivileged.  The present functions of the board are natural functions of the new agency and have been incorporated within the functions of the new agency.  In this respect the chairman and director of the board are fully familiar with the situation and are happy that their present functions will be included in the new agency.  Therefore, I consider the most practical approach is to dissolve the board and to transfer their functions and responsibilities to the new agency.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of the definition of &ldquo;self-help&rdquo; and were concerned at its inclusion.  All the functions included in the original draft Bill are included in this Bill, and other functions have been added.  The words &ldquo;self-help&rdquo; raise some concern among Deputies.  I accept the views of the Deputies that some of the terms such as &ldquo;self help&rdquo; and &ldquo;community development&rdquo;, used in the Bill may be interpreted in a broad sense.  In relation to &ldquo;self-help&rdquo; I accept Deputy Desmond's point that many disadvantaged persons would not have the ability to help themselves, but <Col N="880" /> it is important to recognise that these people do not wish to accept what they would regard as interference by wellmeaning outsiders.  In effect, they want to help themselves but they want to be given the assistance, resources backing and support they need.</P>
    <P>Material handouts and attempts by outsiders at imposing structures are not particularly desired by them.  They need and want self-reliance, self-esteem and the dignity due to ordinary human beings.  With the right approach from trained community workers, there is motivation to help oneself, one's community, family, neighbours or whatever the group may be to get a job, organise a project, start a small industry or try to achieve the particular aim.  There are objectives which can be instilled through the operation of self-help, with the backing and support of members of the community.</P>
    <P>Community workers are, therefore, prime motivators when assisting communities to engage in self-help exercises. One fact which emerges from the reports of the combat poverty programmes is the input necessary in certain areas to enable people to help themselves.  In effect, it meant longer, greater and more specialised support.  However, having been given that support, people became able to handle their own environment and their own particular difficulties.  The degree of support could subsequently be lessened and those people, in turn, were able to help others at that stage.</P>
    <P>Community workers are primarily concerned with assisting communities to identify their needs and objectives and to take appropriate action to ensure that needs are defined and objectives met.  In other words, they also engage in self-help. This is the normal procedure of community workers.  Where people are deprived, poor and powerless, it is vital that strategies are developed to encourage their fuller participation in decisions which affect their lives.  This came through again and again from the pilot studies on combating poverty, where people became involved in determining their own needs and could work towards <Col N="881" /> the alleviation of their problems.  This enhanced their participation as members of society on a wider basis.</P>
    <P>In situations where people are deprived or alienated from the wider community, it is important that initiatives be taken by local leaders to employ personnel to stimulate participation.  It is also important that such leaders look to their own delivery of service and organisation to ensure that no alienation from the group to be helped occurs.  A high level of openness and opportunity for participation in decision-making by the client community must be facilitated. This agency, far from taking over, so to speak, in the community, will play such a facilitating and supporting role.</P>
    <P>Another area about which Deputies were quite concerned was the area of community development.  As Deputy Higgins pointed out yesterday, the word `community' is open to many interpretations. As far as its inclusion in the Bill is concerned in the sense of community development, the strength of the term lies in that very openness to wide interpretation. My concern is to ensure that this agency will not be hampered in carrying out its function by difficulties which narrow definitions would bring.  The term `community development' is used in the Bill primarily to describe work at neighbourhood level.  It is seen as a process by which local communities are helped to assess their needs and plan collective action to meet them.</P>
    <P>The emphasis is on self-help and the maximum involvement of people themselves in the planning and provision of services and amenities.  An essential part of the process is the structuring of a representative organisational framework like the community association which enables people to act collectively on their own behalf.  This neighbourhood organisation is often linked to a more broadly based structure catering for a wider geographical area.  At both levels of organisation, representations from statutory agencies are particularly valuable.  There is some difference of opinion as to the terms of the definition.  It is suggested by Deputies that we have defined these areas somewhat more broadly and I agree <Col N="882" /> with that interpretation.  We have purposely made the definition broader so as not to limit the agency in any way.</P>
    <P>I could point to the work of the combat poverty group and take one of the studies which they did.  The combat poverty group commissioned a study on the elderly, published under the title of &ldquo;Old and Alone&rdquo;.  The greatest problem they found throughout the country for the elderly was that of loneliness.  It is quite obvious that overcoming the problem of loneliness requires community involvement. How we describe the community may be different for each of us.  However, if we go into particular communities and see them in action, this is the kind of care and involvement which we wish to encourage.  We would not like to describe the functions of the agency in the Bill in such a way as to exclude this community care, action and involvement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty mentioned giving the agency teeth, apart from the financial aspect.  She recognised that in section 4 (4) we have again given an additional provision of particular importance.  This provision gives the agency teeth which the previous draft body did not have. Section 4 (4) states:</P>
    <P>A statutory body may and, where the Minister having statutory responsibility for it so directs, shall co-operate with the Agency in the performance of its functions.</P>
    <P>If that is not giving the agency real teeth, I do not know how one is supposed to do so.  That is a direct way in which the statutory agencies can be brought under the support of the programmes of the National Community Development Agency.  It is specifically laid down statutorily and is one of the elements which give real teeth to this agency.  I am particularly happy to be associated with the establishment of this new agency because for a long time we have needed a body like this, with the resources and statutory powers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell suggested that this agency would be coming virtually within the health boards and would be lost in the whole morass of the health services. In effect, this is an independent statutory <Col N="883" /> agency, which will relate directly to the Minister and to the Department and not directly to the health boards.  It is an agency with a considerable strength which has never been seen before, even in the previous draft Bill.  It also has the flexibility to undertake any measures which Members of the House would see it undertaking.  We are all agreed on the work which it should pursue.  We are certainly concerned that this will be pursued with the priorities being allocated to the most deprived groups and areas, but also to the other bodies operating in the area.  That is a matter for priority selection by the agency itself, once established.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I thank the numerous Deputies who contributed to the Second Stage discussion on this Bill.  If they reflect on the functions and measures included in the Bill, they will recognise that all previous measures have been included, and there has been some broadening and the allowance of some additional flexibility in the Bill, which can only leave the agency with the power to undertake work in some of the other areas which we feel quite certain they will need to undertake, if not immediately, certainly in the near future.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies raised the question of research and the fact that the body is empowered to evaluate and collate and to provide resources and funds for research.  I accept, as was said by a number of Deputies, that a considerable amount of research has been done, perhaps not always directed specifically towards the key objectives which the agency or the Combat Poverty Group might have had in mind.  In that sense I can see research will be necessary, directed very specifically towards deprived groups or deprived areas, and not of an academic nature.</P>
    <P>For this reason the agency is given the power to be involved in this way.  At the same time it is not seen as a research body.  It is not seen as establishing a sort of super-structure as some people feared. It is seen as a small, centralised resource group which will facilitate, encourage and grant-aid, both by way of current and <Col N="884" /> capital grant, the various bodies operating in this field.  It will also foster, initiate and undertake trials in areas where this becomes necessary.  We hope it will co-ordinate many of the efforts which are not well co-ordinated.</P>
    <P>This aspect is spelled out fairly clearly in the functions.  It will be in a position to bring the activities of the various statutory agencies in areas to bear on problems which are regarded as high priority by the agencies.  All in all, within the functions there is plenty of flexibility. There is plenty of meat.  There are teeth which never existed before.  I am privileged to be able to bring this Bill before the House.  I look forward to the early establishment of the agency so that it can set about tackling urgently some of the most immediate priorities which we all know exist.  I would welcome a fairly speedy passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas so that we can establish the agency and put it to work in the way Deputies would like to see it working.</P>

    <Title>Urban Development Areas Bill, 1982: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Brady, Dublin South-East) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Brady, Dublin South-East)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Brady,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dublin South-East):</i> I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It has been clear for some time now that existing methods of dealing with the problems of redevelopment and urban renewal in inner urban areas have not been able to achieve the necessary results in area of special need.  In these areas buildings have been allowed to decay and become derelict and the environment generally has become degraded.  In addition, there are often high levels of unemployment, poor housing and other social conditions, high rates of crime and vandalism, poverty, factory closures and lack of job opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This situation has evolved despite the best efforts of the local authorities and the various other agencies who have worked over the years to try to stem the <Col N="885" /> tide; indeed, but for them, the situation today would be far worse.  The problem is not simply an Irish one, nor does it concern Dublin only; cities throughout the world and the major urban areas in Ireland are experiencing similar problems. Much has been already written and spoken about the problems of inner urban areas and their causes and possible solutions and I have no wish to add unnecessarily at this stage to that mass of material.  Two things are clear, however: first, that the present situation is far from satisfactory and, second, that what is now required is action rather than words.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government showed their concern in a concrete way for inner city problems when they established an interdepartmental committee in 1978 to report and make recommendations to deal with the particularly acute problems of the Dublin inner city area.  Following completion of the committee's report, the Government set up the Dublin Inner City Group in May 1979 to further the work of the interdepartmental committee, to develop a programme of action by the various Departments and public agencies operating in the inner city and to co-ordinate the activities and policies of these bodies.  More recently, it has been decided to establish a statutory Dublin Inner City Development Authority in order that the work begun by the group may be intensified and extended. I shall return to this aspect later.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Dublin Inner City Group in 1979 was a response to particular social and economic problems discussed in the report of the interdepartmental committee.  There is, however, another dimension involved in that the special problems associated with much of Dublin's inner city area and with many of our other inner urban areas are characterised by the poor physical condition and sometimes widespread dereliction of many of their buildings.  Because of this the Government have decided that it is necessary to give special attention also to the physical problems of development, redevelopment and renewal in inner urban areas.  My own appointment as Minister of State in the Department of <Col N="886" /> the Environment with special responsibility for urban renewal is an indication of this.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the Urban Development Areas Bill, 1982, represents another step towards getting to grips with the problems of urban renewal.  While the Bill heralds a new approach designed to supplement existing efforts in areas of special need, it does not set out to replace existing systems or programmes.  Indeed, one of my objectives as Minister of State will be to assist and encourage existing agencies, and particularly local authorities, in intensifying their efforts in the field of urban renewal.</P>
    <P>Regretfully a misinterpretation has arisen and suggestions have been made that local authorities will have their powers usurped in some way.  I should like to give an assurance to the House that nothing could be further from the truth.  Local authorities will be in constant consultation with development committees.  I will be examining conditions in urban areas throughout the country to see what steps might be appropriate to promote renewal and regeneration in their particular circumstances. In other words, not only Dublin is getting attention.  I intend on a nationwide plan to examine all the cities, and as many towns as I can, with a view to compiling a statistical analysis of priority needs in respect of urban renewal.</P>
    <P>I will also be examining the existing statutory provisions by which urban renewal objectives are defined and promoted by the local planning authorities and considering what steps might be taken to make them more effective.  I wish to emphasise, therefore that the establishment of urban development commissions does not mean that the local authorities will not continue to have a key responsibility for promoting modernisation and improvement of their urban areas.  On the contrary, it will be a central element in the Government's overall approach to this problem to provide these authorities with every possible support in this most important aspect of overall national development.</P>
    <P>The essential purpose of the present Bill is to enable a new form of agency, an urban development commission, to be <Col N="887" /> created to undertake and promote schemes of redevelopment and renewal in designated parts of urban areas.  The main powers and functions of the proposed commissions are set out in section 4 of the Bill.  The basic provision is the imposition on a commission of a duty to secure the overall regeneration of its area and for this purpose the commission will have power to acquire, hold and manage land for development, either by itself or by others; to prepare and implement, or secure the implementation of, schemes for the development, redevelopment or renewal of land; to dispose of land as may be appropriate; to carry out amenity or environmental improvement works; and to assist, in accordance with a scheme approved by the Minister, persons or bodies concerned with the improvement of the area.  Each commission will be expressly required under section 4(1)(b) to maintain as far as practicable a balance as between housing, industrial, commercial, social, amenity and other development within its area.  This is an extremely important requirement for there is widespread acceptance that the problems of many of our urban areas have been contributed to, if not caused, by a failure to secure balanced development.</P>
    <P>It might be said that the powers being given to urban development commissions are not very different to those already available to the local authorities.  Basically this is correct.  Local authorities, however, are multi-purpose bodies and their energies and resources have to be spread over the whole of their areas and among a wide range of functions.  The establishment of specialist bodies in areas of special need is therefore fully justified. These bodies can be expected to develop substantial expertise in land and estate management and development and in the financing of development and redevelopment. They will be able to operate in a more flexible manner than could a local authority and to form appropriate joint arrangements with both public and private bodies.  They will, I hope, be able to attract new housing, services and industry to their areas, as well as carrying out development directly themselves.  The <Col N="888" /> proposed commissions will be <i>ad hoc</i> bodies, established to regenerate particular areas, and when they have completed their assignments, commissions will be dissolved and their assets and liabilities will be transferred to other statutory bodies.  This is provided for in section 19 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under section 3, an urban development commission will consist of a chairman and not more than six ordinary members.  Neither the chairman nor an ordinary member of a commission may be a member of either House of the Oireachtas or of the Assembly of the European Communities.  Establishment orders will be made under section 5 to provide for the method, terms and conditions of appointment of members and for all of the other basic matters which have to be covered when a statutory body is being established.  This procedure is based on the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1971, which has operated successfully.  It is intended that the establishment orders will provide that the appointment of the chairman and the other members will be made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The success of each commission will depend to a large extent on the calibre of its membership and it must be the aim to secure the services of the best possible qualified persons.  The membership will need to be representative of a range of disciplines, including people with experience in local government and public administration.  The functions of the commissions will include the acquisition of land for development and the implementation of schemes of redevelopment, so that members who have a background in estate management and property development will also be an asset.  In addition, people with a sound knowledge of commercial financial management could have an important contribution to make to the working of a commission.</P>
    <P>Urban development commissions are not intended to become a major burden on the Exchequer and, accordingly, section 18 spells out appropriate financial obligations for them.  In so far as property development activities are concerned, a commission will be required, taking one <Col N="889" /> year with another, to meet its operating expenditure from revenue and to be in a position to repay its borrowings.  In addition, the Minister is being empowered to require any particular commission to generate sufficient revenue to meet some of its capital needs.  This could be a reasonable requirement in some areas but it would obviously not be appropriate to impose it as a blanket requirement because the financial circumstances of commissions could vary widely.  Depending on the nature of their area and its development potential, some commissions may have difficulty in complying with the requirements of section 18, while others may be able to generate more funds than they themselves require at a particular time.  To cater for this latter possibility, an order under section 5 can make provision for the application of profits or other income or funds of a commission in such manner as the Minister may direct, including application for the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Under section 15, an urban development commission will have power to borrow money at home or abroad for current or capital purposes.  It is anticipated that commissions should be able to raise the bulk of their capital requirements by borrowing directly themselves or by other financial arrangements.  To facilitate such borrowings section 17 allows the Minister for Finance to guarantee borrowings up to a limit of £50 million.  Exchequer advances to urban development commissions, up to a limit of £50 million, are permitted by section 16, but it is envisaged that access to repayable advances of this kind will not be available to commissions except as a last resort.</P>
    <P>It may not always be possible to meet the full expenses of urban development commissions from revenue.  For example, expenditure arising from the making of grants for local improvement works, etc., under section 4, or in relation to a planning scheme under section 6, or certain overhead expenses, could require separate financing.  For this reason section 14 of the Bill enables grants to be paid by the Minister to an urban development commission after consultation with the <Col N="890" /> commission in relation to its programme of expenditure.</P>
    <P>Sections 6, 12 and 13 deal with the position of urban development commissions in relation to the physical planning system.  In framing these provisions the Government were anxious to ensure that a reasonable balance was struck as between two sets of objectives.  On the one hand, there was the need to preserve as far as possible the existing physical planning system, as operated by the planning authorities, and to avoid serious interference with the comprehensive nature of that system.  On the other hand, it was considered that urban development commissions should have the power to exercise a major influence on the development and redevelopment of their areas and to initiate and carry out development with the absolute minimum of delay.  I believe that sections 6, 12 and 13 provide an appropriate solution to this difficulty.</P>
    <P>Under section 6, a commission may, and must if so directed by the Minister, prepare a planning scheme for its area. In preparing such a scheme a commission will be required to take account of the existing character and special features of the area, to consult with any local authority concerned and to make arrangements for the making and consideration of submissions by interested persons.  When a scheme has been prepared a planning authority concerned will be obliged to have regard to the scheme in making a development plan, and in directly carrying out any development in the area of the commission.  In addition, planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála will be required to take account of any relevant scheme in dealing with an application for permission or approval under section 26 or section 27 of the 1963 Planning and Development Act.</P>
    <P>A planning scheme will set out the manner in which an urban development commission considers that the overall regeneration of its area should be secured and will specify the kinds of development which, in the opinion of the commission, should or should not be carried out in the area with that end in view.  A planning scheme will not, however, take the place <Col N="891" /> of a development plan under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  Instead, it will be a matter for the planning authority, having regard to the scheme, to review their plan and to make any necessary variations in it.</P>
    <P>I would hope that planning authorities would go further than this and make special development plans for any urban development areas for which planning schemes are prepared.  A permissive power to make such partial plans is already provided by section 19(5) of the 1963 Act but has not been used to any significant extent.  Accordingly, section 13 enables the Minister to intervene, where he considers it necessary to do so, and to direct that a partial plan should be made by the planning authority in relation to a specified part of their area.  This provision has been stated in general terms, rather than being confined to urban development areas, because it seems desirable that a mechanism should be available to bring about increased use of the partial development plan procedure in different kinds of areas throughout the country, for example, areas of high amenity or areas where development pressure is severe, if this seems to be called for in particular cases.</P>
    <P>Special provision is made in section 12 in relation to the carrying out of development by an urban development commission, or development which is approved of by such a commission. Essentially, the approach is to treat such development in much the same way as development by State authorities is now treated under section 84 of the 1963 Planning Act.  This means that the normal planning control procedure will not apply and that a consultation procedure will be substituted.  There are, however, a number of important changes in the section 84 procedure.  First, the planning authority, when consulted, will have power to attach conditions in relation to the development; second, the Minister, when consulted in a case where the commission and the planning authority cannot resolve any differences, will have power to prohibit a development, where he thinks fit; <Col N="892" /> and third, provision is made for a form of public participation process which does not apply at present where development by State authorities is proposed. These arrangements should ensure that development in which urban development commissions are involved will not be unnecessarily delayed by reason of the application to them of a system designed primarily to regulate and control the activities of private developers rather than public authorities.  At the same time, the proposed arrangements respect the position of the planning authority concerned and should provide them with a reasonable opportunity to influence development in which a commission is involved.</P>
    <P>The regeneration of our inner urban areas will require concerted action by many agencies to radically improve the economic, social and physical condition of these areas.  No single authority can provide all the answers and it will only be through increased co-operation between the different agencies involved and, in particular, between the public and private sectors, that viable solutions can be devised and implemented.  The establishment of urban development commissions should not, therefore, be seen as a panacea for all the ills of rundown inner city urban areas.  On the contrary, responsibility for the regeneration of inner urban areas will largely remain with the local authorities, especially in their capacity as planning authorities, and, as I have already indicated, I will be working with these authorities to give a new impetus to their work.  It is only in cases of very special need that urban development areas and commissions will be established and section 2 of the Bill makes this clear.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the section allows for the creation of urban development areas not only in Dublin but in any other county borough, borough or urban district in the country.  That is not to say that the Government intend to extend the urban development commission widely in the initial stages.  It may well be that part of Cork county borough and an area in Limerick city, to mention two examples, would be suitable for designation as urban development areas and <Col N="893" /> I will be looking at this possibility in the future.  It has been decided, however, that it would be sensible and prudent to gain some experience of the new approach in two pilot areas before moving on to the designation of other areas, either in Dublin or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>As pilot projects, sections 2 and 3 of the Bill designate the Custom House docks development area and the Dublin walled city development area, both of which are located in Dublin.  As I said earlier, the problems of dereliction and decay are not peculiar to Dublin but there is no doubt that they are most acute there.  Dublin is the nation's capital and its physical condition is, therefore, a matter of more than local concern; the Dublin problem has, in fact, a regional and national dimension too.  It is for these reasons that the two pilot projects are located there.  The two areas in question are interesting from the historical point of view and each has great and distinctive potential for development and redevelopment. While they are obvious candidates as the pilot development areas, it may be of assistance to the House to fill in some of the background and to elaborate somewhat on our hopes for these areas.  Before doing so, I should mention that I have arranged to have maps of each of these areas placed in the Oireachtas Library for the information and assistance of Members.</P>
    <P>The Custom House docks development area essentially consists of the large area, now in the ownership of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, which the board themselves have sought to redevelop. This unique site has been described in the board's 1980 planning application as a redundant port facility but which has potential in relation to a range of other activities because of its relationship to the city centre.  Having regard to the location of the site and the exciting possibilities presented by its availability for redevelopment, the Fianna Fáil Government had been considering, before the June 1981 general election, what arrangements should be made to secure the redevelopment of the site in a fitting manner. The matter was also considered by the Coalition Government during their <Col N="894" /> period of office but no definite plans emerged.  It has now been decided that the area should become an urban development area and, therefore, the responsibility of an urban development commission; sections 2 and 3 of the Bill provide accordingly.</P>
    <P>The first Custom House Dock, directly east of the Custom House, was a project which involved John Beresford and James Gandon, the team responsible for the construction of the Custom House itself.  This dock, of course, no longer exists.  The remaining dock system, completed over 150 years ago, consists of the larger Inner Dock and the smaller and outer George's Dock, both connected to the river Liffey by a sea-lock.</P>
    <P>The docks have now been reduced to a tidal state and no ship has entered them for some ten years.  The docks' peak phase of activity had, in fact, ceased by the time the newly-established Dublin Port and Docks Board took over ownership of the site from the Revenue Commissioners in 1869 and the adequacy of the docks for the size of ship using the port, even then, was in question.  Now, the main port area has moved to new positions down river and out into the bay itself, thus opening up a substantial gap between the site and the rest of the board's jurisdiction on the north side of the river.</P>
    <P>Although the docks are no longer in use, warehouses on the site are still operated by the Port and Docks Board's Warehousing Department.  Much of the total space dates from early in the last century and, according to the board's planning application, the warehouses are operated at a low level of use because they are not suited to modern goods handling techniques and are inconveniently located, cut off from other port activities. A significant number of men are employed in connection with these warehouses, but there is no question of putting these men out of work when the new commission are established.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill enables land within the Custom House Docks Development Area to be transferred to the new commission on a phased basis, according as progress is made by the Port and Docks <Col N="895" /> Board with the relocation of essential warehousing facilities.  It will be a matter in the first instance for the new commission and the Port and Docks Board to agree a programme for the handing over of the site to the commission.  Ultimate responsibility will lie with the Minister who will have power under the legislation to make orders providing for the actual transfers of land.  Under section 8 the consideration to be paid by the commission to the board is to be determined by agreement, or in default of agreement, the consideration will be determined by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Transport.  The criteria on which such determination must be made are set out in the section: essentially what is proposed is that the consideration should be such as will enable the board to provide essential replacement facilities elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The redevelopment in a balanced manner of the Custom House Docks site will be a challenging task for the new commission. There will be scope for housing and industrial development as well as offices and amenity development.  Some of the existing structures have conservation potential and the commission will have to take this into account.  I am confident, too, that they will endeavour to capitalise on the riverside location of the site.  The redevelopment will have to be phased to fit in with the relocation of essential warehousing, but when it is completed I am confident that Dublin will have acquired a new neighbourhood of which we can all be proud.</P>
    <P>The second pilot project for which provision is made in sections 2 and 3 of the Bill will be very different from the Custom House Docks development project. The Government were anxious to select an area on the southside of Dublin and which would involve a different approach and enable experience to be gained in an area where the land is partly in private and partly in public ownership.</P>
    <P>The area of the medieval walled city was a rather obvious choice.  This area properly can be described as the historic core of Dublin.  It still contains the seat of city government as well as Dublin <Col N="896" /> Castle, Christchurch Cathedral and other structures of note.  It is an area with very great potential.  It has been the subject of much controversy in recent years.  The fact is that, while Georgian Dublin has been singled out for special attention within the framework of the Planning Acts for quite some time, it is only in relatively recent times that the general public and the public authorities have become conscious of the importance of Dublin as a Viking town and of its significance in medieval times.  Indeed, it was not until the excavations in the 1960s at High Street and Winetavern Street that interest in Dublin's medieval origins developed.</P>
    <P>We need to appoint in Dublin, and indeed elsewhere in the country, a city architect who would be able to add immensely to redevelopment in areas of archaeological importance.  He should be appointed by the local authority and work within the framework of the local authority so that we would not only have development but preservation.  I will give the impression of one writer on the subject:</P>
    <P>Medieval Dublin lies hidden from view, buried in the mists of time or beneath the present street level.  Little that is genuinely medieval now greets the eye.  Portions of the defences and of a few churches still survive, but most of these have been extensively refaced or altered in other ways.  The basic street pattern laid down in the Middle Ages remains more or less intact, though many minor streets and alleyways have been obliterated and major streets have been widened during the last two centuries.  Streets that once were full of colour and life present a grey, sombre appearance and an eerie, unnatural air of dereliction.</P>
    <P>The rather depressing situation described in this extract from the note on medieval Dublin published by the Ordnance Survey in 1978, with their map of the medieval town in the modern city, has not come about overnight.  Neither would it be realistic to suggest that the situation can be transformed overnight. I was speaking to an architect recently <Col N="897" /> who said that the decay of Dublin started more than 100 years ago but it is only recently that people began to realise it had reached such proportions.</P>
    <P>I am confident, however, that the establishment of an urban development commission, with special responsibility for the regeneration of the area, will have a major impact and that with imagination and drive, the area can be restored.  It can assume a new vitality and attractiveness for those who live and work in and adjoining it as well as for Dubliners in general and for visitors from elsewhere in the country, and from overseas.  On Sunday I was in St. Audoen's Church, which dates back to 650 AD.  It has been restored and at the moment it is being put forward as a main tourist attraction in the city.  It will have a small adjoining park.  That is the kind of restoration and renewal that can be carried out in an aggressive manner.</P>
    <P>It will, of course, be a matter for the Urban Development Commission to decide in the first instance how best the regeneration of the area might be secured and the nature and extent of the development which should be carried out for that purpose.  However, I would like to think that, where possible, the commission would attempt to recover and highlight and illuminate sections of the city wall and to bring back to the areas trades and crafts which have been shown by archaeological excavations to have been carried on extensively in the area in the past.  These include bronzeworking, weaving, leatherworking and woodworking. In addition, one would hope that cultural facilities, including small museums and art galleries, might be attracted to the area, that small landscaped areas would be introduced and that appropriate shopping, restaurant and other facilities would be developed. Additional residential development to cater both for families and for single people would certainly be desirable, with the emphasis on achieving a balanced community.  The possibilities, indeed, are very great and, for this reason, I expect that the commission will give priority to the preparation, under section 6 of the Bill, of an appropriate planning scheme, <Col N="898" /> taking account of the character and special features of the area and of consultations with Dublin Corporation, as well as submissions from interested persons. There are other agencies doing very fine work in the city, for example, An Taisce, Friends of Medieval Dublin and so on.</P>
    <P>I should explain that the definition of the Dublin walled city development area used in the Bill is based on the 1978 Ordnance Survey publication entitled: &ldquo;Dublin c840 to c1540: the Medieval Town in the Modern City&rdquo;.  The designated development area is essentially the area within the medieval walled city as represented on the Ordnance Survey map and as shown on various representations of Speed's Map of 1610.  However, it has been necessary, in line with standard practice in defining local government areas, to proceed by reference to the centre lines of streets.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are other areas of historical and archaeological interest adjacent to the boundary of the development area and that there is also a need for the regeneration of these areas.  However, the best approach seemed to be to define an identifiable central core area in the first instance, leaving it open to the Dublin Walled City Development Commission to make proposals to alter the boundary of the area, if this is shown to be desirable in the light of planning and other surveys which the commission will no doubt undertake.  The Minister, under section 2(3) of the Bill, will be empowered, by order, to make such alterations. Apart from the central core area, as soon as work starts in this locality an increased awareness will develop relating to our archaeological treasures and past, and people will develop a more healthy respect for our ancient buildings and make an effort to do something about them.  I believe that now financially it is a worth-while proposition to renew rather than demolish and build again, apart from the aesthetic aspect.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in section 9 of the Bill for the transfer of land, by Ministerial order, from a statutory body to an urban development commission.  Such a transfer can be made only where the land is not being used by, or is not required by, <Col N="899" /> the statutory body concerned and, as in the case of section 8, a special basis of compensation is being provided for.  This section could be of some significance in relation to the Dublin walled city development area and other similar areas which may be designated in the future.  It will provide a convenient mechanism for making expeditious transfers of land to urban development commissions to enable them to make progress with the regeneration of their areas.  It will also enable firm action to be taken, where appropriate, to meet the allegation which is frequently heard, that a significant proportion of derelict and vacant sites are owned by statutory bodies.</P>
    <P>Apart from the transfers of land which may be effected under section 9, an urban development commission in an area such as the Dublin walled city development area will have to acquire land for itself within the area, in so far as it considers this to be necessary for the purpose of securing the regeneration of its area.  Provision for the compulsory purchase of land by urban development commissions is, therefore, included in section 7 of the Bill.  In addition to directly acquiring land for development or redevelopment, I will be looking to commissions to explore various other ways and means of bringing about development, redevelopment and renewal by other agencies, whether public or private.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that the initiation of development and redevelopment by urban development commissions within their areas will have a pump-priming effect.  It should have a significant impact on the activities and investment programmes of private sector bodies and I hope that these bodies will be attracted to locate their own new developments in appropriate inner city locations, thereby making a significant contribution to the overall renewal of these areas.  I am confident that section 11 of the Bill, which will enable rates remission to be provided on a selective basis in respect of premises in urban development areas, will prove to be an important additional incentive to development in these areas.  Consideration will also be given to providing <Col N="900" /> additional incentives for the carrying out of development of appropriate kinds and for the establishment of suitable trades and business in urban development areas.  In particular, it is intended to examine the question of providing for appropriate tax reliefs in respect of trades and business which might be particularly suited to these areas.</P>
    <P>The Government are strongly committed to the development and revitalisation of inner urban areas and it is intended that public authorities generally should play their part in a new drive to meet this objective.  In the last analysis, however, much will depend on the private sector. I have just mentioned the question of inducements and incentives but there is also another way of looking at this matter. Almost 150 years ago, Thomas Drummond &mdash; a Scotsman who was one of the most able and enlightened of those who held the post of Under-Secretary in Ireland &mdash; wrote to an Irish landlord to remind him that &ldquo;property has its duties as well as its rights&rdquo;.  A statue of Drummond still stands, with the sculptured figures of Grattan and O'Connell, in Dublin's City Hall, within the area of the medieval walled city.  It would not be inappropriate for me on this occasion to remind the owners of property within our urban areas generally, and in particular within urban development areas, that for them, too, property has its duties as well as its rights.  For far too long a selfish attitude has prevailed in Dublin, which has been almost a scorched earth policy without concern for preserving the aesthetic beauty of our cities and towns.  I wish to state emphatically that my responsibility will be to endeavour to safeguard against indiscriminate badly contrived plans which would mar the city. Properties in central urban areas are inherently valuable and it is wrong that they should be allowed to decay or to remain derelict, or vacant, or underused. I should like to mention an excellent exhibition which is on display at present and which I had the privilege of opening. It is by the Institute of Architects at No. 8 Merrion Square.</P>
    <P>Property owners must face up to their <Col N="901" /> obligations to the community at large and, to ensure that they do so, the government propose to use persuasion as well as inducement.  In particular, it is proposed to introduce a system of taxation of derelict sites so as to discourage the hoarding of property for profit and the resulting urban blight.  It is galling to see some of the awful hoarded up sites in Dublin at present, not to mention other cities and towns, with indiscriminate flyposting going on without any consideration whatever for the appearance of our cities.  This Bill, coupled with the stringent measures being taken in the Litter Bill, should go a long way towards improving the appearance of our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>It is also intended to review the compulsory purchase system and the Derelict Sites Act with a view to facilitating and expediting the acquisition by public authorities of derelict and decaying property.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the proposal to establish a statutory Dublin Inner City Development Authority.  The preparation of the necessary legislation is at a very advanced stage and it is proposed to introduce the Bill this session.  Both the Custom House docks development area and the Dublin walled city development area will fall within the area of the proposed authority.  However, there will be no duplication of responsibilities or conflict of interests between the commissions and the authority.  As I have already explained, the functions of the commissions will lie mainly in the acquisition of land for development and re-development and securing the implementation of schemes of physical re-development and renewal of various kinds.  On the other hand, the proposed Dublin Inner City Development Authority will have responsibility for supplementing the work of a variety of agencies affecting the inner city and will play an active role in promoting co-ordination of investment and of relevant programmes and activities of public bodies.  In addition, the proposed Authority will have its own special fund to enable it to make grants for economic and social development purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="902" /> An explanatory memorandum detailing the various provisions in the Bill has already been circulated.  I have, therefore, concentrated my remarks on the broad features of the new approach, for which the Bill provides, to the regeneration of designated urban areas of special need.  I am confident that this special effort will be welcomed by the community as a whole and I have no hesitation, therefore, in commending the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is the first opportunity I have had I should like to express my very belated congratulations to the Minister of State on his appointment and wish him well in that role.  I might say that if the capacity and the enterprise he displayed in his career as a City Councillor in Dublin Corporation is any evidence on which to go I have no doubt that his career as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment will be a highly successful one and I wish him well.  We wish him well also in carrying through the aspirations he has just expressed in his introductory remarks.  Whether or not the provisions of the Bill are adequate to deal with those aspirations remains to be seen.  But, in so far as the principle of the Bill clearly represents one step in heightening an awareness of urban problems and of introducing a structure seeking to tackle them, then it should be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, one must have major reservations about the Bill, particularly about its scope and the degree to which it will have real teeth in dealing with the enormous problems facing our city.  I believe the Bill is very light in the area of real body and soul, real gut commitment to the problems and skirts easily around some of the fundamental issues.  It was almost as an aside, towards the very end of the Minister's remarks, that he referred to some of the most crucial areas.  For example, he referred to the need to deal with derelict sites, a review of the compulsory purchase order system and the Derelict Sites Act.  Those are very close to the heart of some of the problems confronting our city.  The act of the commission, which facilitates the designation of an area as an urban development <Col N="903" /> area, in itself will not resolve one area of the problem, it will not mean one derelict site less or one derelict building less <i>per se</i>.  It is only the degree to which the commission is, first of all, statutorily empowered to act and, secondly, empowered financially to act that it will be successful. Indeed, the very concept of the commission itself warrants some examination. I know the Minister hinted at it in his speech but, quite frankly, it is not clear to me that the setting up of this commission, as proposed, is that powerful an innovation in itself.  It seems to me to have grasped the concept that some form of authority was necessary but to have fallen short on how far that authority could have been given real power. The powers that this commission, or these commissions, will be carrying out are at present almost totally the powers and responsibilities of local authorities. Therefore, it would be reasonable to examine the degree to which local authorities have carried out their functions in this respect, to ascertain whether or not they have failed particularly with regard to the problems which are the kernal of concern in this Bill, to ascertain whether or not we could remedy that situation without the need to set up more levels of bureaucracy about whose real power and real teeth there is not great clarity at present.</P>
    <P>However, I accept fully the essential goodwill of the Minister in this respect. There is a growing awareness right across the political spectrum, and I hope in our society, that the problems of our cities and of urban decay and degeneration constitute a very great challenge which, if allowed continue on their present course, will result in massive tracts of urban areas being blighted, unsightly and inhabited only by those who have not the strength, youth or resources to get out of them.  That epitomises very largely the city centre of Dublin at present which is really a reflection on the lack of will there has been in this House over the years. The facility we have afforded people in positions of responsibility, whether in Government or as private property owners, to turn their backs on their responsibilities <Col N="904" /> and allow such a set of circumstances to arise is surely a shame and has created an environment in the centre of large urban areas which is inhospitable and inimical to family life, to proper schooling for young people, to jobs, decent housing and all of those values we hold dear.</P>
    <P>This problem is not purely an Irish one. However, because we have now been witnessing for some decades the degeneration of urban areas in some other western democracies, we should have been able to learn from their mistakes. The challenge of the city is a very great one, one on which there is a vast amount of literature.  One of the essential truths that comes through to me as least is that there is ideally an optimum size for cities, that above and beyond that optimum size &mdash; which, if I remember correctly professor Schumacher in his work <i>Small is Beautiful</i> put at about half a million people, but which is open to argument and discussion &mdash; there should be positive discouragement by Governments and State bodies towards the <i>laissez faire</i> development of that city.</P>
    <P>We will not, obviously, in a democracy, ever get into a situation where you build a wall around a place and say that is the finish of the development of the city.  We should be able to have a system of national planning which will ensure that our cities and our towns develop, in the context of a plan which has been worked out and which has a high aspiration, the quality of life of the citizens of those areas, which seeks to encourage planning and developing as far as those parameters are concerned and which positively discourages such developments once they go beyond those limits. If we do not do that we are like the boy trying to keep his finger in the dyke and ultimately the problems of urban areas will overwhelm us because of their integrated and very complex nature.</P>
    <P>The real need in urban areas is for what presently is ostensibly carried on by local authorities, a form of local government, but that expression is really a misnomer as presently applied to local authorities whose role is not local in many cases, if we think of some of the larger authorities, <Col N="905" /> and is certainly not government and has been less so in recent years since the rating power was taken from them, although there are many good reasons for that.  We have an increasing plethora of bodies, whose ostensible function is to govern areas, to impact on them quickly and right across a whole range of social and economic areas, with a view to achieving the desired ends with which I believe all of this House agree but who neither in the past nor in this Bill, if I correctly get the glimmer of the inner city authorities, are not being entrusted with the relevant powers.</P>
    <P>I can give a simple graphic example. At the moment the Minister will be familiar with a Dublin Corporation plan for what is called the designated area.  It is a housing plan and is no more than that.  It cannot be more than a housing plan unless a local authority, an urban area commission or an inner city authority are empowered with the ability to ensure that the education environment, the traffic and transport environment, the jobs environment and the other areas of the environment along with the housing environment, can be organised and planned for in an integrated fashion.</P>
    <P>Building houses <i>per se</i> is not the answer to the problem no more than it will be the answer to the problem to clear up some derelict sites, although I do not for a second decry the great advantage that would be in a city, where it is now almost impossible to walk any street without witnessing the hoardings to which the Minister referred.  Those hoardings and those sites are a symptom of the way our society has developed and that is what we should be dealing with.</P>
    <P>We should be dealing with the basic disease not just the symptoms.  Those symptoms clearly reflect an attitude in our society and, in particular, in relation to the way we run our cities that says it is all right and acceptable for people to buy up property and allow it to become derelict over years while they amass a site; that it is acceptable for public agencies, including the Minister's Department, local authorities and the health boards to amass the same property and, on the basis of a calculation carried out by the <Col N="906" /> students in Bolton Street about three years ago, which was a fairly scientific study, to amass as much as one-third of such derelict sites in the hands of such public bodies.  The scale of those sites and those buildings is very extensive. There are no figures which one can accept as scientifically the last word in this respect but estimates show that there are probably 2,000 and 2,500 acres of derelict land in Dublin alone within the city boundary.  That is based on an extrapolation of a sample area which shows that 9 per cent of the land area of Dublin city is derelict.  That is an incredible waste of resources and we are allowing it to happen.</P>
    <P>This will not change by appointing a commission of people with all the goodwill in the world, who, I see, are to be self-financing, although the manner in which they are to raise their revenue is not spelled out, and by changing nothing else.  Local authorities, for example, cannot develop their areas of responsibility because of the antiquated compulsory purchase order procedures.  A one-line aspiration in a 20-page speech on such an important topic towards reviewing the present compulsory purchase order legislation is not adequate.  That commission cannot function unless it can insist on speedy acquisition of land.  That is not to say that the rights of people involved should in any way be kaleidoscoped or denigrated.  It really means that the present infinite appeal to the courts, which can go on generation after generation, should be looked at.  There is no reasonable acceptable excuse for discussion and negotiation over a small piece of land which a local authority want to acquire over a period of 25 years, which is presently going on.  The Minister is probably aware of this himself but I can certainly give him details of it.</P>
    <P>This commission, if we are not careful, may very well be like the exercise of, as somebody said on one occasion, rearranging the furniture on the Titanic, although I hope it is not.  I wish the commission every success but I am afraid that we are dealing with symptoms rather than the basic disease here unless we give this commission the real teeth and the real <Col N="907" /> power which it should have.  That begs a question in relation to local authorities which I will not go into in detail except to say that I am not convinced, despite being very dissatisfied with the way many of our local authorities perform in many respects, that an adjunct of a local authority or part of the local authority's operations could not have been streamlined to deal with this problem rather than another layer of bureaucracy which, by virtue of what the Minister says and by virtue of common sense, will have to consult regularly with the local authorities and there will be tension between them.  The local authority will draw up the draft development plan, the commission will make a submission to the local authority and <i>vice versa.</i> I am not sure where the final responsibility will rest.  I believe it will cloud the issue to some extent by getting progressive and smart development in areas.</P>
    <P>The number of bodies involved is not the primary factor.  It is the quality of their work and the ease with which they can work.  I believe the outdated laws in those areas, the derelict sites area, the compulsory purchase order procedure area, the ludicrous fines for derelict sites, the 1963 Planning Act, which I am sure must be the bane of planners' lives, are the primary factors.  I have spoken to unfortunate officials in local authorities who cannot get any action arising from this particular area because they are chasing an impossible arrangement which does not work.</P>
    <P>There is no specific commitment in this document or in the Minister's speech to a positive change in the law in this area. Unless those laws are changed we are wasting our time.  I suggest the commission, in particular, will be wasting their time.  The urban challenge we speak of is not just about the infrastructure of a city, it is not just about the aesthetics of a streetscape, it is not just about the derelict sites on the corner.  Why do those situations arise and what is the scale of the problem we are confronting?</P>
    <P>The problems of Dublin city are possibly not fully appreciated and the projected figures in any area of social or <Col N="908" /> economic activity are truly daunting in the light of our ability at present to cope even with existing problems.  The idea of an urban area commission and the idea of the two designated areas initially being in Dublin should not blind us to the reality of this being a national problem and that there are parts of almost all of our cities, particularly Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway, which could suitably be given this kind of treatment. Therefore I trust that the Minister will see fit to apply his attention in these respects also.  I am aware that he visited Cork recently and, while I do not know what the outcome of that was, I appreciate that the Cork people are very hospitable, so I am sure they gave him a fine welcome.  But other areas of other cities should be given similar attention.  In recent times one might be forgiven for thinking that the country began and ended not just in Dublin but in certain parts of Dublin.  We all know that is not the case.</P>
    <P>Regarding the kinds of problems we are facing, I would point out that the input papers to the recent draft development plan for Dublin city give us an idea of population trends.  We find that the growth of population in the Dublin region from 1966 to 1971 was 57,200 people compared with 37,100 for the rest of the country.  We find too that, while the Dublin population in 1971 constituted almost 30 per cent of the population of the rest of the State, the increase in Dublin in the period 1966 to 1971 constituted 60 per cent of the total increase. That is multiplying as the years pass.  This leads us to the conclusion that on this basis the population projection for 1991 would be 1,150,000 or an increase of 298 per cent in 20 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I remember, it was published in March 1979.  These figures basically are extracted from Dublin Corporation Planning Department's papers.  We are talking about an enormous logistical and demographic problem in terms of ordinary matters like housing, jobs and so on.</P>
      <P>Having regard, therefore, to the present unsatisfactory state of play, to the fact that by general admission we are unable to deal with the problems of urban decay, of urban blight and the challenge of urban renewal, by using these figures we can underline that the real challenge facing us between now and the end of the century is enormous and that consequently some radical and fundamental action is necessary.  Though I hope I am wrong, I am not satisfied that the commission we are talking of will represent that sort of action.  However, I suppose that, if one considers the commission as part of a full array of Government action and that if we got the other parts of the total spectrum, this commission might work.  But I do not consider that, even with the terms of reference to acquire and develop land, without the necessities I have mentioned earlier they will solve the problem.</P>
      <P>According to the same document the labour force projections for the same period, that is, 1971 to 1991, show a projected population based on natural increase of 1,150,000 or almost 300,000 more compared with the 1971 figures. The male labour force is estimated to grow in that 20-year period by 95,000 to 314,000.  That is a huge increase and, no matter what index one has regard to, whether it be a pupil-teacher ratio, a ratio relating to school places or to housing or to jobs, we realise that the problem of this city and of others is enormous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But how are we to tackle this situation? I am not suggesting that the Minister has tried to lead us to believe that the Urban Areas Development Bill is a panacea for all our ills.  It is not, but we should not set up any body unless they are given a meaningful role.  This brings us to the question of whether the body we are talking of have such a role.  Instead of cities being allowed to grow too large, of being <Col N="910" /> sprawling or unplanned, or of there being a <i>laissez-faire</i> approach to them, would it not be better if we got down to the fundamental issues in the context of a national planning policy, a planned policy for the development of cities and towns which had as their criteria the highest quality of life for the citizens, which would lay down, for example, that beyond certain levels of traffic density, of housing density and of population density, a city became less than desirable in terms of that quality of life?  We should discourage the growth of cities beyond that.  Obviously, we could do this by establishing other towns and cities, by way of positive inducement of grant schemes and by discrimination in favour of new industries in areas that would fulfil that stated policy.  I am talking about what is a major job, but one that has not been tackled to date.  Something on those lines is likely to be necessary.</P>
    <P>It seems that the Bill is concerned especially with the question of derelict property, with the issue of the acquisition and development of land.  That is only one facet of a huge problem, but probably not the fundamental facet because people who believe that land could be better or more gainfully employed by developing it would not allow it to become derelict.  When one is empowering a commission to acquire a piece of property that has become an eyesore one is dealing with the symptom but not with the basic problem.  Therefore, we must look at other solutions which the commission or the local authority could be empowered to apply.  One such solution that occurred to me recently in relation to the derelict sites problem is that these sites could be rated in the same way as other properties are rated, but apparently this is not possible because a derelict site does not have a rating value <i>per se</i>.  But if there is no incentive for people to transform their property into some living, organic, useful social unit, or if there are no sanctions against not doing it, they will not do so.  There may be a small minority who for very good reasons are unable to do so, though they would wish to be able to effect such development, but the majority of people owning <Col N="911" /> derelict land allow it to become derelict because it is easier and perhaps more profitable to do so, plus the fact that nobody really cares, that nobody will take the matter up with them and that their only problem will be the slight irritant of a local authority troubling them with pursuit under the Derelict Sites Act, 1963.  That is trouble that can be shrugged off easily and the legislation can be evaded without much difficulty.  I do not suppose that that Act was designed to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>It should be unrewarding for anyone to have derelict land or derelict properties, and one way of ensuring this would be to provide that the people concerned would pay the rated value annually and that that would be proportionate roughly to an aggregate assessment of what the land would return if used for some sensible purpose.  I am not talking about reintroducing rates on domestic property, but if we can bring about a situation in which it will not be rewarding for land owners to leave property sit in the way in which so much of it is sitting, we will be beginning to do something on one aspect of the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>What about the sacred constitutional rights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister dealt adequately with the question of constitutional rights when he referred to that well-known phrase enshrined, ironically enough, in City Hall, that is, that property has its duties as well as its rights.  I look forward to the day when some enterprising person or group tests this timehonoured and regular excuse for inaction in our system, that the rights of private property are sacred and enshrined in our Constitution.  So are many other things, including the duties of property in certain respects.  I do not think that is a major problem and if it is I encourage the Minister to take it on in the sure knowledge that he will have full public support.  No set of laws was designed to allow one group of people in our society &mdash; in this case people with property &mdash; to ride <Col N="912" /> roughshod over the rights of other people.  I have no doubt that that was never the spirit of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The question of how to tackle derelict sites is an area we have to deal with.  The only difficulty one would come up against is that apparently the position is that of the 100 per cent of derelict property in our State about one-third is clearly and evidently in the hands of private owners, where the owners are known and their ownership is admitted by them.  Roughly one-third is owned by public agencies, State boards, health boards, local authorities and so on and the final one-third is of unknown ownership.  Accordingly, one of the Minister's suggestions about the possibility of introducing a tax on derelict sites &mdash; my own proposal for a rated value is not dissimilar in content &mdash; might run into trouble in that respect because we do not know who to tax in respect of almost two-thirds of the derelict land.  Such a proposal would not result in the desired remedical action.  It is nonsensical, for example, that a local authority would tax themselves and it is not an answer if we do not know who the owners are.  Ultimately, we will have to move quickly towards the continental solution which is that if land is not used within a reasonable time and if every effort has been made to encourage the owners of it to convert it to good public and social use, or if the land is of unknown ownership the State should exercise its responsibility to acquire, as it is proposed the new commission would do, and develop such land.</P>
      <P>The example I saw in Belgium would be very helpful.  There, instead of having local authorities spending much money in pursuing owners who are hidden behind phalanxes of legal advisers and solicitors in order to avoid detection, they are permitted to append a notice to the derelict site asking the owner to come forward within a specified period or otherwise it would be assumed that there was not an owner and the property would become public property.  This may get a quick response from those who are shy to admit ownership of derelict land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in the course of his speech referred to a number of problems.  I am <Col N="913" /> pleased he is the first Minister of State with responsibility for urban affairs.  Initially, that was a Fine Gael proposal and was referred to in the document I dealt with earlier.  I am a little rueful about the fact that during our last session in Government we were too busy with the immediate priorities to get down to the important job of appointing such a Minister. I am pleased that the Government have made this appointment.  It shows good faith on their part towards accepting that there is a problem in urban areas.  I hope that we have sufficient courage as a society and as a Government to give the Minister the necessary powers.  That power will disturb a lot of people.  It will have to cut across various Government Departments and cut to the bone certain vested interests whose financial well being is based in some cases on seeing our cities being run down so that they can acquire sites and property.  The Minister must face a big challenge in this regard and not all of it is outside the parliamentary system or his own party.  The Minister has his hands full in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that one of his objectives was to assist and encourage existing agencies, particularly local authorities, in intensifying their efforts in the field of urban renewal.  The problem is that much of the area of debate in this regard is cluttered with such good wishes.  We all have that but what does it mean?  Does it mean that the law will be changed or that local authorities will get more power? Their intensification of effort in the field of urban renewal at present needs either better law and/or more resources.  Neither of those things are committed in the Bill.  Unless there is a commitment the Minister's hopes and good wishes in respect of local authorities will not yield fruit.</P>
    <P>We got the same type of echo in the Minister's remarks when he said he wished to emphasise that the establishment of urban development commissions did not mean that local authorities would not continue to have a key responsibility for promoting modernisation and improvement of their urban areas.  At face value the harmonisation of efforts between the commission and local <Col N="914" /> authorities seems a little unhappy.  I can foresee problems unless that integrated approach is worked out comprehensively, clearly and in full consultation with local authorities.  At present it looks a little unsettled and I am not sure how it will work out in practice.  For example, the local authority of which I am a member do not know anything about this proposal. They are unsure of their ground. To what extent will their power be diminished, to what extent will they now have to consult and perhaps have their actions slowed down by either level of bureaucratic control?  I am not that concerned whether or not a body such as a local authority have more or less power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is helpful but I am not that concerned about whether a body have more or less power.  The structure is purely the means to the end.  If, tomorrow, giving less power to a local authority meant that a job would be done in a superior way I would heartily endorse it. Frankly, I do not think that is the case here.  I am not hung up about the power of local authorities.  We should pursue the best way of doing the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told the House that the essential purpose of the Bill was to enable a new form of agency to be created to undertake and promote schemes of redevelopment and renewal in designated parts of urban areas.  I would like to think that the Minister had given full thought and concern to the reason for this new form of agency.  My experience is that once a new agency is set up it is almost impossible to dismember it.  I acknowledge that later in the Bill it is stated that once a commission has done its job it will cease.  Political and public service development here over the years do not show that.  Usually once a body is set up it will find some justification for being continued.  I accept that that could be changed but I would have looked to the local authorities first to see if we could <Col N="915" /> get them to do the job rather than setting up this other level.</P>
    <P>The Minister told the House that each commission will be expressly required to maintain as far as practicable a balance as between housing, industrial, commercial, social amenity and other developments in this area.  He said that this was an extremely important requirement because there was a widespread acceptance that the problems of many of our urban areas have been contributed to if not caused by a failure to secure balanced development.  That is the central point. However, the Bill, although it insists that the commission will be expressly charged with this responsibility, does not seem to give the power to the commission to do that.  That is the kernel of the matter and could be the Achilles' heel of the Bill.  I did not find anything in the Bill which empowered an agency to insist on a balanced housing, industrial, commercial, social and other development in an area. How can that be done?  For example, if the IDA decide to put a factory in a location and the commission feel it is not in the interests of the plan for the area who has the superior right to decide?  The integration of these authorities in line with the commission's work and based on goodwill all round will be a gargantuan task.  I can see all types of tensions and rivalries arising with one body saying that they were in first and as their first priority was to create jobs they would not be told by any mickey mouse commission which would be extinct within a few years what to do.  If we are going to charge a commission, or any other body, with the job of doing what the Minister said, the creation of a balanced environment, socially, economically and otherwise, we have to bite the bullet and give it the teeth.  We must make sure that whatever the amalgam of interests somebody will have the power to say at the end of the day the way a certain thing would go.</P>
    <P>We made an effort on our local authority to bring together in a special and permanent development committee those interests from those facets of the city's economic and social life.  We did so out of desperation because we recognised <Col N="916" /> the problem the Minister dealt with in his speech.  Because the input in these agencies and their ability to make a contribution is purely <i>ad hoc</i> and voluntary it does not work.  It does not work if, for example, any time you want a decision the gentleman representing a semi-State body must go back to his authority who see things in a national light and do not have this local, regionally focused approach, and that gentleman is not empowered to make a decision in his own right without waiting months for a board to decide on many national criteria. Therefore, there is no point in asking us to endorse or the commission to give effect to an arrangement which cannot be achieved by the structure being set up. The commission as proposed cannot do the job being asked of them if they are being asked to maintain, and I quote from the Minister's speech: &ldquo;a balance as between housing, industrial, commercial, social and other development in this area&rdquo;.  That is a governmental job which can be done only by a body to whom are entrusted powers right across the full range of social and economic areas placed regionally, a form of truly autonomous local government.  That was the ideal which is supposed to have been embodied in the local authorities but that has not happened.  That could be the essential weakness as regards this problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he hoped that these commissions would be able to attract new housing, services and industries to their areas as well as carrying out development directly themselves.  I tell the Minister that this is not in the Bill.  I cannot see any way whereby these bodies will have major grant-aiding functions and acquisition powers.  The financial arrangements are interesting and I will refer to them in a moment but they would militate against bringing about the desired end expressed by the Minister.  In passing I note that the chairman and members of the commission may not be members of either House of the Oireachtas or serve on the Assembly of European Communities but I am not sure that this is wise.  I see no reason why people who might have long experience of urban development in, say, the European situation <Col N="917" /> or are perhaps members of the European Parliament should not be at least equal to other citizens.  Nobody wants it cluttered up with TDs or Senators, but we should not be discriminated against as a body.  However, I am not making a meal of that, I mention it in passing.</P>
    <P>The financial arrangements are set out in section 18.  The Minister in his speech said that urban development commissions are not intended to become a major burden on the Exchequer.  That is reasonable. He went on to say that as far as property development activities are concerned the commission would be required to meet their operating expenditures from revenue and to be in a position to repay their borrowings.  As far as I can gather, therefore, the commission are expected not to make demands for finances on the Exchequer to be able to dispense tax, grants or other financial inducements to regenerated areas and to do it all within their own compass and fund-raising capability.  That in an ideal world would be nice, but I do not see how it will happen.  Let us assume that the commission are to start work tomorrow morning at, say, Earlsfort Terrace where a site is available at the moment. The site will cost a lot of money.  I do not know where the commission are to get the money tomorrow to enable them to enter into negotiations.  Is it envisaged that grants would be made available to the commission, or at some stage will they be able initially to borrow and, having developed the site or encouraged its development, realise revenue from the sale of that regenerated site and thereby pay off their borrowings?  How are they to function?  I would like to see a little more spelled out in that area because it seems to militate against the successful operation of the commission.  If we are to set up this kind of body then let us mean it and let us give them the powers, functions and finances they need.</P>
    <P>The co-ordination or integration between the local authority and the commission was referred to by the Minister. He talked about the planning scheme drawn up by the commission who, he said, would set out the manner in which <Col N="918" /> an urban development commission consider that the overall regeneration of such areas should be secured and would specify the kind of development which, in the opinion of the commission, should or should not be carried out in the area.  He went on to say that a planning scheme would not take the place of a development plan under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, that instead it would be a matter for the planning authority, having regard to the scheme, to review their plan and to make any necessary variations there.  It would appear from that that the plan produced by the commission would have superior status and rights and that the local authority would be obliged to conform, as it were, to the intentions of the commission's plan.  The Minister said that he hoped that planning authorities would go further than this in expressing development plans for any urban development areas for which planning schemes are prepared. That is commendable, but it is not clear from the Bill, the Explanatory Memorandum or the Minister's speech whether we are saying to local authorities &mdash; if we are saying it we should spell it out and the Minister said in parenthesis a few minutes ago that he gave assurances to the City Manager &mdash; that the Commission's plans have a status superior to a local authority's draft development plan. If that is the case, that is a major, significant change from the planning law arrangement.  I am not saying whether one would support that, but if it is the case we should at least not do it by stealth even if that is not deliberate.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech referred to the regeneration of our urban areas being based on concerted action by many agencies to improve radically the economic, social and physical condition of these areas.  He said that no single authority could provide all the answers and that it would be only through increased co-operation between the different agencies involved and in particular between the public and private sectors that valuable solutions could be devised and implemented. Voluntary controls and well-intentioned appeals to people engaged in this area of commercial development <Col N="919" /> probably are a waste of time.  The only two stimuli at work are on the one hand positive inducement, making it more profitable for people to do X rather than Y and, on the other hand, definite, clear and very telling sanctions.  Neither of those exists at present.  In any planned framework for urban regeneration we should have very strong reference to both, to the tax, financial and other possible inducements on the one hand and on the other hand to very clear, salutary sanctions.</P>
    <P>Dereliction is only a form of vandalism. It is a very serious form of anti-social behaviour and, coming as it does from people of property and substance it is particularly reprehensible.  If we are serious about it we will make sure that it stops.  The only way that can happen is by encouraging in positive ways those who own their property to develop it and if they fail to do so, then by making it painfully clear to them that it does not pay.  Unfortunately, at the moment it does pay.</P>
    <P>That brings us to major issues affecting the control of, for example, the price of building land, some aspects of the Kenny Report and other areas that I do not wish to deal with now but where action is long overdue.  Unless the commission are to act in the sure and certain knowledge that that kind of approach will be taken &mdash; a tough, meaningful approach that will have teeth &mdash; we are wasting our time here.  It has not worked in the past, it is not working now and unless we take the proper approach it will not work in the future.  The Minister says that he will be working with these authorities &mdash; the local authorities &mdash; to give a new impetus to their work.  I should be greatful if the Minister would elaborate on that because I am not clear how it is to happen.</P>
    <P>Two specific areas are referred to and I am very pleased to see that they are to be given priority attention.  I am slightly suspicious about the reasons for the decision in relation to one of these areas north of the Liffey in the middle of my own constituency.  This constituency is shared by four other Deputies, one of whom is very familiar to the Government <Col N="920" /> and with whom the Taoiseach had extensive negotiations.  Presumably good will come from it for the people who live in the area and about that I am quite happy.  I will be doing everything I can to see that every aspect of the agreement is implemented in full.  However, I am not sure any more what an agreement is following the statement today by the Minister for Agriculture that commitments made a couple of weeks ago are not commitments any longer.

      <P>The site in the area of the Custom House presents a wonderful opportunity for an enterprising Government or Department since it consists of 27 acres and is probably the largest area available for redevelopment.  Very good work has already been done by the Dublin Port and Docks Board in consultation with the local authority.  If designation of that area as an urban area suitable for treatment by this commission will help, then I am very pleased, but I do not think that the declaration of it <i>per se</i> is adequate.  At least it opens the door and I wish the venture good luck, as I do in respect of the old Viking area about which the Minister spoke very eloquently. I know he has long had an interest in this area.</P>
      <P>It would be wonderful if the vision outlined in the Minister's speech were to come true.  We would have a city truly revitalised where people could enjoy a high quality of life, where families would not be terrorised by crime and vandalism and by the ravages of traffic, noise, dirt and pollution.  All this can be achieved if we have the will and that is my essential concern about the commission.  It is a step in the right direction but I am not sure if the step is big enough or tough enough.  We will suspend judgment and give the Minister every opportunity of showing us that he means business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> Despite the Minister's assurance that there is no question of the men employed in these warehouses being thrown out of work, I know that there is concern and perhaps the Minister would give them more concrete assurances.  People look to what they have and worry about the impact of any new development.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of the Minister's speech towards re-establishing small craft-type industries in some of the inner city enclaves.  I have long felt that we should concentrate a great deal more of our industrial and commercial efforts on the skills we have or had in the recent past and on the small industries employing up to three people.  That is the kind of development which is appropriate to a city.  If we can recreate a working environment in which it is possible to reinvest and locate industry, without the place being burned down when one's back is turned, we will get life again in Dublin.  By international standards Dublin is not an enormous city and it should be possible for us to deal successfully with its problems in an organised and comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the possibility of providing cultural facilities in these areas, including small museums and art galleries.  I would support such a proposal and would ask him to consider discussing with his colleagues, particularly in the Department of Education, the possibility of taking the wraps off some of the possessions of the State and using them as a basis on which to establish small cultural exhibitions.  Some of these items are in a disgraceful condition and some, having had public money spent on refurbishing them, are literally out in the rain.  There is room within the Government's own resources to give real meaning to the Minister's good intentions.  If a suitable location were obtained there would be a happy marriage of public enterprise and the private sector.</P>
    <P>A central question for the commission relates to the transfer of land by ministerial order from a statutory body to an urban development commission.  This is dealt with in section 9.  The Minister said that such a transfer can be made only <Col N="922" /> where the land is not being used by or is not required by the statutory body concerned and that a special basis of compensation is being provided for.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that statement. I know of no land in the possession of any local authority or statutory body which on their own statement is not being used or is not required by them.  If the local authority or statutory body are simply asked whether the land is required by them and we accept their response, seciton 9 will not have any effect because nobody will admit to not requiring the land either now or in the future.  We should be slightly tougher and give them a certain period in which to develop the land, telling them that if they fail to do so the commission will take it over and do the job.</P>
    <P>A tough approach to land, land prices and development would, I have no doubt, elicit a massive response from the public.  The average citizen is thoroughly fed up with the state of our city.  If the Minister takes the necessary measures he will find that it will be rewarding not only in that the city will become a better place in which to live but also it will be politically rewarding.  At present people are on the verge of giving up.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned bill posting. Under existing legislation, despite the fact that on every street corner these obnoxious posters appear, it is theoretically impossible to convict the people who are making money from this because allegedly they may not be posted by them or by people acting on their behalf.  Such nonsense should not be tolerated.  On one occassion I tried to pursue this issue in relation to a particular individual but that person swore in court that he had nothing to do with it and it was up to the person bringing the prosecution to prove that he or somebody acting on his behalf was responsible.  A law which allows for that kind of weakness&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that properties in central urban areas are inherently valuable and it is wrong that they should be allowed to decay or to remain derelict or vacant or underused. He goes on to say that it is proposed to introduce a system of taxation of derelict sites to discourage the hoarding of property for profit with the resulting urban blight.  I would like the Minister to elaborate on this.  We had this statement first of all in a document prior to the vote on the nomination of the Taoiseach recently.  It was reiterated in that same form in the budget speech by the Minister, Deputy MacSharry, and it is here again.  I would like to know to what extent that proposal has been developed and whether or not we can expect action on that soon.  If there is some positive action to deal with this question along the lines of a tough sanction then there is some hope of the commissions actually doing good work.</P>
      <P>Finally I would like to wish the Bill and the commissions every success.  I hope they will be successful.  The reservations I have expressed come from a long-time interest and concern in the policy activity in my own party in this area.  If there is any doubt at all in my mind about these commissions being effective it relates essentially to the question of whether or not the commissions are going to have sufficient authority and sufficient power to do the job.  Secondary to that is the question of co-ordination with the work of local authorities.  If the Minister could deal with both of those issues I would be very grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to respond to this Bill in a constructive and, I hope, relevant manner.  I would like, without in any way denigrating the commitment of <Col N="925" /> the Minister of State for urban affairs to attack what I consider to be the central weakness of this Bill which seems to be something peculiar to Fianna Fáil.  I would describe it as embodying yet again central government elitism.  The Minister says that the membership of the commissions will not be ordinary people who manage to get themselves elected.  That is far too dangerous a thing to undertake. On the contrary &mdash; and I quote the Minister &mdash;&ldquo;membership will need to be representative of a wide range of disciplines including people with experience in local government and public administration.&rdquo; A nod is as good as a wink to a blind person and we are going to have former Departmental officials prominent on these commissions.</P>
      <P>Why am I attacking what I have described as Fianna Fáil's obsession with central government elitism?  I am attacking it because its record in local government has been universally disastrous. Fianna Fáil introduced the City and County Managers Acts back in the thirties. Section 4, which is the sole saving grace of it, was brought in in 1955 or 1956 by the Coalition Government of that day. Already in this administration we have heard the Minister say that that is going to disappear.  In every sphere that Fianna Fáil can get their hands on in relation to local government they take more and more power away from the local authority and vest it in the Custom House in the extraordinary belief that the people in the Custom House know best.  We have heard it in relation to finance with the abolition of rates with the consequent destruction of local authority autonomy throughout the country, and every member of a local authority realises that and the Minister realises it.  We have had it in relation to the way in which local authorities are confined in what they can do and in what they cannot do.  But in this instance we are now having central government yet again with its elitist, know-all attitude sticking its head into areas of local development on the basis that it knows best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to remind the House about the last time a Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government or urban affairs drastically <Col N="926" /> altered the balance between central and local government and interfered in the basis of the housing problem of the day and demonstrated that central government knew best and that the local authorities did not know best.  I refer to that golden wonder that was going to be the jewel in the crown of the administration of the time which is known today as Ballymun.  The Ballymun complex, the system of building, the form of building and the planning organisation was rammed down the throats of the elected members of Dublin Corporation and the officials against the advice of the housing committee and against the advice of the housing manager of the time, the now retired Jim Molloy.  Who knew best in the end, the local authority or the elitist people in the Custom House?  Having done that ignominious deed in relation to the expertise that had been acquired and accumulated over the years on housing, they made the situation worse by then changing the way in which housing was procured generally and enforced upon local authorities the system of the guaranteed order scheme.  This again was another brain child from central government overriding the collective experience and wisdom of the local authorities to the extent that we had the scandal of housing estates throughout the country but most spectacularly in Finglas South and in Cork where disaster occurred and where ultimately the unfortunate tennants or the public taxpayers had to pick up the bill.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am opening my remarks, I hope, in a constructively critical manner, by saying there is no reason for this House, to believe that there is deposited in the Custom House, particularly when Fianna Fáil are in Government, some unique form of knowledge that is implicitly better than that of the local authorities on the ground.  That is the first marker I want to put down in relation to this Bill, because this Bill starts to go down the same path and it should be checked and identified and the Minister should very clearly respond to it.  Let us have no doubt about this whatsoever.  We are not just talking about the Gregory deal in relation to the Port and Docks <Col N="927" /> Board site or some kind of consciencesaving measure for the damage that was done to Wood Quay.  That section of the Bill empowers the Minister to designate any other site that he feels is required. We are opening a Pandora's box here in which we are not only going to throw out the baby of local democracy which is essential to this country but we are going to have central government elitism with its known track record in relation to Ballymun and the guaranteed housing scheme operating again in an area where the local authority is being consistently bypassed.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make &mdash; and it is an extension of my first &mdash; is that Fianna Fáil in occupation in the Custom House seem to have a most extraordinary disgust for local democracy or for an independent voice outside either the Cabinet or the permanent government or the civil service, because embodied in this legislation is the return of a beast that we thought we had killed in 1976. Indeed, we were talking about it in the House earlier today.  In 1976 we finally killed the corrupting abuse of ministerial appeals in relation to planning authorities and planning decisions.  In this legislation we have the possibility for ministerial appeal.  That is a retrograde step.  I am referring specifically to the section which proposes that where a commission and a planning authority cannot agree on the nature and form of the development that should take place, instead of appealing to An Bord Pleanála, the final authority, they are obliged to appeal to the Minister. That is a backward step which we will certainly oppose.</P>
    <P>The House should pause before going into the detail of the comprehensive speech given by the Minister and the substantial comments made by Deputy Keating and go into the origin of this legislation.  With the agreement of the House it might be far easier for us to enable the Fianna Fáil minority Government to deliver on their deal to Deputy Gregory-Independent and not complicate matters by bringing in superflous legislation which has a very dangerous <Col N="928" /> tendency to undermine the last remaining props of local democracy.</P>
    <P>The memory of the Minister for Agriculture might not be very sound in this regard but I am quoting from Volume 333 of the Official Report, 9 March 1982, when Deputy Gregory-Independent told the House how he had finally come to decide for which candidate he would vote.  At column 26 he said:</P>
    <P>Specifically, my decision is based on a clear difference in response from Deputy Haughey and Deputy FitzGerald. Given the commitment by Deputy Haughey, witnessed and signed by the General Secretary of Irish Transport and General Workers Union, I had no alternative but to support a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Among the many things signed into that commitment, and witnessed, was the subject of the legislation we were discussing today, the National Community Development Agency.  At column 27 Deputy Gregory-Independent said:</P>
    <P>The controversial and disruptive motorway plan will not now be proceeded with.  The vital 27 acres on the Port and Docks Board site will be nationalised and developed along lines geared to the needs of centre city communities.</P>
    <P>That is the godfather to this legislation. As I said on numerous occasions, given half an opportunity to introduce legislation relating to local government, irrespective of motivation, there seems to be this extraordinary pressure in the Custom House to strip away further powers and autonomy from local authorities and to take them back into the Custom House. It might be far easier and more effective to bring in a very short Bill enabling the Minister for the Environment, with the agreement of the Minister for Transport, to get from the Dublin Port and Docks Board the 27 acres in question and allocate them to Irish Life in consultation with Deputy Gregory-Independent and his team of advisers and proceed forth-with with that development.  Why clutter up the Order Paper of this House and pretend that this Bill is more than that? <Col N="929" /> This is a delivery on a political deal.  It is a dangerous delivery because it sets a dangerous precedent and local authorities will be under severe attack.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in attempting to suggest that this legislation addressed itself to a wider scale, talked about the problems in Dublin generally.  I have no doubt, because I have known the man since 1974 when we were both elected at the same time to Dublin Corporation, that he is very sincere in his concern, but this Bill in its present form will not go very far to deal with the problems we all recognise are in Dublin.  Let us put on record, as the Minister and Deputy Keating did, the extent of those problems because, with respect to other Members of this House, this Bill is designed to meet not only the political deal made between Deputy Gregory-Independent and the then Deputy Haughey, but to deal with the problems in Dublin.</P>
    <P>What is the situation in Dublin?  First, we should recognise the time frame in which we are operating.  The city is effectively 1,200 years old and has been growing slowly over that period, but in the next 20 years we will see the most extraordinary explosion of growth for which we are not geared in any shape or form.  The year 2,000 is closer to us than 1950.  In 1950 half the people alive in Ireland today were not even born.  There is a greater proportion of young people under 25 in Dublin than in the rest of the country.  In 1950 Dublin had an edge, a boundary, a line where the city ended and the fields began.  It was a clean edge not far from the canals which ring the city.  In the old days the drinking laws allowed some public houses beyond the green fields to serve travellers from Dublin after city closing hours.  Today those pubs are in the city, in the suburbs, surrounded by housing estates and factories. The city has grown quickly since 1950.  Today Dublin has just under one million people; by the year 2,000 it will be close to 1.5 million.  Most people dream of growing old gracefully. Dublin's problem and our nightmare, is that between now and the year 2,000 we will have to accommodate at least another 300,000 people who want to be <Col N="930" /> Dubliners, who are the children of Dubliners and who need to come to Dublin.</P>
    <P>The last full census, 1971, gave a figure of 852,000 for the population of Dublin, which has grown steadily and gradually over a period of 200 to 300 years, from an earlier population of 100,000.  In many cases it was able, in the twenties, thirties, and forties, to use the buildings, streets and facilities which were over 100 years old to accommodate that growth.  Allowing for that slow growth, Dublin failed as a city.  Let us dispel some of the nostalgia we sometimes indulge in in relation to the good old times in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Dublin was a living city, a compact city, but it was not a just city.  It was truly a strumpet city, imprisoning far too many people in tenements and hovels instead of homes and denying both work and health to thousands.  Between 1946 and 1961, which some people look back on as a golden era in Dublin, when there was a population increase in the country generally, 100,000 Dubliners were forced out of their own city to cities like Boston, Birmingham or Brisbane in search of work denied them at home.  They were workers &mdash; mostly the children of Dublin working people &mdash; who, denied education and opportunity, could not get a share of the new office jobs or a start in the small, traditional Dublin industries which were either being rationalised or were simply declining.  Many of those industries have now disappeared altogether. Some city dwellers, particularly in the inner city, who can claim to be fourth and fifth generation Dubliners, are effectively closed out from the city and today the Bostons of the world are full.</P>
    <P>In 1971 the Dublin workforce was 330,000.  By 1991 the available workforce will be approximately 460,000.  We will need at least 200,000 new jobs in Dublin by the year 2000 and present estimates show that by 1991 alone we will have something in the region of 50,000 to 60,000 Dubliners unemployed.  The statistics go on and, indeed, are familiar to many of us; but the problem, in fact, gets worse.  We are running out of time in relation to how we handle it.  The Minister, with all sincerity, has suggested that this Bill is a concrete way in which we can <Col N="931" /> resolve that problem.  I beg to differ.  I do not doubt the Minister's sincerity or commitment, but totally and fundamentally reject the ability of this Bill to deal significantly with some of the problems the solution to which is embodied in the promise I have made and which is available to the Minister in his capacity as a member of Dublin City Council.  All the planning documents from which those figures were taken were presented in 1976 and 1977.</P>
    <P>Why do I make that criticism?  It is because the present proposal will not deal with two of the fundamental problems which need to be solved to get the kind of invigoration we need.  Firstly, the proposal will not deal with the problem of controlling the price of building land, with the sole exception of the way in which the Port and Docks Board are having their land extracted from them.  I would like to acknowledge the cleverness and skill with which that legislation was drafted.  I also would like to put on record that the Dublin Port and Docks Board will scream, and scream loudly, that a source of capital which they had anticipated becoming available to them and which is essential to the development of Dublin Port down river, will now be denied to them if this land is extracted from them by agreement between the Minister for Urban Affairs &mdash; I presume the Minister for the Environment, but effectively the present occupant of the Government bench and the Minister for Transport.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Port and Docks Board have a statutory obligation to operate within their own revenue and resources as a commercial, non loss-making body. The Port and Docks Board are representative of various sectors, including the working force &mdash; indeed, the vice-chairman of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union either is chairman or was former chairman of this board.  I would like at some stage in the debate to find out precisely what consultations took place between the Department and the Port and Docks Board in relation to this proposal.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the central question of <Col N="932" /> land, control of land price is unique to the first site to which the Minister's Bill refers.  There are no such provisions in relation to medieval Dublin and we are back to the old problem of compulsory legislation.  Instead of producing this kind of Bill &mdash; and which could have been done largely by agreement in the form I have earlier suggested &mdash; the Department would have been far better employed in bringing in a Bill to reform and improve the procedures for compulsory legislation. As the Minister well knows from his own experience, that legislation simply does not work and will not enable the Viking Commission for Dublin &mdash; to give it a tentative name &mdash; to acquire the land which it is tentatively suggested in this Bill it can acquire.  That is the first reason I do not think this Bill will work.</P>
    <P>The second fundamental reason is that at the end of the day this is another well-meaning, well-intentioned agency, commission, body, institute, group, which is full of intentions, with its own office and permanent staff, either transferred from another Department or people who will acquire permanency very quickly upon being hired.  They do not have the economic leverage or muscle to direct the revenue generating activities into the areas which we wish to revitalise.</P>
    <P>It is very significant that the Minister did not suggest during his speech that one of the most potent forces in urban renewal and development in this country, and in this city at the moment, is the commercial development of office space. The Department and the Minister himself are aware that the majority occupant of office space in this State &mdash; and about 90 per cent of office development throughout the State occurs within the Dublin area &mdash; is the State itself.  Even a rudimentary knowledge of economics would clearly demonstrate that if you control 70 per cent of the market you effectively can dominate the market, lead it and dictate to it, which we have seen in relation to other sectors of our economy. There was no suggestion in the Minister's speech that the State would play a productive role in relocating some of its own office use into areas which the commission might develop in order to guarantee <Col N="933" /> the economic success of the redevelopment proposals which will flow from any plans which such a commission might make.  Instead, we have recourse to another unspecified form of guarantee of borrowing up to the extent of £50 million, either at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>There is no suggestion, for example, that, instead of borrowing at home and abroad, we utilise the enormous resources of our own pension funds, most of which are the product of the Labour movement's gains in getting pensions for people over the last 40 or 50 years.  The most successful development company, and the dominant market leader, is a State-owned company &mdash; Irish Life.  It is significant that the Minister did not refer to it.  It would not be appropriate for it to have been embodied in a Bill, but if there is an economic force in the present economic climate which has the economic muscle to do the type of development which the Minister speaks about it is pension funds such as those of Irish Life, Aer Lingus and others acting in consort with the State itself to use community demand and community money to revitalise urban areas.  Having established that economic productive base within the urban areas, then the less economically productive or revenue-generating activities would flow from that.  This is the alternative approach to urban renewal.  It is, in essence, a socialist alternative to the kind of <i>laissez-faire</i>, dream management upon which the Minister has been somewhat engaged.  We have yet again another aspiration that something good will come from this, like all the plans and documents produced by Deputy O'Donoghue when Minister for Economic Planning and Development &mdash; document after document, six months on six months, setting targets, objectives, aims, but never saying &ldquo;We have the resources, we own Irish Life, we can control the price of building land, we have workers' pension funds which they need for themselves and their children.  We will direct, plan and control.&rdquo; It has never gone that far because, fundamentally, Fianna Fáil, as a pragmatic party, are so linked into the capitalist system that they are not prepared to take that extra step until such time as <Col N="934" /> they may be forced to in order to stay in power.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to make petty party-political points.  There is an alternative and nowhere is that alternative more readily available to the State than in the area of urban renewal and urban redevelopment. The Minister for Finance owns 97 per cent of the issued share capital of Irish Life, and Irish Life are responsible for 70 per cent of the development of offices in Dublin city.  The State is the tenant for 75 per cent of the footage let.  What more do the Government want?  They have all the power they need to redevelop any part of Dublin city, if they have the political will to do so.  I hope this will surface in the Minister's reply or on Committee Stage.  The State has far more power than it realises, or perhaps more ominously, than it is prepared to utilise to achieve the objectives the Government say they are committed to.  That is the economic question.</P>
    <P>Let us forget about unsecured borrowing and State guarantees of another £50 million with an inflation rate of around 20 per cent, although I gather Coopers and Lybrand are now saying it will be down to 17 per cent by the end of the year.  At a Fianna Fáil Party meeting recently a former Minister for Finance took the view that inflation would still be over 20 per cent at the end of the year, and the currency will be devalued.  If that is the case, I earnestly request the Government not to let this agency borrow money overseas.  This would compound the difficulties for this group which we saw nationally when we borrowed foreign currency.  The socialist alternative indicates clearly that the Government already have the levers of power in their grasp and in their ownership.  All that is required is the political will to use them.</P>
    <P>Another fundamental objection to the Bill to which there is a socialist alternative is on the question of the structure of the agency the Government propose to create to implement whatever proposal emerges after consultation.  It is inherently undemocratic.  The commission are to be appointed by the Minister who must have due regard to the hidden commitments <Col N="935" /> in the Gregory deal or to the members of the Minister's party who have to be looked after, compensated, reassured or placated.  None has to be elected.  All have to be satisfied.  It is inherently undemocratic, and worse, it has the potential to be under the dominance, or the influence, or the thumb of the Department because of the insidious phrase that they should have experience in local government administration or public service.  Membership will need to be representative of a wide range of disciplines including people with experience in local government and public administration. That is the phrase.  When that type of clause is added to a sentence in the Custom House I know precisely what they mean.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example.  When a previous senior incumbent of the Custom House wearing the Fianna Fáil colours decided in a fit of pique to abolish or suspend the elected members of Dublin Corporation and to appoint a commission, it was not coincidental or accidental that the commissioner who was appointed was a retired former secretary of that Department.  If you are appointing a gamekeeper it is essential that you know him well in advance, and more to the point, that he knows you.  That tendency will continue.  There is no evidence to suggest that it will not.</P>
    <P>What is so wrong about elected people?  What is so wrong with the ordinary individual who manages to get sufficient popular support having a role to play on a commission?  What is the distrust of these people being appointed to it?  The Minister has been forced into that position.  The other great political scandal in the Custom House &mdash; I am not having a cut at individual civil servants who are not politically responsible for what emanates from that august building &mdash; is that buried in the vaults of the Custom House is the failure to do anything about the reform of local government.</P>
    <P>If the Molloy White Paper, or the Tully discussion document, or many of the proposals received from various local authorities, had been dealt with adequately, this problem would not arise. <Col N="936" /> The balance between Dublin and the rest of the country is totally wrong in relation to local government representation.  The Minister proposes to by-pass the democratic procedures we have built up over the years.  This is consistent for Fianna Fáil.  There is an alternative embodied in our own document which I regard as essentially a socialist proposal to restructure local government in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Let me give the House a description of what I mean.  It is essential to consider what the Minister said against the background of the problem in Dublin and the need for a clear structure to deal not just with the Custom House site which has the good fortune to be in tentative public ownership by the Port and Docks Board and to be in the constituency of Deputy Gregory.  Our alternative is the medieval site which is there for historic reasons. There is no clear indication what the Minister would like to see happening to it. The Bill indicated that the Minister can designate other areas for development.</P>
    <P>Let me put the following scenario to the Minister to show how dangerous the power is which he is now asking the House to give him.  Deputy Keating referred to the Earlsfort centre site. Under the terms of this Bill the following situation could arise.  The eventual owners of that site could argue that the planning constraints and planning permissions are too onerous.  In other words, that they cannot make money from it. That is what developers mean when they say planning permissions are too onerous. Therefore, it has to be left lying derelict and vacant.  Somebody was nearly killed on part of that site in November.  I put down a Private Notice Question about the provision of a telephone service for the dangerous buildings section of Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>Influential developers with links to benign charitable organisations based in the Burlington Hotel or in Mount Street could make a persuasive case to the effect that they needed to get out from under the onerous conditions of the planning permission.  There is nothing in this Bill to prevent the Minister from designating the Earlsfort centre site as an area for development, establishing a commission, <Col N="937" /> and empowering them to draw up a development proposal.  The local authority would be consulted.  Let us assume they attach the same condition to any development as they have in their development plans, that is, 40 per cent maximum office use and the balance to be commercial or residential.</P>
    <P>The commission would say they did not agree with these proposals and conditions. Instead of the matter being decided by An Bord Pleanála under the normal process we won from successive central Governments, it would be decided by the Minister.  The circle would be nicely rounded off, and there would be a potential charter for private developers because of the absence of democracy in the way in which the commission can be set up.  I am making an extreme argument.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister would do that.  He might not always be Minister for Urban Affairs and there will be others who may not be as sensitive or as touchy and perhaps might be politically pushed into doing it in order to maintain the high cost of elections or whatever other politically expedient reason is given.  That is part of the power embodied in this Bill and part of the power we are asking the Minister to give.  I believe there is an alternative and it is the radical restructuring of the way in which local government works in Dublin.  I believe it should be on the following lines.</P>
    <P>The Minister should move as soon as possible to establish a Dublin metropolitan council.  The Dublin urban region, which extends from the city out to the county and in some cases over into neighbouring counties to include towns like Bray and Leixlip, should have a single unified metropolitan council.  This would involve a change in the county boundaries and the merging of Dublin County Council with Dublin City Council.  The council would have a membership of approximately 85 based upon a ratio of 1 member to 10,000 population.  The combined total of council and corporation representatives at present &mdash; it is more now &mdash; is approximately the same.</P>
    <P>The major areas of responsibility of such a council would be as follows: (1) <Col N="938" /> structure planning &mdash; this unit would have overall physical planning control for the region including economic and land use planning; (2) services &mdash; this unit would contain major water and drainage schemes, roads and related engineering services including refuse disposal; (3) housing &mdash; this unit would have overall housing policy for the region, acquisition of land for housing, providing research and assistance throughout the region for the provision and allocation of housing; (4) health &mdash; this unit would have the present function and activities of the Eastern Health Board which covers all of the area involved and would be integrated into the structure of the metropolitan council; (5) education &mdash; this unit would have the present function of the vocational education committee which would be taken under this category and pending the reform and organisation of second-and third-level education would come under the aegis of the metropolitan council.  Council activities to which the Minister earlier referred would be contained within this unit; (6) transportation &mdash; transport is not catered for at present. A new transportation board embracing the various elements involved in transport would be established under the aegis of the metropolitan council.  It would have a specific role in relation to public transport in conjunction with CIE and in fact would include the Dublin metropolitan transportation authority which is promised or which is on the way.</P>
    <P>Finally, environment would cover parks and recreation.  The last category would be finance.  The metropolitan council would provide the first level of local regional government in the Dublin area.  It would emcompass &mdash; this is the important part of it &mdash; one-third of the entire population of the State.  Left on its own it could not claim to be a system of local government and for that reason a second level of local government would occur below the metropolitan council. There is a precedent for this already in the relationship of urban district councils to county councils and more especially in the relationship of Dun Laoghaire Borough to Dublin County Council.  Taking the Dun Laoghaire position as a guide, <Col N="939" /> the second tier of local government would be a number of local boroughs. The size and boundaries of the various boroughs would vary somewhat but efforts should be made to consolidate existing community ties and tradition. Dun Laoghaire, for example, would remain intact, possibly extending its boundary inland or out towards Bray. The old urban district council areas of Pembroke and Rathmines including their symbolic townhalls would similarly serve to establish or suggest boundaries.  The final shape and size would have perhaps particular regard to a balance between local democracy and administrative efficiency.</P>
    <P>If we take a typical borough as having a population of 100,000, we would have nine or ten such boroughs under the framework of the metropolitan council and each borough like Dun Laoghaire would have its own elected council as well as elected members on the metropolitan council.  It would have direct responsibility and autonomy regarding matters of local concern, A typical borough, I believe, would have the following kind of profile: the size would be 100,000 population; the council would have 25 local borough councillors.  The representative ratio would be one councillor for 4,000 people; elections would be every five years and the quotas to be elected to such a council would range between 1,000 and 1,500, based on a system of five five-seater wards.  The structure of such an authority would be similar to that which operates in Dun Laoghaire at present.</P>
    <P>It is significant that we are talking about these commissions in the context of Dublin city which is the one part of the entire local government system that has actually broken down.  Dublin Corporation as a political and administrative system in contrast with any other local authority simply does not work and cannot work because of the scale and magnitude of its functional area and the problems it has to deal with.  It is further complicated by the fact that the senior executive staff in Dublin Corporation have to maintain a condition of permanent <Col N="940" /> schizophrenia between their responsibilities to Dublin County Council and Dublin City Council, leaving aside the unfortunate position of Dun Laoghaire which is frequently squeezed in the middle. I have seen correspondence in which an engineer employed by the people of Dublin wrote in the morning in his capacity as Dublin County Engineer to himself in his capacity as Dublin City Engineer and received the letter in the afternoon, considered it and refused the request it contained.  He wrote back and told himself so.  That is the kind of nonsense, the Gilbert and Sullivan nonsense that actually has happened and does exist. The Minister is aware of it.</P>
    <P>He may well recall the time when we tried to reduce the cost of local authority housing by improving density ratios in areas of Dublin County Council only to be told time and again that the provisions of the Dublin County Council development plan were such that we could not do this even though the manager and all the officials agreed with it.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister would be far better employed in seriously dealing with the problems of local government reform and introducing in the inner city area some form of local authority that can actually function, is actually democratic and will have its ear to the ground and will be able to do the job which the Minister believes these commissions might possibly be able to do.  I criticise the Bill in that context because I do not think the commissions will be democratic.  They will certainly not have members who will be representative of all sides of the community. Fianna Fáil do not play the political game that way at all; we know that if one happens to be a member of Limerick County Council or in any area where Fianna Fáil have a majority.  Concerns of proportionality and the other niceties such as the Minister has experienced in Dublin Corporation just do not exist.  It is a winner-take-all system with a vengeance, nicely presented and pleasantly packaged but if you are not in the moral community, as a noted columnist has described it, you are not in there at all. There may be the odd trade unionist or tame community worker as a kind of fifth <Col N="941" /> columnist to suggest that it is representative. These commissions will be composed of members of Fianna Fáil, sympathisers or not.  If the Minister suggests that he personally would not be disposed to do that, as perhaps would be his personal wish, then I think if the orders do not come from the top floor of the Customs House they will certainly come from Merrion Street as regards the membership of these commissions.</P>
    <P>We are not talking of commissions representative of the community but about political appointees or alternatively safe people who know how the mind and heart of the Custom House really work.  The system is inherently undemocratic and it will rely on the simple expertise of the Custom House, which was displayed in Ballymun and with the guaranteed order scheme against the specific advice and expertise of local authority members.  I did not hear in the Minister's opening speech or in any of the comments made any justification for providing that these should not be elected members, why there should not be a local authority that can do this.  There is no suggestion that Dun Laoghaire Borough needs this kind of organisation.  There is no suggestion clearly identified in the public mind that smaller towns like Waterford and Limerick need these commissions.</P>
    <P>What Waterford and Limerick need is the money to proceed with CPO acquisitions. Waterford and Limerick have very clearly defined the areas within their own local authority development plan in regard to precisely what they want.  All they need is the money from the Department to enable them to do it, not a commission to complicate the matter.  Yet we are not getting that kind of response from the Minister.  The Minister would be far more productively engaged if he were to give power to local authorities to borrow up to £50 million at home and abroad on a guaranteed basis.  That would get some areas out of their straitjackets. Authorities like Waterford, Drogheda and Dundalk, who have the kind of medieval core which the Minister has identified in this Bill, would have the power to borrow the moneys they need <Col N="942" /> to do the kind of things he thinks the commission will do.</P>
    <P>This Bill is part of a package and the Minister has loosely referred to the inner city authority which is to be established later on.  The Minister in his speech referred to the proposal to establish a statutory Dublin inner city development authority and said that the preparation of the necessary legislation was at an advanced stage.  He said it was proposed to introduce the Bill this session and that both the Custom House docks development area and the Dublin walled city development area would fall within the area of the proposed authority.  However, he said there will be no duplication of responsibility or conflict of interests between the commission and the authority.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on his ability to produce in such a short time from his Department such a myriad range of legislation.  It is unique to produce so much so quickly.  One wonders whether it has not been thought out very clearly or, alternatively, that it had been there for some time and was not acted upon.  I recognise that the intricate departmental committee formed the basis for much of the kind of thinking that seems to be embodied in what the Minister has been saying.  I read that report and there was nowhere, to my satisfaction, a clear identification of the kind of economic leverage which is available to the Government being utilised by either the authority or the commission. The Minister has an obligation to tell us why we are debating this Bill in the absence of the inner city development authority.  It is not at all clear what the inner-connections are going to be.  The Minister has assured us that there will be no duplication.</P>
    <P>As the Minister well knows from his period in opposition, assurances are not really much use.  The courts do not have due regard to them and the operation of the law ignores all the fine assurances which are put on the record of this House. We need and we want to have assurances replaced by facts.  The Bill for the establishment of this inner city develoment authority should be published so that it <Col N="943" /> can be compared in the context of these two development commissions.  What is going to be the function of this inner city developoment authority?  Will it be able to borrow money to the tune of £50 million? Is it going to be democratically elected or will it be another Fianna Fáil array of appointees?  What will its specific relationship be with Dublin Corporation? Is it not yet again part and parcel of the central Government elitism that permeates the entire range of legislation?</P>
    <P>Lest the Minister think I am obsessive about the kind of elitism I am denouncing, the genesis of the Port and Docks controversy, which resulted in the opposition to it locally and in one sense brought Deputy Gregory to prominence, is in this document published by the Port and Docks Board themselves.  It is a document expensively produced and prepared by a team of consultant planners and architects.  Because the planning permission process has been democratised, procedures exist for third party appeals and it was only when third party appeal objections were made that the enormity of what this proposal was going to do to the area became apparent to the public at large in that immediate vicinity who raised it as an issue to the extent that it formed part and parcel of the Gregory deal.  This is the product of the kind of elitism and consultation between professionals on the one hand, public servants in the Port and Docks Board on the other and officials negotiating and talking privately in Dublin Corporation.  Yet this Bill is going to eliminate from the planning process a fundamental part of it, third party appeals.  It is the very process of third party appeals that made the Port and Docks Board site a public issue in the first place.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of ordinary, commonsense wisdom shown by the people when the Government went to the housing committee and suggested the idea of high rise flats in 1962 and 1963 after the collapse of houses in Fenian Street.  The ordinary elected members of Dublin Corporation from all walks of life and all parties said it would not work in Dublin.  Yet the central Government elitism dictated and <Col N="944" /> directed that it would and could work. We all know the tragedy of that venture. We are being asked to accept that there has been some miraculous transformation between then and now under the control of Fianna Fáil and that the same mistakes will not be made again.  There is no such assurance in the Bill.  There are no such powers to allow of third party intervention &mdash; consultations certainly, that is a new phrase in the eighties.  You can consider and consult but at the end of the day the Minister, not An Bord Pleanála, will decide.  These are retrospective, anti-democratic steps that push back gains which were made over the last ten years.</P>
    <P>If the Minister thinks I am being unduly party partisan in this matter, let me remind him of what we would both regard as the most extreme abuse in recent times of ministerial appeal.  I refer to what has now become known in Donnybrook as &ldquo;Tully's Tower&rdquo; on the Dodder Bridge, a building which I understand the present Minister gave a commitment that he would revoke if he came back to power.  Perhaps I am misinformed.</P>

Although it is not a Fianna Fáil example, it is the kind of product that central government elitism and ministerial appeal in its worst form can produce.  We are being asked again, with the record of the Custom House in the area of planning and development, to transfer powers from local authorities and elected members to the Custom House and to Fianna Fáil Ministers &mdash; to any Minister who, under pressure for any reason, is capable of making the sort of decisions which result in either &ldquo;Tully's Tower&rdquo; or Ballymun.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that and I do not think the House should accept it.  The Labour Party certainly do not accept it and we will be opposing that section.  We will be putting down a range and a raft of amendments to this legislation.  While the intent is good the content is seriously defective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" /> I ask the Minister to seriously consider the question of how he sees the integration of the current economic power which the State has, especially in relation to Irish Life, the pension funds controlled by the public sector and also in relation to the office use which the State has by way of its market demand.  How does he see all that being used in concert with the commission?  Can he see it being embodied in this legislation in any shape or form?  If he does not, it will be another Údarás na Gaeltachta, another body without any real teeth or economic leverage and not being able to function.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points which could be usefully made in relation to it on Second Stage.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the fuel variation levy in electricity accounts be discontinued in view of (1) the glut in oil supplies and the consequent lowering of heavy fuel oil prices, and (2) the adequate supply of natural gas to the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy E. Collins)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I welcomed the Minister's statement that it is now opportune to discontinue the fuel variation cost charge.  That levy or charge has been causing great concern to consumers in industry and agriculture and to householders. The Minister has said it will be got rid of and I am glad he has promised an announcement to this effect in the next two weeks.  One of the reasons for this, the Minister told us last night, is that no longer will we be so dependent on heavy fuel oil for electricity production. At the moment heavy fuel oil accounts for 40 per cent of the cost of electricity generation by the ESB.  In 1978 it accounted for 66 per cent of the cost and <Col N="946" /> the Minister has said that it could be reduced to about 30 per cent by the end of the decade.  That is most encouraging.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons for that projected reduction in the use of fuel oil is that the ESB have been diversifying from heavy fuel oil to indigenous resources.  For instance, we have developed more bogs, we have the contribution of hydro power and now we have natural gas.  In my constituency Bord na Móna have acquired 13,000 acres of bog and they hope to acquire a further 2,500 acres. They propose to set up a briquette factory in the area.  This development will go a long way towards reducing ESB dependence on heavy fuel oil and it will provide as many as 600 jobs in the area.</P>
      <P>Natural gas has made a significant contribution towards reducing dependence on oil.  It now represents more than one-third of the material used in electricity production.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on ESB price reviews.  In the past year we have had a price increase of 25 per cent in electricity charges and there were similar increases in previous years.  I am glad the Department of Energy and the ESB have a projected figure for this year which will stabilise the increase in single percentage figures.  This is good news for all consumers but particularly for small industries, firms who have been trying to achieve stability of costs so that they can plan for the future.  Of course they were hindered by the high cost of electricity. Numerous representations were made to the Department of Industry in efforts to get some relief, and I am glad that the Minister has said he will have consultations with the ESB to determine the extent of relief for industry.  The ESB are to review the situation to see what they can do.  I am knocking on an open door in this respect because the Minister has given a commitment to small industries, many of which were set up by the IDA and county development teams and have been doing tremendous work, although they were hindered in the past few years by high electricity costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that farmers' incomes have fallen badly in the past few years and dairy farmers have been particularly <Col N="947" /> hit by high ESB bills.  A few years ago when the FEOGA grant scheme was introduced there was delight among communities in the west.  However, there was disappointment that the scheme was so restrictive and many farmers did not benefit from it as they had expected.  The FEOGA scheme was restrictive in many ways and I hope we can get some changes in the regulations which will enable us to extend it not only to farmers but to people in rural areas who either had houses built for them by councils or who have provided their own houses.</P>
    <P>Last Novermber I put down a question asking for the number of people who had applied for help under FEOGA in respect of their capital contributions, and I was told that in Galway and in the west generally only half of the applications had been approved.  An effort should be made to speed up the processing of applications so that more people will be approved for grants.  I hope that the removal of the ESB fuel variation charge will help those who had been hoping for assistance.</P>
    <P>People in rural areas have been complaining about poor electricity supply.  I hope the Minister will inquire into this matter.  Only for the co-operation which exists between farmers who rotate heavy work which involves the use of electricity, such as milking, there would be more difficulties than there are at present. Action should be taken to deal with this. Transformers should be erected or three phase current should be brought to towns and villages which do not have that kind of supply.  That should be done immediately to help those who are handicapped by poor supply.  Trustees of group water schemes have done tremendous work in bringing water supplies to rural homes. One of their bones of contention is the high cost of electricity involved in this.</P>
    <P>When the Minister makes his promised announcement people will not be charged the fuel variation cost.  I was critical yesterday when speaking about the public relations side of the ESB.  Like other Deputies I would regret if people were not given adequate time to pay high bills and would be concerned if they were <Col N="948" /> cut off.  Deputy Taylor gave examples of people who were disconnected.  Like other businesses, the ESB are affected by inflation as regards their wage costs, materials, transport, postal charges and fuel.  Their costs are also affected by interest rates because they buy oil and gas abroad with a declining currency. Inflation has increased the price of electricity. Up to 1972, oil was relatively cheap and so was electricity.  Before the oil crises it cost £7 a ton but immediately the war broke out in the Middle East between the Arabs and Jews there was an increase in the price of heavy oil of the order of £65 a ton.  That was the reason why the fuel variation charge was introduced. The ESB abolished that charge in 1977 because it looked as if there would be stability in the oil crisis.  However, despite their best efforts it had to be reintroduced.</P>
    <P>The ESB are to be complimented on the various measures they have introduced to make payments easier for the consumer.  They have a number of schemes such as savings stamps, a budget payment system, credit card and an easy pay system which allows the customer to pay weekly or monthly to suit the household budget.  We hear many complaints about large two-monthly ESB bills. There are 300,000 customers availing of these different schemes and that figure reflects their success.  However, they are not as great a help to the consumer as the Minister's decision to discontinue the fuel variation charge.  I am glad he has made this decision and I am sure all sides of the House agree that it is an opportune time to do so.  I say that particularly because of the diversification which has taken place.  This diversification has helped other sectors of the community, for example, in bogland areas we have electricity generating stations.  Natural gas has made a significant contribution and the ESB have stated that savings to them were of the order of £45 million in 1981 and are expected to be £55 million in 1982.  The overall effect is that ESB prices to the consumer are 10 per cent lower than they would otherwise have been.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on the step he has taken.  I am glad that there <Col N="949" /> is agreement on the motion.  It has not been mentioned in the debate that our native energy resources are saving us large sums of money because we do not have to import so much oil.  The figure quoted by the ESB is a saving of £136 million a year.  We are helping our own economy by the diversification process and because we are less dependent on oil now the Minister has been able to discontinue the fuel cost variation charge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a number of observations on the motion before the House and the debate thereon.  When one casts aside all of the debate and discussion one central issue comes through, which is this, that the public have a right to expect now a drop in the price of electricity.  Naturally I am grateful the Minister has seen fit to accept the motion from this side of the House, so ably and comprehensively put by our spokesman, Deputy E. Collins.  However, I should like to take it a step further and pose one or two questions arising from the debate and particularly the implications of acceptance of the motion by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion relates to the discontinuance of the fuel variation levy in electricity accounts.  As I understand it, the Minister has indicated that he is willing to accept that that should be the case.  I should like to know very clearly whether or not that is merely some form of accountancy exercise to be compensated for by some other means.  I think one speaker last evening referred unkindly to the fact that what might be given with one hand might be taken away with another.  Perhaps that is a commentary in itself that one is always somewhat dubious about such easy undertakings given in this House that we must probe a little further.  But, in truth, there are very solid, economic reasons that the hopefully temporary problem relating to extraordinarily high prices for oil over the last number of years and the recent glut in the market which has led to a downfall in prices should result now in a real and appreciable drop in the price of electricity for the ordinary consumer, the ordinary housewife.  This is compounded <Col N="950" /> by the fact that at the time of sanctioning by the previous Government of a 25 per cent increase in electricity charges &mdash; which increase, incidentally, was agreed merely because it had been postponed during the reign of our predecessors &mdash; there was inbuilt into that 25 per cent an 8 per cent tier which was to be for one year only.  This case has been made already by Deputy E. Collins.  I shall not over-emphasise it except to say that regardless of what should happen arising from the natural fluctuations downwards in the market price of oil, the public have a realistic right to expect a visible and appreciable drop of approximately 8 per cent in their next accounts.</P>
    <P>The dropping of the fuel variation levy should mean that ESB charges should drop considerably.  I should like the Minister to confirm that that is the case.  Over the last number of years the public have experienced increases in electricity and indeed in other commodities, due to international trends, particularly in relation to the price of oil.  In all cases all that ever happens &mdash; as far as they can see &mdash; when international prices rise is that they pay more but these prices never come down again.  The same operates now despite the fact that there has been a dramatic change in the international oil situation, despite the fact that OPEC have had to rethink their strategy and attitude, despite the fact that people in the oil-purchasing business, large companies, now pay a great deal less than they did, the housewives of this country pay more than they ever did before.  That is not something we should tolerate.  I ask the Minister to spell out clearly that whatever benefits can be derived from the erratic price of oil on the open market should be passed on to the housewife, not after long and protracted delays, not after they have been wrung from possibly reluctant oil companies by a Minister but automatically, as their right, the same way as they, the voters and others must pay increased prices when those oil prices rise.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to make very clear indeed that when he agrees to discontinue the fuel variation levy there will be no other form of imposition of an <Col N="951" /> energy-related nature to compensate for such an innovation and that the public who consume energy will see a realistic improvement in their situation.  Of course, the general dependence of this country on oil, which is one of the highest in Europe and which successive Governments have endeavoured to depress to some extent, should not be encouraged further.  In line with the hoped-for decrease in prices, I hope the Minister will continue to emphasise and do whatever possible to ensure that other aspects of energy consumption in this country likewise improve qualitatively.  Here I am talking particularly about our waste of energy which is extraordinary by any standard.  I hope the Minister will be able to instil into the public a real appreciation that energy, particularly that based on oil, is a finite commodity and should not be wasted.  Indeed, I might give him an example on which to start in this very House &mdash; and I am not talking merely about our hot air, if the expression will be pardoned in this Chamber &mdash; but the actual temperature of the rooms here is an appalling and abysmal commentary on the way we carry out our business.  Perhaps in this case we should start at home. Certainly it would appear that throughout society the public is being given very bad example.  Therefore I do not blame people who are cynical about energy and energy prices, if they do not expect that what the Minister is saying now will redound now to their advantage because, if it does, it will have been for the first time.  I shall wait and see.</P>
    <P>Therefore if the Minister accepts that the fuel variation levy will no longer be a feature of ESB accounts it is incumbent on him to say where the shortfall, if there is one, will be made up, or if there is to be any loss of revenue to the ESB.  It is unrealistic to expect that body &mdash; which has rendered this State a great service over the years &mdash; simply to continue with their expansion programme, with the very high quality of their service while their income is reduced.  Accordingly, I hope the real reduction will be made up of a composite element, based on the 8 per cent one-year-off levy or increase <Col N="952" /> granted in the context of the February 25 per cent increase, plus the fuel variation element, that it will be significant and will be compensated for in the event of the ESB having to go without.  It is not simply acceptable that a board would be told, Look, we are going to give you less income, you make it up from here.&rdquo;  That temptation, if it exists, should be resisted because it could prove to be very unsettling to this board which I believe have done an exemplary job in almost all respects.</P>
    <P>The cost of our national fuel bill should mean that if there is a significant decrease it will undoubtedly redound to the advantage not just of the housewife &mdash; who obviously is of primary concern &mdash; but will be of significant advantage also to industry, particularly to small industry, in some cases very heavily taxed now by a wide variety of methods of extracting money from them, not the least of which has been their fuel bill.  If there is anything the Minister can do by way of giving special consideration to small industries and businesses &mdash; I am talking about people employing up to half a dozen people &mdash; I appeal to him to do so.  If we can encourage their development and growth by positive discrimination in relation to fuel prices then we will be doing a good job and the present employment prospect, so daunting, might be brightened on that account.</P>
    <P>The motion asks that the fuel variation level be discontinued in view of the glut in oil supplies, and consequent lowering of heavy fuel and the adequate supply of natural gas to the Electricity Supply Board.  In regard to the glut in oil supplies, I would be of the view that it is imperative that a Government should have a national energy policy, that we should not be dependent on the whims of the market places or indeed on the ability of a Minister to garner for us the benefits which are available because of the international market price situation.  We should develop our utilisation of energy, our approach to conservation, our approach to alternative energy forms and so on, in the context of a national energy policy.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see there is not a <Col N="953" /> national energy policy.  Although we had a Green Paper last year on this, I am not aware of any serious clearly established policy within which the Government are acting at the moment.  The result is that there is uncertainty with regard to pricing, which is the kernel of this motion, but also with regard to every other aspect of fuel and energy.  That should not be because it is unsettling in terms of domestic budgeting and its impact on commercial and industrial development, and the whole life of the community is affected when there is uncertainty about the development of such a fundamental input to the future as energy.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a great need for the Minister to say not just that the price will now come down, which is inevitable when one considers the international situation, but that there is now a readiness to decide principles on which action in future will be guided.  If we get that kind of reduction in price we will create a climate in which the private and public sectors will be sympathetically disposed towards accepting the rigours of a policy in this area.</P>
    <P>There would, therefore, be no need for a debate about the fuel variation levy or any other aspect of prices, which would be automatic and would follow clear guidelines set out in a policy rather than the irregular debates which occur on occasions such as this when there is a glut in oil supplies.</P>
    <P>The second reason for the request of the Opposition in this respect is the supply of natural gas to the ESB.  Natural resources, in whatever part of the State or whatever shorelines, should lead to the benefit of all our citizens and no such supply should be seen in merely local terms.  It is accordingly perfectly realistic to expect that there would be very significant reductions in price to consumers when natural gas supplies are on stream as they now are.  The sooner they are on stream to the whole community the better. In the interim, it is reasonable that savings made because of the supply to a locality should be reflected in a national price structure.  That has not been clear to date.  One would be forgiven for thinking that the natural gas availability at <Col N="954" /> present is a matter reserved almost for local concern and local consideration. That is not the way it should be.  It should be a question of advantage to the whole community in the same way that the whole community have to shoulder the burden if the barometer goes in the other direction.</P>
    <P>We would like the Minister to spell out in as much detail as possible what exactly his acceptance of the motion means in terms of the fuel and energy pricing structure &mdash; if people will have to compensate in some other way.  We would like to know where the money is to come from that will no longer be paid in the bills. We would like to know the exact size of that and if I am right in assuming that it will reflect the two composite elements referred to previously by me, the 8 per cent one-year levy plus the natural fluctuation downwards in the market price of oil.  We would like to know if the Government accept the need for an energy policy within which that price structure will be a feature rather than being the subject of a separate debate and perhaps in some cases taken out of context.</P>
    <P>I would like to tell the Minister, if he is in need of any food for thought in that area, that our party have an excellent document which he should certainly acquaint himself with.  It is one of our finest productions.  Deputy Eddie Collins and all the other spokespersons in our Department will be happy to facilitate the Minister in regard to this.  The consumer at long last appears to be in sight of getting some relief.  I do not know if we should give the international market place the credit, the oil companies, or the Minister.  Perhaps a little bit of credit is due to each of those segments.  I would like to see this being implemented as soon as possible.  I would be grateful if the Minister would give us a little more clarity on that.  Apart from that I want to reiterate the general thrust and content of Deputy Collins' contribution last night which eloquently made our case for us.</P>

      <P>I will allow other speakers to get in.  I was surprised at Deputy Keating directing questions to the Minister about where the money is to come from to pay for the acceptance of the motion. Deputy E. Collins should have been less farcical, a little less like a pharisee and come before the House and stated where he and his colleagues would find the money.  After all, it is the Fine Gael motion which we are debating which is being accepted with the same degree of integrity by the Minister as the Deputy when he put down the motion.  We should not test the credence of the House too far by putting forward the type of arguments Deputy Keating has just put forward.</P>
      <P>In common with the Minister and the majority of Deputies in the House, I welcome this motion.  I am delighted to see that the Minister indicated last night that he intends to seek discussions with the ESB in order to eliminate this very contentious item from the ESB bills of all electricity consumers, domestic and industrial users.  All of us have practical experience of receiving ESB bills and noting this charge, which has generated quite an amount of resentment and even at times, perhaps, misunderstanding about the ESB by their customers over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fuel variation element of all ESB accounts has been with us for eight years, since January 1974, although it applied in a limited way before that in regard to industrial.  All of us have practical the mechanism was necessary in times when there were steep increases in oil prices.  We all understood that oil was the main energy source for the ESB, during the seventies particularly, but the crisis which was caused during that decade by the rapidly increasing prices brought about by the oil producing countries, forced the ESB to consider diversifying their sources of energy supply.  That diversification has been effected.  We must all acknowledge that the consequence <Col N="956" /> of that rapid increase in oil prices had a dramatic effect on the standard of living not only of all of our people but of most other people in the developed countries. It was a shock that took some time to absorb but we had to contend with it. In that sense it was understood and accepted that the ESB, in order to fulfil their statutory obligation, had to impose this type of surcharge.  They had responsibility for keeping some semblance of order in their own finances and for producing the necessary result at the end of each year of neither making profit nor finding themselves in a loss situation to any extent.  However, the need for the surcharge at present is questionable.  As has been said here it is very difficult for the ordinary consumer to understand why he should have to pay this surcharge in circumstances, it would appear, of falling world oil prices and of a glut of oil products.  As Deputy Keating has said, the prices of heavy fuel oil have fallen dramatically but perhaps all of us in discussing this matter can ignore the fact that while oil prices are expressed in punts we pay in dollars and that the ratio between the two has not moved as dramatically as has been the case in respect of other world trends both in terms of supply and price.  Therefore, we may be under some misapprehension in talking of oil prices in isolation and not talking into account all of the other factors that are influencing the situation in which it would appear that the ESB should not be in a position to reduce charges to their customers, both domestic and industrial.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that all of us would be of the opinion that the consumer is entitled to expect to be the beneficiary of these trends.  Until 1978 the generating output of the ESB was derived perhaps to the extent of two-thirds from oil but then the situation in relation to the supply and price of oil forced the ESB to diversify and reduce their dependency on this one source of energy to the present figure of about 40 per cent.  This was achieved to some extent by the increased output from the hydro-electric and peat stations plus a development that we all welcome though which perhaps might not be the best in terms of the utilisation of energy <Col N="957" /> sources, that is, the natural gas burning station at Cork which is capable of producing one-third of the total amount of electricity generated.</P>
    <P>Therefore, against a background of falling oil prices, of a dramatic reduction in dependency on oil and of the enormous contribution of natural gas, it is inconceivable that the imposition of the electricity surcharge would not be examined urgently with a view to its removal.</P>
    <P>I have here an example of a domestic account of 800 units per month.  That Bill as presented to the board by the consumer shows a standing charge of £2.65. There is usually no comment so far as that is concerned.  The number of units consumed represent a charge of £33.8 while the fuel variation charge amounts to £15.65 or approximately 50 per cent of the cost of the electricity consumed.  This is an area in which the ESB have not conducted a proper public relations exercise in explaining to the public why this charge is so high in relation to the basic charge for the electricity consumed.  The title of the charge implies that it is a variation charge in respect of fuel oil but we all know that the price of fuel oil has not increased to this extent or that if it has, the board have been remiss in not restructuring their charges to show this situation in a more realistic fashion than in the example I have given.  This is what leads to misunderstandings and to a lot of resentment against this surcharge.  To that extent much of that resentment is justified.</P>
    <P>The situation in industry is at least as serious but perhaps even more so in that there is inherent in that situation more hindrances to our potential competitiveness as against that of our trading partners in terms of our very high energy costs.  This is a factor that is recognised by the IDA.  In the context of attempting to attract industry we would appear to have excessively high energy costs <i>vis-à-vis</i> our trading partners.  Any step that may be taken to alleviate this burden on industry must be welcomed and I trust that the Minister's consultation with the board in this connection will be successful.</P>
    <P>I would direct the Minister's attention <Col N="958" /> to a situation that exists in a part of my constituency though it is a situation that may be common to many other areas also.  I refer to circumstances whereby, despite the fact that the ESB have surplus generating capacity due to a situation which will probably rectify itself now with the ending of the recession and the beginning of the upturn in the economy, industries who are large consumers must at a certain time of the day, especially from 5 p.m. to 7 or 8 p.m., switch to their own generating capacity because otherwise there would be a breakdown in the system. It is difficult to understand why this should be the case.  It is something that militates against the smaller units who are not capable of providing their own generating capacity and who are consequently paying an inordinately high price for their electricity, they being pegged to a maximum kilowatt demand which comes into effect for possibly five, ten of 15 minutes in the day but once they have crossed that demand for even a small period of time, they must pay an excessively high cost for the energy they use. This is an area also that should be considered and I cannot conceive of there being any objection from any side to any rearrangement by the board in terms of their price structure in order to discriminate positively in favour of these smaller industries.</P>
    <P>I would question also the activities of the ESB as a body in the field of the sales of domestic appliances.  While this seems to be compatible with their general thrust in the commercial field, I wonder whether it is right that they should be tying up scarce financial resources in this area, an area that could be left more properly to the ordinary commercial sector. There must be substantial amounts of money involved in this area both in terms of financial arrangements made between the board and their customers and in the provision of the large stocks that are carried.  While this may be a small element, it must be a contributory factor in the pricing structure of the board's supply of electricity to customers.</P>
    <P>It has been said that competition is the spice of life and in this connection the figures for the projected output from the <Col N="959" /> Kinsale gasfield are heartening.  I congratulate the Minister on completing the deal with the Northern Ireland authorities in regard to the supply of natural gas to that part of the country.  I am sure that some rural development will spin off from that move northwards.  Competition is good for any organisation and it is time the the ESB looked to its laurels in this respect.  The availability of natural gas, a clean and cheap form of energy, will force from the ESB a form of pricing structure that will make them more competitive.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to extend the supply of natural gas northwards, supplying the major towns en route.  I welcome the fact that agreement has been reached with the gas company in Dublin in relation to the supply of natural gas.  It is good to know that towns like Waterford, Limerick and Dundalk and other large centres of population will get a supply of natural gas.  This will assist those towns in their drive to attract energy-using industries.  We must also remember the advantage that the use of natural gas will be to the National Exchequer.  We are all aware of the substantial amount of money that is paid annually by us for oil. Natural gas is a welcome addition to the generating capacity of the ESB but it is an inefficient form of energy production. The board should accept that it will not always be available to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister was asked to outline where the finance necessary to implement the terms of the motion will come from but that is a problem to which the ESB must direct their attention.  There is little use in the board burying their heads in the sand and saying that a situation will not arise, but a cheaper source of energy will become available and the board must work to prune their overheads where possible. They must prune their financial commitments to ensure they can within their statutory obligations reduce the price of electricity to a level that will be competitive and acceptable.  I accept that the ESB are committed to a further reduction of their dependence on oil through the construction of coal burning stations.  Those stations are bound to be a big contribution to the areas they serve <Col N="960" /> and I am sure will prove efficient and more competitive.</P>
    <P>The fuel variation charge, as it appears on consumers' bills, amounts to an additional charge of about 50 per cent on the cost of electricity used.  The ESB within their own organisation have the scope to make the necessary saving to implement the terms of the motion before the House.  I hope the Minister's discussions will bear fruit and will result in consumers being granted a reduction in the charge. I welcome the terms of the motion and the fact that as a nation we have reached the stage whereby we will be able to generate a greater proportion of our electricity from native resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Waterford) Mr. Gallagher (Waterford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> On the surface the motion tabled by Deputy Collins appears to be a straightforward one which would find favour with all Members and the public who must bear the fuel variation charge in addition to the price they pay for the electricity they consume.  However, the manner in which Deputy Collins proposed the motion was less than candid about a very complex matter.  The fuel variation levy was first introduced ten years ago but applied only to industrial consumers.  In 1973-74 when we had to face our first oil crisis the ESB extended the fuel variation charge to all consumers.  The board responded with flexibility and speed by extending that charge to all consumers so as to ensure that industry survived and that household consumers had an adequate supply of power.  In 1978-79 the fuel variation levy was used by the ESB again in response to a situation which was outside their control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Collins was being simplistic when he stated that because there was a glut of oil on the market there should automatically be a drop in the price of oil to consumers.  I listened to the contributions and I noted that the Minister pointed out to Deputy Collins that the drop in the price of oil was more than offset by currency fluctuation, the value of the punt as against the dollar.  Having listened to the contributions so far in the debate I must remark that some salient points have been overlooked, deliberately <Col N="961" /> in my view.  The reason electricity costs are high is because 64 per cent of our electricity is generated by burning high-priced residual fuel oil, a most expensive way of generating electricity. Another factor that must be taken into consideration is that the price of residual fuel oil is further increased because the ESB are obliged to purchase supplies through the private enterprise firm of Tedcastle Limited.  It seems odd that a State company in doing business should have recourse to a middle-man in the private sector in order to obtain supplies. If the ESB dealt directly on a state-to-state basis there could be a reduction in the cost of electricity, especially to industry.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that hand-won turf is burned at an electricity generating station in the west of Ireland.  Obviously, this amounts to a hidden subsidy being paid by the ESB to the area.  If the Government wish to pay a subsidy to an area &mdash; I am not saying they should not &mdash; it should come from the area of direct taxation rather than expecting ESB consumers to pay it in the form of an increased charge for their electricity.  A similar situation exists in relation to a private enterprise coalmine at Arigna. That is a costly way of generating electricity. The ESB have produced an effective low grade coal burning furnace capable of utilising the plentiful supplies of low grade coal here, particularly in the south and west.</P>
    <P>Another matter which contributes to the high cost of energy &mdash; this was ignored by other speakers &mdash; is the high interest charges the ESB., like other State companies, must pay to the banks.  I should like to know what bank interest charges cost consumers.  It is obvious that more coal-burning electricity generating stations should be erected so as to reduce the overall cost of generating electricity. However, the ESB cannot do this if banks are allowed to levy the same heavy interest charges they are permitted to charge other State companies.  For example, the sugar company, which had a trading profit of £378,000 last year, had that profit more than wiped out by interest <Col N="962" /> charges which were in excess of £10 million. Irish Steel have to find £3.8 million each year to meet interest charges while NET must find almost £40 million.</P>
    <P>We all accept that it is necessary to keep down the cost of electricity not only to prevent increases in the cost of living but also to ensure that our industry is not placed at a disadvantage in their efforts to win or hold markets.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he intends having discussions with the ESB and I hope they prove fruitful.  I expect that the Minister will be in a position to make a favourable announcement on the matter shortly.  Another aspect of the discussion on the motion which I felt was unwarranted was the attack on the ESB staff, the manner in which it is portrayed that ESB staff deal with the ordinary consumer. I cannot speak for other areas of the country but in my own area of Waterford, particularly Waterford city where I live, I know the policy of the ESB in relation to the general public who have difficulty in paying their bills is an open-door policy and I am sure that that policy is consistent throughout the country.  It is disheartening to hear this constant sniping which surely must lead to a lowering of morale among workers of the ESB.  I recall the snowstorm last winter and the response of the ESB staff who worked 18 hours a day to ensure that supplies were kept going.  At that time it was politic for politicians to praise ESB staffs.  That is over now and the snow is gone.  It is open season in regard to State employees, and a very unfair advantage is being taken, particularly in the case of the ESB who are giving first-class service to the consumers and the public at large.  These allegations are reprehensible and harmful to the staff of the ESB and will lead to resentment among them.  There have been problems in the ESB from time to time, but we must accept that relations within the ESB structure have been developed to a highly sophisticated level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's speech in relation to the ESB fuel variation charge and its abolition.  This charge has given rise to considerable adverse comment up and down the country for a long time.  It was introduced some years ago when oil prices were increasing and it may have been necessary to some extent, but a levelling-out has occurred since then and there is no doubt in my mind that this charge should have been dropped by the ESB even before now.</P>
      <P>It is good to see that the House is not divided on this issue tonight.  Undoubtedly the benefits of the abolition will be seen right across the board by the normal householder, the farmers, the agricultural industry and industry as a whole, particularly small industries.  One can imagine that the cost of electricity to industry is a burden, particularly on small industries.  I live in Navan which is a hive of small industries based mainly on house furnishings and carpets and all the machinery in those small industries depends totally on electricity for its functioning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not alone given a commitment to abolish the fuel variation charge but also has given an undertaking to ensure that ESB increases will be confined in future to single percentage figures. In doing that he has given small industry an enormous boost and it would seem that he has also given them the opportunity to plan ahead.  They will know this year how to plan for next year. They will know what their energy costs will be.  Energy costs have been an exasperating and killing factor for small industries trying to develop, endeavouring to give employment, and then knowing that, having set their targets for the coming year, some time during that year through an ESB increase or whatever, their overhead costs in relation to energy have risen beyond their calculations and this has caused unpleasant ramifications for whatever industry it might be.  I have no doubt that the small industrialists I am <Col N="964" /> speaking of will welcome this decision of the Minister and will be with him in doing what he has said here tonight.</P>
    <P>The fuel variation charge has always puzzled householders who could never understand it fully.  Every Member of this House and of a local authority must have had at some time a visit from a constituent asking about this fuel variation charge, the reason for its initiation, whence it came and why it should be imposed.  The abolition of this charge will be an enormous benefit to every house-holder. As recently as last week I had a visit from a constituent, a young widow, whose ESB bill had caught up with her and because of a little bit of arrears and one thing and another she was unable to pay that bill.  The fuel variation charge in both her previous bill and her present bill was part of the reason.  I had to contact our local ESB office where I must say I am usually met with compassion, consideration and kindness when I make representations on behalf of a constituent.  The ESB were considerate in not cutting off the young widow's supply of electricity and through my representation they facilitated her by allowing her to pay her bill over a phased period.  It struck me then in looking at her bill how unfair, unkind and unjust this fuel variation charge was.</P>
    <P>Agriculture today is as dependent on electricity as industry.  There is not a dairy farmer in the country who does not depend on his electricity supply to milk his cows twice a day.  Farmers pay substantial electricity bills but now, because of the Minister's wisdom, they will not have to bear the brunt of this imposition. I know that farmers will greatly appreciate this move by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that we are living in difficult times, both politically and economically. It behoves us all to assist as much as possible the ordinary house-holder, the farmer and the industrialist. Any gesture which can alleviate their problems will be much appreciated.  By eliminating one problem we are indirectly assisting industrialists to give further employment.  Their overheads will be reduced and this may give them the incentive to take on more staff. <Col N="965" /> Unemployment is our biggest scourge and this gesture by the Minister will be worthwhile if it creates even one extra job per small industry.  I compliment the Minister on his fine and noble gesture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that the Fine Gael motion which seeks to abolish the fuel variation charge has been accepted in principle by the Government. This is a clear recognition that circumstances are now such as to allow of stability in the price of electricity and for a lowering of the price to the consumer.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies who took part in the debate.  It is always helpful to get the views of all sides of the House.  I was somewhat surprised at the ungenerous contribution of Deputy Gallagher of the Workers' Party.  I suppose it is symptomatic of the schizophrenic position which that party hold in the House.  His speech was certainly sympathetic to the Government position with regard to this motion and it only confirms my view that this party are in rampant support of Fianna Fáil.  Once that is understood by the public, I am satisfied.  I do not think they should be flying the flag of socialism in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his remarks Deputy Gallagher made certain allegations about the ESB which cast doubts on the integrity of certain personnel there, particularly those who have responsibility for the purchasing of primary sources of energy.  In view of his remarks regarding the other personnel employed by the board, I would expect that senior personnel in the ESB would take a very dim view of his remarks regarding purchasing policy.  I hope that his remarks regarding purchases of residual fuel oil or heavy fuel oil will be rebutted by the Minister in due course or, if not, by the ESB.  To my knowledge the board's policy is one of extreme competitiveness.  Indeed, when I had responsibility for the board I had difficulty in getting them to take any quantities of residual fuel oil from the Irish National Petroleum Corporation. To my certain knowledge their attitude to the purchase of both oil and Bord na Móna products is one of high efficiency which will tolerate only the highest <Col N="966" /> degree of competitiveness on the part of suppliers.  I hope that this aspect of Deputy Gallagher's speech will be rebutted.</P>
    <P>There are some aspects of the Minister's speech to which I wish to refer.  He expressed surprise that the previous Government did not make it a condition when granting the ESB an increase of 25 per cent that there would not be a further increase for 12 months.  In order to put the record straight I will reiterate what I said in my speech.  I said that at the time of sanctioning the 25 per cent increase my clear directive to the ESB was that there should be no further price increase for a period of one year.  I accept that the Government did not insist on a one-year moratorium on prices.  As the Minister responsible for the ESB I called in the chairman and the managing director and I told them quite bluntly &mdash;&mdash;</P>

The price application being examined will not become effective until the August-September accounts, which is one year later. It is obvious that the spirit of what I said to the chairman and managing director of the ESB has been adhered to and I am pleased about that.</P>

      <P>It is a relatively small point in the context of the debate.  I am glad there was not an increase for one year and I am not too sure that there should be an increase now, for the reasons I stated last night.  There was a serious loss of income to the board because of the electoral position of Fianna Fáil at the time and we had to rectify the matter by giving them an unduly large increase. However, 8 per cent of the 25 per cent granted was given for only one year and I expect that 8 per cent to be taken off the price of electricity as and from August-September.  I do not understand why the application for a 6½ per cent increase is being considered when 8 per cent should be coming off the price of electricity in accordance with the decision of the former Government.  I do not accept the argument of the Minister that oil prices did not fall in the context of currency fluctuations.  I am quite sure that the board were capable of buying forward to ensure that falling oil prices were translated into real falling prices in Irish money terms.  I am sure that was done by way of purchasing forward with dollars. I do not accept the argument put forward by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his contribution the Minister said I had reservations about gas to be given to Northern Ireland.  I did not say in my speech that I had any such reservations about this matter.  I said it was important to establish the true reserves in order to ensure that the allocation of those <Col N="968" /> reserves could be handled and understood by all concerned.  I welcome the supply of natural gas to Northern Ireland and I hope it will become a reality soon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the report of the National Prices Commission. Paragraph 55 states that the board are anticipating an increase in their total fuel bill in 1982-83.  In the case of fuel oil, the board forecast an average price for 1982-83 slightly above the average 1981-82 price.  I challenge that.  I hope that in the next review of the fuel cost variation surcharge, which will take place this month, the position will be reversed.  I made a slight error regarding the FVC when I spoke last night.  It is reviewed on a four-monthly basis by the National Prices Commission.  It was introduced to allow that four months flexibility while, at the same time, retaining the annual cost price increase.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the price of electricity should fall.  I have explained the reasons, such as natural gas coming on stream and the collapse in the price of oil.  The fact that the Minister has accepted the motion is an emphatic endorsement of my view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Deputy not do all of this when in office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows quite well that the drop in oil prices did not commence until January-February and it continued into March.  It did not begin to occur until this year.  The circumstances in which the ESB are operating are changing.  Natural gas will come on stream in Dublin and perhaps in other areas in the next few years.  I suggest that the growth in electricity sales will be static <Col N="969" /> to say the least.  In those circumstances the attitude of the board to efficiency is welcome and I hope it will be continued in the years to come.  I am aware of the excellent work done by the staff in difficult times, especially during the winter. I am aware that the board is not over-staffed. I believe that the service given to the public is efficient.  The point I made last night was that it is important that this concept of efficiency should continue to permeate the whole of the board's activities.</P>
      <P>The ESB have to contend with foreign currency movements and this was referred to by the chairman in the annual report for 1981-82 when he stated:</P>
      <P>A measure of this risk is the fact that adverse currency movements alone in the past year increased foreign borrowing liability by £35 million.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the time is ripe for the Government to guarantee the ESB with regard to their foreign borrowings against devaluation of the Irish currency.</P>

      <P>I have given permission to Deputy Harte to raise the subject matter of Question No. 107 on today's Order Paper.  Deputy Harte has 20 minutes.</P>

    <Col N="970" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago I found it necessary to raise this matter by way of Private Notice Question but for some reason the Chair decided that it was not sufficiently urgent to warrant a Private Notice Question.  I then asked to raise the matter by way of a question on the Adjournment and, with the consent of the Chair, I would like to ask the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of the chronic situation in County Donegal because Donegal County Council have insufficient funds to pay housing loans to applicants whose loans have been sanctioned. On the basis of this loan approval these people have committed themselves to a building programme and are now in severe financial difficulty because of the unavailability of funds.  Will the Minister make a statement on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise this matter because the position in Donegal has reached crisis proportions. I have been unable to ascertain the exact number but I am assured that well in excess of 100 people, ordinary working class people, applied to Donegal County Council for loans to build their own homes; their credentials were fully examined and their ability to repay the loan assessed and the loan passed, and on the basis of the information that they would get their loan from Donegal County Council they proceeded to build their own homes.  Now, having built their homes, they cannot get instalments from the county council even though the county council have sent engineers out to certify that the work has been done. Ordinary working class people are now financially embarrassed.  They cannot pay the contractor; the contractor cannot pay the supplier; the supplier cannot pay the agent from whom he buys his materials. There is a total crisis.  People are being hurt and something must be done immediately. I know young men and women who are rearing young families and they come literally crying to me.  I do not exaggerate.  Young people come to my house in tears to ask me if I can get their names on the list for the next payments. I go pleading to the loans section of the county council.  The officials there are totally sympathetic.  They say they will <Col N="971" /> try to do something, that they know the hardship involved, that they will try to include certain people in the next payments, only to be told that the Department of the Environment have not sent them sufficient funds.</P>
    <P>We need about £3.8 million this year. The Department have told us that they will give us money but they have not done so.  The people on behalf of whom I am making this plea to the Minister cannot sleep in their beds for worrying.  These are young working-class people embarking on the very serious project of building their own homes.  It is probably the biggest thing they will do in their lifetime. They work out the economics of it all. They do everything right and are very particular about the way things have to be done.  In good faith these applicants have commissioned contractors to build their houses.  In good faith the contractors have undertaken the task of building the house, and in good faith the suppliers have supplied the contractors with the materials.  The result is that everybody is bogged down in this vicious circle because the Department of the Environment have not made funds available to the county council.</P>
    <P>It is a strange thing that in the city of Dublin a young Deputy, a novice by many standards, with one day's experience in this House &mdash; I do not wish to take away from the intelligence of the young man &mdash; can negotiate with the Taoiseach the price of his vote in this House, £150 million for the centre of Dublin, but the second longest serving Deputy in this House who is a buddy and a pal of the Taoiseach &mdash; I will not go into how close the relationship is &mdash; who represents the same constituency as I is not able to persuade Deputy Connolly, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Burke, or the Taoiseach to provide a miserable £.5 million to get us out of our difficulty.</P>
    <P>At election time Fianna Fáil said they would reintroduce loans for single people.  It is easy to do that on paper when they do not provide the money. Now Donegal County Council have <Col N="972" /> approved loans to single people and cannot get the money.  Single people have to build houses urgently, but there are families living in bad housing that one would be ashamed to go into, and doing their best to make them habitable and embarking on the very noble and adventurous exercise of building their own homes instead of waiting for the local authority to build a house for them.  But the blindness of the Government has put them into a financial cul de sac and driven them almost to the point of a nervous breakdown.  Dozens of young couples are asking me to do something about the situation. I get on to the county council and I am told that they will do their best but that they are in difficulties.  They have got to the stage where they are fed up making excuses for the negligence of the Department of the Environment.  Too many times people have been told on the telephone that money will be provided.  Time after time Donegal County Council have been told on the telephone that money will be provided but there is nothing in writing and the money has not been provided.</P>
    <P>It is disgraceful to mislead a local authority into believing that the funds are available so that they approve loans to young people to build their own homes. These are ordinary working-class people. If they were not in the position of having to apply for a loan they would not be coming to me with cap in hand begging for something that they are entitled to.  It is a disgraceful situation and it is time the Minister told us how much money we are going to get and when we are going to get it.  I want an assurance from the Minister that he will make available immediately that £.5 million, which is approximately what is needed.  If that money is made available then the people that I have been talking about and pleading on behalf of will be able to sleep well in their beds.</P>
    <P>All of the people who are trapped because the Government do not make money available are working-class people.  The contractors are not very rich people; they are ordinary working people, working to provide for their wives and their families and they can ill afford to be out of the money for the work that they have been commissioned <Col N="973" /> to do.  The suppliers in Donegal are not that big.  They are not multinationals. They are just ordinary families who are in business for a living and find it difficult to stay in business and they cannot afford to do without the money.  I hope the Minister is getting the message.  This is a very unfair situation and there is no point in saying that it is not happening because it has been happening for the last two or three months.  The officials of Donegal County Council have been consistently in touch with the Department asking them for funds to get them out of this terrible dilemma.  They have been put off on numerous occasions and told that the money will be in the post, but nothing has ever been written down. Promises do not put cement blocks together.  If this problem was relevant to his constituency, the Minister of State would be kicking up a great deal of dust about it.  The ordinary people of Donegal who badly need financial help are as good as the ordinary people of Laois/Offaly.  I ask the Minister to listen to my appeal.</P>
    <P>I cannot emphasise strongly enough how important it is for the Minister to tell us if he can give us £400,000, and when can he give it.  If he does not give this money the banks will put pressure on applicants who have bridging loans, the contractors will put pressure on the applicants for the money they invested in building new houses, and the suppliers will be putting pressure on the contractors for their money.  These people will give no credit to a Government which glibly spend £150 million on promises given to the youngest serving Deputy, Deputy Gregory-Independent, who says &ldquo;The price of my vote is this list of things I want done.  If you promise to do them I will vote for you, Charles J. Haughey, as Taoiseach&rdquo;, which he did.  It is time Deputy Blaney told us what price he put on his vote.  The people on whose behalf I make this plea tonight give him no credit.  It would be very easy for Deputy Blaney to ring the Minister of State and say the people of Donegal need money. Some of these people are my supporters, some support Deputy Blaney and others support Deputy Conaghan.  They are <Col N="974" /> ordinary, good living, working class people who deserve to be recognised for their efforts to build their own houses.</P>
    <P>It should be recognised that inflation has caught up with them and the longer it takes to build these houses, the dearer they will be.  I feel very strongly about this and if the Minister does not tell us how much money he is giving us and when, I will make myself heard much more loudly in this House.  I am not exaggerating.  The position is at crisis point.  These people need the money and their problem cannot be solved unless the Department make money available for housing loans.  I appeal to the Minister to tell me if he can give Donegal County Council £400,000 to get them out of this vicious circle.</P>
    <P>As I have about six minutes left I will give way to Deputy Conaghan.</P>

      <P>I was not aware that this matter was being discussed this evening. I appreciate Deputy Harte's concern. We all know there is a critical financial situation in Donegal but I would like to put on record that this problem existed before this Government came into power.  For the first time in the history of the Donegal local authority there was no money for housing loans.  This happened during the term of the previous Government. Last November there was no money available from the Department to pay housing loans which had been accepted by the council.  Unfortunately the position has been aggravated &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This has left us in a ridiculous situation because of the shortfall <Col N="975" /> created by the previous Government. I am convinced the present Minister knows the situation and he will take steps to alleviate the problem we are facing. He should seriously consider the situation we inherited and do something to solve it.</P>
      <P>With a deputation from the Buncrana Urban Council I met the Minister of State, and Deputy Harte when a deputation from Donegal met the Minister for the Environment about the many problems facing the Donegal local authority. We made a very valid case and got a good hearing from the Minister and I am convinced he will provide some money to help us to get over these difficulties which were created because the previous Government did not provide the necessary money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

      <P>Since I was elected to this House I have made repeated representations for special consideration for County Donegal because there is a shortage of houses in that county and we have a very long waiting list.  This situation was caused because we have a young population which is increasing yearly and these people need to be housed.  They want to stay in Donegal and provide their own houses but they must be given the necessary financial help to do so.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have always made provision for these people.  For the first time in the history of the Donegal local authority we were not able to provide the necessary money, month by month, to the people who were granted SDA loans.  I know the Minister is aware of the position and will do something about it.  Everybody appreciates that there is a great scarcity of money and that there will never be enough to meet the amount, we as Deputies, would like to see coming to our counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put on record that we in Donegal have a case which deserves special attention and ask the Minister seriously to review the situation.  Sympathy is not what we want, it is money that we <Col N="976" /> need.  The necessary finances must be provided to allow the local authority to get over their present difficulties.  Would the Minister please deal with this serious situation as his finances permit?</P>

      <P>The capital allocation of £3,200,000 to Donegal County Council in respect of local authority house purchase, erection and improvement loans is the supplementary grant for 1982.  This allocation was made by Deputy Harte's Government when in office.  It is difficult for anyone in my position to foresee accurately the demand for SDA local authority loans. An extra demand for these loans has been brought about because we stabilised the interest rate at 12½ per cent on these loans, non-fluctuating.  The Deputy's Government increased that rate to 15½ per cent.</P>

    <P>To minimise such overlapping in the future it is proposed to adopt the following arrangements, with effect from 1 January <Col N="824" /> 1983:&mdash; (1)  Assistance by housing authorities under section 12 of the Housing Act, 1966, to Women's Aid should be restricted to work relating to the provision of additional self-contained housing accommodation by way of building, purchase, improvement or conversion; and (2)  Assistance in respect of the proposed refuge, which will be provided by the health board and operated by Women's Aid, would be a matter for the health board and the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>Regrettably, the board's allocation for 1982 has been fully committed.  The question of whether assistance can be provided next year will depend on the level of capital funding to be made available to the board and the degree of priority which the board can afford to this project in relation to other similar developments in the board's area.</P>
      <P>I might add that this project is largely of a housing nature and that any assistance which might become available from health resources would be related to its infirmary only.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of injury benefit in respect of an occupational injury from 19 January to 18 July 1981 when he exhausted his title to this benefit on the expiration of the statutory period of 26 week's payment. He was subsequently paid disability benefit from 19 July 1981.  In February 1982 he was transferred to the system of payment under which payment issues weekly <Col N="833" /> but medical evidence is required only at monthly intervals.  As a result of an administrative error a delay occurred in the issuing of the first payment under the new system.  All arrears due were however issued to him on 4 March 1982, and the subsequent weekly payments have since been issued regularly on the Monday of each week.</P>
      <P>In addition to the weekly amount of injury benefit and disability benefit payable the claimant also received payment of pay-related benefit up to 21 April 1982, when he exhausted his entitlement to such benefit.  During that period he was, however, precluded by regulations from receiving more by way of combined injury benefit or disability benefit and pay-related benefit than the weekly amount of his reckonable earnings in 1979-80, the contribution year on which his entitlement was based.  For instance, prior to the coming into operation of the 1982 budget increases on 4 April 1982 he was in receipt of £55.10 a week by way of disability benefit plus £12.78 a week in pay-related benefit.  As from 5 April his weekly rate of disability benefit was increased to £68.05 a week but it was necessary to reduce his pay-related benefit entitlement to £9.87 a week giving a total weekly payment of £77.92 so as not to exceed his average weekly earnings of that amount in the income tax year 1979-80.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Regulations provide, however, that the combined weekly amount of disability benefit and pay-related benefit payable may not exceed a person's reckonable weekly earnings in the tax year relevant to his claim.  While, therefore, the rates of disability benefit were increased in all cases the amount payable by way of pay-related benefit may have to be reduced in some cases in order to comply with these regulations.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the fact that there are 3,100 farms in the Arrow-Owenmore catchment area, many of them subject to flooding and precluded from participation in the western drainage scheme because of excessively high water levels, he will seek a special allocation of EEC funds for arterial drainage so that the farmers can have the advantage of grants generally available to their colleagues in the Western areas, and so that productivity can be increased over an area of 126,000 acres where the average size of farm is only 29 acres.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 740, 741 and 743 together.  The Owenmore catchment of which the Arrow forms part is No. 16 on the priority list of major catchments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Field surveys of the Owenmore catchment were carried out intermittently between 1963 and 1973 as engineering resources became available.  Some progress has been made with the design of a scheme which commenced in 1976.  It has not so far been possible to allocate a full <Col N="838" /> engineering team to complete the scheme and it is not possible at this stage to say when it might be completed.</P>
    <P>When a scheme for the Owenmore catchment has been prepared it will be considered for whatever EEC funds might be available.</P>

      <P>The Boyle River is the only major catchment for which a formal arterial drainage scheme has been prepared and on which construction works have not yet started. Works on the scheme will start in July in conjunction with works on the Bonet scheme.</P>
      <P>While some progress has been made with the design of schemes for the Suir, Owenmore (Sligo) and Mulcair catchments no scheme for a major catchment other than the Boyle River is complete.</P>

      <P>In the case referred to in the question, the company is in receivership and the employees concerned should pursue their claims against the company or the receiver.  If, however, the company is wound up, it appears that the provisions of section 13 (1) of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act would apply.  That section provides that any compensation awarded by the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the Act shall, where the employer is a company and is being wound up, rank as a preferential debt against the assets of the company. In that situation, the question of payment of the compensation in whole or in part would depend on the amount of the company's assets and the extent to which there are other preferential claims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned, in common with other employees of the same <Col N="859" /> employer, lodged an unemployment benefit claim on 4 January 1982.  As it appeared that there was a trade dispute detailed inquiries were made both from the employer and the trade union representing the employees.  When the inquiries were completed a test case was selected and referred to a deciding officer for the determination of eligibility to unemployment benefit.  When a large number of workers are involved &mdash; in the present instance some 40 &mdash; it has been accepted practice to take one case as representative of all claimants of similar circumstances and deal with the matter on this basis.  After examination of all the evidence the deciding officer was of opinion that employment was lost by reason of a trade dispute and the test claim was disallowed under the provision of section 35 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.</P>
      <P>Each employee was advised of the disallowance at the local office at which he was signing as unemployed.  In the case of the person concerned in the Deputy's question he was advised orally at the branch employment office, Ballybofey, on or about 5 March 1982 and told about his right of appeal.  In reply he stated he did not wish to appeal.</P>
      <P>An appeal had however been lodged in relation to the test case and an oral hearing took place on 26 February 1982. The employees were represented by officers of their trade union and the appeals officer explained that the test case was representative of all the employees who were involved in the issue.  On the 2 March 1982 the appeals officer upheld the disqualification of the claim on the grounds that employment was lost by reason of a stoppage of work which was due to a trade dispute at the claimant's place of employment.  The claimant was accordingly covered by the test case appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The officers of the trade union were immediately informed of the decision of the appeals officer.  In this connection the manager of the employment exchange was assured by a trade union official representing the claimants that all claimants, including the person referred to by the <Col N="860" /> Deputy in the question, were fully advised of developments in relation to their claims.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, satisfied that the person concerned was at all times fully informed of the issues involved, and of the outcome of the decision of the deciding officer and the subsequent test appeal. Unemployment benefit is accordingly not payable in this case while the claim remains disqualified under the trade dispute provisions of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.</P>

      <P>It is presumed that the parliamentary question refers to an unemployment benefit claim as there is no record of a disability benefit claim in respect of the person concerned according to the Department's records.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 25 May 1981 to 28 April 1982 after which he resumed work and he was paid weekly at a reduced rate pending the completion of inquiries about the non-payment of contributions by his employer.  These investigations were only recently completed and it has been established that he is entitled to payment on unemployment benefit at the maximum rate following the collection of outstanding contributions.  Arrangements have been made to pay the adjusting arrears of unemployment benefit when the person concerned next calls to his local office.</P>
      <P>According to the Department's records he has insufficient earnings to qualify for pay-related benefit as a supplement to flat-rate unemployment benefit during the period of his claim.  However, inquiries to ascertain if he has additional earnings during the relevant April 1979 to April 1980 income tax year are still in train.  When the necessary inquiries are finalised his entitlement to pay-related benefit will be determined.</P>

He has now been notified of the correct number and has been requested to use this number on all correspondence with my Department in future.</P>
      <P>The claim has now been re-admitted and arrears of disability benefit due for the period 26 April to 5 June 1982 were issued on 31 May 1982.  Further weekly payments will issue on receipt of medical evidence of incapacity at monthly intervals.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the procedures governing the operations of local improvements schemes from 1967 to 1981; if he will give details of any changes which were made recently in these procedures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The administration of the Local Improvements Scheme is a matter for county councils subject to the provisions of the Local Government (Roads and Drainage) Act, 1968, (No. 6 of 1968) and general guidelines issued annually by my Department.</P>
      <P>Following the adaptation of the Local Improvements Scheme to take account of EEC aid available under the western package for farm roads, it was necessary this year to advise the county councils concerned that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a specified minimum amount of their allocation should be devoted to farm road projects,</P>
      <P>(b)  that a minimum local contribution of 10 per cent (which is a necessary condition for EEC aid), would apply to farm road projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of that portion of their allocations not devoted to western package projects, it is open to county councils to apply the general principle of the scheme (which in appropriate circumstances may <Col N="867" /> include a lower rate of, or no local contribution) to other Local Improvement Schemes.</P>
    <P>A copy of the 1982 memorandum issued to the county councils in the western package area will be forwarded to the Deputy for his further information.</P>
