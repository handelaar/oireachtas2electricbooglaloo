    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I spoke for a few minutes after Deputy Bruton's interesting and constructive contribution. The first point I made was that I thought it indefensible that the Dáil should have remained in recess until the end of October at a time of economic crisis.  As the House is aware, our country faces a quite unparalleled crisis of depleted Exchequer finances and of unemployment which is in the range of 168,000 people, 31,000 of whom are under the age of 25 years.  There is political paralysis in the administration of our economic affairs because of a minority Government who are not certain from <Col N="224" /> one day to the next whether they can command the support of the House to pursue a policy of economic management. In that situation there is a grave danger that the solutions necessary to resolve the crisis will be further postponed as happened in 1980, 1981 and for the most part in 1982.  The result will be that the crisis will be more prolonged and intractable in 1983.</P>
      <P>I hold the view that the Labour Party have a quite different approach from that of the other political parties in the Dáil with regard to the economic crisis.  The document produced by Fianna Fáil is very strong in well-written phrases and is well produced in terms of analysis of the budgetary problems facing the country but it is not a plan.  It is a programme which does not hang together with regard to output figures, export projections and Exchequer financing.  Despite the assurances given by the Taoiseach yesterday that there had been extensive consultations with the ESRI, with the Central Bank and with the Commission with regard to the budget deficit, I do not accept that informed economic opinion here agrees with the basic analysis.  Once again in his anxiety to be all things to all men on economic issues, the Taoiseach has fallen into the trap of taking out the difficult parts and leaving us with a programme that does not hang together. That is the basic deficiency in the document and I will deal with that matter in detail later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Fine Gael side there is an excessive preoccupation with budgetary stringency without a balanced reflection on the taxation side and the need to balance taxation revenue so that we can maintain essential public and social services.  The document produced by that party has some good things such as proposals regarding a reduction in the PRSI rates but they are more clearly related to the prospect of an early general election than to reality so far as income tax and PRSI contributions are concerned.  Despite many excellent items in the Fine Gael programme for economic recovery it has that basic deficiency particularly with regard to taxation and on the need for the maintenance and development of taxation <Col N="225" /> to pay for essential public and social services.  These matters are absent from the document although I agree it is a fair and reasonable presentation of many other aspects.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's approach is quite different.  We maintain we must provide Exchequer resources to meet the needs of the unemployed and of school leavers. We say we must provide Exchequer resources to maintain essential public and social services and, above all, to develop prospects for the creation and maintenance of jobs.  In that way we are different in our approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>At the moment I will refrain from commenting on The Workers' Party plan but I will do so later on.  It is alleged to be an output plan but it does not face reality and does not stand up.  It is a combination of different observations by different sections of the party and it does not knit together.  I will give one example of what that plan states:</P>
    <P>Over the next three to four years, however, we recognise that it will be necessary to devote the planned increase in national output to the reduction of the foreign debt of the State.  This means that the extra money from increased foreign exchange earnings cannot be used to expand employment in those sectors to meet the social needs of the country, such as health services, education, urban environment and housing.</P>
    <P>In other words, no money will be available. Yet, the plan goes on to indicate among other things that we will have a national health service with medical cards for everyone, free hospital service for the entire population and an extra 7,500 teachers.  There is not the slightest indication in the plan where the money will come from other than from what they call &ldquo;output&rdquo;.  Despite many reasonable and fair observations in the plan it does not hang together.  I am very critical of documents produced by political parties, where different spokesmen put in their own contributions with regard to health, electronics, agriculture and forestry and then call it a plan.  That is not so.  It is just a series of chapters which do not relate to one another.  This is what happened in <Col N="226" /> relation to the famous investment plan. I remember when the Department of Finance produced an investment plan for Fianna Fáil.  They did a very good investment side and compiled a really excellent contribution with regard to taxation and the disciplines required to have the money for investment.  However, Deputy Haughey put in the material relating to investment but he left out all the data regarding the disciplines required so far as taxation was concerned.  He called it an investment plan but, of course, it was not such a plan.  It was totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>In view of the unprecedented character of the economic crisis facing this country today we must welcome, and I warmly welcome, the fact that the political parties are producing economic documents and what they call plans or programmes. This is the first time I can recall the different political parties almost simultaneously producing economic and social policy documents of a general nature, however inadequate their plans may appear to be.  Unfortunately, most parties produce plans and programmes and then leave them there thinking that merely producing the document will solve the problem, but needless to remark a great deal more has to be done.</P>
    <P>The alternative proposals which I intend to put before the House on behalf of the Labour Party are, we maintain, responsible, constant and capable of implementation.  Our first priority is maintaining competitiveness in the Irish manufacturing and export industries.  Everything else pales into insignificance.  There is a direct link &mdash; and any political party who did not acknowledge it should return to their economic textbooks &mdash; between inflation and job losses.  There is no doubt that a lack of competitiveness, even in a recessionary climate, has led to redundancies and factory closures.  The lack of competitiveness has hit large sections of the agricultural and food processing industries.  We have to rectify that situation first and the sooner we do so the better.</P>
    <P>While a great deal of our inflation is imported, too much has been domestically created by direct Government action and by inappropriate approaches <Col N="227" /> to incomes policies.  There is no doubt in my mind that our actions often fuel inflation and add to existing costs.  Lack of competitiveness, and inflation which is the worst in western Europe at this stage, have been the product of social and political attitudes here.  These attitudes have come from the Fianna Fáil Party.  That may seem a very sweeping statement but from 1976 onwards, when the famous manifesto began to take shape, there was what one might call Fianna Fáil inflation generated by the deliberate social stimulation of unreal expectations among many sections of our society.</P>
    <P>People may say I am harking back too far, but everyone knows that in economic affairs five years is the minimum period in which one can do any kind of reversal of general economic policy, and that it takes at least five years to recover from that kind of approach.  Only now in 1982, is the problem, which is virtually at an intractable stage, being recognised. There must be a long-term planned approach to incomes policy based on permanent consultation between the Government and the employers, the unions and the farmers' organisations.</P>
    <P>That is why I was appalled at the Government's deliberate abrogation of the public service pay agreement.  That was a retrograde decision because while it may help the opening budget deficit for 1983, it undermines and corrodes basic confidence between the trade union movement and the Government and could result in there being no national wage agreement for 1983-84, leaving a residue of distrust in its wake.  I believe the national understandings represented the first step towards a comprehensive approach in which all aspects of the incomes question could be tackled in the context of overall national development. I regret that in the Fianna Fáil programme, the Fine Gael document and the other documents available, there is no reference to the prospect of further national economic and social understandings. Rather there is an unrealistic figure stating what the likelihood might be of wage increases in 1983 to 1986.  That is a basic inadequacy in those documents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> I regret that the Government's economic strategy is in ruins.  I would like to know where the Government's document was printed.  It does not seem to have a Cahill's or other Government printing code on it.  I would like the Minister of State to tell me how much it cost because we are all very preoccupied with costs. The publication of this new programme does not deny the fact that the Government strategy is in ruins.  I submit that any pretence at planning or management of the economy has been abandoned in favour of what can only regrettably be called public relations and political survival at any cost.  My biggest problem at present is with credibility about this plan being implemented in any way.  I do not believe, despite the Taoiseach's vehement protestations, that he is going to implement it.  The process of budgeting official estimates of receipts and expenditure has been brought into permanent and damaging disrepute.  I hold that view very passionately.  If I did not, I would not waste the time of this House saying it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach in many ways has been maligned because from 1977 to 1980 one would imagine he was the lone author of all the misfortunes which befell the country arising from the famous manifesto. He was not.  There were other people around and they, too, must accept their responsibility.  But certainly from 1980-81 he was exclusively and utterly responsible.</P>
    <P>In apportioning responsibility for the sorry mess in which we find ourselves today I can go back to 1979 when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, said in an Adjournment debate that their policy of recruiting 12,000 civil servants would be fully implemented by the end of the year and that the last 4,500 were at that time being recruited.  Admittedly Deputy Haughey was probably in Inishvickillaune but there were other Ministers in office who cannot be wholly excused. However, there is no doubt that the responsibility during 1980-81 rested exclusively on the shoulders of Deputy Haughey.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is that economic growth <Col N="229" /> has collapsed and scarce Exchequer resources which should have been conserved in 1979-81 to offset the worst effects of the recession have been frittered away and we are now faced with a programme from the Government which is not capable of being implemented.  It has no prospect of actual success and there is not a single economist of repute who would hold out any hope that it can be implemented in the immediate future. We will be doing well if we achieve a growth rate of 1 per cent in 1983 and that is a measure of the gravity of our economic problems.  Ours is an economy which would require a growth rate of at least 4 per cent per annum if we were to have any hope of reducing unemployment significantly and providing adequate resources for essential investment and public services.  I strongly submit that the momentum of growth promised has been lost not just because of the world recession or because of high interest rates during the past three years but also because of substantial mismanagement and misdirection of resources by the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is a measure of the crazy priorities we have had in recent times.</P>
    <P>There must be a change but I am not sure that the Taoiseach can bring about that change.  It has been strongly suggested by the Taoiseach that the key features of the economic plan are sustainable. I do not accept his view, any more than I accepted his apologia in successive election campaigns.  During the general election campaign in June 1981 the Taoiseach maintained that the country's finances were in good order, that there was a great prospect of growth towards the end of 1981 and that the incoming budget prospects were quite rosy.  When we introduced our budget in July 1981 Deputy Haughey maintained that there was no need for such a budget and that it should never have been introduced.  He said of our January 1982 budget that it was wildly excessive and unnecessary, that there was no cause for concern, that the overall Exchequer situation could be put right without any great sacrifice and without any problems developing.</P>
    <P>Then in March 1982 we got a new <Col N="230" /> budget.  The Taoiseach dominated the Minister for Finance to a degree which was unprecedented in the history of the State.  I submit that as far back as April 1981 he had absolute awareness of the situation, prior to going to the country. There was a working group on future budget policy in the Department of Finance.  They produced a document dated 7 April 1981 which I received when I went to the Department of Finance. The document states as follows:</P>
    <P>The essence of Government policy is the achievement of sustainable economic growth adequate to provide employment for an expanding labour force and to generate resources for social development.  This requires a positive development programme focused on investment in the productive areas of the economy and a phased and disciplined reduction in the current deficit.  The 1981 budget is based on this policy.  The budget targets have been set to support a record investment programme, with expenditure in the Public Capital Programme rising by 36 per cent, while provision is made for a modest cutback &mdash; from £547 million to £515 million &mdash; in the current deficit. Overall Exchequer borrowing is projected to be reduced from the 1980 figure of 14.5 per cent of GNP to 13 per cent of GNP this year.</P>
    <P>That was the view of the Department of Finance of what the 1981 budget postulated. That budget was announced in January 1981 and the report was produced in early April of that year.  It states further:</P>
    <P>Foreign borrowing in 1981 is likely to raise the Exchequer foreign debt to £3,000 million.  Our credit standing abroad is good at present but because of the rapidly rising level of our debt, there can be no guarantee that the £800 million or so in foreign borrowing required this year can be obtained on the same terms as have applied to loans negotiated up to now.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Difficulty of Achieving the 1981 Budget&rdquo; the document <Col N="231" /> states:</P>
    <P>If there is a substantial deviation from the 1981 budget arithmetic or if there is a substantial carryover of commitment from 1981 to 1982, then the conclusion in the report will need to be revised.</P>
    <P>This is really significant:</P>
    <P>The experience of 1980 in particular, when supplementary estimates of expenditure, totalling more than £250 million, were required, has raised queries in the Dáil and elsewhere as to the ability of Government to live within the budget limits that have been set for this year.</P>
    <P>That is a very clear internal observation. We must remember that this document was available to the Government, to the Minister for Finance, and to the Taoiseach who said everything in the garden was rosy.  The document went on:</P>
    <P>Generally it would be hoped to realise the revenue targets in the current budget, on the basis of the underlying economic assumptions.  The same cannot be said of the current expenditure figures.  These add up to an increase of 14 per cent on the 1980 outturn.  The increase in the pay figures is 18 per cent and the non-pay figures 11 per cent. The non-pay expenditure allocations generally will not match inflation and the reality is that they will be exceeded substantially if the decisions already taken to exercise restraint are not matched by practical measures to enforce these decisions.</P>
    <P>This gives the lie &mdash; and I use the word &ldquo;lie&rdquo; deliberately &mdash; to what was suggested time and again by the Taoiseach, that there was slippage, nobody knew, everything in the garden would be rosy. This notion was perpetuated right through the election campaign of May-June 1981.  In television performance after television performance, in speech after speech at the cross-roads, the Government were happy with the way things were going, when they knew, and had a report before them, that everything <Col N="232" /> was totally different.  That is way I do not believe in <i>The Way Forward.</i>  I cannot believe anything any longer.  The document went on to say:</P>
    <P>The consequences of these developments on pay and non-pay expenditure, if they are not counteracted, will be substantial supplementary estimates in the latter half of 1981 which will increase the budget deficit and defeat the policy of reducing reliance on borrowing.  It will also destroy confidence in the determination of Government to put more order into the public finances, and will be directly contrary to the approach proposed in this report.</P>
    <P>These are selective quotations of necessity. There is a limit to what one can disclose.  When I went into the Department of Finance in a junior capacity I sought all the available information within the Department to satisfy myself as to who was telling the truth.  I was quite horrified at the kind of information available.</P>
    <P>That brings us to the 1982 budget.  This is all very germane to the 1982-1986 situation in the context of this plan.  We have the massive overshoot in the current budget deficit which was predicted clearly by all the commentators as far back as last March.  Only the Taoiseach seems surprised.  I stated as far back as budget day in March that the outturn of the budget provisions would result most likely in a deficit in current account of at least £900 million because of the determination to implement a whole litany of election and by-election promises and deals of all shapes and sizes in virtually every constituency, ranging through the Gregory deal, the Blaney deal, the Dublin west deal, the Whitegate deal, the Clondalkin deal, the Talbot one, the Beaumont Hospital deal &mdash; £65 million on that one &mdash; and the decentralisation deals.  They are all evident.  That is why we will finish up with an accumulated deficit of £920 million projected for the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The most decisive factor in the 1977, 1981 and 1982 general elections was the cash hand-out promises made by the <Col N="233" /> political parties in those election campaigns. The most culpable and most blameworthy were undoubtedly on the Fianna Fáil side.  The Fine Gael promises in the 1981 election were equally wrong and unsustainable.  The Labour Party were in Government with the Fine Gael Party and they stopped them from being implemented.  There was the famous massive tax credit operation and there were the other arrangements for which a figure of £460 million loss in revenue came up in the Department of Finance on an initial checking.  The plan was as expensive as that.  For the most part it was scrapped and, in the heel of the hunt, loss of revenue to the Exchequer would probably have been no more than £30 million or £40 million.  The Fine Gael tax package which won that party a substantial number of votes in the 1981 election was not sustainable and was accepted as such by the Fine Gael party in office.</P>
    <P>I have a copy of the Labour Party's 1981 election programme.  I remember the leader of the Party, Deputy Cluskey, throwing his eyes to heaven when pressures were brought to bear on him to make some concessionary promises in the election campaign.  He would not.  He is a very obdurate and difficult man when he believes he is right, and he was right. He was quite correct in not making any soft option promises.  A great deal of money necessary for social, health and education services, for employment maintenance and creation was squandered in the quest for political power from 1977 to 1981.</P>
    <P>How do we get out of the grip of that situation?  We will not get out of it by saying to the Irish people: &ldquo;We will plan a programme.  We will implement the Telesis Report.  We will implement sections of the McKinsey Report and sections of the report by the Commission on Income Taxation.  There will be no problem. It will all work out in the end.&rdquo;  That has been the classic approach of the Taoiseach in particular.  When Brian Farrell interviewed him on television on <i>The Way Forward</i> that was a very interesting interview.  He said the situation was very difficult and we must get to grips with it. When the interviewer asked did this not <Col N="234" /> involve sacrifices he said it would all work out, there would be no drop in standards of living and that nobody would have to pay very much for it.  It was the same old story.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to the question of taxation.  Any plan or programme which deliberately ignores and casts aside issues relating to taxation is not dealing with reality in terms of future economic and social development.  At the moment in western Europe and in this country there is great anti-taxation feeling, great anti-public expenditure feeling, great anti-welfare feeling which is reprehensible because if this manifestation of what is in fact, we well know, 19th century economic philosophy prevails we might as well dismantle the economic superstructure and the budget and all go home and leave it to chance.  In any modern economy it is expected, and citizens have the right to expect, that the Government will provide a wide range of services to the community, including nealth, education, housing for those in need, environmental services, social welfare services and so on.  Over the past 20 to 30 years the range and extent of those services have increased greatly and continue to do so even today in all OECD countries. Thus in 1965 total public expenditure, current and capital, amounted to 37.9 per cent of gross domestic product and today the percentage is up to 67.1.</P>
    <P>I want to advance a philosophy which is totally different from that contained in <i>The Way Forward</i> and which to an extent is implicit in the Fine Gael document and virtually absent from The Workers' Party one.  The policy objective of our party is a further proportionate actual increase of public expenditure which is necessary to remove the many inequalities in the present system.  If we are to have the best standards of health care available in all parts of the country to all those who need those services, if we are to have a greater emphasis on, for example, preventative medicine, which we should have, if we are to have a greater emphasis on community health programmes, which we should have, if we are to open up second level education to all those to whom it is currently denied, if we are to open up <Col N="235" /> third level education to all those social classes and income groups who are currently denied third level education, if we are to house the homeless in our community, and if we are to provide basic adequate support on a family income basis to those who have no work or who are without adequate income, and furthermore if we are to extend our policy along lines which would be quite appropriate to give selective assistance to both agriculture and industry, then there is only one way we can do it, namely, devote a greater proportion of GDP to public expenditure.</P>
    <P>It will be argued that this runs contrary to all concurrent conventional thinking. It does not.  The only thing that has been wrong with the way we have been going about it is that we have financed our public expenditure by an excessive reliance on borrowing, domestic and foreign. That has been the problem.  We have ignored the fact that there are two sources of funds for public expenditure, taxation and borrowing.  Borrowing, while it has an important role in the development of any economy, particularly capital programme borrowing, provided it is invested on a productive basis, is nevertheless an expensive way of funding public expenditure particularly when interest rates are high.  I concede readily that that is so and that borrowing often merely defers the problem of financing public expenditure from one year on to the next.  However, it should be possible to learn from experience over the past five years and to have a proper, reasonable balance in the budget and in the Government's programme from now to 1986 between borrowing and taxation. So far it has been all borrowing and Governments, with the notable exception of the Government of which I was a junior Minister for 8 months, have been relying almost exclusively on the borrowing prospect.  In Ireland annual interest payments on public sector borrowing were 13.9 per cent of total tax revenue in 1965-66 while by 1981, 24 per cent or nearly one quarter of total tax revenue had to be used merely to pay the interest on early borrowing.  Therefore, there are <Col N="236" /> sharp and absolute limitations at this stage on the borrowing side.</P>
    <P>However, given the crisis over public borrowing, to get the commitment of my party to maintain and, it is to be hoped, increase the level of services provided by the Government, it is quite clear that taxation is the only other major source of funds available for public expenditure. There is considerable dissatisfaction already about the current levels of many forms of taxation and it is being argued that there is little scope for increasing taxation.  On this point it is useful to compare levels of taxation in Ireland with those in other countries.  If we look at the revenue statistics of OECD member countries for 1981, we find that the levels of personal income tax, social security contributions and corporate income taxes in Ireland as a percentage of GDP are below the average of all OECD countries and most European countries, while taxes on goods and services and on property as a percentage of GDP are higher than the OECD average.  Nevertheless, total tax as a percentage of GDP is slightly lower in Ireland than the OECD average.  International comparisons of this sort must be treated with great caution since each country is unique and income levels and social and taxation structures vary widely.  Nevertheless, it is reasonable to conclude that Ireland has not reached the limit in terms of taxation levels except perhaps for indirect taxation where I think it has reached the limits compared with most other countries.</P>
    <P>The crux of the matter is the structure and the equity of our taxation system and the other objectives, apart from revenue raising, such as the redistribution of income, incentives towards different policy objectives and so on.  Our present taxation system has developed in a most haphazard way, with new taxes being introduced separately with no regard for the overall pattern, with numerous exemptions, with special cases being provided for, with various small pressure groups having their own tax inch &mdash; sometimes for valid reasons, sometimes merely for short political gains or special pleadings, or simply because of reactions <Col N="237" /> within the system to various pressure groups.</P>
    <P>Our entire tax system has for years provided a happy hunting ground for tax avoidance and evasion.  It is, therefore, of considerable importance that the Government as a matter of absolute urgency should look at the entire tax structure.  It is necessary to maintain and increase total revenue, otherwise basic social services and public services will be dramatically curtailed.  In that context I am concerned about a number of aspects of the report on the Commission on Taxation. My greatest concern this morning is the virtual absence from the Fianna Fáil document <i>The Way Forward,</i> of any indication of the future taxation profile of the Government between now and 1986.  All the Government say, in an indefinable way, is that they will provide relief of about £100 million for PAYE and, between capital taxes and VAT, an increased yield of £400 million.  Beyond that meaningless statement there is absolutely no projection of PAYE or VAT yields up to 1986.  That could have been done, but was not.  There is no indication of any kind of profile of taxation which any plan normally would convey and which the Department of Finance could project, if requested, in a coherent and responsible way.  There is no response at all to the Report of the Commission on Taxation.  I readily concede that it would be impossible in the short period of preparation of this plan for the Government to respond in detail to this report, but there is no response at all.  I did not expect any response.</P>
    <P>My basic point on behalf of the Labour Party is that in a recessionary period I do not accept that this House should yield to the popular notions of anti-social welfare, anti-public expenditure and anti-taxation and dismantle our social and economic structure because of these highly negative social pressures in our community.  In a recession the burden of unemployment and of falling real incomes invariably bears hardest on low income families, on unskilled workers, on those without property and those who have not had an opportunity in their lifetime of accumulating any savings &mdash;<Col N="238" /> therefore on a particular segment of the community.  If we use our tax system effectively it can be a major redistributive force in our society and a key feature of social policy, eliminating a great deal of inequality and poverty.  That is why I welcome the comments made by Peter Bacon of the Economic and Social Research Institute with reference to two taxes.  He suggested, and I share his view, that consideration be given to the question of property taxes, about which there is nothing particularly new.  In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 17 October he said:</P>
    <P>Property taxes could be used to expand the tax base.  Recent studies have estimated that a comprehensive property tax of one to 1½ per cent could raise some £250 million.  To save on administration costs, self-evaluation might be used, with incentives not to undervalue.  Net yield from this tax could be £140,000,000 assuming existing rates were abolished.</P>
    <P>I also share his view that there should be a system of taxation of imputed income of houseowners and that this would work on the estimation of a notional rent on a house similar to the pre-1969 taxation of imputed income from land.  Such a scheme affecting house owner-occupiers could yield £20 million to £40 million in income tax.  I further agree with his comment that there should be taxation on gains from land rezoning. He maintained that the total gains could yield £30 million to £50 million annual tax if we had an effective taxation system derived from a special capital gains tax. All those areas of taxation could be substantially developed here.  I state very strenuously that there is absolutely no way to obtain economic recovery based only on value-added tax, customs duties, excise duties and miniscule capital taxation. The outcome of that policy is a massive reduction in basic public services and social services.</P>
    <P>There should be a greater interaction between the Government and the Central Bank on the monetary policy side. As at present constituted the Central Bank cannot effectively fulfil its obligations as the central statutory agency for implementing monetary policy and regulating <Col N="239" /> and controlling our financial institutions. At the moment the Labour Party have a Land Bill on the Order Paper and are only entitled to one Private Member's Bill, but we intend to move, in due course, a Private Member's Bill to remove the nominees of the commercial banks from the board of the Central Bank, thus enlarging the independent authority of the bank.  It is also our intention to ensure that exemptions given to the banking system under the Restrictive Practices Act of 1972, the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, and the Prices Acts of 1958, 1965 and 1972 be abolished.  There is no effective interaction on economic policy between the Central Bank and the Government of the day.  They treat one another very much at a third or fourth remove.  I share the view that there is a need for greater governmental public influence over the financial system as a whole, that there is a need to ensure that the banking system and the other financial institutions are brought more closely under the general supervision of governmental policies wherever that is necessary for the achievement of economic and social objectives.  This has been done successfully in France and in Austria, for instance, as well as in Italy &mdash; though that may not be the best example &mdash; as well as in many other European countries.  In these places there is a very close interaction between the central federal banks and the government of the day.  That does not seem to be the situation here.  Again, I would cite Germany as another example of where there is much more systematic influence on the part of the State in so far as the banking and credit sectors of the economy are concerned.  That sort of reform is much needed here.</P>
    <P>Perhaps my greatest disappointment with the plan is the omission of any structural governmental planning.  There is no provision for a national economic and social planning board.  What happens here is that when problems arise they are hived off to the NESC, to consultants or to inter-departmental committees instead of being dealt with at central government level.  The NESC in their <Col N="240" /> report express concern about the spread of responsibility between Government Departments and their associated bodies, a situation which the council maintain reduces the capacity for a unified approach to the formulation and implementation of industrial policy.  I share also the view expressed by the council that the functions related to industrial development should be arranged in such a way as to ensure that the main thrust of industrial policy is focused clearly on the priority issues referred to in the previous sections of their report.  The council recommend a review of the co-ordination between the Departments with the objective of ensuring that the primary responsibility for industrial development policy is clearly assigned.</P>
    <P>One of the appalling inadequacies of our governmental system is the diffusion of responsibility for industrial development as between various Government Departments.  When I was in Finance we had the Industrial Credit Corporation, Fóir Teoranta and the ACC.  We were happy with our lot and looked after them quite well, but then there were another lot on some distant horizon &mdash; the Department of the Gaeltacht.  They were looking after Údarás na Gaeltachta, though no one knew from one end of the year to the other what they were up to. At the same time there were the IDA, a massive body with a staff of 800 developing industry and services with a Minister supposedly in charge, though it would take a Minister working full time to look after that body whereas the Minister concerned has responsibility also for such bodies as the IIRS, a critically important body with a substantial budget, and also the Irish Productivity Centre, SFADCo and the Irish Goods Council.  In addition he has responsibility for the Kilkenny Design Workshop and the new National Enterprise Agency.  He also has his functions as a member of the Government as well as having responsibility for the area of energy.  That is a crazy situation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately governmental departmental portfolios have become stalking horse gifts between different politicians within the one party or between parties, <Col N="241" /> allocated by and large without reference to the capacity of the individuals to service those Departments or to know what they are supposed to be doing. What we have is a seniority hierarchial authoritarian allocation by the Taoiseach of the day to satisfy his party, to satisfy regional party considerations and to satisfy the personal ambitions of individuals. While all that is just part of the system, it is highly undesirable in a country of 3.4 million people supposedly having an independent sovereign Government. After 60 years of self-government we are incapable of having a Cabinet governmental departmental structure capable of developing industry and services in a coherent way.</P>
    <P>We may be critical of our State-sponsored bodies but a big argument developed about the setting up of a national development corporation.  Such a body was envisaged as being the solution to all our problems, but while it is all right to set up such a body it becomes one huge mess unless the other superstructure is cleared out of the way.  For example, let us take a State-sponsored body in terms of its relationship with a national development corporation.  Let us suppose that we have a national enterprise agency. Presumably, those in that agency would want the body retained.  In other words, in Ireland everything remains in some form or other.  Let us assume that tomorrow we establish a national development corporation and that there is a question of some major new piece of electronic technology.  What happens?  We go to the national development corporation, to the national enterprise agency, to the relevant State-sponsored body and having been with the chief executive of that body we go then to the board.  After the board have spent a great deal of time debating the issue with management and usually with other powers in the land, what do they do then?  No matter which State-sponsored body are concerned they will become involved with three Departments, inevitably with the parent Department, also inevitably with the Department of Finance and then with the Department of the Public Service with whom everything winds up, staffing, <Col N="242" /> salaries and so on.  That having been done, back the whole thing goes to the Minister, who goes to the Government, the Government come to the Houses of the Oireachtas and by then somebody has had a nervous breakdown along the line and lost a file.</P>
    <P>That kind of structure does not work, and the appalling profusion of development ideas here are not successful. Therefore we need dramatic changes in our structures.  Take France.  They have a Minister for Public Enterprises responsible for all public capital investment; they have a Minister for Technology responsible for that area, they have a Minister for the Budget and a Minister for Social Affairs.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, here we have not such a structure.  If we are to have a real way forward we need dramatic changes in our overall Government structures.  I share Deputy Bruton's view expressed at the end of his speech last night when he made a proposition to the Government.  Unfortunately, this Government like all Governments do not wish to hear any more.  Their plan will be recyled into 25 scripts between now and 16 November, the Clare by-election.  It will be forgotten then.  The plan will be useful around Ennistymon and Lahinch after Mass on Sunday mornings.  Unfortunately that is what it will be used for.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton suggested that we should have a budget committee of the House which could sit down not in confrontation or in a political argumentative way but which would sit in Room 114 and take the book of Estimates which is to be published in three weeks containing the projected outturn of expenditure for 1982.  Incidentally, this is a unique development in the history of the State: it is the first time that we have been given in November a Book of Estimates in respect of 1983.  We welcome that.  Therefore, we should have a budget committee to discuss and if possible to reach agreement on the Estimates.</P>
    <P>At the Labour Party Conference last week I stressed strongly that despite the severity of our current budget situation it is possible to do a great deal on economic and social development in a short <Col N="243" /> period.  We have the scandal of between 750,000 and 800,000 people living at the bare social welfare subsistence level. That scandal of poverty could be abolished. I had no hesitation in saying in Galway last week that here we spend £2 million a day, even in recession, on booze.  I said that a small portion of that could solve poverty.  I said to my colleagues and to the people of Galway that any country that could afford to spend £4 million at two days of horse racing in Ballybrit outside Galway can also afford to eliminate poverty.  I went on to say that in a country which can give massive budget reliefs every year on house mortgages, even to people occupying from three bedrooms to six bedrooms, where people can have holiday homes and get mortgage relief on them, we can afford to house the homeless, the travelling people.  I indicated in Galway that any country which could afford after-tax profits of £13,000 on one acre of rezoned agricultural land could well afford to provide decent serviced sites for the travelling people.</P>
    <P>I strongly hold the view that a country in which profits from farming are nearly all untaxed could change the present situation dramatically by way of an equitable system of taxation.  I think I correctly pointed out last weekend that the Government talk about a rational capital taxation being introduced between now and 1986 but when the Government had the opportunity in the last budget to introduce taxation on discretionary trusts whereby 1,600 of the wealthiest people have salted away £500 million which would have yielded £4 million in tax, the Government did not do it.  Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the Government will do it between now and 1986.  That is why I do not believe the Government's projection in regard to capital taxation.</P>
    <P>I hope that any future Government which fail to commit themselves to basic reforms of our financial structures will not get the support of the Irish people.  I believe that inevitably the outcome of the next general election will be that those who do not put their policies on an honest basis, without gimmicks or election <Col N="244" /> promises, will not receive support.  The policy of the Labour Party has been one of unremitting reluctance to give Dutch options.  We have been reluctant to indulge in harebrained policies like demanding that small farmers compulsorily should be retired at the age of 65, that they should no longer be allowed to occupy their farms, that kind of undemocratic lunacy we have had from some political parties.  I think that the fair, progressive, democratic policies of the Labour Party will be accepted by the electorate in the years ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am greateful to Deputy Sherlock for having given way to me.</P>
      <P>Deputies will have heard with shock and revulsion of the cold-blooded murder of three Irish soldiers serving with the United Nations Interim Force in the Lebanon. The soldiers who died were Corporal Gregory Morrow, Private Peter Burke and Private Thomas Murphy, all from Dublin.  A fourth soldier, who is from Belfast, is suffering from severe shock and is being treated in hospital.</P>
      <P>Despite our best endeavours we have as yet been unable to establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident. Every effort to do so is being pursued by the United Nations on the spot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From such information as has come to hand so far it appears that the four soldiers were manning a checkpoint at Tibnin Bridge within the Irish contingent's <Col N="245" /> sector of operations when they were attacked by men armed with automatic weapons.  It appears that the three men were killed almost instantly.  We are informed that the fourth man managed to send a radio message to Irish headquarters at Tibnin.  When this message was received a patrol was sent out immediately but the incident was over by the time the patrol arrived.</P>
    <P>Since the Irish troops went to the Lebanon 16 of our men have lost their lives there in the course of duty.  Can there be any greater evidence of the commitment of this small nation to the cause of world peace and the role of the United Nations than the sacrifice of these young lives in a distant land?  These attacks on our troops inevitably raise the question of whether our contingent should continue in its role as part of UNIFIL.  This question was considered recently by the Government when the question of the extension of the mandate came up.  The decision of the Government was that Ireland should continue to supply troops to the force.  This decision was strongly influenced by the repeated requests of the Secretary General of the United Notions, voiced most recently when the Minister for Foreign Affairs visited New York to address the United Nations General Assembly in September.  The necessity for the continued presence of the force was again emphasised by President Gemayel of Lebanon in talks which he had last week with the Minister for the Environment at Shannon Airport.  On that occasion President Gemayel expressed his appreciation of the contribution which Irish Forces had made to peace and stability in the area.  In the course of conversations which the Minister for Defence had last week with the Force Commander, General Callaghan stressed that the local population regarded it as essential that UNIFIL should continue to serve in the Lebanon because of the stability and protection it provided in its area of operations.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the mandate for the continued presence of the force in the Lebanon was renewed recently for three months ending on 19 <Col N="246" /> January next.  It is clear that UNIFIL has not received the full co-operation of all the parties in the area in the discharge of its mandate, which is broadly to lessen instability in the area in the interests of international peace and security and to help the Government in the Lebanon to restore its effective authority.  The nature of the mandate and related questions will have to be reviewed before next January.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am sure that all Members of the House will wish to join with me in expressing sympathy with the bereaved families and relatives of those who died and in wishing the surviving member of the checkpoint party a full and speedy recovery.  In their grief we hope it will be some consolation to those families that their men died nobly in the cause of world peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join the Taoiseach in asking this House to convey to the relatives of the three young men who sacrificed their lives in the interest of world peace yesterday in the Lebanon our deepest sympathy and to offer our best wishes for the speedy recovery of the young soldier from Belfast who is in hospital in the Lebanon.  That message of sympathy should go also to the Chief of Staff and the comarades of those soldiers in the Army.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Taoiseach for coming so speedily to the House to give us what must be necessarily an incomplete account of what happened yesterday.  We are all extremely proud of the job being done by our troops as part of UNIFIL.  That we have not been as successful as we would wish is a matter of regret.  But I am glad that the Government have decided at this stage to renew the mandate of our troops going to the Lebanon.  That is the correct decision. However, it is one that should be reviewed constantly and, if circumstances so change, we might come to another decision as regards taking part in UNIFIL forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frequently we do not appreciate, or perhaps more correctly do not express, our appreciation in this House of the role of the Army, not just as security forces <Col N="247" /> in this country but of the contribution they have made now for almost 30 years to peace-keeping all over the world.  In their present mission 16 members of the Defence Forces have lost their lives.  This House, the Irish Army, Irish people and particularly their families can be proud that their lives were lost in an attempt to bring about world peace.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I wish to be associated with the expression of sympathy to the families of the three Irish soldiers shot in the Lebanon yesterday.  It is to be hoped that whoever were the perpetrators of the attack will be apprehended soon and made answerable for their crime.  For over four years now Irish soldiers have been serving the cause of peace with UNIFIL.  During that period a total of 16 of our soldiers have died in varying circumstances. The region of Lebanon has seen no central Government of authority since the civil war there began in 1975. Armed gangs and tribal militia have held sway there, some Lebanese Christians, some Lebanese Moslems and the PLO. These militias have been armed to the teeth and supported by outside factions, by Israel, by Syria and others.  The role of a peace-keeper among such factions is rendered almost impossible.  We can be proud in this House that our soldiers have carried out their extremely difficult task with courage and determination.  It is to be hoped that the new situation now obtaining in Lebanon, following the departure of the PLO, will enable the new Lebanese Government, under President Gemayel, to establish their full authority and that all remaining forces in the Lebanon, Israeli, Syrian and others, will now remove themselves from that war.</P>
      <P>Finally I submit that the role of UNIFIL in the changed circumstances must be re-examined.  Hopefully, our soldiers will be able soon to hand over their vitally important duties to an independent Lebanese Army and return home.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Workers' Party I should like to express shock, indeed horror, at the brutal murders in the Lebanon of the three Irish soldiers on peace-keeping duties with the United Nations forces.  I should like to extend our deepest sympathies particularly to the families of the young men who have been taken from them so tragically. Our country has had an honourable record over the last 20 years in providing troops for United Nations peace-keeping forces in some of the most difficult situations in the world.  Our troops have acted with honour and great courage. For a small country the price we have had to pay in the loss of our troops' lives has been very high.  However, further loss of life in the Lebanon should not be allowed to undermine our commitment to the United Nations, particularly in the efforts to bring peace to the Middle East.  While those responsible for yesterday's outrage have not yet been identified, it must be said that serious efforts to undermine the authority and effectiveness of the United Nations forces in the Lebanon have been made by various groups and factions.  As Deputy Barry Desmond has said, the PLO have already withdrawn from the Lebanon.  We would urge that the Irish Government press at every available opportunity for the withdrawal of Israeli forces as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>We believe that the United Nations offers the best hope for lasting peace in Lebanon.  International pressure must be exerted on Israel to withdraw from Lebanon and to end its hostilities to the United Nations forces which has been evident in recent times.  We believe that the mandate of the UNIFIL forces must be strengthended but UNIFIL needs more than moral support.  The Government must seek a strengthening of powers and additional resources for UNIFIL.  This could best be done by upgrading the status of UNIFIL from that of a peace-keeping force to that of a peace-enforcement role.  The very least that must be done is to ensure that our troops are given adequate support and resources to defend themselves and ensure that yesterday's outrage will never be repeated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Desmond concluded his contribution with a reference to the plan issued by The Workers' Party I should like to make a brief statement on it before dealing with the Government plan.  Our plan states that the economics of despair has been fully reflected in Ireland, where the propagandists of pessimism maintain that defeatist measures such as work-sharing, the black economy, phoney work experience or training programmes, or the removal of disincentives to work, are the only means available to counter the ever-growing problem of unemployment. We reject this defeatism and assert that it is the duty of every political party which seeks to serve the people to formulate a realisable and realistic programme to create full employment.  Full employment is the demand of our society, and it cannot be shirked.  In stating clearly that full employment is our priority in economic policy, our plan goes on to say that we do not intend to underestimate the difficulties that exist for the creation of employment in the immediate future. One could say that the dogmatic adherence of the conservative political parties to free enterprise policies has placed the Irish economy in very deep difficulties. The balance of payments deficit and the level of foreign borrowing cannot continue without a compensating increase in national output.  The reckless destruction <Col N="250" /> of the economic foundations of the country, and the stubborn refusal of Fianna Fáil and the Fine Gael-Labour Coalitions to plan this economy, to mobilise its resources, mean that in the immediate future all increases in national output must be devoted to reducing the unsustainable foreign debt, instead of expanding the productive work force.  Our plan continues:</P>
      <P>We cannot borrow to meet the very great social and economic needs of the population until the problem of the balance of payments deficit is solved. Thus a realistic plan for full employment must necessarily incorporate a programme to solve the foreign debt problem.</P>
      <P>Thus the programme which we outlined for the years up to the beginning of the nineties incorporates a strategy consisting of two phases: (1) a recovery plan to stabilise living standards and the unemployment level, meet the growing social needs of the population and bring down the unsustainable balance of payments deficit and (2) a programme for full employment that will involve the creation of an additional 300,000 jobs in the next nine years.</P>
      <P>Full employment &mdash; which involves the provision of socially necessary and productive jobs for the available work-force &mdash; can be achieved by the beginning of the nineties if the annual increase of national income can be raised to 5 per cent in real terms.  This is an eminently realisable objective if the resources available to the country are mobilised through a national production plan in which State intervention is made the engine of growth.</P>
      <P>The land of Ireland is the country's greatest natural resource.  Unfortunately, Irish farmers have so far failed to realise anything like the full potential of this land and all past policies which were aimed at increasing production have been almost total failures for one reason or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like at this juncture to refer to the vast sums of money being given by way of State aid, incentives and services to the private sector.  In the Government plan the whole emphasis is on the private <Col N="251" /> sector and the estimated cost to the Exchequer in 1982 is £2½ billion.  The Fianna Fáil plan is a deception.  The first part carries a grim statement of what is in store for the less well off in our society. The second part of the plan is pure fantasy, it will never become a reality.  I am not suggesting that the second part of the plan is intended to become a reality, it is there to help sell the first part of the plan. The second part of the Fianna Fáil plan pretends to believe that it is possible to get increased output by giving more grants and bribes to private enterprise. This formula has never worked in the past and, therefore, there is no possible chance that it will work now.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the first part of the plan.  In paragraph 18 there is an insulting message for the unemployed: &ldquo;to remove the present disincentive to work, flat-rate unemployment benefit for short-time workers will be limited to ensure that it will be related to a five day working week and pay-related benefit for those workers will be withheld&rdquo;.  The expression, &ldquo;disincentive to work&rdquo;, is a grossly ignorant insult to the unemployed because they did not choose to go on the dole this year rather than last year or the year before.  People are on the dole because they cannot get jobs and for no other reason.  If there were jobs to go to in Britain, as was the case over the greater part of former terms of office of Fianna Fáil, our people would be on the emigrant ships in search of them.  Fianna Fáil, more than any other party, know that people want to work but if they admitted to this knowledge it would be impossible for them to justify robbing the unemployed of a part of their benefits.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil plan also intends to rob the disabled because overall benefits will be reduced from the ceiling benefit of 100 per cent at present to 80 per cent of, as they state, reasonable weekly earnings. Pay-related benefits for those entitled will be reduced from the current level of 40 per cent to 30 per cent for the first six months and to 20 per cent for the remaining nine months.  The Government, according to the plan, will rectify the anomaly whereby employees by a <Col N="252" /> combination of tax refunds and social welfare benefits can receive more than when they are whole-time at work.  This is used as an argument against the unemployed when any reasonable person can see that it is an argument against lower wages.</P>
    <P>There will be fewer employed in the health services and those services, such as they are, will become just illness services to an even greater degree.  Our health services are costing a vast amount of public money but it is not the services that our people are getting that are costing such an amount of money.  It is the system, particularly the fee-per-item system, payable to doctors and pharmacists that needs to be reviewed.  A national health service can be introduced while committing very little additional resources to the health services.  The only thing that is required is the reallocation of existing expenditure and the restructuring of the present service.  In Ireland the pharmaceutical and medical professions have been allowed to serve their own interests.  They have not been compelled to serve the public interest as is the case in most European countries. Successive Ministers for Health have failed to tackle the monolith of the medical profession in this country.  Consequently, we have the high cost of the services without any real benefit to the people.</P>
    <P>There is a statement on page 24 of the plan that £100 million will be lifted from the shoulders of those who pay tax under the PAYE system but this must be read against another statement further on in the plan that VAT will be increased.  This is an increase in indirect taxation which will be payable by the same people as pay tax under PAYE.  If the statement in the plan were to read &ldquo;increased taxation from farmers, self-employed and professional people&rdquo; without anything else we would accept it.  The fact that VAT is also included means that the £100 million, which it is stated will be collected, will come mainly from VAT.</P>
    <P>In table 6 on page 35 of the plan a fairly clear view is given of what the plan intends to do.  Over a period of five years wages and salaries will increase by 10.5 <Col N="253" /> per cent and consumer prices will rise by 9.25 per cent.  I suppose we are expected to take that figure seriously.  Profits are forecast to rise by 23.5 per cent.  Wages will be kept well below the forecast rate of inflation.  This means that the Fianna Fáil plan is one to reduce living standards. Nobody believes that inflation can be reduced while the rezoning of land multiplies its value by 10.  The result of this is that many young people intending to get married and start a family face a levy on rent and massive mortgage repayments. Food prices and house prices are higher in real terms than is the case in New York where pay is about three times higher than people get here.</P>
    <P>The plan seeks to shift the responsibility for housing from the public housing programme to the private sector and this must be rejected.  Housing is an essential social necessity and houses must be provided at a reasonable cost, even if that means incurring a loss.  It is proposed that the number of houses be reduced annually.  Anybody who believes that the need for housing can be taken up by the private sector has got it all wrong.  Untold harm is being done to family life because of the length of time young people have to live in grossly overcrowded and totally inadequate living accommodation before qualifying for local authority housing. The majority of such people are earning less than £100 a week.  If those people were to take out the cheapest mortgage, which is £14,000 on an SDA mortgage, the repayments would be £150 per month.  How could a person earning less than £100 a week take out a mortgage and meet those repayments?  There is no way they could provide the essentials of life for themselves and their families if they did that.  The plan states that the cost of public housing has risen so sharply in recent years that it places a limit on the extent of State support and that the emphasis over the planned period will be on encouraging householders to provide their own houses and reducing the degree of State support for public housing.  The number of families in deserving need at this time is increasing annually, so the number of people who will apply for local authority housing is likely to rise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="254" /> Table 6 on page 24 spells out a clear intention to reduce living standards by putting iron restraints on pay increases. Less will be spent on education and there is more than a broad hint that school buses will be withdrawn.  We are spending less on all levels of education than any other country in the EEC and now we are to have another cut to put us further down the ladder.  What will the Fianna Fáil plan do for the class that party represent?  CIE will have to give more of the profit-making road haulage section to private enterprise.  This will mean greater subsidies to CIE because any enterprise must make losses if their profitable sections are cut away.  One cannot over-emphasise the madness of that policy to hand over the lucrative road haulage business to the private sector.  I come from an area where at this time of the year we see the extent of the private road haulage business.  One will not see a CIE truck any day going into Mallow sugar factory.  A few years ago quite a number of CIE trucks were hauling beet. I am giving that as an example to prove we know what we are talking about in relation to the question of handing over the lucrative road haulage business to the private sector.  It reduces the chances of those who will find themselves unemployed by the introduction of one-man buses, as suggested in the Fianna Fáil plan, getting alternative employment with CIE.  If they are lucky to get jobs they will be forced to work for one of the notorious cowboy hauliers who remain in business by breaking every rule in the book.</P>
    <P>What has the Fianna Fáil plan to say in relation to increased output?  The plan states in relation to agriculture that a £70 interest subsidy is available for each calved heifer retained in the herd, a calf premium of £20 payable when the calf reaches six months and then there is the suckler cow scheme.  This is a repeat of the policies which have failed in previous years.  This is a policy of throwing money at farmers in the hope that it will stimulate them into producing.  Why should it work now when it has not worked in the past?  The beef cow herd is smaller now than it was in 1974.  On page 35 of the <Col N="255" /> Fianna Fáil plan there is a blunt statement that living standards are to fall.  It is qualified by saying that this is a short-term expectation.  To say the cuts in living standards are intended to be of short duration is a deception because if Fianna Fáil really believed in their plan the cuts in spending on the unemployed and those suffering from disability, the spending cuts on health and school buses would not need to be made as the increased output which the Fianna Fáil plan pretends to believe will come from the private sector of the economy would provide a surplus.  We say so in detail in our plan. The long-term intention as well as the short-term intention in the Fianna Fáil plan is to set standards of living of ordinary people on an ever-descending spiral.</P>
    <P>The reason why an ever-falling standard of living is an essential part of the Fianna Fáil plan or the Fine Gael plan is obvious; it is to enable us to go into competition with Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Puerto Rica as low pay countries in order to attract the cheap assembly end of this or that industry.  We call in our plan for the development of skills and for high technology industry and this means a high pay economy.  Anyone who thinks that this is an extreme view or an unreasonable view should read the Telesis Report which was so damning of the outlook contained in the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael plans.  We wonder if this is what caused a long delay in the publication of the Telesis Report.  We despaired of it being published at all and some months ago we released it to the media ourselves.  Perhaps this was a factor in forcing the release of this report which shows clearly what the Fianna Fáil plan is about.  It is the way forward to a low pay economy.</P>
    <P>What is the attitute of the Fianna Fáil to the State sector?  It is to reduce all mention of this sector to the question of pay, to load all the worries of the economy on this single item.  We say that this is not true for the following reasons. The Fianna Fáil plan ignores the fact that many public sector workers are highly skilled manual workers and technicians. It can be said without fear of contradiction <Col N="256" /> that the only serious engineering industries in the country are located in Aer Lingus, the Sugar Company, the ESB and Bord na Móna.  There is more technical know-how in the ESB, the IIRS and NET than in all the private enterprise sector combined.  The Fianna Fáil plan prevents this skill being harnessed for economic recovery.  The Fianna Fáil plan makes economic recovery impossible by reducing all this skill and expertise to a mere prop and support for private enterprise. The State sector needs to be given its head to lead the way out of the present depression.  Money now being wasted on one or other sector of private enterprise should be diverted into the sort of high skilled output activity which is the only road to full employment.  All establishment parties shrink from proclaiming that the goal of our society is full employment. We say that full employment is possible and in our plan we show how it can be achieved.  Selling off State company assets to private enterprise is not the way.  Many people are now beginning to see clearly that we no longer have real private enterprise; we have a number of privately owned firms receiving handouts of taxpayers' money.  I gave the figure earlier, £2.5 billion.  We have the expertise of the State companies placed at the disposal of the profit makers.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil plan will be a failure because it relies on the sector of the economy which has failed to deliver the goods on so many occasions in the past, the private sector.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I should like to refer briefly to the situation regarding social welfare cuts and to say that when it is proposed to cut social welfare benefits at present the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 1981 people who applied for unemployment assistance are being assessed on their incomes in the previous year. This has resulted in leaving sick people, where this section of the Act has been applied against them, without being paid supplementary welfare allowances by the health authority.</P>
    <P>My final point refers to the road policy. Nowhere in the Fianna Fáil plan have I seen any reference to the county road system.  All the emphasis is on national <Col N="257" /> primary and national secondary roads.  I do not have the figures now but in my county the county road system is very highly rated.  An effort has been made to have a reclassification programme.  A plan that refers solely to the national primary and secondary roads without any reference to the county road system whose users are entitled to have a policy for county roads so that maintenance and improvement programmes can be undertaken, is sadly lacking.  In this plan there is no indication that that will be done.  All in all we say that the plan is in no way acceptable to us as a workers' party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Realism, responsibility and purpose are the hallmarks of the national economic plan now before us.  The world economic recession poses testing problems for our growing nation, with its young population and its industrialising economy.  Nobody owes us a living; we are full and committed members of the European Communities, but our independence as a nation requires us first and foremost to rely on our own efforts in face of the challenges before us.</P>
      <P>The National Economic Plan begins by rightly emphasising the efforts now required of our people as a test of national spirit and independence.  This Government have no fear of the people of Ireland been found wanting in the demanding situation before them.  Unlike the previous administration, we feel no need to fall back on unproductive sermonising or on sterile analyses of the many woes which face us.</P>
      <P>Our job is to govern and in <i>The Way Forward,</i> we seek to exercise this role in two ways: first, and without apology, by encouraging the great store of energy, potential and resilience which this nation enjoys; and secondly, by seeking to harness this effort into the most productive and beneficial channels possible by means of the particular programmes which the national plan draws up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contrast with this planned, purposeful and fully costed approach to economic recovery over the next five years the many half-truths and facile analyses <Col N="258" /> which have already been offered on behalf of the Opposition.  I am little concerned about the unheeding opportunism involved in this approach.  What is more serious, however, is the discredit which it does to the sober perception of the country's problems already held by the Irish public and especially by our young people.  Very simply, the people know that problems occasioned by a world economic recession are not going to dissolve in face of petulant criticism of the Government or easy political opportunism. Our plan of action is now drawn up and the best service which the Government can now offer the people is to set about implementing it without delay.</P>
    <P>As Minister responsible for the building and construction industry, including such essential services as housing, roads and sanitary services, I feel it important to focus attention on what I may call the development elements of the plan.  A study of the plan will show that despite the difficult financial circumstances facing the Government, these infrastructural needs are carefully catered for.  Our particular priority has been to concentrate the limited financial resources on key investment, including productive infrastructure and, of course, on necessary social services.</P>
    <P>The plan is particularly concerned for the needs of the building industry.  Public sector support for the industry, currently running at 70 per cent of total investment, is crucial to its welfare at all times, but particularly in times of recession.  Since 1980, the increased public sector support has had a counter-recessionary effect on the building industry, helping to maintain output and employment to a significant degree against a massive drop in private sector investment.  For example, between 1979 and 1981, private sector investment fell by over 30 per cent while overall output fell by less than 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>The building industry is still suffering from lack of confidence, depressed demand and the general effects of recession, and the likelihood is that recovery will be difficult.  Given this general scenario, the commitment to a five-year capital investment programme for housing, roads and sanitary services will be warmly <Col N="259" /> welcomed by all elements of the industry. Between them, these three programmes add up to about half of total building output; the commitment to maintaining capital investment in housing at the 1983 level and to increased investment in roads and sanitary services will, therefore, go a long way towards stabilising the industry and generating the confidence needed to bring full recovery.</P>
    <P>One of the main concerns of the plan is to direct public capital investment into productive and cost effective projects in an orderly and purposeful way.  The roads programme will be a particular beneficiary of this policy.  The National Economic Plan endorses and renews the Government's commitment to the Road Development Plan for the 1980s already adopted by us in 1979.  It provides for a capital investment in our major road network of £100 million in 1983; £111 million in 1984; £122 million in 1985, 1986 and 1987.  These amounts, which total £577 million, are at 1983 prices and this investment will bring the road plan substantially towards completion by the end of 1987.</P>
    <P>Underlying the priority accorded by the Government to roads is the accepted need to bring our major road network closer to the standards obtained in the rest of industrialised Europe.  The most pressing reason for this is the economic one; the geographical isolation with which Irish transport has to cope should not be compounded by internal obstacles to the flow of goods and services on our roads.  The major schemes envisaged by the plan will accordingly give priority to key works designed in particular to meet industrial and commercial needs.  But important environmental and safety benefits will also flow from this ambitious roads programme.  New by-passes, bridge crossings and inner relief roads will relieve many of our towns from the environmental disadvantages of traffic congestion.  These and other improvement works will also enable our roads to cope more safely with increased traffic.</P>
    <P>Many major road schemes are at present under way and should reach completion during the period of the National <Col N="260" /> Economic Plan.  The Naas by-pass, which is of motorway standard, is expected to be open to traffic in mid-1983 and in conjunction with a planned by-pass of Newbridge, will significantly improve the route to the south and south-west.  Similarly, the Dublin-Galway route will benefit from major improvements at present under way at Palmerstown, from improvements scheduled for the Lucan-Kilcock section and from the by-pass of Athlone which includes a new bridge over the Shannon.</P>
    <P>A concerted series of improvements to the N1 (Dublin-Belfast) route will take place in the next five years and will include by-passes of Santry, Swords, Balbriggan, Dunleer and a relief road for Drogheda.  Work on the third phase of the Drogheda inner relief road is about to commence as is the construction of the Swords by-pass, and improvements to the route between Whitehall and the airport are proceeding.</P>
    <P>Major improvements are also scheduled for other areas throughout the country. New bridges are proposed for Sligo, Galway, Limerick, Kilkenny and, as already mentioned, Athlone, with two Custom House bridges and an Opera House bridge planned for Cork.</P>
    <P>Many other schemes will contribute to the improvement of the national road network over the plan period.  These are designed to bring the national routes up to a specified minimum standard and will involve realignments, provision of hard shoulders, eradication of accident black spots and strengthening of pavements.</P>
    <P>The average direct employment generated by the £577 million in capital investment in roads provided under the plan will be 4,200 jobs annually.  Added to this will be the substantial indirect employment afforded by road works, which allow a high use of Irish made materials.  Ongoing road maintenance will of course continue to make its contribution to both direct and indirect employment.</P>
    <P>The momentum started by the road development plan for the 1980s is being maintained and consolidated by the National Economic Plan.  The outcome, I am confident, will be a national road <Col N="261" /> network of proper European standard to which industry, business and the people of Ireland themsleves are fully entitled.</P>
    <P>On the plan's provision for housing, it bears saying first of all that for the first time ever, a Government commitment has been given to maintain the level of public capital expenditure in real terms over a five-year period.  This will give maximum flexibility in planning and adjusting housing policies to meet changing requirements while at the same time giving the building industry the assurance that the existing high level of public capital support for the industry will be maintained. Full advantage must be taken of the projected level of investment to keep the number of houses produced as high as possible and to channel aid to those most in need of it.</P>
    <P>Despite present difficulties, we are making a generous allocation of £210 million available to the local authority housing programme in 1983 &mdash; an increase in real terms on the allocation for this year. We have at all times given a high priority to rehousing those who are in real need and are unable to house themselves. Deputies may be assured that this commitment will continue.  The capital allocation for housing construction has already increased by 127 per cent since three years ago &mdash; a rate of increase well above the level of inflation in the building industry generally.</P>
    <P>As envisaged in the national economic plan, it is the intention that local authority house building programmes will be subjected to a critical review which will be carried out in conjunction with a detailed analysis of the housing needs in each area.  It seems to me to be vital in the present economic circumstances that local authorities should maintain housing lists of approved applicants and should keep these lists updated annually.  This is, of course, already standard practice in many areas and is, in fact, an essential element in ensuring that overall resources can be distributed among local authorities on the basis of the relative degrees of housing needs existing in the areas.</P>
    <P>In assessing applications for local authority housing there is a responsibility <Col N="262" /> on local authorities to ensure that those persons seeking rehousing who might reasonably be expected to house themselves are made aware of the grants, subsidies, loans, tax relief, and so on, available to house purchasers and are given positive encouragement to house themselves. This has become a vitally important part of housing policy because not alone does it give such persons a stake in their own homes but it ensures that the scarce capital resources which the Government can make available for the purpose are used to the best advantage to provide housing for those most in need.  I will be looking to all local authorities to pursue active and vigorous policies in this matter from now on.</P>
    <P>The economic plan refers to the levels of subsidies &mdash; amounting to more than £80 a week on average &mdash; now falling to be paid on new local authority houses to the extent to which the aggregate rents from all local authority houses fail to meet even the costs of their maintenance and management, let alone contribute towards the cost of loan charges.  In 1982, the shortfall between total rental income and total maintenance and management charges is estimated to be in the region of £23 million.  In addition to this, the State's outlay on subsidies towards the cost of local authority housing will amount in 1982 to over £96 million.  In 1983, this cost will increase to £128 million. The maintenance of a good standard of existing local authority housing is obviously desirable and one could argue that more money should be spent on improving and maintaining the stock of such houses.  It is clear, however, that the levels of subsidy on such houses now being carried by the taxpayer are a serious barrier to what can be achieved in raising standards of existing housing. Further, these subsidies are now growing at a rate which, if it were to continue, could in time give rise to a completely unsustainable burden.  At the same time the average weekly rent of a local authority dwelling is under £5.50 per week which, as Deputies well know, is significantly below the levels of rent in the private rented sector for dwellings of very moderate quality.  The Government, <Col N="263" /> through the differential rents scheme, are determined to ensure that tenants on very low incomes will continue to be protected, but the inevitable consequences of this is that those tenants who are able to pay more must be asked to do so.</P>
    <P>The statements in the plan on house prices and the provision of finance reflect the genuine concern and commitment of the Government.  Part of the strategy of the plan is to reduce inflation which will have the effect of reducing house prices. The Government will continue to encourage the building societies to make funds available to purchasers of modestly-priced houses.  In fact, the Government at present require societies to allocate at least 70 per cent of all mortgage finance towards providing mortgages for house purchasers whose mortgage requirements do not exceed £20,000.  The societies are also obliged to allocate at least 40 per cent of all loans for the purchase of new houses.  There has been an encouraging improvement in the inflow of funds to the societies in recent months which, I am glad to say, has resulted in a relaxation of the conditions for obtaining loans from the societies.</P>
    <P>I have also been very pleased to note the continued downward trend in interest rates which I believe will soon be reflected in reduced building society interest rates and lower repayments for borrowers.  In this connection I should now tell the House that I will be meeting the building societies' association tomorrow at noon to discuss this question and I am confident of an early decision resulting to reduce interest rates.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to ensuring as far as possible that sufficient mortgage loan funds will be available from public sources through the SDA scheme and the Housing Finance Agency.  The SDA scheme with its fixed interest rate is most suitable to those on lower incomes.  The agency, although still in its infancy, is already proving to be popular largely due to the lower repayments under the scheme in the initial years.  The agency expects to advance £15 million to local authorities this year and I have allocated £60 million to the agency <Col N="264" /> for 1983.  I am asking the board of the agency to consider possible improvements in the loan scheme in the light of their generous capital allocation of £60 million for next year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that a change is being made in the structure of payments made under the mortgage subsidy scheme under which the payments made will take effect over a five-year rather than three-year period as heretofore. This alteration in the scheme should not, however, be viewed in isolation from the overall effects of the measures proposed in the plan.  Lower interest rates and lower inflation, for example, will mean that the outgoings of house purchasers will be reduced.  Looked at against the background of the difficult economic conditions, the modest change made in the terms of the scheme cannot, I feel, be regarded as unreasonable.  Even with the alterations, a £1,000 subsidy will be payable in the first year which together with the £1,000 grant represents a substantial State assistance for first-time buyers in their first year of home ownership.</P>
    <P>The Government have also retained the scheme of house improvement grants at their existing levels.  This is designed mainly to encourage the conservation of the existing housing stock and ensure the provision of basic amenities in these houses.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the subject of private housing, I want to refer to the scheme of tax relief for private rented residential accommodation, which we introduced in the 1981 budget.  This scheme now accounts for about 3 per cent of total housing production and the question of expanding the scope of the scheme to meet the need for extra private rented dwellings is now being examined as a matter of urgency.  Such an extension is foreshadowed in the plan and I am hopeful that an early announcement can be made in the matter.</P>
    <P>Despite some undoubtedly difficult problems, then, for housing there are a number of matters which give cause for optimism.  Building society interest rates have come down significantly and a further reduction is now in the offing.  The effect of this development is to bring <Col N="265" /> about a welcome reduction in mortgators' outgoings and also to bring house purchase within the reach of increased numbers of persons.  Coupled with this, the societies' requirements for the granting of loans are now more liberal than they have been for some considerable time and conditions in the housing outlet are favouring the buyer.  The Housing Finance Agency is being given the resources necessary to make it a real force in the overall housing situation.  The incentives under the scheme of tax relief for private rented accommodation are to be improved.  The Government are committed to the maintenance of the 1983 level of public capital expenditure on housing.  All in all, I am satisfied that these and other matters dealt with in the plan exemplify the Government's continuing strong commitment to the central importance of housing and represent a most commendable effort, despite the adverse economic environment, to maintain the programme at the highest practicable level of output.  In fact I would go so far as to say that there are few Governments anywhere which, faced with the problems with which we have had to deal, would have been prepared to accept a degree of commitment to housing comparable to that assured by this Government.</P>
    <P>Now I want to refer to a most important policy initiative in the plan.  It concerns import substitutes.  It is a fundamental requirement for the success of the plan that Irish goods should capture an increased share of the domestic market. The trend towards increased import penetration which has been apparent in recent years in all sectors of the economy from food to building materials must be reversed very quickly.  This is essential both in terms of maintaining and creating employment and of correcting our unsustainable balance of payments deficit.</P>
    <P>There is a huge potential for replacing imported building materials with domestically produced materials. In 1981, imported building materials were valued at £350 million, of which approximately £170 million could have been made at home.  This indicates that, although the <Col N="266" /> building industry has a relatively low import content, there are nevertheless substantial opportunities for Irish enterprise which could result in the creation of 5,000 to 10,000 jobs.  I intend to see that the many initiatives of the National Economic Plan which affect the building industry are harnessed in support of this policy of import substitution in every way possible.  It will, of course, take an intensive and sustained effort on the part of this country to bring about the degree of import substitution that is required.  It will involve the public and private sectors of the economy and above all the ordinary consumer.  We must begin by ensuring that our products are price competitive. We must aim for unsurpassed quality and a wider range of products. We must counteract the prejudice against Irish goods which, regrettably, is evident in some quarters, and promote a greater consciousness of the benefits which accrue to the country from the purchase of quality Irish goods.  It has also been shown that ignorance of the availability of Irish goods has often militated against their use.  As far as building materials are concerned, a major effort has now been made to overcome this problem by the preparation by An Foras Forbartha of the &ldquo;Irish Building Product Register&rdquo; which is a comprehensive guide to the full range of Irish-made building products.</P>
    <P>It is along these lines that the new units which have been set up in my own Department and in the Department of Industry and Energy will operate to develop greater opportunities for Irish resources.  The latter unit will be concerned with the manufacturing sector generally and the former with the building industry.  It will be the role of these units to monitor performance in their respective areas and to provide advice and information to all those concerned in achieving the stated objectives.  As far as the building industry is concerned, I am determined to ensure that in the case of publicly financed works, Irish enterprise are fully aware of the potential that is there to be exploited by them.</P>
    <P>The advancing physical development of the country, which sees new houses, <Col N="267" /> factories, offices, agricultural and other buildings proceeding at an accelerated pace, is now using up serviced land at a rate of over 6,000 acres every year.  The only guarantee of the continued supply of such land is a sustained programme of water and sewerage schemes.  The National Economic Plan fully accepts this requirement and sets forth a bold policy of investment in sanitary services over the coming five years.  I am confident that this will be seen as a landmark in the planning and financing of these services for our generation.</P>
    <P>The plan provides firstly for a total sanitary services investment of £118 million in 1983 &mdash; a very substantial increase in real terms on 1982 expenditure of £95 million approximately.  The plan then provides for increases in the volume of sanitary services investment to £128 million in 1984, £139 million in 1985, £144 million in 1986 and £150 million in 1987, all at 1983 prices.  At the end of the period of the plan, sanitary services investment will be over 40 per cent higher in real terms than in the current year.</P>
    <P>The enlarged programme of water and sewerage schemes will increase employment on the programme during the coming year, which will help to reduce unemployment at local levels and at the same time provide an essential service.</P>
    <P>The priorities for selecting sanitary services schemes for approval and financing are clearly set out in the plan and are as follows: schemes required to cater for new housing and new industry; schemes needed to make good deficiencies in existing water and sewerage services; schemes of headworks and trunk mains required for the development of private group water schemes in rural areas; and schemes needed primarily for the prevention and abatement of pollution.</P>
    <P>The benefit of the Government's commitment to the sanitary services programme will be substantial.  First, I have now approved the acceptance of 13 tenders for sanitary services schemes held in my Department.  Second, I intend to release a significant number of high priority water and sewerage schemes for which contract documents are in the Department. <Col N="268" /> Thirdly, I hope that the plan will encourage local authorities to speed up the planning of other high priority schemes so that these schemes can be undertaken during the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>The major schemes to be financed in 1983 include two further contracts in the Greater Dublin Drainage Scheme, Tramore/River Valley Sewerage Scheme, County Cork; West Clare Regional Water Supply (Extension) Scheme; North Roscommon Regional Water Supply Scheme; Rosses Regional Water Scheme, County Donegal and Edenderry, County Offaly, Dungarvan, Ballinasloe and Castlebar.  In addition to the major schemes outlined above, the plan also includes continued provision for private group water schemes and for public water schemes eligible for grant assistance under the Western Aid Package of FEOGA.  In 1983 the provision for these grants will be £12.8 million, which is included in the total sum of £118 million. These schemes are an important element in helping the maximum number of people from rural areas to reside in their native parishes.  This can only be done if rural housing and living standards are brought up to those in urban areas.</P>
    <P>The benefits of this enlargement of the country's stock of serviced land do not need emphasising to this House.  The Industrial Development Authority have repeatedly stressed the importance of adequate piped water and sewerage in attracting new industry.  The supply of serviced sites has, moreover, a major influence on the cost of building land. The national plan is determined to win for the people of this country the benefits of an increased supply of serviced land. We are launched on a programme of sustained and unprecedented investment of sanitary services.  We will thereby create more capacity for industry.  Finally, by halting the inflation of land prices we will provide sites at reasonable cost for new houses, factories, schools and hospitals.</P>
    <P>In addition to the three main areas of roads, housing and sanitary services which are set out in detail in the plan, the Government will continue to provide for other essential services, such as the fire <Col N="269" /> and emergency services, the local improvement scheme, libraries service, local authority office accommodation, waste disposal, and so on.</P>
    <P>In 1983 six million pounds will be provided for the fire and emergency services. This amount provides for a real increase over the current year's provision of £4.75 million.  The need for new and improved services is necessary to cater for the increasing population and the increasing dangers which arise from the transport and use of dangerous materials.  The six million pounds will finance continued improvements in the fire services, both stations and equipment.  At present major new fire stations are under construction at Phibsborough, Rathfarnham and Donnybrook in Dublin and at Midleton in County Cork.  Construction is likely to commence in the near future on a number of other fire stations including major projects at Blanchardstown, Athlone, Limerick, Clonmel (phase II), Killeshandra, Bray and Tinahely.</P>

      <P>In addition Dublin Corporation have purchased the O'Brien Institute at Malahide Road, Marino, and will convert it into a training centre for fire services personnel.</P>
      <P>During the past year I have initiated a comprehensive review of planning legislation in order to identify changes in the law which would make the planning system more efficient and more effective.  I feel that there is scope for improvement, and in view of the importance of job creation all avoidable delays in decision-making at local and at appeals levels and obstacles to legitimate development should be eliminated.  My aim is to ensure that environmentally sound development, which is consistent with social and economic progress, may be stimulated and promoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To assist local authorities in reviewing their own procedures, I have arranged the preparation in my Department of a substantial memorandum containing advice and general guidelines in relation to development control.  This memorandum issued to local authorities on 26 <Col N="270" /> October and I am hopeful that it will have beneficial effects.</P>
    <P>In order to help overcome the severe problems which have been created by the decline of the inner city area of our capital, I have recently presented to the Dáil the Dublin Inner City Development Authority Bill, 1982.  The object of this Bill is to provide for the establishment of a new Authority to co-ordinate and supplement the work of a variety of agencies affecting the Dublin inner city area and to provide by way of grants, loans or otherwise for inner city projects.  The proposed new Authority will replace the existing non-statutory Dublin Inner City Group.</P>
    <P>The House is already familiar with the Government's new approach to the problems of physical redevelopment and urban renewal in inner city areas, as expressed in the Urban Development Areas Bill, 1982, which passed the Second Stage during the last session.  This legislation is intended to allow intensive revitalisation to be undertaken at an early date in areas of special need and two areas have been selected for initial projects &mdash; the site at the Custom House Docks in Dublin and the area covered by the medieval walled city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Apart from the legislation currently before the House, I am having a general review of the position on urban renewal throughout the country carried out with a view to assessing the extent of the need, particularly outside the Dublin inner city area.  This review will include an examination of the existing powers available to local authorities and which could, perhaps, be used more actively in the promotion of redevelopment in inner urban areas.</P>
    <P>I have advised local authorities within their existing housing programmes to have regard to the desirability of providing houses in inner urban areas, towns and villages.  The provision of new dwellings in inner urban areas can improve their general appearance by renewing obsolete and decayed areas and by encouraging private investment in redevelopment. I also expect local authorities to avail themselves to the full of the powers available under the Derelict Sites Act, <Col N="271" /> 1961, to eliminate dereliction and in particular to encourage the redevelopment of privately owned derelict sites.  I feel there is important scope for co-operation between the private and public sectors in this area.  Many of our towns contain unused backlands, and the provision of access and services to them would facilitate their development.  The best results one often achieved by programmes of gradual redevelopment rather than by wholesale demolition and renewal.  In our circumstances I feel that much can be gained by this approach which helps to preserve the character of the areas and causes the least disruption to the population.</P>
    <P>The provision of the extra funds for necessary infrastructural services must be balanced by the restoration of balance between Exchequer receipts and current expenditure, the reduction of total Exchequer borrowing to manageable and economically justifiable levels and, to the extent that the borrowing constraint permits, the expansion of public capital expenditure to make the economy more productive and efficient.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, who will spend some £1,200 million in 1982 and who employ about 35,000 people, will also be required to play their part in achieving economies, as well as other parts of the public sector. In this connection, the Government intend to establish without delay a special investigation team to go into the local authorities to investigate their administration and finances with a view to ensuring the most efficient use of existing resources and providing full value for money to both the ratepayer and taxpayer. The very considerable expenditure now incurred by the local authorities warrants a rigorous examination of their structures and any special measures which might be necessary to ensure the greatest possible efficiency and economy in the provision of services and to eliminate waste, duplication or over-lapping.</P>
    <P>I began my contribution to this debate by emphasising the need for realism and credibility in formulating solutions to the serious problems which face the country. The Opposition have at times during the <Col N="272" /> past months attempted to assume a monopoly on credibility and in particular to query the bona fides of the so-called Gregory deal between Deputy Gregory and the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Let me say first of all that this Government offer apologies to nobody for a set of policies aimed at systematically renewing the centre of our capital city.  But the motives of those in Fine Gael who have seen fit to criticise us, and in particular of their party leader, need to be examined somewhat further.</P>
    <P>Recently the full text of an agreement with Deputy Gregory apparently proposed by Deputy FitzGerald in the dying days of his discredited administration has become available.  The contents have not so far, to my knowledge, been denied. The document ranges over an extensive list of initiatives for the Dublin inner city, about which I will inform the House in more detail in a moment.</P>
    <P>But some items in it are of special concern to my area of ministerial responsibility, and I would like this House to appreciate their import in a little more detail.  I have in mind the document's proposal for acquiring the Dublin Port and Docks Board site, its promise to boost Dublin Corporation's housing programme, and its undertakings for increasing employment in Dublin city under the environmental improvement scheme.</P>
    <P>First I refer to the Opposition Leader's proposal for securing the 27-acre Port and Docks Board site.  His administration had already determined, by a decision of 5 March 1982, to buy this site.  But where were the practical means of ever putting this pious intention into effect?  The document includes a statement of intention to promote a consortium to negotiate with the Port and Docks Board for the 27-acre site.  That was all.  How the statement of intention would or could be translated into action was left unsaid.</P>
    <P>The Government on the other hand have made specific provision covering the procedure for acquisition of the site and for settlement of the price to be paid.  In contrast to the vague proposal for the development to be carried out by a consortium of conflicting interests, the Government have also made specific provision <Col N="273" /> for a statutory Urban Development Commission to be set up and provided with the powers and resources required to do the job properly.  All this is provided for in the Urban Development Areas Bill, 1982 which has passed Second Stage in the House, despite a vote against it by Fine Gael.  So much for continuity and consistency.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the unique importance of this site and its development have been recognised long before the election or any question of a deal arose but it was left to this Government to tackle the need head-on and to make practical provision to enable a worthy scheme of redevelopment to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>The next hollow feature of the purported agreement by Deputy FitzGerald relates to his promise to achieve a target of 2,000 housing completions for Dublin Corporation by 1984 &mdash; again, a laudable ambition in itself and one on which this Government are in fact committed to deliver.  But by what means did Deputy FitzGerald propose to translate this promise into realisation?  By the addition of a mere £7 million supplement to the corporation's previously agreed housing allocation.</P>
    <P>I can state categorically that this would have yielded a mere 1,400 completions in 1982, and that the task of stepping up the programme from this base to achieve 2,000 completions by 1984 would have been physically impossible.  Deputy FitzGerald's document both grossly underfinanced the investment requirement for the target it set and misunderstood the physical constraints of accelerating a housing programme.</P>
    <P>The third promise of the document which I will detail to the House was the addition of £1.9 million into the January budget provision of £500,000 for the environmental schemes programme and on undertaking to boost employment under the programme to 300 in Dublin. Again, the contrast with the present Government's practical achievement in this area is noteworthy.</P>
    <P>We have made a special additional allocation of £2.5 million to Dublin Corporation to enable the scheme to be continued and enlarged and the number of <Col N="274" /> employed to be raised to 500.  All in all, almost £9 million has been provided in 1982 for employment on environmental works in all areas including a total of £4.266 million to Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>The FitzGerald document contained 49 pages of detailed promises for</P>
    <P>&mdash;establishing pre-school centres;</P>
    <P>&mdash;providing courses for pre-school operators and interested parents;</P>
    <P>&mdash;extending the Rutland Street project;</P>
    <P>&mdash;establishing the needs for curriculum development and special pupil-teacher ratio for inner city schools;</P>
    <P>&mdash;establishing of a back-up psychological service to support each school's remedial programmes;</P>
    <P>&mdash;inservice training programme;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a physical aid programme to assist primary schools;</P>
    <P>&mdash;additional appointment of play leaders;</P>
    <P>&mdash;scheme to improve participation in second level education;</P>
    <P>&mdash;scheme to improve participation in third level education;</P>
    <P>&mdash;scheme of free books for primary schools in disadvantaged areas;</P>
    <P>&mdash;extension of literacy schemes and other programmes for adult education.</P>
    <P>&mdash;continuation of community, youth recreational and employment programme;</P>
    <P>&mdash;inner city industrial employment.</P>
    <P>All in all, this adds up to a perfectly laudable attempt to tackle the problems of Dublin's inner city and its inhabitants. But why, having themselves put these promises on the table, have Deputy FitzGerald and his party &mdash; and their friends in the media &mdash; sought to attribute insincerity to the Government, in preparing our action plan for the inner city? So much for Garret the Good and his Band of Christian Democrats who through their continuing policy of whisper and half truth to the media about the character and personalities of members of this Government are so debasing the Irish political system.  Where is the Christianity in this slander?</P>
    <P>A basic tenet of Christianity is truth. <Col N="275" /> Indeed, the motto of Fine Gael's Christian Democratic colleagues in Italy is &ldquo;Veritas&rdquo;.  Yet since their dismissal from power, we have had from Deputy FitzGerald and his party a policy of hypocrisy on Dublin inner city matters such as this State has not seen before. Their addendum to this motion is another example of the dishonesty, double-think and half truths which, unfortunately, Fine Gael have been attempting to sell to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I allow that many of his party members will not have been privy to the agreement which Deputy FitzGerald has unsuccessfully tried to conclude and I invite them to form their own judgement as to his subsequent behaviour.  But one way or another, the people of Ireland will eventually have the opportunity through the ballot box, at the end of this Government's term of office, to pass verdict on this unprincipled posturing.  I do not doubt that the result will be one of rejection of Deputy FitzGerald.</P>
    <P>What I say now I say with deep regret rather than in any spirit or feeling of anger.  At the end of February next, between my father and myself we will have had the honour of representing County Dublin in Dáil Éireann for 40 years.  We served it as well as both of us could, and God willing will continue to serve it in the future.  In that long period of service, a campaign of vilification, rumour and innuendo has never been indulged in by any party or party leader such as is now being conducted by Deputy Garret FitzGerald and his party.</P>
    <P>We had evidence of it in this House yesterday when, once more, Deputy FitzGerald donned his whiter than white political garments and presented himself as the only honest and pure politician in Ireland.  What a load of rubbish.  Deputy FitzGerald's portrayal of himself and his party as the only embodiment of morality quite frankly is nauseating.  Fine Gael's apparent belief that they are in some way untouchable and set apart from ordinary mortals not only defies the truth but is silly, and silly in that particularly schoolboyish fashion in which only members of his party indulge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> The sinister aspect of the current campaign is that Fine Gael, in conspiracy with a number of highly politicised journalists, believe that by spreading rumours, indulging in innuendo and following a nod and wink policy in relation to members of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Cabinet, will slowly but surely sow the seeds of dissension, division and doubt, hopefully leading to the eventual disintegration of this great national movement, Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Because Deputy FitzGerald has shown himself to be unrelenting in this campaign, nothing that I say now will change his mind.  I want to say this to him.  When he is hawking his conscience around the country and appealing to young people to take an active interest in politics, he should stop and think of the damage he is doing to people's faith in our democratic institutions.  Obviously he does not care what damage is done as long as his cleverly concealed lust for personal power is satisfied.  Garret FitzGerald stop now.  There are hundreds of thousands of people in this country of ours who are continually asking: &ldquo;In God's name what are our politicians doing?&rdquo;&mdash; a sentiment, I might add, that does not discriminate between party labels.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy FitzGerald came into this House and once again attacked the Taoiseach and the Cabinet.  He advised the Taoiseach to distance himself from those around him.  Those men around him are the members of the Cabinet. Contrast them with those who were around Deputy FitzGerald when he was Taoiseach.  They had no constitutional role and were there as advisers of one type or another.</P>
    <P>In case the statement I made with regard to the media may be misunderstood, I should like to refer to the debate before us today, the debate on the economic plan, <i>The Way Forward.</i>  In last Sunday's <i>Sunday Tribune</i> there was a heading <i>&ldquo;The Way Forward</i> to an Economic Wonderland: Moore MacDowell analyses the National Economic Plan.&rdquo; The final words were &ldquo;... retreated to an economic wonderland&rdquo;.  I give this gentleman as an example of the people who were around Deputy FitzGerald <Col N="277" /> when he was in Government and leader of the Fine Gael Party who portray themselves as the whiter than white souls.</P>
    <P>How can you expect responsible comment when the same Mr. MacDowell, at the request of my predecessor, Deputy Peter Barry, and approved by the then Minister for the Public Service, Deputy Kavanagh, was engaged as a consultant as and from 5 October 1981 to advise the Minister, my predecessor, on such financial and economic matters as might be considered by him as affecting the Minister's function, at a fee of £60 per day?</P>
    <P>These are the same people who purport in the media to give unbiassed interpretations of the contents of an economic plan.  I am not saying there was anything incorrect in the employment of that adviser.  If the Minister felt he needed him, so be it.  I am saying that, having appointed people around him, the least Deputy FitzGerald should do is not to proceed with this hypocrisy we are seeing week in and week out, day in and day out, in the media and from his pals in the media, and from himself in this House. Democracy deserves better.</P>
    <P>There is a mountain of work to be got through by this Government and this House.  Deputy FitzGerald and his party should devote their energies to something more positive and constructive instead of constantly feeding the voracious appetites of gossip columnists who care not a whit whether the muck they peddle contains a germ of truth.  In conclusion, I want to remind the House of the positive and responsible set of measures the Government have developed in the present plan for our economic progress. I commend the plan and the motion before it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the Minister who has just spoken I cannot claim such a long pedigree of service in this House, being one of the breed of politicians who came into politics without any relative preceding me.  In dealing with the allegations made by the Minister about members of the media I find it difficult to understand how he can explain away the comments of all economic commentators since this plan was published which run along precisely <Col N="278" /> the same terms, although perhaps expressed in a different manner, as those of the journalist to whom he has just referred.</P>
      <P>For example, can he explain why Mr. Joseph O'Malley should take such an extremely strong line in condemning this document as totally unrealistic?  Can he explain why Mr. Colm McCarthy should condemn the document as being full of economic loopholes which will sink the plan?  Can he explain why <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial writer of 23 October condemned the plan unequivocally as having targets which are outside the bounds of reality?</P>
      <P>I can understand the Minister's anger and annoyance about the fact that the plan was criticised.  However, to go down the road of attacks on commentators who are earning their living by examining documents on the economy and commenting on them is to go down the short road to disaster for any serious politician or Government, and I would commend more prudence to him in that area.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that he feels that the Fine Gael Party are &mdash; I think he used the word &mdash;&ldquo;schoolboyish&rdquo;.  I do not want to be accused of being schoolboyish and a great many of us in the party would consider that that does not apply to us. Unfortunately, the Minister's perception of the Fine Gael Party's actions over the last considerable time is at variance with that of the general population.  The Party now find themselves, according to the result of the most recent opinion poll, at level pegging with Fianna Fáil for the first time in either party's history and that is a fairly eloquent comment on what the general public think of that kind of accusation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One stands to speak on this economic plan against an extremely sombre background which becomes more distressing by the day.  It is very difficult to speak about a way forward for this part of the country when from day to day the northern part sinks further and further into total chaos with tragic news of deaths, kidnappings, retaliatory slayings and wholesale carnage reaching us every day.  This country will never have a real way forward while that problem remains <Col N="279" /> unsolved.  The sombre news from Lebanon today is another reminder of upheavals and dangers right across the world which obviously cannot and will not leave this country unaffected.  The discussion takes place against the background of the anxiety of the parents of young people and of young people themselves about their future.  It takes place against the background of a breakdown of security in so many parts of the country and particularly this city where people have lost confidence in the ability of society to protect them against lawless and violent elements.  Most serious of all for any of us in this House, it takes place against a scenario of politically uncharted waters where the expression &ldquo;a week is a long time in politics&rdquo; has taken on peculiar significance for Irish people.</P>
    <P>The dangers inherent in the political time we live in cannot be overestimated and they make discussion of any Government's plan necessarily slightly difficult if not slightly unreal.  Ireland at the moment is trying very painfully to adjust to a new situation in the eighties.  The eighties may prove a difficult decade for most western countries but particularly difficult here given Irish peculiarities today.  We should be aware that we are all on trial in this House, that the kind of debate and words which have gone on in this House for a long time are no longer adequate or relevant to deal with the problems of the country.  I may return to that idea later.</P>
    <P>Any national plan from any party which ignores the necessity for reform of the general procedures in this House in their fundamental elements cannot be described as a serious plan.  The major consideration in people's minds when they hear about parties coming forward with plans, particularly as they hear about a Fianna Fáil plan, is why it has taken so long to arrive at a plan which states that very serious problems are facing the country and very extraordinary measures must be taken if we are to pull out of this downward spiral, a plan which tells us that hard times are ahead and that we have four years or so of great difficulty before us.  People are asking with amazement how it has taken Fianna Fáil so long <Col N="280" /> to come out with the truth.  It would appear that Fianna Fáil were living in some kind of wonderland, but the trouble is that the people who were propounding this wonderland to the population occupied their seats in Dáil Éireann and in the Cabinet offices in Government while they proceeded to go through these twists and turns and arrive eventually at the inescapable conclusion that they would have to agree with Fine Gael about the serious position of the country.</P>
    <P>This question raises further questions about how we arrived at this position in the first place.  The Irish economy faces a range of economic problems which are unprecedented in their size and seriousness. Our inflation rate is twice that of our major trading partners, one person in eight of our labour force is unemployed and output in the economy is almost at a standstill.  We bear a growing and unsustainable burden of debt to our international creditors.  There are a variety of causes for these problems and many of them have their roots in the recession which has been gripping the world economy for the last two years, but others have arisen because of decisions and actions taken within our country, and these problems must and can be tackled by ourselves and ourselves alone.  We can work harder and more efficiently We can sell our output more competitively.  We can exploit our resources and apply our inherent strengths to better effect.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael consider that the single most important contribution in this regard in terms of recovery can and must be made by Government.  Five criteria must be applied when talking about Government leading the country to an economic recovery.  Government must lead by example, by planning, by efficiency, by developing trust, by authoritative and sensible explanation and negotiation and by realism.  If any Government now held firmly to these criteria in governing the country, we could be on our way out of the present serious situation.  We must give priority in our recovery programme to the maintenance of our economic independence. We cannot allow it to be further <Col N="281" /> eroded by the shortsighted and ill-considered incurring of foreign debts.  We must commit ourselves to an outward looking, export-orientated approach and not allow present circumstances to tempt us back into protectionism.</P>
    <P>These are the principles which must inform any Government hoping to tackle the present economic crisis.  These are the principles which form the basis of Fine Gael's economic policy document In discussing the plan before us from Fianna Fáil, <i>The Way Forward,</i> it is important to ask ourselves what its antecedents are.  We must remind ourselves of the recent history of Fianna Fáil plans which, like this one, have set some daft targets.  That is the only way to describe them.  Who was it that talked as recently as 1978 about full employment by 1983? It was Dr. Martin O'Donoghue who quite recently, perhaps the very day on which he departed from the Cabinet, expressed himself as proud of having played a part in framing this latest economic document.</P>
    <P>In June 1978, a plan came before us from Fianna Fáil entitled <i>Development for Full Employment.</i>  According to this document, unemployment was to fall by 25,000 per annum to 1980, output to rise by 7 per cent per annum, inflation to fall to 5 per cent by 1980, Government borrowing to fall rapidly, the current budget deficit to be virtually eliminated by 1980. This was the eagerly awaited Fianna Fáil economic document of 1978.  The country did not quite so eagerly await the present document, despite the marvellous amount of heralding preceding it.  Once bitten, twice shy.  The document of 1978 followed on a manifesto of 1977 which had laid the ground and basic framework for disaster.  It told people that they did not have to pay domestic rates, or car tax, and that it was easy to play a never-never game with money from the United States, West Germany, or the World Bank.  It said that the money was somewhere and that Governments could pluck it from abroad if they were afraid to pluck it from the taxpayers, which the Government have finally decided to be a limited golden egg.  They got many into a frame of mind of never-ending boom and <Col N="282" /> bloom.  When speaking about that type of background, it is very difficult to avoid clichés, despite the fact that they are true, such as that Ireland has been living beyond its means, that the world does not owe us a living, and the challenge of our young population.  Our young people must be amazed to hear themselves referred to in every second breath of politicians, while their unemployment rate still rises and their hopes still go down.  It is another example of words expended over so many years, particularly in this forum, which have turned out to mean very little.</P>
    <P>It is relevant here to mention something referred to by the Minister.  He was very hurt indeed that his party, or the Cabinet, should be criticised.  That is a phenomenon in Fianna Fáil which I would describe as a Messiah complex.  In criticising people for daring to cast doubts on the capacity, veracity or general sanctity of the Cabinet, the Minister was very much fulfilling Fianna Fáil's Messiah-like complex, which complex is very relevant to this discussion, as it has had an extraordinary effect on the country's progress, or lack thereof.  This is a very deep feeling among Fianna Fáil people that they, and only they, are the rightful rulers.  It finds its expression in the present document which we are told is absolutely the only way forward.  Unfortunately such thinking leads, and has led in the past, to a situation where everything else is unimportant if it stands in the way of Fianna Fáil actually being in Government.  That is why there is at the moment such distress in the ranks of Fianna Fáil.  It is now seen that their dominance of Irish politics is coming to an end, which must be extremely painful for them.  That Messiah complex finds expression, for example, in the justification I heard recently for double voting in an election &mdash; that it did not matter what the means were, that anyone in government who was not Fianna Fáil was somehow an aberration, a temporary problem to do with a quirk of PR, that the system must be used to get the rightful Government in.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the necessity of this economic plan &mdash; despite its inadequacies, there are some true statements <Col N="283" /> in it &mdash; is that between January 1980 and June 1981 the Government embarked on a programme of extraordinarily profligate spending of the taxpayer's money to ensure that there was no slip-up at the general election of June 1981.  That effort to buy that election resulted in not a little of the chaos which we face now and which this plan is supposed to set out to rectify. The country now has before it the Fine Gael policy document, the Fianna Fáil document, <i>The Way Forward,</i> and a plan from the Workers' Party.  The Government could be expected to command a great deal more attention than the parties in opposition.  That is why many more column inches were expended by all the commentators on this plan than on the Fine Gael plan.  Unfortunately for the Minister, the column inches were, alas, not favourable, but that is the risk you take if you build up something, as this plan was built up over the last six months.</P>
    <P>We must face the question of whether Oppositions should plan and Governments should act.  When I heard about six months ago that we were to have a plan which would indicate to us what were the Government's intentions, it occurred to me immediately that the Government, instead of planning to do something, should be doing something and that an Opposition's role is to plan and to present the people with details of what the party would do should they be elected to office. However, for six months the answers to questions were couched in such terms as, &ldquo;that will be part of the Government's plan&rdquo;.  In other words, we had to have the six months planning involved in bringing forward a plan.  Now we have a plan and we are debating what it may or may not achieve.  Irrespective of which party are in Government such a delay is very long.  Other than pulling themselves apart in the past number of months I do not understand why Fianna Fáil have delayed so long in bringing forward this plan when all those public servants whom the Government intend getting rid of in their thousands are there to run the country as opposed to sitting down and writing more documents.</P>
    <P>The first question to ask ourselves is <Col N="284" /> whether the Government can be trusted to bring forward a document that contains only the truth.  The next question is whether their record is one that enables us to have confidence either in their willingness or in their ability to put the country before the party.  Thirdly, we must ask whether this is a plan or whether it is simply an economic aspiration.  This is a question that has caused commentators many problems.  Allied to that is the more serious question that, given the make-up of Dáil Éireann and with a minority Government who have been weakened seriously by catastrophic internal divisions and who have failed manifestly to win public confidence, is it realistic to imagine that if the document had been believable, the Government could have forecast any length of time for its implementation?</P>
    <P>The details of the plan have been commented on considerably but the basic problem seems to be that the assumptions inherent in it and the targets it sets out are so out of line with reality and past experience as to render it at best an imaginative leap in the dark or at worst a cynical public relations exercise.  It is a serious matter to describe a Government plan in those terms but unfortunately that is how we must speak about it.  One commentator who, luckily for the Minister for the Environment, did not print in his newspaper a remark he made to me said that the plan reminded him of the Dublin city bus timetable, a document which he tries to use.  He said that the timetable was fine if we could have a situation in which traffic flowed in a pattern that is not the norm, if at the same time there was no rain, if there was no maintenance or other strike and if drivers and conductors did what they were supposed to be doing.  However, since those conditions never coincided the bus timetable remained a nicely produced document but with the wish unfulfilled.  That, the commentator added, appears to be the case with this plan.</P>
    <P>Just before the plan was published I heard that the Government had three plans, that there had been a good deal more work going on than we were aware of.  Apparently, a decision had to be <Col N="285" /> taken as to which plan was to be produced. One plan was, I understand, the civil service option which was a severe, rather dry document containing realistic targets and judgements.  Another was the Government plan, an attractive option without too much realism while the third was an in-between document.  Perhaps even those people who have since left the Cabinet were in favour of the in-between document.  We may never know that but what appeared eventually was the attractive, the soft option, entitled, <i>The Way Forward.</i>  That is a simple statement of reality.  There are several brave statements contained in the document but unfortunately these are not backed up by reality.</P>
    <P>One must consider some of the assumptions made and which are basic to the kind of results the Government are setting out to achieve.  The plan assumes that export margins will increase between 1983 and 1987 by 4 per cent.  The problem is that our unit wage costs were assumed to increase by 7½ per cent on average each year while all the economic forecasts, both domestic and international, put the figure at 4 per cent.  In other words, our trading partners' costs will rise by about 4 per cent at most but possibly by only 2 per cent on average in the four years in question.  This fundamental basic assumption requires international movements totally outside our control but which are not deemed to be possible.  If by way of some fantastic achievement, we succeeded in holding our unit wage costs to 3½ per cent for those years it still would not help to achieve the targets of this plan.  If other countries' unit wage costs are to be similar to or less than ours, we will not get the advantage which the plan assumes we will get.  We will not get this wonderful accrual of benefits envisaged in the plan because we are supposed to be much more economical in our unit wage costs than they are.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of basic assumption made in the plan on which it has to stand or fall.  Therefore it will be suggested that the commentators who have forecast that it must fall had no choice but to come to that conclusion.  Another assumption <Col N="286" /> in the plan is in regard to agricultural prices.  The document states that one of the basic ways in which agricultural production can be stimulated and prosperity brought back to the agricultural sector is through our agricultural prices rising side by side with EEC inflation.  That flies in the face of all EEC declarations on farm prices.  The EEC is committed irrevocably to a farm price increase lower than inflation, considerably lower than EEC average inflation.  This anomaly renders the whole section on agricultural prosperity development equally suspect.</P>
    <P>An assumption has been made about consumer spending.  Apparently consumer spending will increase by 2 per cent per annum which is to be an essential way to boost our economy, people being able to buy more from our producers. But how can consumer spending increase by 2 per cent per annum because in another part of the document there is the definite statement that incomes will be falling?  Will people continue to spend more when they will have less?  I do not understand how that can happen and I hope somebody can explain it to me.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock described this document as a plan for the lower paid, for the workers.  I would describe it in a different way.  The plan states that total exports from Ireland will rise by 12.25 per cent per annum, an amazing target in itself because it implies that manufacturing exports will rise by approximately 17 per cent.  Any overall judgment on total exports implies a higher export ratio in the manufacturing sector.  An essential component in the plan is that wages will rise hardly at all.  I do not understand how this or any Government can convince workers to accept lower pay in the middle of a massive export boom.  It seems to be an illogical joining of two ideas, because if manufacturing exports embark on this magnificent programme of increasing by 17 per cent a year I cannot foresee Irish workers accepting tiny increases and being told that they cannot join in the boom because it has nothing to do with the national plan for prosperity: &ldquo;It does not affect you; you must continue to accept low pay&rdquo;.  I am afraid that projected export boom has a <Col N="287" /> large element of wishful thinking about it.  One commentator described it like this: &ldquo;The Government have decided to assume away the problem by whistling up an export boom&rdquo;.  I am sure Deputy Burke, the Minister, would castigate Mr. O'Malley of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> in the same way as he attacked <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> commentator.  Last Sunday, Mr. O'Malley began his comments with three ifs:</P>
    <P>If things happen that never happened before, like huge increases in output in manufacturing employment, if people behave as they never have behaved before by accepting major cuts in living standards over a five year period, if Mr. Haughey survives to act as he has never acted before, then the National Plan is a realistic document.</P>
    <P>I wonder what combination of circumstances are supposed to have arisen in the last few months to make those three ifs some kind of a reality.  I believe that at least the plan faces the reality that the people will be required to make a sacrifice together to get the country on the road to recovery, but we must consider very carefully how the Irish people will be brought to make a great united sacrifice, a great unselfish effort, of the kind that will be needed in the next few years. The only way that will come about is through leadership and Government of exceptional standards.  It will need the kind of criteria I cited earlier.  It will need example from the top.  There are various kinds of examples.</P>
    <P>We will have to get rid of national white elephants which, as Deputy John Bruton said yesterday, involve the State in a massive financial input for industry and State-owned organisations sited in various places for purely political reasons.  We will have to consider realistically what to do with our steel mills, airports, disease eradication programmes, all the areas which have represented enormous white elephants that have soaked up taxpayers' money and have caused an enormous credibility gap.</P>
    <P>I will give an example which on the face of it appears to be extremely small, <Col N="288" /> but it is valid.  I refer to our system of State cars.  Despite its relative importance it has assumed a disproportionate importance in people's minds.  I believe the public see the State car system as something which is unjustifiable in a time of economic problems.  I should like to discuss this for a moment because, if we are to ask the people to make sacrifices, we ourselves in politics must show that we too can make sacrifices and will do so. The emergence of this syndrome as a problem in the public eyes warrants a response.  It is a symptom of the kind of respect, or lack of respect, which so many people have for politicians.  I should like to pose the simple question: is there any need for Ministers and Ministers of State to drive around in their very large black Mercedes cars chauffeured by highly-qualified individuals whose pay I understand in many cases exceeds that of the people they are driving?  I do not believe for a moment that the hedgerows of Ireland are full of heavily-armed desperados waiting to jump out to assassinate every Minister and junior Minister.  Having said that, I accept that the provision of a driver is necessary for the enormous round of duties demanded all over the country from Ministers and Ministers of State.  Certainly the provision of a driver is necessary.  I accept also that the holders of some Government posts and some individuals are particularly vulnerable or sensitive and need special protection in terms of accompanying cars and armed drivers in that kind of area.</P>
    <P>However, an immediate decision should be taken to dispense with the black Mercedes fleet which should be replaced by a fleet of modest energy-consuming cars which would be altogether more in keeping with the style of this country.  In every possible case ordinary drivers should be employed to drive those public servants except where it has been decided by the Government, after advice from the security forces, that special protection is necessary.  Of course it goes without saying &mdash; and I am sure it is already the case &mdash; that the use of these small, modest cars must be confined to the office holder on official political business only.  This may seem a small item <Col N="289" /> but a rationalisation of that system, which so annoys the public, would constitute one aspect of example from Government so necessary for beginning to work together on the road to recovery.  Revision of that system should form a very small part only of the overall reform of procedures and privileges of both Houses, procedures crying out for modernisation and reform.  The whole system cries out for renewal and a reaching out to the population, particularly young people.  The time for talking about reform is over; the time for beginning that reform has come.</P>
    <P>There was one enormous problem touched on by Deputy Bruton yesterday and to which I should like to refer once more.  The Government's economic plan states that the opening deficit for next year will have to be 5.5 per cent of GNP, which is £750 million.  This is what the plan aims to do as part of its target to cut the deficit altogether.  But the plan also states that next year we will have a 5 per cent increase in public sector pay, that the existing tax bands and levels will be maintained, that food subsidies will be increased by about 4 per cent and that social welfare benefits will increase by about 8 per cent.  Having done one's sums on those targets for next year in terms of expenditure, one finds that they add up to an opening deficit for the budget of 1983, a few months away only, of £1,250 million.  But the plan says that the 1983 opening deficit will be £750 million.  That means that between now and the introduction of the 1983 budget the deficit will have to be brought down by £500 million. That money must be found either by way of tax increases or cuts in expenditure. That is perhaps the biggest credibility gap in this plan because we are not told how that £500 million is to be found.  Taxpayers need to know how that £500 million will be found before they can be expected to subscribe to a document setting out those targets.  The poor of this country should be told what further cuts there are going to be in Government expenditure in different Departments so that they can ascertain whether they can subscribe to this plan.</P>
    <P>These are enormous questions raised <Col N="290" /> by the blithe declarations in the plan which are not backed up by solid criteria. Perhaps in the civil service plan, one of those rejected by the Government, those cuts were detailed.  Perhaps that is why plan one did not get printed or come before the people.</P>
    <P>I might refer to the closing part of the Minister's speech when apparently, more in hurt than in anger, he brought up the question of Deputy FitzGerald's discussions with Deputy Gregory about the inner city development aid.  Throughout the Minister's perambulations in that respect it was not quite clear to me what he was endeavouring to prove.  Every second sentence was saying: of course Fianna Fáil approve that these plans must be brought forward for the inner city. Then he would revert once more and condemn Fine Gael for having had discussions with Deputy Gregory.  Of course Deputy FitzGerald met Deputy Gregory in as equal a blaze of publicity as did Deputy Haughey.  Every evening television gave us these accounts of people meeting with different people and it was general knowledge that these discussions were taking place.  I am very glad to say that Deputy FitzGerald responded to the request of Deputy Gregory for help for certain parts of the inner city.  That is an absolutely correct thing to have done.  I should have liked to have asked the Minister was he seriously suggesting that Fine Gael should have been the only party not to meet Deputy Gregory, because that appeared to me to be what the Minister for the Environment was saying.  In the heel of the hunt, as has been shown to be the case, Deputy FitzGerald went as far as he felt it was possible and necessary to go and not one step further.  Deputy Gregory on the floor of this House on 9 March last made that absolutely clear.</P>
    <P>I can recall the Minister for the Environment referring also to the fact that perhaps members of Fine Gael did not know about those discussions.  I can recall, still with some amazement, the expression on the faces of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench, particularly on the faces of the two recently departed members of the Cabinet, as Deputy Gregory read out the price he had extracted from Deputy <Col N="291" /> Haughey for his vote.  I can also recall the warm applause for Deputy FitzGerald from his own side of the House when Deputy Gregory announced that Deputy FitzGerald was not prepared to go that far.  I do not know why the Minister for the Environment felt it necessary or important to bring up something that was well known, documented and was no secret, as if it was some type of triumph. Perhaps it is another example of the difficulties Fianna Fáil are facing as the gap between them and Fine Gael closes.</P>
    <P>The Minister's outburst can only be described as a red herring in an effort to distract attention from the universal, rather condemnatory attitude of all commentators to the Government's plan.  I should like to quote from an editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 22 October which discussed the plan.  I do not believe Deputy Burke will accuse <i>The Irish Times</i> of being anti-Fianna Fáil.  If he accuses <i>The Irish Times</i> as well as the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> and the <i>Sunday Independent</i> he is saying there is very little left to Fianna Fáil except their own newspaper.  The editorial I am referring to sums up the problems which arise in the plan and the disappointment which is justifiably felt by all sections.  It states:</P>
    <P>The plan has little chance of meeting the ambitious objective it sets itself.  It will not work.  It will not work because it attempts to tackle too many of the country's problems too quickly.  It will not work because the preconditions on which it is based are faulty.  Most of all, it will not work because it assumes away the problem by postulating a rate of economic growth and an export performance which are outside the bounds of reality.</P>
    <P> sad that the Government who have taken six months to produce this document should have fallen at this fence yet again.  It is sad that a public service which we are told was very much involved with the plan should have had to be associated with it.  It is sad for the country that the apparent conversion of Fianna Fáil to the kind of reality which we hoped they were learning from Fine Gael is not being followed. <Col N="292" /> Fianna Fáil hope that cosmetics will get over harsh realities and sugar the pill quite easily.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to the contribution of Deputy Hussey who indicated that the Minister for the Environment in some way was not prepared to listen to critical comment or to accept comment from commentators on the plan as published. Members who were listening to the Taoiseach at the press conference when he launched <i>The Way Forward</i> will recall that he invited constructive criticism of the plan.  The Taoiseach said that if the basics of the plan were preserved in any new suggestion coming as a result of open debate on the plan they would be incorporated in it.  Deputy Burke was talking about something quite different.  He was referring to an assumption of moral precedents on the part of the Fine Gael Party, about the assertion that probity and integrity resided only in the Fine Gael Party and about something which has saddened many people who have given themselves to public life.  In the general election campaign earlier this year very strict principles were laid down according to which the country would have to be ruled if we were to maintain our economic independence.  We were told: <Col N="293" />&ldquo;These are our principles even if it means imposing penal VAT on the necessities of life for the weaker sections of the community.&rdquo;  No independent person could withhold a certain amount of admiration for the Leader of Fine Gael in his campaign on those principles which, it was stated, would not be changed.  In fact, when the general election was over we saw that it was the old dictum: &ldquo;Those are my principles and if you don't like them I will change them.&rdquo;</P>

In the last decade the quality of life in politics has deteriorated and no less a person than whom no Member has more experience, Deputy Oliver J.

      <P>It is not the usual practice, as it is a tabular statement, but if the Deputy wishes I will quickly give her the figures.  In relation to tobacco products there was £131.2 million from excise duty and £29 million from VAT, a total of 160.2 million.  From alcoholic drinks, beer, spirits, wines, cider and perry £200.1 million was received from excise duty and £84 million from VAT, a total of £284.1 million.  From motor cars the excise duty was £80 million and the VAT £47 million, a total of £127 million. Roughly speaking, on the figures I have given, which are up to 31 August in respect of tobacco products and alcoholic drinks and to 31 July in respect of motor cars, in regard to alcoholic drinks, where the reduction is mainly accounted for because of a fall-off in beer consumption, the revenue was about £6 million excise duty and £4 million VAT and on motor cars about £10 million excise duty and £10 million VAT, on budgetary expectations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued on publication of the end-September returns, I indicated that the current budget deficit for 1982, which had been estimated at £679 million at budget time, would be above £900 million.  Because of continuing uncertainties about the pattern of tax receipts for the remainder of the year, I am not in a position at this stage to give a more precise estimate of the likely outturn.</P>
      <P>The excess on the budget deficit is attributable to a shortfall in revenue. Current expenditure appears likely to be some £30 million below the budget estimate of £5,949 million, even taking account of an excess of about £40 million on Central Fund services.  The fact that the figure is being kept within the budget estimate is attributable to strict Government control of spending and in particular to the measures announced on 30 July.</P>
      <P>Changes since 1 July in the estimate of the current budget have been the result of updating of information on the main budget aggregates.  Forecasts of tax receipts especially have been subject to revision in the light of changed expectations here, as in other countries, of the rate of recovery of world economic activity and its repercussions on Ireland.</P>

      <P>I said in the September statement, and I said I cannot be more precise than that, that it would be about £900 million, mainly as a result of revenue shortfall.  The expenditures are below target notwithstanding the fact that spokesmen from the Opposition parties have made comments, carried extensively in the media, that Government expenditure was out of control.  Government expenditure at this stage of the year, for the first time in 12 years, is on target and in fact Estimates for the end of the year will be about £30 million below what was estimated in March. Government expenditure is not out of control.  In fact it is in control for the first time in 12 years.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister explain why so many of the taxation revenue yields have been seriously underestimated, whether it be Post Office receipts or VAT?  Would he agree that the original figures given by him in relation to VAT from the point of entry of £145 million will be from £24 million to £26 million less than projected last March?  Surely, in terms of strategy, the <Col N="300" /> revenue side of the budget was completely wrong?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>One could accept the last statement that the Deputy has made, but in relation to it being wrong, the bulk of the figures used on the revenue side were those contained in the January budget produced by the Deputy's party and the Fine Gael Party while in Government. In relation to the first part of the Deputy's question, generally speaking, as I said in the reply, it is the changed expectations in revenue because of the continuing recession and the world economic outlook generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot get away from the fact that most of the figures that were used on the revenue side in my budget of March were those contained in the January budget.  Taking the income tax case, for which I have the figures in front of me, we had £1,581 million for income tax in the January budget; £1,590 million in the March budget and the expected outturn now will be £1,500 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not concede on that very point that in terms of the income tax concessions granted in the March budget there was no corresponding decrease included on the revenue side and that it was quite erroneous to maintain that in the March budget the revenue yield given as £1,591 million would be just £10 million in excess when in fact we all knew that arising out of the March budget and what Fianna Fáil said they would do in the course of the February election campaign, automatically tax revenue yields would be down by £50 million or £60 million?

The Minister has said that the cuts which have got it down to this he announced as £120 million.  That means that if there had been no cuts the shortfall would have been £360 million.

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am.  I want to be clear on the fact that the taxation figures are correct before I put my questions and I will put them again.  If the Minister is suggesting that after the measures he has taken the deficit will be £920 million which is £240 million more than the budget deficit, then the deficit that would have occurred had the Minister not taken action would have been £360 million.  I understand also that the Minister has said that there is a shortfall in revenue of £200 million.  Does that mean there is an overrun of expenditure of £160 million?  Or would the Minister like to correct my calculations or explain what the overrun in expenditure will be on that basis?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is getting at.  Obviously he was not here for the reply and I shall give him the details again in relation to the question asked.  I said that the excess on the figure for the budget deficit as I announced in September would be about £900 million and I could not be any more precise than that at this stage and that the excess on the budget deficit is attributable to a shortfall in revenue and in fact current expenditure appeared likely to be some £30 million below the budget estimate of £5,949 million.  That is even taking account of an excess of £40 million on Central Fund Services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget deficit was £680 million as presented to the House by the Minister.  It now looks like being over £900 million after £120 million in expenditure cuts by the Minister.  That has come across.  That being so, the shortfall that has occurred and which has been partially bridged by the Minister's action is of the order of £360 million.  He then tells us that follows a £30 million cut in expenditure by comparison with the budget.  Is he then telling us that there is a revenue shortfall of £390 million?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the supplementary question I am asking and I think the Minister ought to answer it because it arises directly from the question.  I shall put the question again in case the Minister has not got the figures.  He does not disagree with the budget deficit of £680 million; he does not disagree that the outturn now will be over £900 million; he does not disagree that this follows expenditure cuts of £100 million.  Therefore, had those cuts not taken place the outturn would have been over £1,000 million.  There is therefore a difference between the budget and the outturn, before the expenditure cuts took place, of the order of £320 million.  He says that is despite a cut in expenditure of £30 million.  Are we therefore not talking of a shortfall in revenue of between £350 million and £400 million &mdash; yes or no.</P>

I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of making interest-free loans available to those farmers.  Their herds were lost as a result of the collapse of the firm and their incomes for that year were wiped out. The Government should arrange interest-free loans to them to allow them to restock their lands and to prevent them from having to sell their homes and farms, leaving many of them with no <Col N="313" /> future but the dole queue.  Will the Minister make a submission to the Government to provide interest-free loans for those families?</P>

I know the farmers in this instance because I represented the constituency which the Deputy represents now.  However, I want to emphasise that there is no way any responsible Minister could bring in a scheme that would automatically discharge debts incurred by people in commerical arrangements.  Because a firm has gone into liquidation, it does not give rise to the situation where the State just steps in and pays the debts of that firm.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 17 and 18 together.  I am aware of the concern about the increase in imports of flour which are now running at a rate of about 14 per cent of total requirements.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a similar problem arose on two previous occasions and that one of his predecessors, Mr. Mark Clinton, brought the flour milling industry, the bakery industry and retailers together and arrived at an agreement that they would voluntarily not go ahead with imports of flour for a number of strategic reasons, with which the Minister will be familiar.

      <P>I am anxious <Col N="324" /> to proceed as soon as possible with the introduction of new land legislation. However, since some of the main policy changes envisaged for inclusion in the legislation are based on use of the rateable valuation system, it is necessary to await the determination of the courts regarding that system before proceeding further.

He should read the files a little more diligently and he should also read the two reports on which the heads of the Bill currently in preparation are being fashioned.  Is it not the case that most of the matters to be dealt with in the Bill he talks about preparing and covered in the two reports on which <Col N="325" /> it is based, are not totally unaffected by the use, or abuse, or non-use of the PLV system?

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is well aware, on resales of land the Land Commission have been losing 60 and 70 per cent and the taxpayers have been subsidising these losses.  The funding of new legislation is all important.  While I have been in charge of the Land Commission we have had numerous meetings between the senior Minister, Deputy Lenihan, my colleague Deputy Cowan, officials of my Department and interested parties concerning land policy and the future of the Land Commission.  I am putting on the record of this House that while the Deputy was in the Department he and his colleagues had one meeting.

This is not an ordinary industrial dispute. It has within it major inconvenience and possibly danger to people's lives.  Will the Minister get involved directly and take the steps necessary to ensure that gas supplies will not be interrupted, as they have not been interrupted during the 130 years of this company's history?

      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if, on account of the deadline issued by fishermen on the west coast in regard to their intention to cull <Col N="328" /> seals on the Inishkea Islands in the absence of a ministerial decision, he will now make such a decision and issue instructions as to whether he considers it necessary to have a cull carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have decided, on the basis of current scientific evidence and having regard to my responsibilities under the Wildlife Act for the conservation of seal species, that a cull of the grey seal population on the Inishkea Islands off the County Mayo coast would not be warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down this question because of the very emotional issue which has arisen between environmentalists and fishermen on the west coast.  I have a few supplementaries which I should like to ask the Minister in order to clarify the position.  Does the evidence in his Department show conclusively that seal numbers have increased or decreased on the islands in question?  Secondly, does the evidence suggest that salmon stocks in the area are being depleted, as is the claim of some fishermen?  I have seen some half-eaten fish coming out of nets. Thirdly, has any organisation or individual applied to the Minister or his Department for a licence to hunt, kill or cull seals in the district?  If no cull is deemed necessary, can the Minister ensure through his officers that no illegal culling will take place and that we will not have a repetition of last year's massacre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In August last, following continued complaints from fishermen in the western area about damage being done by seals to salmon catches, on my instructions my Department established through a scientific examination and through a survey of the seal population in the area the extent of the seal population. A census of the breeding population of the seals was carried out.  An analysis of the findings indicates that there was a reduction of 50 per cent in pup production over the past two years, that is, an analysis of the survey carried out by officials of my Department indicated <Col N="329" /> a reduction of 50 per cent in the seal population in two years.</P>
      <P>It is considered likely that a further reduction in the production rate will occur in the years ahead because of the unauthorised killings which took place there in 1979 and 1981 and the natural death of seals caught in nets and also disturbance factors which interfere with the breeding of seals.  Therefore, not only is there a decline already in the stocks of seals there, but there are also indications of a further decline over the next 100 years.  We will continue to monitor that situation and to look at it for the next year or so.</P>
      <P>In relation to the other parts of the Deputy's question, there has always been damage to salmon catches by seals.  There is evidence of that and evidence also that a series of other issues damage salmon stocks.  The seals on their own certainly would not damage the salmon stocks irreparably.  A variety of factors which I have spoken about on numerous occasions are damaging salmon stocks.</P>
      <P>In relation to the final part of the question, every effort will be made by my Department and every co-operation has been requested from the Garda.  We will work in close co-operation with the Garda and my staff to ensure that, in so far as it is possible, no unauthorised killing of seals will take place in that area this year.</P>

      <P>An applicant under the EEC Suckler Cow Premium Scheme must be a full-time farmer, i.e., he must earn not less than 50 per cent of his income from farming and must spend more than 50 per cent of his working time on farming activities. The requirement to restrict benefits to full-time farmers is enshrined in the Council Regulation which introduced the scheme in June 1980 and applies to all member states.</P>
      <P>This EEC requirement does not give rise to anomalies or unusual delays, although it is more difficult to implement than the off-farm income clause under the Cattle and Beef Cow Schemes in the Disadvantaged Areas in so far as it requires the farm income to be calculated whereas the latter does not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>1.  The criteria used by AnCO to determine the most suitable location for a training centre are as follows: total population in the area; population density around potential locations; existing industrial jobs and planned growth; minimum training centre size for economic operation; availability of financial resources.</P>
      <P>2.  Under the building programme of AnCO to date all major towns in the country were examined in the light of the above criteria.  Following this examination a number of sites were selected for training centres.</P>
      <P>3.  The council of AnCO are currently reviewing their building programme in the light of the financial criterion mentioned above and also in the light of the increased capacity of existing training centres following the introduction of a productivity agreement earlier this year. Even at this stage of the review, however, I understand it is unlikely that AnCO could justify the establishment of a permanent training centre in Westport.</P>
      <P>4.  An important part of the AnCO approach to training is to cater for the needs of areas which do not have a permanent AnCO training centre by running courses organised by their external training division.  These courses are run in rented accommodation or in employers' premises and are designed to be flexible and responsive to local needs.  Training facilities are also provided outside AnCO training centres through mobile training units and the community youth training programme.</P>

    <P>Firstly, the rebroadcasting of British television signals would require under copyright law the agreement of the broadcasting authorities concerned.  Secondly, the broadcasting frequencies available to this country under international agreements are not sufficient to allow the widespread rebroadcasting of British television signals.  Any such systems serving extensive areas would lead to unacceptable interference with other services, including licensed cable systems, <Col N="343" /> and would inhibit the improvement of reception of existing RTE services and the development of new services.</P>

Following inquiries it was ascertained that he was employed in Northern Ireland during that year.  It was therefore necessary to make inquiries with the Northern Ireland authorities to establish whether he had sufficient contributions to qualify him for payment.  On receipt of his Northern Ireland record his claim was reviewed and payment was allowed from the commencement of his claim at the maximum rate appropriate to a married man with one qualified child.  Payment of all disability benefit due to 30 September 1982, the date of the latest medical certificate received, has been made.</P>

      <P>The person concerned attained age 65 years on 4 July 1982 and claimed retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts.  He does not qualify for such a pension at the standard rates as he failed to satisfy the condition which requires him to have a yearly average of at least 24 contributions during the period from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1982.</P>
      <P>Under EEC regulations he qualifies for a pro-rata rate retirement pension in this country on the basis of his combined Irish and British rate contributions in addition to the retirement pension payable from the Northern Ireland Department of Health and Social Services since July 1982.  However, this pro-rata rate pension was withheld as he was in receipt of disability benefit at a higher rate.  As his entitlement to benefit ceases on 30 October 1982, payment of the pro-rata retirement pension will commence from 4 November 1982.

Subsequently a deciding officer disallowed his claim from 13 August 1982 on the grounds that he lost employment through conduct which disqualified him for unemployment benefit but he allowed payment from 11 September 1982.  All arrears of flat-rate unemployment benefit were paid in early October 1982 and weekly payments continue to be made to him as they become due.</P>
      <P>Additional inquiries were necessary to establish his entitlement to pay-related benefit and these were recently completed.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate on <i>The Way Forward</i> was adjourned I was talking about certain undesirable elements that had crept into our political life.  I was not decrying them just because they have crept into our life but because of their possible effect particularly on our young people and because, as a result of this type of politicking, there is a danger of corrosion of what I regard as &mdash; it is an oldfashioned term &mdash; a very important thing and that is patriotism.  There is a spirit of generosity in young people.  There is a willingness to sacrifice, if called upon.  This can only be corroded and damaged by cynicism, by low standards in treating political opponents.  Our adversative type of politics need not necessarily lead to that position.  It is a healthy system, but there are limits to adversative criticism, the barrier and boundary of which is the truth.  I am talking about the old virtue of <i>pietas</i>, the love of one's family, in a more extended domain the love of one's <Col N="359" /> community and, finally, the love of one's country.  They are part of the same virtue and it is only by virtue of the existence of that virtue of <i>pietas</i> that we can call upon people, as we have to in this instance, to make sacrifices and work for the common good.</P>
      <P>We are putting a way, <i>The Way Forward,</i> before the Irish people.  We regard it as the way, but also the truth.  We have outlined corrective measures which must be taken and we have outlined the development plans which we hope will take the country out of its recession.  A previous speaker this morning mentioned that we, as a Government and as a party, had &mdash; and I quote &mdash;&ldquo;manifestly failed to get the public confidence&rdquo;.  I am oldfashioned enough to believe that the only credible way in which confidence is expressed in a Government or in a politician is in the ballot box.  We in Government and in the Fianna Fáil Party are prepared to abide by the decision of the ballot box.  Our antecedents in this have been challenged.  In the country, we have a proverb about the jennet.  The jennet is half ass and half horse.  We say of him that he has neither pride in his ancestry nor hope of posterity, because he is barren by nature.  The people who have been offering the criticism fill the role of the jennet in our political life &mdash; if we must examine antecedents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very important appendix to a chapter in <i>The Way Forward</i> is that to Chapter X.  I do not know why, but we have been inclined to look at our problems as affecting ourselve alone.  We are an island and at the edge of Europe.  Nevertheless, we have had a very wide <i>diaspora</i> but, on occasion, this has not had the effect of making us look at what is happening in other countries.  I would suggest to the House and to our citizens that we should look at the appendix to Chapter X which gives an indication, in summary, of what people in other countries are being asked to do &mdash; what sacrifices are being asked of the citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany, Denmark, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Japan.  There is a list of other measures, besides those <Col N="360" /> given on page 114, which are being asked of the citizens of those various countries. On occasions we have been affected, for short periods anyway, with an insularity of outlook.  I never could quite understand why, seeing that the Irish <i>diaspora</i> had kept windows on the world for so long.  It would be healthy, when people are saying that they are being asked to do the things and will not do them, to have a look at that chapter to see what the citizens of other countries are being asked to do.  In fact, a general election campaign was conducted in one of those countries on the basis of sacrifices being demanded and the parties putting the strict and hard options to the people won that election.  That is the kind of thinking that we require from our citizens in the serious economic position in which we find ourselves today.</P>
    <P>Many of the measures contained in this economic programme will be unpalatable to different sections of our population. However, without the measures outlined in the plan, we will be unable to continue to borrow to the extent needed, we will have difficulty in servicing our public debt, in maintaining the present value of the punt and in continuing to import without restriction.  The basic strategy of the plan before this House is one which will progressively create an economy capable of providing employment for a rapidly growing labour force, an expanding and more competitive productive sector, the possibility of reduced personal taxation and more efficient and economic public services.</P>
    <P>The careful reading of the plan will show that 17,000 extra people will be coming on the labour market each year over the period of the plan.  This amounts to about 85,000 people.  This, in fact, is the major challenge of the plan and was recognised as such in discussion in Government.  It is there that we hope to make the impact which will bring this country up to 1986 in a developing situation. I must point out that our economic problems are shared by so many people that we get encouragement from their efforts to solve them.  Countries everywhere are faced with the need for severe adjustment and unpalatable corrective <Col N="361" /> action to offset the effects of the worst and most prolonged recession to hit the world economy since the thirties.  Ireland could not insulate itself, could not avoid that recession.  A small economy cannot escape.  It is not possible to stop the world so that we can get off.</P>
    <P>We have special difficulties in adjusting our economy without causing excessive cutbacks in demand and output.  For one thing, our population is growing at about four times the European community average.  Secondly, our labour force is growing at about twice the European community rate.  These facts highlight our need for greater investment and more jobs at a time when we must curtail borrowing and correct our large and unsustainable balance of payments deficit. There are some signs of hope on the economic horizon.  I agree with our adversative system of politics.  It keeps people in government upon their toes, it subjects all judgments, decisions and policies to a minute analysis, but at times Opposition speakers should recognise that there is a threshold below which the criticism should not go.  Before I was elected to this House, whenever national loans were being floated, the leaders of all the political parties, without cavil, without making any reservations, supported the then Government, whichever Government was in office, in their efforts to provide money for the development of the economy.</P>
    <P>Many of the international economic trends are now for the first time in three years beginning to offer us the prospect of increased exports to replace the internal demand we were forced to create temporarily at the height of the recession by internal and external deficit financing. For example, EEC imports are forecast to increase by 2½ per cent in real terms in 1982 and by about 3 per cent in 1983, following a fall of more than 1½ per cent last year.  Another good sign is the continuing moderation in international inflationary pressures.  It is against this slowly-improving international background that our economic strategy can now be modified progressively to remedy <Col N="362" /> deep-seated defects in our economic structure.</P>
    <P>The plan outlines measures to remedy the many defects which the economy suffers from at present.  I shall first mention a few of these defects &mdash; the inability to sell competitively at home and abroad all the goods and services we can produce and the unsustainably high level of borrowing for public expenditure, including borrowing for current expenditure to finance public services.  The word &ldquo;competitiveness&rdquo; occurs frequently in the plan.  I regard that as the key word in this document because we must direct all our energies to improving our competitiveness.</P>
    <P>In the main the plan proposes stringent measures to restore balance in the public finances.  These measures will include elimination of the current budget deficit by 1986.  That will, in effect, halt and reverse the trends of the last decade in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>As less money will be borrowed to finance the current deficit, like a see-saw, more money will become available to finance the Public Capital Programme, to finance productive manufacturing industry in particular.</P>
    <P>Other measures in the plan will involve moderation in the growth of taxation, making it more equitable.  Further, the plan will help to create the competitive conditions essential for growth in employment.  More significantly the plan will accelerate the productive and econiomic infrastructure investment programmes essential for development and will bring new criteria of efficiency to bear throughout the public sector.</P>
    <P>Let me assure you that this is not a &ldquo;paper plan&rdquo;.  It is a plan of action.  The Government are fully determined to adhere to the strategy outlined in this plan, whatever the difficulties involved. The plan will be monitored continuously so that when and where necessary, measures to reinforce its operation and to secure the achievement of its objectives may be expeditiously introduced.  These steps will be particularly applied in the case of industrial and other sectoral developments.</P>
    <P>While some of the measures will be <Col N="363" /> unpalatable to many, there can be little disagreement about the essential objectives of the plan.  Who could quibble with the objective of halting and reversing the trend in unemployment by lowering inflation and interest rates and having more moderate trends in moneys and taxation? These objectives are among those spelt out in the plan.  All of the objectives have the basic requirement to create a more competitive economy in which employment can progressively increase, the grim upward trend in unemployment be reversed and the realisation of a more equitable and expanding economy ensured.</P>
    <P>It is evident from what is said in Chapter VIII of the National Economic Plan that the Government attach a high priority to a good telecommunications service. Telecommunications are clearly an essential infrastructural service in modern times and if industry and business are to be successful, as they must to meet the aims of the plan and to ensure our survival and prosperity as a nation, then we owe it to them to help them in being successful.  In getting supplies for business and industry and in marketing, use must be made of telecommunications and the better these are the more efficient can industry and business be.  For far too long a period our telecommunications services did not get the attention they need in a modern State.  The capital to keep them up to date and to expand them to meet present day needs simply was not made available.  I do not say this in any critical sense of successive Governments; the simple fact was there were many other pressing demands, priorities, on the finances of the State to meet housing, educational, industrial and other high priority needs.</P>
    <P>But needs and priorities change and one of the features of the economic plan is that it identifies these changing needs and their priorities, recognising that in a number of areas we have been giving ourselves higher standards than our output and national wealth would justify. New priorities are set and where money has to be provided for them, this is identified and earmarked.  Telecommunications <Col N="364" /> are being accorded their rightful place as services that must be given the necessary capital and attention during the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>Telecommunications are a capital-intensive industry.  This will be evident from the range of £970 million to £1,200 million given as the limits within which capital investment is likely to fall over the five-year period as set out in pages 92 and 93 of the plan.  As pointed out in the plan, the actual sum needed will depend on demand for the services and this in turn is dependent on the general state of the economy, the cost of funding the capital, the cost of the service and so on.  The plan envisages that the money needed will be made available to meet the stated objectives of providing efficient services to meet demand in the most cost-effective manner, developing good customer relations and adopting a market-oriented, businesslike approach.  I will deal now with what is being done to ensure that these objectives are achieved.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation of the Department into two State-sponsored companies, under the Postal and Telecommunications Bill at present before the House, is an important part of the Government's plan for the development of the postal and telecommunications services.  Deputies will recall that the setting up of State-sponsored bodies to run the services was recommended by the independent Posts and Telegraphs Review Group, under the chairmanship of Dr. Michael Dargan, which concluded that the civil service was not the environment best suited to the operation and development of commercially-orientated services.  I should like to record my appreciation of the help I got from Deputy Cooney and others during the Second Stage debate.</P>
    <P>The Government remain strongly of the view that the establishment of the new State-sponsored companies will contribute significantly to the better development of the national communications services.  Let us be clear that that is the object of the exercise.  The aim of the reorganisation is to achieve faster development of the services, to get things done better and more efficiently and to create <Col N="365" /> an environment in which the needs of the customer will be recognised and catered for more fully.</P>
    <P>The new bodies, therefore, are rightly being given a considerable degree of commercial freedom and flexibility.  At the same time, there is no question but that the national communications services will remain firmly within the public sector and the Minister will retain the necessary functions, in the areas, for example, of public policy and financial control, so enable him to meet the Government's overall responsibility for the services in the national interest.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Bill to set up the new companies is at present before the House.  Deputies can read the figures in the graphs in the plan.  The guiding principle underlying the proposals in the Bill is that the two new bodies should be established on a fully satisfactory basis, so as to enable them to realise the objectives which I have mentioned.  The Government believe that the proposals will achieve this.  The other primary consideration for the Government is to ensure that, in the transition from Government Department to State-sponsored companies, the legitimate interests of existing staff will be fully and adequately protected.  I assure Deputies that that is the intention.</P>
    <P>The Government regard the reorganisation as fully consistent with the development aims of the economic plan and an essential feature of it in so far as the postal and telecommunications services are concerned.  As such, the Government wish to see it implemented as soon as possible.  We are aiming, therefore, with the co-operation of the House, to have the remaining stages of the Bill processed quickly so that, if possible, the new bodies can be set up early in 1983.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the amount of capital needed for development of the telephone service over the plan period is likely to be between £970 million and £1,200 million.  Until last year it had been the practice to provide all the money needed for telephone development from the Exchequer.  In the present year, most of the capital needed is being raised by Irish Telecommunications Investments <Col N="366" /> Ltd., the company formed to finance telecommunications development works. When the new telecommunications board have been established, the intention is that they will raise all the capital they require, just as the ESB and some other commercial State-sponsored bodies do at present.</P>
    <P>The experience so far is that Irish Telecommunications Investments Ltd. have had no difficulties in raising the capital needed and I do not expect there should be any in the years to come. Development of the service should not suffer therefore from inability to secure the capital needed.  I should mention, too, in this connection that substantial funds are being made available by the European Investment Bank at attractive rates for telephone development work and I would expect this funding to continue in the years ahead.  It is an indication of the confidence the European institutions have in the basic soundness of our economy.</P>
    <P>As will be evident from the economic plan, it is not possible to forecast closely what the demand for telephone service will be.  Demand is closely linked with the general state of the economy, with the charges for the service and with the capacity to pay for the service.  Telephone density in this country is low by the standards in other EEC countries &mdash; I was shocked to see how low when I took over the Department &mdash; although there are factors here, such as the bigger family size, which invalidates comparison to some extent, but it is clear that there should be a continuing high level of demand for quite a long period ahead.</P>
    <P>The demand will obviously need to be monitored on a continuing basis and whatever adjustments are necessary made.  What the economic plan does is to suggest the limits within which demand is likely to fall and to make provision for the capital needed to meet these levels of demand.  The allocation of the financial resources needed to meet whatever the level of demand is likely to be, as set out in the plan, is evidence of the Government's determination to ensure that we have a high quality telephone service here equal to that in other EEC countries <Col N="367" /> and that business and industry which, as the plan sets out, are to be the main springboard for providing the jobs needed over the next five years, will not be placed at a disadvantage with their foreign competitors.</P>
    <P>The current telephone development programme was embarked on at the beginning of 1980 and we are now entering the second half of that programme. Significant progress has been made and the programme is broadly on target.  A record 130,000 new connections were made in the years 1980 to 1981.  The waiting list has at last begun to fall and is now below 80,000.  The subscriber trunk dialling service is improving steadily and the conversion of the remaining manual exchanges and telephones to automatic working is continuing.  Some 350 buildings for telephone purposes, mainly for new telephone exchanges, have been completed and a further 84 are under construction.  Two new engineering training schools have been opened to, among other needs, train staff in the new technology that will be required to operate and maintain new digital exchanges that are now being installed.  Is minic cú mall sona &mdash; we were lucky to have come into the development stage when we could avail of the most modern technology in this field.</P>
    <P>The resources have been built up and meeting the connection targets set out in the economic plan is not expected to give rise to any insuperable problems.  This is not to say that the targets will be met readily but I am confident that such problems as are likely to be encountered can be overcome.  The trunk and local automatic telephone exchanges needed to meet the targets for quality of automatic service set are either already installed, on order or at the advanced planning stage.</P>
    <P>The same comments apply to the trunk transmission systems and to the exchanges needed for conversion of the remaining auto-manual exchanges to automatic working.  Much of the basic work involved in improving the quality of the service to subscribers has been done and the targets in the plan are realistic <Col N="368" /> and attainable.  When fully realised, the benefits to the country will be very great indeed.</P>
    <P>A key factor in the implementation of the telephone development programme is having the necessary manpower available. Clearly, when the programme got under way in 1980, there was not enough staff available to carry out the programme. This was not something that could be remedied overnight.  In many instances, the staff were working in conditions that were already overcrowded and the extra staff needed to carry out the programme could not be recruited until accommodation had first been provided.</P>
    <P>This accommodation has now been largely made available by way of new buildings provided as part of the Department's building programme or, where this could not be done, by renting the facilities needed.  Almost all the extra engineering staff needed has been recruited and much of the training to enable these to function effectively and make the contribution to the programme for which they were recruited has been given.  Only marginal numbers remain to be recruited.  The result is that my Department now have almost all the resources needed to press ahead with the programme as planned and that is what is being done.  This was budgeted for by my predecessor and continued by me.</P>
    <P>Because all the staff needed were not available the shortage had to be made good largely by working a substantial volume of overtime.  There was no real alternative to this in the short term but clearly continuation of it over any extended period could not be supported.  In fact, the volume of overtime, which peaked last year, is being reduced substantially this year, and will be further reduced next year.  The aim will be to continue to reduce it according as the resources needed to bring it to the irreducible minimum become available.  I believe that there will be general acceptance that this is the right course.</P>
    <P>While much progress has been made in implementing the development programme I would not wish to convey the impression that all in the garden is rosy <Col N="369" /> and that there are not problems still to be overcome.  There are, and I want to make it clear that my Department are fully conscious of these and to explain what is being done about at least some of them.  In dealing with these I exclude the delays in providing telephone service and the extension and improvement in the quality of the automatic service which are basic to the whole development programme. Some of the matters I have specifically in mind are the less than satisfactory service in repairing underground cable faluts in Dublin, telephone billing problems, which all Members of this House have called to their attention regularly, and delays in answering persons making calls via operators.</P>
    <P>Delays in repairing faults in underground cables in the Dublin area have persisted over an unduly long period. There have been two basic problems, the generally deteriorating standard of the cabling network and a shortage of the necessary skilled jointers.  Much of the cabling network is substandard &mdash; there is no use in concealing that &mdash; and does not stand up to severe flooding which unfortunately we have had three times in the last year and which put numbers of major cables serving up to 1,000 lines or more out of service.  The Department's ability to deal with this has been aggravated by a shortage of skilled jointers. The problem has now been tackled on a basis which over the next two years will deal comprehensively with it.  Firstly, more skilled jointing staff have been allocated to the work, a programme of preventive maintenance has been undertaken and the bigger subscriber cables are being pressurised.  The jointing force has been considerably strengthened this year but I should make it clear that it will take time before these are fully effective. Of course, skilled jointers are also needed to provide service for applicants &mdash; this is the point; this is the kind of catch-22 situation &mdash; and the demands for jointers for provision of service of applicants and for repair of cables have to be balanced.  Because of the continuing unsatisfactory repair position, however, it was decided some time ago to allocate almost all the available jointers to contain <Col N="370" /> the repair position which had deteriorated following thunderstorms last June. As I mentioned already, there were three exceptionally severe periods of bad weather which affected the underground cables.  Repairs will continue to be given priority until the position is brought fully under control.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the action that has been taken will bring the required results. But I should sound a note of caution that it may take up to two years before a fully satisfactory underground cable repair service is available.  I know that at the very edge of technology now we have fibre-optics and that a lot of these problems will not be encountered when these fibre-optics come into use.  We have used them on a very small scale only as yet &mdash; 20 or 30 kilometres in each case.  I hope this too will bring an improvement, because deterioration of the underground cable has been a major headache. I should also mention that the diversion of all jointing staff to underground cable repairs for prolonged periods this year has affected our ability to meet applications for telephones.  I made that point already.  Priorities had to be settled between meeting applications and repairing faults and I am satisfied that the course we have taken was the correct one.</P>
    <P>I am aware that telephone bills have been the subject of public criticism and a cause of unease to numbers of subscribers. Perhaps I should say at the outset that I can appreciate the concern of subscribers in a situation in which they have no meter available at their homes or places of work from which they can check their metered call usage although in this respect their position is no different from that of telephone subscribers in other countries.  I should point out also that the subscribers meters used in this country for recording metered calls are the same kind as in other countries and are thoroughly reliable.  Subscribers in other countries are complaining also about the metering of their calls.  I do not know whether that is any consolation; I do not think it is.  However, in a situation in which there is unease about metered call billing, clearly it behoves us to do whatever <Col N="371" /> is possible to allay that.  At present where subscribers continue to be dissatisfied with the number of units for which they are being billed printer meters are placed on their lines with their agreement. I must say that some people who come into my &ldquo;clinic&rdquo; anyway do mistake the unit call for a call.  At times they talk about a charge for three minutes when in fact the basic charge is for 20 seconds, depending on the distance they are telephoning. These printer meters record all the calls made over the line in question, but not the content of the calls, and the results are compared with the subscriber's own records which have to be maintained while the checks are in progress. Clearly this is a help.  Within the next few months meters will be made available for sale or rental to subscribers with which they can check their metered call usage. Digital exchanges becoming available now, to which I have referred already, will have the capacity to provide details of metered calls made.  The intention is to move, over a period, to a situation in which details of all trunk calls made can be made available to subscribers.  In the final analysis this is the only fully satisfactory solution and is the direction in which we propose to move.  More frequent billing, which would make it easier for subscribers to pay, is also being considered. The whole question of future billing arrangements has been under study in the Department since early this year.  A report on the examination, with recommendations for future action, is expected before the end of the year.  I believe these measures being taken now and the further measures to be taken when the examining group reports will remove existing causes of dissatisfaction with telephone billing during the period of this plan.</P>
    <P>The time taken to answer callers at a number of exchanges throughout the country seeking calls via telephone operators is excessive.  This has been due to a number of factors, the principal one of which is that because of the planned conversion of the remaining manual exchanges to automatic working in the ordinary course there would be a surplus <Col N="372" /> of telephone operating staff if action were not taken in good time to deal with it.  In anticipation of this, recruitment of telephone operators was stopped some time ago.  The result is that we have rather less operators at numbers of exchanges than would be needed to handle the current level of traffic.  But of course staff will become available as other auto-manual exchanges are changed to automatic. However, with the spread of automation to centres that have manual service only at present, the extension of STD to Northern Ireland and Britain and the extension of international dialling, the demand for operator services will clearly drop over the next few years and the speed with which callers are answered will improve substantially over the next two years.</P>
    <P>The main concentration at this stage must be to improve the quality of the basic telephone, telex and data services and it is to these the main resources are being devoted.  However, as set out in the economic plan, the provision of new services that will be of benefit to users is not being neglected.  A public mobile automatic radio telephone service for the Dublin area initially, but with the capacity to extend it to other areas if the demand justifies that course, was ordered recently.  The planning of a national packet switched data network, which will greatly facilitate the transmission of data, and of a national radiopaging system is almost completed and tenders will probably be invited for these in the course of the next year.  Numbers of other new services being introduced in other countries recently are also being studied to establish if their introduction here is likely to be beneficial and warranted, and a group has just been established to recommend on the action that should be taken by this country so that is can benefit to the maximum extent from the developments taking place in all forms of satellite communication.  It is therefore the intention to ensure that this country is not left behind in the case of any technological developments that are likely to bring advantages to the country.</P>
    <P>While the emphasis must clearly be on improving the basic telecommunications <Col N="373" /> services, sight must not be lost of the need to keep under review all the existing services provided to ensure that they are all fulfilling an essential purpose and that their provision continues to be warranted. The telegram service is at present under review.  This was once an essential service for business and was in many instances the only means of urgent communication over a distance.  The service is now used largely for social purposes &mdash; sympathy and greetings telegrams &mdash; and is being operated at a substantial loss.  Increasing charges is not the answer as the evidence is that the more charges are raised the less use is made of the service.  The question must therefore be considered whether it should be continued &mdash; or, at least, whether it should be preserved in its existing form &mdash; and this is at present under examination.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware, too, that it has been decided to issue only the home part of the telephone directory to all subscribers next year, although the second part will be made available on request, possibly at a small additional charge.</P>
    <P>Development of the infrastructure of the telephone service itself has also to be carried out on a basis that will not impose overheads on the service that it could not bear at this stage of its development.  In pursuance of that policy, the Department have deferred the provision of a number of buildings until such time as more of the essential investment already made in the service becomes revenue-earning.</P>
    <P>I mention these only as an indication that we are not concerned simply under this economic plan with providing high quality telecommunications services &mdash; we must also ensure that it is provided as economically as possible and that costs are not incurred unnecessarily on services for which there is not a real demand or which do not pay their way, or before they become absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>Good communication systems are indispensable for economic advancement and the value of an efficient postal service to business and commerce for the foreseeable future is obvious.  Basically, we have a very well-developed postal network. However, accommodation for operations and staff needs to be <Col N="374" /> improved and expanded, and mechanisation extended to improve cost-effectiveness and efficiency in line with postal developments in other countries.  The financial provisions in the legislation for the setting up of the new postal board will enable An Post, the new company, when established, to press ahead with these essential improvements, while concentrating as well on service to the customer and the need for the service to be financially viable.</P>
    <P>The main direction forward for this important service is to improve its efficiency and cost-effectiveness, gear itself more closely to the needs of its customers, develop new services which will be self-financing and regain traffic lost.  It has been going through a difficult period. As a highly labour-intensive service it has been particularly heavily hit by inflation, its charges have had to be sharply increased in an effort to cover increases in costs and, mainly because of the economic recession and high prices, traffic volumes have fallen.  This trend has to be arrested and reversed.</P>
    <P>One way of doing so is by introducing new lines of business and some progress has been made in recent times in introducing some of these &mdash; the surface air lifted parcel service, which is geared to meeting mail order export business to the USA, and the postbus are two, and others such as express delivery service in the main centres of population, surface air lifted letter service and facsimile transmission are in the pipeline.  But while these should be a help, they will not bring the increase in volume that would be needed and which the service could handle at little extra cost.  A service which has attracted a lot of business in other countries is unaddressed mail for advertising, and this is a service to which consideration is being given here at present. I expect that when the postal board takes over the operation of the services it will devote substantial effort to marketing these new services, as well of course, as attracting more of the traditional business. As a result of conversations I have had with the chief executive, chairman and board members I am convinced they <Col N="375" /> have very good prolific ideas for that type of development.</P>
    <P>While new services can be expected to make a valuable contribution the main business will continue to be the ordinary letters and parcels and it is the reliability with which these services are given and the cost at which they are provided that will be the determining factors in the future of the postal services.  The quality of the service slipped over the last few years but I am glad to be able to say that it is now much more reliable and although it has still some distance to go before it reaches the previous high standard, it is headed in the right direction.  There is much spare capacity in the postal system. Most postmen on delivery work could carry much more mail, and if the public, and business in particular &mdash; the percentage of post which is purely social is very low &mdash; can be persuaded to make greater use of the post, the service should return to its former healthy state.  Staff and management have an important role to play and the future of the service will depend very much on how well they perform their jobs.  I know they are conscious of this and that they can be relied on for the necessary effort and to give their co-operation in the measures that are being developed to raise the level of efficiency in the postal service, thus assuring the country of a viable, high quality postal service in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>As in the case of the telecommunications service, economy and efficiency do not consist solely of doing what we are doing well.  We have to ask also whether some of the services being provided at present are necessary at all or needed to the standard at which they are being given and whether, in the interests of economy, the way in which some of them are provided should be changed.  These aspects too, have been under review and, in particular, the second postal delivery in the major urban areas and the hours of counter services; the delivery of mails to roadside boxes is also under consideration. Changes of this kind are an essential feature of the revamping of the postal service and developments of this <Col N="376" /> kind can be expected over the period of the plan &mdash; in the earlier rather than in the later stages.</P>
    <P>Of all the resources available to the Department its most important resource is of course its manpower.  There is a wealth of experience, expertise and talent there and the primary task of my Department will be to ensure that it is effectively and harmoniously harnessed towards achieving the goals set out in the plan in relation to the telecommunications and postal services.  I believe that the staff of my Department will not be found wanting and that the effort and co-operation required in the attainment of those goals will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate in the context of this discussion on the economic plan to consider the role of the semi-State bodies under the aegis of the Department of Transport.  The efficient operation of the transport facilities provided by the State transport companies is vital to the smooth operation of the economy.  This is especially so in our case since the livelihoods of so many of our people depend on trade and, therefore, ultimately on the smooth movement of both passengers and goods within the State and to and from our trading partners.</P>
    <P>The plan refers in chapter IV to the need to improve the financial performance of commercial semi-State bodies so that investment by them generates an acceptable return.  As most Deputies will be aware, the present financial position of these bodies is very bad.  The latest published results of these bodies show that in general they are unable to generate out of profits sufficient finance to meet these needs in the normal commercial manner.</P>
    <P>A major purpose in setting up our semi-State bodies was that they should undertake essential business relating to national development in an enterprising and developmental way.  In the main, these bodies have to operate in the commercial market place.  Their success or failure must be measured on the basis of the quality of service they provide and the financial results which they return.  In recent times considerable public attention has been paid to the disappointing <Col N="377" /> performance, particularly in financial terms, of a number of semi-State bodies. In fact a Committee of this House was established to examine the operations of some bodies.</P>
    <P>In looking at financial performances, we must, of course, bear in mind the present general economic difficulties, which are marked by slow growth, depressed foreign markets, a high rate of inflation and unfavourable trading conditions all round.  Public enterprises &mdash; like those in the private sector &mdash; have been severely affected by these problems. Do these external factors fully explain the present difficulties of the State-sponsored sector?  Some critics of public enterprises have suggested that State bodies are shielded from market forces and thus lack strong commercial motivation.  There have been suggestions of over-manning, of over-investment. Are these fair criticisms?  Why has our system of State-sponsored bodies, which was previously held in respect and even pride, become the subject of so much criticism?</P>
    <P>All our State-sponsored bodies were originally established with a fairly clear purpose in mind.  Over the years, however, we appear as a community &mdash; either explicitly or implicitly &mdash; to have tacked on additional objectives.  In the last few decades the State has become a major agent of economic growth and this has led us to view State-owned enterprises as a means of increasing national output and as an instrument for generating or preserving employment.  It goes without saying that we expect State enterprises to conform to general economic objectives such as the reduction of inflation and the purchase of Irish goods and services.  In addition we have, in the transport area particularly, a need to maintain services which are not economic in the full sense but which are deemed necessary in the public interest, whether for social, strategic or other reasons.</P>
    <P>All these developments have, I believe, contributed to a degree of ambiguity on the part of the community as a whole in our approach to State bodies. There is a dichotomy which leads the public to demand the maintenance of <Col N="378" /> uneconomic transport services while at the same time deploring the losses which are incurred in providing them.  We criticise public enterprises for being inefficient or over-manned but feel free to protest at the redundancies or other consequences of remedial measures.  We demand investment for infrastructural or regional development needs but complain about the lack of strict investment criteria.  This does not, of course, absolve the State bodies from responsibility for their problems.  I have no doubt that in a number of instances State bodies have been happy to live with an imprecise view of their role and their objectives.  They have not been required to give such a high priority to profitability and have escaped the full discipline of clear performance measurement.  They have enjoyed a degree of protection from the harsher winds that have blown so severely and caused so many casualties in the private sector.</P>
    <P>These and other issues have been addressed by the Government in the National Economic Plan.  In future all significant investment proposals will be submitted to the most rigorous and, where necessary, independent financial and commercial assessment before they are allowed to proceed.  Unless the proposed investments are judged capable of achieving an adequate rate of return on capital employed, they will have little hope of approval.</P>
    <P>A similar approach will be taken in regard to proposals for the financial restructuring of semi-State bodies.  The ultimate aim of each commercial semi-State body should be to give a rate of return at least equal to the cost to it or to the Exchequer of borrowing funds so far as its commercial activities are concerned. I should point out to the House that studies done in this area have shown that the present rate of return to the Exchequer on its investment in such bodies is only 4 per cent compared to current domestic interest changes of about 15 per cent on long-term borrowing.</P>
    <P>A clear definition of policy objectives and overall financial targets will be set for each commercial semi-State body and their performance will be monitored on <Col N="379" /> a continuous basis.  The task of adjusting the targets of the State-sponsored bodies and the investment criteria which apply to them will be carried through without impairing their autonomy or the sense of enterprise which has served them and the country so well in the past.  When the balance is being struck a great deal will depend on the exact role of each body, the cost of discharging that role and our expectations as to results.</P>
    <P>At both national and local levels we had come to expect too much from the State sector.  We looked to the State enterprise to fulfil all our aspirations and solve all the problems in their respective fields of activity.  We felt free to rebuke them, sometimes quite harshly, when they were unable to provide ideal solutions. We have subjected some of them to unfair criticism.</P>
    <P>What we are aiming to do in the State sector is get our expectations right both within the enterprises themselves and in a nationwide context.  Indeed, almost everything in the plan relates to expectations. Nationally our expectations have been too high for the amount of effort we were willing to devote to realising them. This is related to my opening remarks with regard to sacrifice and with regard to dedication.  The new plan identifies expectations for the future which, while remaining high, are also capable of being realised under the programme of action set down.</P>
    <P>The National Economic Plan points the way forward.  It provides the main economic and financial framework for our development over the next five years. There is now a strategy before the Irish people which can ensure a satisfactory economic and social future for our growing population.</P>
    <P>Of course, many of the decisions which will have to be taken within the framework of the Plan will not be easy.  The decisions involve moderation of income and welfare expectations.  They require some sacrifice and acceptance of some new burdens.  These burdens are necessary because if we do not reshape and restructure our economy we will lose out in the new competitive conditions being <Col N="380" /> created by our trading partners.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with some other dimensions of our transport arrangements.  I will first deal with CIE. Over the past decade we have seen an alarming escalation in the losses being recorded by CIE.  In the current year the deficit in the board's operations is estimated at over £100 million.  For longer than perhaps was wise we were prepared somewhat complacently to accept rising deficits in CIE as a kind of testimonial to our social concern.  Complacency, however, is a luxury we can no longer afford. We must now set about quantifying the social elements in our transport system. Criteria will have to be developed for the payment of subventions in respect of payment of essential public services which cannot be made self-supporting.  The Government, as the paymaster for such social services, must take a more active role in the determination of the level of such services.  This means that we must now decide whether the present structure and organisation of our public transport services are the best suited to our future needs.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the existing structure of CIE will shortly be considered by the Government in the context of the recommendations in the McKinsey Report.  Equally, stricter controls will be necessary in relation to capital expenditure projects.  The position which has arisen in relation to CIE arrangements with the Bombardier bus-building plant at Shannon highlights the deficiencies in the present system of control of public capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>CIE's original arrangement with Bombardier envisaged a production at a rate of more than five buses per two weeks. However, because of a backlog of bus replacement requirements, CIE permitted an increase in the production rate to five buses per week, a rate which could not be sustained by CIE long-term requirements.  This might have been acceptable if substantial export orders were assured which would have absorbed the excess production capacity.  This, of course, was not the position, and the problems this created came to a head in 1982 when the allocation of public capital <Col N="381" /> for bus building purposes was limited to £20 million.  A letter from the then Minister, my predecessor Deputy Cooney, indicated that £20 million was the allocation for 1982.  While this was a very sizeable allocation it was not enough to sustain production at the rate of five buses per week, which had been developed at the latter part of 1981.  CIE represented that this would involve a substantial cutback in staff or closure of the plant from July.</P>
    <P>With a view to minimising disruption of production at the plant and to provide for an orderly transition to the agreed reduced rate of production, the Government agreed to allow an additional allocation of £5 million for buses in 1982. However, it appears that CIE, despite warnings to the contrary, had proceeded on the assumption that yet more money would be made available to enable the maximum rate of production at the plant to be maintained throughout 1982.</P>
    <P>To my mind this approach by the board seemed to indicate a reluctance to accept the constraints of straitened public finances.  Obviously CIE and other State companies must be made amenable to the very real financial difficulties facing the country.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Dublin Transport Authority I would like to be in a position to introduce legislation before the Christmas recess providing for the establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority. The proposed functions of the authority in the areas of transport, planning and budgeting, public transport services and traffic management and the administrative improvements which the authority will bring about in these areas are set out in the Government's plan.</P>
    <P>There is ample evidence to suggest that there are inadequacies in existing administrative structures in so far as transportation in the Dublin area is concerned. The Government are satisfied that the only remedy for these inadequacies is a single body with responsibility for the integrated planning and operation of transportation in the Dublin area.  It is the Government's intention that the Dublin Transport Authority will have the necessary powers to enable them to tackile <Col N="382" /> Dublin's growing traffic problems and to ensure the co-ordinated assessment of the priorities between capital and non-capital expenditure and, within capital expenditure, of the priorities between road and rail infrastructure, very much needed rationalisation so that road development will not progress without any reference to what is being done in the rail section.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the activities of the Authority in the traffic management field will be of the utmost importance.  The need for a properly balanced and well-enforced traffic management strategy cannot be over-emphasised.  The effects of congestion in terms of delays, fuel wastage and vehicle wear and tear represent a significant waste of resources at a time when this can be least afforded.  The Dublin Transportation Task Force has been acting as a forerunner of the Authority in the traffic management field and their achievements, particularly in securing the successful introduction of more than 50 buslanes in the past 18 months, have been considerable.  With the establishment of the Authority it is envisaged that the traffic management strategy currently being pursued will be continued and intensified.</P>
    <P>I would like now to deal with the subject of road haulage.  Road freight haulage in Ireland has been operating within a restrictive licensing system which goes back to the early thirties.  An important change came with the liberalising measures implemented in 1971 and 1978 but these were initial steps limited in scope and aimed in the main at easing restrictions on licensed hauliers to facilitate development of their businesses in preparation for more general liberalisation. The Road Transport Act, 1971 helped licensed hauliers by removing the restrictions on the areas of operation in general merchandise licences and abolishing the weight restriction on the vehicles used.  The Road Transport Act, 1978 increased six-fold the number of vehicles which each licensee could operate under a licence.</P>
    <P>The continued growth in the importance of road freight transport over the seventies led to the in-depth study of the <Col N="383" /> industry which the Transport Consultative Commission were invited to undertake. The commission's comprehensive report was presented to my predecessor in July 1981.  The commission identified a need for measures to enable road freight transport to become generally more efficient, flexible and competitive so as to yield not only benefits to the road transport industry but also to the economy generally.  They found that restrictions on access to the professional haulage industry had served as a brake on development in standards and quality and had contributed to the situation where as much as two-thirds of road freight activity are still undertaken by &ldquo;own-account&rdquo; vehicles.  The own-account sector operating with vehicles and equipment, which are not used to maximum capacity, need to take a hard look at their investment in transport and to assess the advantages of using the professional haulage sector.</P>
    <P>The main recommendation of the commission's report is for completing the liberalisation of the system of road transport merchandise licensing on a phased basis: this would result in general haulage licences being freely available to all qualified applicants after a period of two years. The recommendation embraces &ldquo;own-account&rdquo; operators who are suitably qualified.  These developments are linked to recommendations on improved enforcement of road transport and road traffic legislation and higher standards of quality controls.</P>
    <P>As a prelude to the Government coming to a conclusion on the commission's recommendations, the report was examined in my Department taking into account the views, written and oral, of the many interests who responded to the invitation to examine and furnish their observations on the recommendations in the report.  I personally met the major interests concerned in order to have a first hand account of their views and concerns in the matter.</P>
    <P>As indicated in <i>The Way Forward</i> the Government have decided that the longer term development of road haulage lies in following the approach recommended by the commission.  The Government <Col N="384" /> will decide on implementation of the recommendations very shortly and I believe that the new legislation, which will be necessary, will help to strengthen the position of professional road freight haulage within the whole transport sector and influence the general quality of road freight facilities.</P>
    <P>I wish now to turn to access transport. The section of the plan dealing with access transport indicates that Government policy towards Aer Lingus will be based on the review of their commercial and financial position carried out earlier this year.  Legislation will be necessary to give effect to the Government's decision on the future financing of the air companies and I propose to bring that legislation before the House during the current session.  That will provide an opportunity for a full-scale debate on the activities of Aer Lingus and I will accordingly refrain from commenting in detail on the affairs of the air companies in this debate.</P>
    <P>As regards sea access transport, I would first like to refer to the B &amp; I Line. This company have been encountering serious financial problems in the recent past.  Over-ambitious investments have burdened the company with high interest payments and capital charges which they cannot meet.  A stagnant market, rising costs &mdash; fuel in particular, but also wages &mdash; together with price competition has led to severe financial difficulties. The B &amp; I &mdash; like Aer Lingus &mdash; are in direct competition with foreign-based operators and it is now clear &mdash; as indicated in the plan &mdash; that a radical retrenchment and rationalisation of B &amp; I's operations is necessary.  This is the inevitable consequence of loss of competitiveness in world markets but, more important, it is also a pre-requisite to the restoration of the competitiveness which the plan has identified as a necessary condition for the revival in the economy. The Government identify in the plan the necessity to ensure the economic operation of the B &amp; I Company's services together with a reduction in the company's cost overheads.</P>
    <P>I turn now to Irish Shipping.  It is unfortunate that the plan must report a deterioration <Col N="385" /> in the performance of Irish Shipping to the extent that the profits generated by the company's ancillary activities will no longer cover losses incurred in the deep sea shipping market. The present slump in tramp shipping is the worst that Irish Shipping have had to contend with.  But Irish Shipping is not unique in this regard.  I note from a recent edition of the London based <i>Economist</i> that the whole shipping industry is in its worst depression for 50 years.  The <i>Economist</i> quoted industry analysts' estimates that there will be no improvement in shipping before late 1983.  Accordingly, there is little hope of a short-term improvement and the plan has accordingly identified the need for Irish Shipping to take stringent remedial action.</P>

      <P>I was wondering if this debate would go on and on.  We have before us a document which the Government calls <i>The Way Forward.</i> There is just one thing in that document that I welcome and it is that for the first time the Government have recognised that there is a crisis in our economy.  The boom and bloom has been thrown out the window.  A few months ago the man in the street could not understand why the Government were refusing to recognise that there was an economic crisis. The Government should apologise to the people for recognising so late in the day that there is trouble in the economy.  We were led to believe during the last general election campaign and in the introduction of the budget that there was boom and bloom.  We were told there was no problem at all.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The Way Forward</i> is like the road to hell &mdash; it is paved with good intentions. However, good intentions are not enough.  At least we can have a real debate because the Government have at last recognised that there is a crisis.  That is the only thing in the document I welcome.</P>
