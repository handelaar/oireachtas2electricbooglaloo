      <P>In view of the unprecedented and serious implications of the lobbying campaign by nearly all the employees of RTE regarding their fears for the future of the national broadcasting service station's future, will the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs indicate if and when he proposes to take action, legislative or otherwise, on the collection of the licence fee which has an outstanding deficit of £8 million, and on control of the air waves?</P>

      <P>When does the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs propose to introduce legislation promised by him six weeks ago to a deputation in relation to the alleged re-broadcasting of BBC, ITV, and pirate radio stations?

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="1320" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is concerned with the introduction of a concession in respect of income tax costing £45 million for people who are paying pay-related social insurance contributions.  If £45 million is available, I consider this is the worst and most inequitable way of using it to aid people who have problems paying their pay-related social insurance contributions.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with that issue I should like to condemn in the strongest possible terms the fact that the Government have failed consistently, despite repeated requests from this side of the House, to say how they will raise the £45 million. Throughout this debate they have criticised us for putting forward amendments, some of which would cost as little as £4 million &mdash; one-tenth of the amount involved in this concession.  They have criticised us for irresponsibility in doing our duty as an Opposition and putting forward amendments of this kind.  Yet, although they announced this concession well before the Dublin West by-election they have not yet told us how they will raise the money and I predict they will not tell us how they will raise it until after the Galway East by-election.</P>
      <P>The Government are engaged in a campaign of concealment in regard to their true intentions in the matter of cuts in public services and increases in taxation. They will deliberately withhold from the people information that should be made available to them in regard to how the £45 million will be raised.  I fear they will not make the announcement until this Dáil is safely in recess, thus depriving Members on this side of the House and perhaps some on the other side of the opportunity to express their views on whatever measures the Government enact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as expenditure cuts are to be made, I believe these will be made after the Estimates for Public Services have been passed and sanctioned by this House.  In other words, the Government will seek to reverse the decision of this House in regard to Estimates for Public Services by cutting back on levels of expenditure that have been agreed by this House.  If that should take place I <Col N="1321" /> believe it would be unconstitutional behaviour.  If the Government intend to modify any expenditure programme contained in any Estimates this House will pass, they should announce at the time when the expenditure is being considered precisely what reductions they have in mind.  If they allow the House to go ahead and pass Estimates, as it will do on Friday and as it has done on a number of days up to now, without telling the House that they intend to cut back on the public services as sanctioned in those Estimates, in my view they will be behaving against the spirit of the Constitution in not giving a true disclosure to the House of their intentions and, in fact, intending to frustrate the decision of the House in regard to Estimates.</P>
    <P>In the event that they decide to raise some of the money other than by cuts in expenditure but rather by increases in taxation, I fear they may do so by means of the mechanism of an imposition of duties order.  As we know, it is possible for the Government, without the Dáil meeting and without any resolution being introduced here, to introduce increases in taxation by means of such an order. Obviously if the Dáil were in session there would be an immediate opportunity for the Opposition to express a view, contrary or in favour of whatever increases in taxation were proposed by the Government.  However, I fear the Government will wait until the Dáil is in recess to announce how they will raise this £45 million and that they will do so by means of expenditure cuts, which would be in defiance of the Estimates passed by the House, or, alternatively, by increases in taxation which will be introduced by means of imposition of duties orders, fiats announced by the Government which this House will have no opportunity of debating until perhaps three or four months after they come into effect, when the Dáil eventually meets again in October.  I believe that is the Government's intention in regard to raising the £45 million and it is a most unworthy procedure.  The Government must in this House today, be flushed out into the open as to how they propose to raise this £45 million.  They will say, of course, that <Col N="1322" /> they are looking forward to the results of reviews of expenditure and staffing, one of which was initiated by me.  I will come to that in a moment.  Both of these reviews are available to the Government and both have been presented to the Minister for Finance.  He has the material to make the decisions now but I fear he will not make decisions until after the by-election in Galway East and until this House has gone into recess.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to an inquiry into staffing in various Departments and he conceded that it was I, not he, who initiated this inquiry.  It was my intention that this would be used as a long-term means of reducing staff costs and that the procedure in regard to an embargo on new posts in the public service and the decision of the Government to fill only one in three vacancies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates specifically to how this is going to be paid for and in referring to staffing survey I am referring to a statement made by the Minister who said that this was one of the ways whereby he would raise the £45 million.  When I initiated this inquiry it was my intention that, in the event, the results of that survey would be used as a means of saving staff in a long-term way, so as not to necessitate the continuance indefinitely of the procedure which, we all agree, is crude and difficult to administer, of failing to fill two in three vacancies as they arise.  If the Minister is going to use whatever resources are suggested to be saved by means of this staffing review for another purpose, namely, to cover the £45 million, he is departing from my intentions in this matter which were that it should be used, when available, to enable a relaxation to be made in regard to the non-filling of vacancies.  If the Minister is going to use it to raise the £45 million necessary for the implementation of this section, it behoves him to state his intentions in regard to the non-filling of all but one in three vacancies in the public sector.  Clearly, if he is using it for this <Col N="1323" /> purpose he is going to have to continue this embargo on the filling of vacancies in the public sector to raise the money that he is now using for another purpose.  If he uses one penny of the money made available by the staffing reviews to raise the £45 million, it will be he who is continuing the embargo on filling vacancies in the public sector.  He will no longer be able to blame the Government of which I was a member for the fact that vacancies, many of them important, for carrying out skilled tasks, cannot be filled.  It will have been his deliberate decision to use the money available from the reviews that were supposed to release resources to stop the operation of this system of non-filling of vacancies for another purpose, and thereby require, through his decision, not mine, the continuance of this non-filling of vacancies.</P>
      <P>There are many reasons, not just financial, but relating to staffing policy in the public sector which necessitate that the Minister come clean on where he is going to get the £45 million.  He must come clean before the Galway by-election and before the Dáil goes into recess. Otherwise, he will be deliberately depriving this House of the opportunity of passing its verdict as a democratic Assembly on whatever decisions the Government take in our name.</P>

      <P>I welcome this section which gives some relief to people who have carried the burden of taxation over the years.  They have also borne the brunt of PRSI increases which, it must be said, were not in the budget proposals but were contained in the Social Welfare Bill, 1982.  The decision to spend £45 million to give relief to employees who pay the higher rate of PRSI contributions is very welcome.  Deputy Bruton has been asking for reliefs in taxation.  It is surprising, therefore, to hear him continually asking today where the money is coming from. Deputy Bruton did not say he welcomed the granting of tax relief and if he were Minister for Finance I am sure he would not have granted that and he would also have increased the PRSI contributions to the 7.5 per cent.  PRSI is not a social <Col N="1324" /> insurance scheme, it is clearly just another form of taxation and there has been very strong reaction from people who have to pay this very high rate.  It is unjust, inequitable and unfair and bears heaviest on the working class, especially in the private sector.  In the 1982-83 rates of PRSI, 7.5 per cent was added to wages and salaries in the private working class. Only 2.9 per cent was added to the wages and salaries of public sector workers. There was 2 per cent added to the profits of self-employed and farmers.  Investments, dividend incomes and capital gains income from land rezoning are zero-rated.  Company cars were also exempt.  Thus, while the public sector workers pay half what the private sector workers pay, the farmers and the self-employed in practice pay only one-third of what the supposedly cossetted public sector workers pay.  That is a situation that must end.  The PRSI contributions must be spread to the private sector and the farming community because they are getting benefits for which even workers do not qualify.  If workers paying PRSI qualified for full eligibility or health services one could say they were getting something from it, but they are getting nothing.  For that reason one must welcome the spending of this £45 million.</P>

Last evening Deputy Bruton tried to imply that the Bill had not been prepared by him.  The fact is that it was, including the 1 per cent levy that was put through last December when he was still in Government.

      <P>The speech that we have heard from Deputy Bruton this morning would be more appropriate to the church gates somewhere in East Galway than it is to the business in hand here, bearing in mind that we have up to 100 sections in the Finance Bill.  Yet Deputy Bruton proceeds to delay the passage of it for what might be described as political point-scoring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Sherlock said, it is hard to understand the approach of Fine Gael in their demands in relation to where the £45 million might be found, bearing in mind the various statements that I and other members of the Government have made.  The totality of the amendments in the name of Fine Gael alone would cost £180 million.  But there is no shouting from the roof tops by Deputy Bruton regarding the provision of that kind of money.  The outburst that he has made is more appropriate to a by-election.  But I have no intention of running the State finances on the basis of the pending by-election. I have said clearly on numerous occasions that the £45 million would be made good this year by expenditure savings or additional taxation.  The staffing review committee which was introduced by Deputy Bruton reported to us as a new Government.  In addition to that we undertook an expenditure review, the most extensive and exhaustive that has ever been undertaken, and those two reviews have been examined by the Government.  The Government are not just going to make a decision because Deputy Bruton demands it or because there is a by-election pending.  They are going to make decisions in the light of the information that has been obtained from these reviews.  The Government will <Col N="1326" /> make up their minds in relation to any expenditure savings that can be effected and if further taxation is required it will be imposed.  But, as I have said consistently, the £45 million will be made good.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of getting involved in the political arguments raised by Deputy Bruton.  Everybody accepted the necessity for some easement of the burden created by the increase in the PRSI contribution.  With all the statements being made by Fine Gael as to where the money will come from, despite it being explained clearly what the Government intend, one must ask if they are opposing this concession.  It appears that they are against it.  But notwithstanding that, we spent hours yesterday debating an amendment to this section which would cost more than £45 million and that amendment was not in the name of Deputy Sherlock or of Deputy Desmond but in the name of Deputy Bruton.  It is very hard to reconcile these contradictions. But that is a matter for Fine Gael and their own consciences.  We have to deal with reality, and I intend to do that in relation to any decisions that I have to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with points that have been made by the Minister.  First, he referred to a cost of £180 million if the Fine Gael amendments are passed.  I would like to refute that statement.  The position is that £170 million of the alleged costs relate to the amendments that Fine Gael have down to remove the proposals which are simply bringing forward corporation profits tax and VAT from next year to this year. They are not raising any additional revenue; they are just artificially changing the date from which revenue will be raised from January 1983 to December 1982 in order to fool the people.  It will not fool the economic and financial community but it may fool the people about the true extent of the current budget deficit. That is what our amendments are concerned with.  They are not items of cost.  They are simply items designed to force the Government to do their bookkeeping in an honest and not a dishonest fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1327" /> I would like to deal with the concession here.  I believe this method of using £45 million is about the worst possible way of using it because it will be of most benefit to people who are better off, people who are on a 60 per cent marginal tax rate and on high incomes.  To them the tax allowance will be worth 60p in the £.  To people who are so badly off that they cannot even use up their full tax allowances and pay no tax, the additional tax allowance will not be worth a single penny.  To people who are moderately well off and who are not paying tax at the 60p in the £ rate but at 25p or 35p in the £ the concession will be worth only 25p or 35p in the £.  In other words, this concession in regard to PRSI gives most to those who have most, and least to those who have least.  I do not deny that there is room for concessions in regard to PRSI. If £45 million is available for that purpose it should be used to relieve low paid workers altogether from PRSI to the extent that that can be done with £45 million.  This money should not be used, as it is being used by the Minister for Finance, to give disproportionately large benefits to people at the top end of the incomes scale.  I am surprised to hear the representative of The Workers' Party, who concerns himself with the interests of low paid workers, welcoming this type of concession which will give the largest possible benefits to high paid workers and little or no benefit to low paid workers.  Deputy Sherlock seems to have a remarkable capacity for inconsistency in this as in every other matter in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, the Minister referred to the amendment that I introduced yesterday and which was very nearly passed by this House.  That amendment was solely concerned with allowing people whose incomes are so low that they could not avail of the concession this year to avail of it in future years.  It was not adding to the concession. It was simply allowing people on low incomes who could not get any benefit <Col N="1328" /> from it this year to benefit from it in subsequent years, and for the Minister to suggest that I was in some way trying to add to the concession is wrong.  It is not true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  I do not want to delay this debate but it is relevant and appropriate for me to point out that Deputy Bruton refers to costs of £180 million for the Fine Gael amendments and says that £170 million is for VAT on imports and bringing forward corporation profits tax payments.  That is true, but that is the alternative that we as a party put before the people following the fall of Deputy Bruton's budget.  If he is so concerned about those two items he must still be standing by his original proposals to raise that money by VAT on clothing and footwear and the abolition of food subsidies.  This is the man who has spoken about 50 times in three weeks about the lower paid.  How would they have been affected by the imposition of VAT on clothing and footwear and the abolition of food subsidies?  Let the Deputy answer that question.</P>

      <P>I defended those proposals of the January budget during the election campaign and I believe it was a just budget, under which people had the choice of adjusting their expenditure in accordance with the price of the items concerned.  I do not believe that the approach of this Government is an honest one because they are simply piling up problems for next year.  In our January budget we faced the issues squarely and proposed to raise money this year in the best way we could devise.  It happened that the Dáil decided to reject it but I will not apologise to the Minister for Finance or anyone else for that budget.  It was an honest and forthright attempt to face the problems of the country and many people will agree with this assessment when they see the zig-zag approach and the concessions which are typical of the policy of this Government.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> I have listened for some time to Deputy Bruton and I find no sincerity in <Col N="1329" /> any of his arguments.  Deputy Bruton framed a budget in January and if he was sincere about the concessions he is now seeking he could have included them in that budget.  He claims that the January budget was a sincere effort to fix our finances but he had every opportunity to enshrine many of the proposals he now advocates.  Why is he not trying to include by way of amendment the proposals contained in his January budget?  I cannot see any sincerity in his amendments.  If Deputy Bruton were still Minister for Finance I do not believe the concession of £312 would by included.  I am surprised that any Deputy would try to create hardship for PAYE workers but that is what Deputy Bruton is doing.  He would like the provision of £45 million to be deleted.</P>

      <P>We have an extremely bad precedent whereby under a section £45 million of relief is given with no indication whatsoever, many months after the budget, as to where the money will come from.  People would know what the Government were talking about if the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance said that £45 million of relief on PRSI was being given but that as a consequence petrol would by increased by 25p a gallon, or the pint of beer would be increased by 10p, or the 30 per cent VAT rate would be increased by about 7 per cent.  These are the kinds of measures which would be necessary to raise £45 million this year.  Such proposals have not been made and the Minister says he will save £45 million some way or another. Indirect taxation could be increased but the Minister knows how difficult it is to get financial resolutions passed by this House.  The alternative is capital taxation but I do not believe that this Government in any circumstances will move in that direction.  To raise £45 million in 1982 we would have to introduce a £90 million regime for the remainder of this year because six months have already passed.  Anyone who would suggest that the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance or the supporters of Fianna Fáil would countenance such a measure would be living in cloud cuckoo land.  There are only three options, namely, direct taxation, capital taxation or cuts in public expenditure.</P>

Outside this 90-bedroom hotel there were two coaches, one German and one American.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Fitzpatrick that whether it is excise duty or custom duty, post office receipts or any other segments of Exchequer revenue forecasting, they are all down.  Post Office receipts are down by about £10 million, as we know.  The buoyancy of £20 million which was supposed to exist in the budget is now gone out the door. There are no tourists in this country, for all practical purposes, for the summer of 1982.  If one sees a British tourist, one almost stares.  That is the reality of the buoyancy about which we are talking. We are back to indirect taxation, capital taxation or cuts in ordinary public expenditure.  Any Deputy or Minister can say we should cut back in the health services but the health boards are screaming for money.  They are crucified in 1982 because of a very tight financial situation.</P>
      <P>My last point relates to cut-backs in local authority services or education services or, indeed, in the services related to agriculture.  That is Deputy Bruton's fundamental objection, which I support, in relation to the £45 million.  I have been belted over the head and criticised unmercifully at trade union conferences when I pointed out the reality of the situation and regarded almost as reactionary in saying if £45 million relief is to be obtained, it must be got from somewhere else.  One had better find it in the context of the current budget, because next year's budget will be even worse as regards finding the money.  I am quite certain that my view is shared widely by many Deputies on the Government benches and I make no apology for raising these issues here again this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have to leave it in the Minister's hands, because we will not be back here after Friday week.  It will be the longest summer recess in the history of the Dáil because I doubt if we will be back before 25 or 28 October.  After that, <Col N="1332" /> it is a short run until Christmas and then the end of this financial year.  In the interim period, since the Minister cannot pass any Financial Resolution between next Friday week and the end of October &mdash; and if he tried to do so we are in such a totally unstable situation that he would not get it through the House, although he might be surprised at who would vote for him again &mdash; in that situation, he is back to cuts in public expenditure.  I do not see these coming, either.  At the end of January 1983, I can see this House facing a budget which will be even more untenable than the one which is in such a tattered state this morning.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The section modifies the restrictions of the amount of relief available in respect of life assurance policies so that any excess premium due to health considerations which an individual is required to pay on a policy of life assurance will not be subject to certain restrictions imposed by section 152.  Only the normal premium on the policy will be subject to these restrictions.  The current limits are set out in section 152 of the Income Tax Act of 1967 which imposes restrictions on the amount of relief available under sections 143 and 151 of the Act in respect of premiums payable on life assurance policies.  The aggregate of the premiums on which relief may be granted is restricted to the lesser of either one-sixth of total income, or £2,000 in the case of a married person or £1,000 in the case of a single person.  The qualifying premium on any particular policy is restricted to 7 per cent of the capital sum payable on death.  This latter restriction is modified in cases where special terms apply on health grounds.  In those areas <Col N="1335" /> the 7 per cent restriction is to be calculated not on the sum assured but on the capital sum that would be payable if these special terms did not apply.  The present section continues this policy by enabling relief to be claimed on premiums in excess of the existing limits where the excess is attributable to the health record of the assured person.  That is the information I have on that.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 44 in the name of Deputy John Bruton. Amendments Nos 45 and 46 are consequential.  By agreement amendments Nos 45 and 46 may be discussed with No. 44.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 44.</P>
      <P>In page 22, subsection (2), line 2, after &ldquo;1982-83&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(but subject to subsection (9)* of this section)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to avoid retrospection in regard to the application of the provisions of this section. It appears that the provisions of the section will come into operation from 5 April this year.  As we know, the section is a new one not known to the public or the people involved until the date of publication of the Finance Bill.  Therefore in effect this new form of taxation on benefits in kind in the form of preferential loans is, to the extent that it is to apply from a date prior to the publication of <Col N="1336" /> the Finance Bill, retrospective legislation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to deem the provisions of the section not to come into operation until 2 June 1982, which was the first date of publication of the section in the Bill.  The Minister might argue that one has got to take a year as a whole and that one cannot say that a restriction applies for part of a year only to what is deemed to be income.  I do not believe that is so.  The possibility exists &mdash; indeed it is provided for in section 5 in regard to allowances for rent &mdash; for the apportionment of rent as between different years.  It should be possible also to apportion benefits in kind as to part of a year and therefore part of the benefit only would be taxed in that given year. In other words, if the provisions of the section do not come into effect until 2 June one could allow no taxation in respect of one-sixth of the year, that is in respect of the months of April and May, in regard to which no notice was given of the introduction of this new form of taxation. This would mean that one would be deemed to have received five-sixths only of the full benefit in 1982-83, the one-sixth being the benefit received during that portion of this year when this proposal had not been announced.</P>
    <P>I shall be asking the Minister also, on the section, if he will take a look at the problem &mdash; quite apart from this question of the date of operation &mdash; of people who, for instance, last year entered into certain commitments in regard to purchasing a house, say, of a certain size on the assumption that they would get a loan at a particular interest rate and now find that the tax rules have changed and that the resultant effective interest rate will be higher.  Could something not be done to relieve these people in some way in regard to the change that has been made in their conditions, given that they entered into commitments?  I should like the Minister to deal with that.  If people have made arrangements on the basis of certain assumptions they must be prepared always to accept the fact that those assumptions may change.  I will not be pressing the Minister hard on that matter but I should like him at least to advert to <Col N="1337" /> it and explain how he sees this affecting people.  I would feel strongly that the amendment I am now proposing, which is more clearly justifiable in that it provides that there shall not be retrospective legislation, should be considered by the Minister.  Naturally, I would be happy if he and his advisers were to look at the drafting of it to ascertain whether it is the most appropriate method of drafting.  I feel it is wrong that there should be any retrospective taxation involved in this or any other section of a Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear from these amendments whether the changes sought are in respect of loans made on or after 2 June 1982 or in respect of interest paid or payable after that date.  It is assumed that the amendments refer to the interest paid or payable after 2 June 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Acceptance of the amendments would give rise to an immediate technical problem as banks and other financial institutions normally issue interest certificates for a full year and not for part of a year.  Furthermore, some loans carry interest accruing on a dayto-day basis while others have set payment dates of equal amounts.  Therefore, it is not always possible, even for the lending agency concerned, to say in respect of any particular payment what is the interest content.  As the Deputy has said, these amendments seek to postpone the implementation of the provisions of the section to 2 June instead of 6 April. I do not think there is any justification for making this change since it is the intention of the Government to look into this matter of preferential loans in the context of this Finance Bill, which was announced in my statement on 25 March last, and to which I think I referred earlier on the Financial Resolutions.  It is normal for changes announced in the budget to come into effect on the following 6 April. For that reason I must reject the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second point the Deputy raised, the case of those people who took out <Col N="1338" /> loans last year and who find now because of taxation changes that their mortgage or interest repayments are higher.  I do not think that is a particular issue.  All I know is that on my house mortgage the interest keeps changing a couple of times a year.  There is absolutely no way in which one can be compensated for that. One has to live with those kinds of situations.</P>

The Minister will appreciate that this is a point that has been made to me by a number of organisations representing workers affected. Therefore I think it right that I should at least raise it with the Minister.</P>
      <P>There is a point that has been raised with me by the Confederation of Irish Industry.  If I may I should like to read their observation to the House.  Sorry, I suppose we had better move to the section first.  Therefore, I will withdraw that amendment and move on to the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall read the observation that has been made by the Confederation of Irish Industry, which states:</P>
      <P>Section 8(4) states that the amount of notional interest on preferential loans which is to be treated as income is also to be treated as interest paid for certain purposes of relief from tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Confederation believes that the restrictions on the relief on tax will include relief for investment in companies and the Confederation believes that this type of restriction is undesirable. The Confederation recommends <Col N="1339" /> that section 8 (4) should be amended so that an amount of interest equal to the notional amount assessed under section 8 (2) or 8 (3) is deemed to have been paid for all purposes of relief from tax.  The Confederation is also concerned about the principle of applying onerous conditions to existing loans. An employee may, for example, have received a preferential loan many years ago.</P>
    <P>The first point I want to make is in relation to the quotation I have given from a submission made to me and I believe also to the Minister from the Confederation of Irish Industry so that the Minister has notice of this observation.  I would be grateful if he could let me have his views on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy some information I have which may give some reply to the points he has raised. The section is intended to counter large-scale abuses, particularly in the case of those in the higher income group, whereby benefits by means of preferential loans are given instead of increases in salary.  However, as I said in the course of the Second Stage:</P>
      <P>ordinary employees with a preferential loan will be largely unaffected by these changes.  For example, the new arrangements will not increase the income tax for a married with a preferential housing loan of up to £40,000.</P>
      <P>It is one thing to give the relief to an individual who borrows for the purpose of purchasing his home or his motor car, but it would not make sense for the State to subsidise by means of tax relief the investment by an individual in let property from which he would receive rental income or to buy in to a company where that investment is affected by means of a preferential loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1340" /> It is also not seen how the provisions of section 34 of the Finance Act, 1974, that is relief to individuals on loans applied in acquiring interest in companies, could apply to the use of a preferential loan obtained by an individual to provide capital for that company by the purchase of the company's shares.  Section 34 was intended to facilitate the injection of fresh outside capital into an under-capitalised company and it is not clear how the individual in question could obtain a preferential loan for this purpose unless from the company in which he proposes to acquire the interest.</P>
    <P>The situations outlined appear to be highly artificial and ordinary employees are unlikely to be involved.  There would be little merit in providing a tax concession on a preferential loan used for the purpose of enabling a person to become a landlord.  If any actual cases are brought to my attention we will consider them with a view to the introduction next year of any necessary amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is really an attack on the perks in society and to that extent it is welcome because in this day and age, when the pressure on the State's finances is so enormous and when the tensions in society are getting to a very dangerous stage, the tensions between people in the same employment with different perks and what some people perceive as undue perks which some employees have over others, we could not really continue for much longer allowing some people to have loans at 5 per cent while the rest of us have to pay 18 per cent or 19 per cent for our loans.  Some people could argue that if you work for a particular institution you are entitled to get some benefit from working for that institution.  I believe in times of tremendous growth that kind of incentive might be justified, but in the present atmosphere and tensions in employment and in relation to income and standards of living it would not be justifiable to continue any longer allowing preferential loans to people in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We tend to think of banks and insurance companies only in relation to this and that those are only the people who <Col N="1341" /> after a few years in employment can get a preferential loan.  But there are many private companies in the country, small family companies, partnerships and so on, where all those preferential loans have been obtained for a long time.  We have become a sort of perk-laden society and this has to be tackled very courageously in the present climate.  I would like to say to the people who feel they are hard done by this, who perhaps a few years ago took out loans at 5 per cent and suddenly find they have to pay an extra £15 or £16 a week, that even though the section is putting in the figure of 12 per cent it is still a very good bargain in relation to present day prices.  There are some people who would argue that it should be brought right up to the commercial rate the rest of us have to pay.  In fairness, I believe the suddeness of the jump will play havoc with the budgets of the people who got those preferential loans many years ago and it will throw their day to day budgets into turmoil.  I suppose, therefore, a more reasonable figure had to be picked rather than going for the full commercial rate.</P>
    <P>Many of my constituents have approached me on this and have pointed out how terribly aggrieved they are that they suddenly find they have this extra bill which they had not planned for.  I want to say to them that 12 per cent is a fairly good deal.  As time goes by and if the tensions in society increase because of the standard of living which we all find difficult to maintain, never mind improve, we will have to look at other areas.  I believe there are many areas, such as the travel world, in which the provision of loans and all those other perks are tucked away.  I am not advocating a large scale attack on them.  When we consider the difficulty there is in running the State finances and the tensions in society, justice has to be seen to be done. If you are living next door to a person who has a loan at 5 per cent and you are put to the pin of your collar to meet an 18 per cent or a 19 per cent loan, it is not unreasonable that you would feel very aggrieved about that.  I have to ask those people, admitting that it is an imposition on them, it is difficult for them and it is <Col N="1342" /> suddenly throwing into turmoil their domestic budgets, to understand that in the interest of trying to get some type of tax equity into society this has to be done. At 12 per cent it is still a very good bargain.</P>

      <P>I have three questions to put to the Minister.  Will the Minister give an indication of the number of persons involved who have benefited under this provision so far?  Will the Minister tell the House the amount of revenue to accrue to the State in a full year as a result of the change and if I am correct in assuming that employees of certain State bodies, such as Irish Life, the Central Bank, ACC and ICC are in receipt of preferential loans in the course of their employment?  It would be good if the Minister could tell the House the sectoral numbers involved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we pass from this section I should like to give Deputy Bruton some information on a matter he raised in regard to a previous section.  It is mainly concerned with a person who has two employments.  I will give the Deputy an example.  In employment A he has £800 and he pays PRSI at the higher rate while in employment B he also has £800 but does not pay the higher rate of PRSI. That is the type of individual we are talking about.  If the £600 was given first against employment A only £200 of the <Col N="1343" /> £312 PRSI deduction would be given and the balance would not be set against employment B because PRSI was not paid on those emoluments at the higher rate.  What happens is that the £312 is first put against the emoluments of employment A and only £488 of the £600 PAYE allowance is required to cover the remainder of the emoluments and the balance of the £600 PAYE allowance, £112, can be set against employment B. The taxpayer does not lose any part of the £312 or the £600.  It is to help the taxpayer.  I apologise that I did not have the actual details earlier.</P>

      <P>This section continues for a further year the relief in respect of the labour cost element of expenditure by householders on the maintenance. repair or improvement of their residence. The scheme was introduced for 1979-80 on a temporary basis but was continued for 1980-81 and 1981-82.  The limits on such expenditure for purposes of relief remains at £450 for single persons and £900 for a married couple.  This is simply a question of extending the existing scheme that has been in operation since 1979.</P>

Is the Minister aware of suggestions that if one has a choice of two contractors, one of whom is operating under the scheme and the other is not, the price of the contractor in the scheme is higher to the extent of the allowance than the contractor who is not in the scheme.  That suggests many possibilities none of which is very reputable. Originally the section was justified, among other things, on the grounds that it would help to catch builders who were not declaring their income from small residential jobs for tax purposes.  Any contractors who were to be brought into the net by that means have been brought in by now and I imagine that no other people will be brought in unless the Minister can indicate that in the last year or so there has been a significant number of new registrations for the purpose of the section.  If that is the case then the section is still doing valuable work in the matter of detecting tax evasion.  I would be glad if the Minister would comment on those points.</P>

I agree with what the Deputy has <Col N="1345" /> said.  I had experience of cases where two or three people sought prices for work on houses and the fully authorised certified contractor was higher than the others.  It is obvious from the figures I have given that some progress has been made.

      <P>I welcome this section. It is one of the items contained in the six-point plan for agriculture published by Fine Gael in December 1980.  At that time agriculture was in a deep depression, a depression which has only slightly relieved in recent times.  The problem then and now is in relation to stock numbers and the fact that less milk and beef was produced.  One method we proposed to alleviate that situation was to give 110 per cent stock relief in respect of cattle numbers so that farmers would be encouraged to increase stock numbers.  I am glad the Minister carried this proposal through, which we made in December 1980, and incorporated it in the March budget.</P>

The portion of rates which is not being allowed as a credit will be allowed in the normal way as a deduction in computing farming profits.</P>

      <P>Regrettably, when one is in Opposition one can only make provision for tax relief.  It is an anomalous situation.  One cannot impose charges as such.  Under the current budget proposals, rates credit under which farmers may credit rates paid in the previous year against current income tax liability will be reduced by 50 per cent in the year 1982-83 and abolished altogether the following year.  I am of the view that even that provision should not have been granted by way of concession.  The main point I am making is that in 1981 the PAYE sector paid 17.5 per cent tax as a percentage of income whereas the farming sector paid only 1.7 per cent. That is of considerable concern in a community <Col N="1347" /> where we do not have a balanced tax structure.  Hopefully, the committee on taxation will highlight this.  There is no doubt that of the 160,000 full-time farmers about 30,000 of them could well afford to pay substantial income tax. They should be obliged to pay the same form of measure as the PAYE wage and salary-earner.  It is appropriate that we should see farming as a business enterprise and allow substantial deductions in the normal process of an enterprise; but, in the heel of the hunt, there must be some liability.  The major political parties, largely because they are dependent on segments of farming support, are very reluctant, and have been subjected to a great deal of internal pressure, not to do what they in justice feel should be done.</P>
      <P>I come from a farming background in North Cork and have no antagonism whatsoever towards farmers.  Most of my relatives are small and medium-sized farmers.  Some of them regard PAYE as a peculiar Dublin joke in which I am involved.  It is often assumed that politicians who speak strongly about farmer taxation are some kind of peculiar concrete urban breed always travelling into the country on forays to capture individual farmers and make them pay tax.  This is not so.  There are some 30,000 farmers who should be paying substantial taxation on incomes earned from their enterprises. At present they pay very little. This relief will be abolished altogether in 1983-84.  However, the 50 per cent concession should never have been introduced. We have a major change now which will have to be considered.  I strongly wish to make that viewpoint known.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton has already referred to the fact that these sections are the carry-over effects of implementing various decisions by successive Governments to assist the farming community when farming income declined, which nobody has ever denied. For two to three years farming income declined substantially and it is only now that it is beginning to turn around.  These concessions are a carry-over as measures <Col N="1348" /> of assistance to help farmers.  In relation to rates, the farming community have always said that they have no hesitation in admitting and accepting that they should pay their fair share of tax and they have always claimed that rates are a form of double taxation.  Successive Governments through the years have in one way or another, depending on valuation, abolished rates and both sides of the House have agreed that next year rates will be abolished completely and then an income taxation system can become fully operational for farmers.  These various sections are carry-over measures legislating for measures already introduced to assist farmers through a difficult time. We all hope, in the interests not only of the farming community but of the economy as a whole, that the corner has been turned and that we will continue to make progress in the agricultural sector, because we will be depending on them for increased exports and output and increased help for the balance of payments as well as for the economy generally.</P>

      <P>On farm taxation, it is probably recognised by the farming community that unreasonable opposition to reasonable proposals for farm taxation in the end leads to disproportionate and unjust taxes being introduced when counter-pressures are put on the Government by other sectors.  The best example of this is the resource tax which was an unjust tax introduced chiefly because of the farmers' objection to any other proposals brought forward previously by the Government was so comprehensive that in the end the Government acted in panic in an unjust fashion.  It is in the interests of the farming community as a whole that there be a stable and fair system of farm taxation under which the farming community will be seen to be paying what they agree they should pay, their fair share, and that the tax code applying to them will not be subject to change every year as a result of pressure either from within agriculture for less taxation or without agriculture for more taxation on agriculture.  If agriculture is to develop it needs a stable system of farm taxation <Col N="1349" /> which is accepted as reasonable by everyone, including the farmer, and which does not change every year, thereby inhibiting development.  I hope that we are moving towards such a system.  We will have to await the Government's decisions on the Commission of Taxation to see what such a system will be, but the aim should be having what is fair, seen to be fair and stable, in other words that it does not change every year from one system to another under political pressure. Otherwise it will not provide a framework for investment.</P>

      <P>One is very well aware of the problems encountered by the farming community and at present it is very depressing to see young people who have invested and borrowed money to improve their holdings going to the wall every other day.  Also a greater number of small farmers are applying for unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>However, a number of farmers could and should be paying tax under the system and the reason they are not perhaps is that the Government and former Governments have not been able to introduce a taxation system which would be fair and equitable for farming because there has been no policy for agriculture. Many farmers who have in excess of 100 acres of land have not been paying tax over the past years.  They have been lodging all their income in the bank while agricultural workers on the same land have paid tax because their earnings were known to the Revenue Commissioners. This year farm income will rise by 25 per cent and this when the total amount of rates paid by a farmer is to be allowed only as a deduction in computing taxable profits and not as a credit or instalment of the total tax bill payable.  Nobody accepts for one moment that people who cannot afford to pay should be paying tax, but when people with 400, 500, 600 acres of land refuse to pay rates and are not paying their proper share of tax, that is wrong and must be rejected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support some of Deputy Sherlock's observations in this area.  I understand that the Minister cannot <Col N="1350" /> adopt a certain attitude to any one sector of society and he must endeavour to be fair and broadminded in his attitude and approach and to encourage and stimulate all sectors of our economy to be productive and to create as much employment as possible.  The farmers have had the best of all worlds for too long and they see themselves as being somewhat apart from society and having a right to do as they wish with their land.  The Constitution enshrines the right to private property and so on, but the day is gone when the farmers can have the best of both worlds.  They come to the Minister in lobbies with submissions looking for help, and if the Minister is as responsive to them as he is in this Bill before the House, they have an obligation to have some public accountability.  The farm as a unit cannot be seen in isolation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the farm be seen as not just land to sit on and have and acquire.  Deputy Bruton yesterday used the term in the House, &ldquo;a man of straw&rdquo;. Where I come from in Limerick the farmers consider a man of straw to be a man of no property.  One day I heard two farmers speaking in a public house and one of them praised another man.  However, the second farmer had not much time for the man referred to who was a neighbour of theirs.  &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I do not like him.  He is only a man of straw, he has no land.&rdquo;  It is wrong to draw that type of distinction.  One man is as good as another.  The attitude of tuppence-ha'penny looking down on tuppence is rife in the farming community, but the Minister here cannot subscribe to that philosophy.  If farming can be productive in countries like Holland with a population of 14 million, or in Denmark, there is no reason why farming cannot be efficient here.  There is no point in molly-coddling farmers as we have done in the past.  In modern society they must pull their weight and help in finding the solutions that the Minister is seeking to such problems as employment in food processing and production.  There is no reason why farming here cannot be productive and efficient, but our farming must surely be the most inefficient in Europe.  We have ladled out money to <Col N="1351" /> farmers for decades and they must show some return for it.  Deputy Sherlock is right in saying that the greatest opposition the ordinary PAYE workers have to farmers is the farmers' point-blank refusal to pay any form of taxation whatsoever when the going was good, and the going was very good and lucrative for the farming community up to about two years ago, and they were rolling in wealth then. In my part of the country, the Golden Vale of Limerick and Tipperary, they have the most lush and fertile pastures in Europe and probably as good as any in the world, and the people there refuse in a steadfast way to countenance even the idea of paying taxation.  That got people's backs up. It got into the noses of most working people.  The farmers who were rolling in wealth then had more wealth than culture. They did not know what to do with their money.  They bought second and third cars and more land, but the land they bought was not all used for productive purposes.  There was an element of speculation in the buying of farming land. A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, if you or I become involved in buying land we must take the consequences for that.  Nobody will bail you or me out if we get into financial difficulties.  Some of the speculation by farmers was not wise and it was done for greedy and selfish motives.  Now they come crying crocodile tears depending on the Minister and the people to bail them out of the difficulties they are in.</P>
    <P>Accountability and responsibility must exist in farming.  If the farmers produce efficiently they will help all sectors of society.  The day has gone forever when farmers can be seen in isolation from the problems of society.  I do not come here to be a dog in the manger.  I prefaced my remarks by saying that I understand the Minister has a global responsibility for all sectors, including farmers, but let the farmers wake up.  They must realise that the day is gone when they can exploit people, when they can avoid paying their fair share of taxation.  They must respond, like everybody else, to the problems and needs of society.  They cannot divorce themselves from these problems as they did all too often in the past. <Col N="1352" /> Above all, they have responsibility to be productive and efficient in order to meet some of the problems we are faced with today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; was unjust.  It is now being abolished by them.  I do not wish to take away from that.  I merely indicate that I believe the resource tax was ill-conceived.  It was not a resource tax as recommended by the National Economic and Social Council which would have been related to genuine productive capacity.  It was a discriminatory tax based on the archaic Griffith valuation system drawn up in the 1850s when farmers were to be asked to pay this tax if their valuation &mdash; in some cases quite artificially &mdash; was above £70 regardless of whether they were making any income on the farm.  This taxation would have been payable whether an income was being made or not.  We do not, as I said in regard to an earlier section, believe that there should be resistance by the farming community, as I must say there has been in the late seventies to an unreasonable extent to reasonable proposals for the taxation of the farming community. Unfortunately, if resistance is carried to an unreasonable extent it often leads to pressure on the Government from other sources which are equally unreasonable and it leads to unreasonable proposals such as the resource tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that this tax which we undertook to abolish should be abolished.  I look forward to a time when agricultural conditions will have improved, as I hope they will in the next two or three years, when farming will, through a fair system of taxation, be able to pay a much more substantial sum towards the overall running of the State.  It is not acceptable that <Col N="1354" /> farming should not pay a reasonable and proportionate contribution.  I hope such a system will come into being and that agriculture will be of sufficient strength as to be able to pay such an amount of taxation.  I am confident that taxes such as this particular type of resource tax, which was a Griffith valuation tax and not a resource tax, will have no place in a fair system of farm taxation.</P>

      <P>Our party proposed the abolition of this resource tax and I am pleased to find this provision in the Bill now before us.  This resource tax and the other unfair tax, the 2 per cent levy, have caused considerable fear in the farming community.  The Government are correct in abolishing this particular resource tax. I think it is accepted on all sides of the House that the farming community are experiencing great difficulty at present. They have not experienced such difficulty for many years.  This small gesture, on the part of the Government prompted I hope by our party, while small is a very welcome step.  I heard Deputy Sherlock say that he is opposing the section but I think anybody representing a rural constituency at present must understand and appreciate how bad the farming situation is.  In my view it is unprecedented.</P>
      <P>Many farmers find themselves with huge commitments to banks and financial institutions.  This must be appreciated.  A resource tax of this nature is an added burden on the farming community which, with the rampant inflation from which the country is suffering they are unable to meet.  The whole concept of the tax was totally unfair and unjust.  There was no question of whether a person was able to pay it or not; he was just told to pay and had to pay.  Some farmers are in a desperate financial situation which they will never get out of in their lifetime.  I hope the Minister will arrange for the refund of this resource tax to many of these farmers who need the money and I urge that the refunds be made as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We oppose the handing back of this tax to farmers.  We believe it is unprecedented that the Dáil should <Col N="1355" /> agree to hand back tax levied by this House and agreed to by the House.  The majority of farmers refused to pay it.  The miserly amount collected is now to be handed back and in my view that is a disgrace.</P>
      <P>We had a lot of whingeing and crying here over the past few months from the Fine Gael benches about the relief given to people paying very high rates of PRSI. There is no way in which PAYE workers can escape when a tax is levied by this House.  Nobody will come back next year and say: &ldquo;We feel it was a bit too rough on them and we will give back half or all of what we got from them last year.&rdquo; While the resource tax may have leaned somewhat heavily on some farmers, they can recoup that tax by utilising the land they have.  The amount of land not being utilised is a disgrace.  The resource tax could be used as an incentive to ensure that the land is utilised.</P>
      <P>The whole concept of giving back tax to a sector of society that pay something in the region of 1 per cent of all income tax collected in the State is to be deplored especially when one realises that the people who proposed this in the first place, though Fianna Fáil are equally to blame, proposed taxing shoes and clothing as well as social welfare payments. These were the people who at the same time decided to hand back money to farmers who were legally and properly liable to pay the tax concerned but who refused to do so and because they refused to pay it was decided to scrap the tax. That was a ridiculous decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this section. In 1978 within a year of coming to power, the Jack Lynch-led Fianna Fáil Government had concluded that the most suitable form of agricultural taxation should take the form of a resource tax. This was clearly indicated in their Green Paper of June 1978 entitled, &ldquo;Development for Full Employment.  This argument was developed further in the January 1979 Government White Paper entitled, &ldquo;Programme for National Development 1978-1981.&rdquo;  It was stated in that programme that, and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> The Government see taxation in the agricultural sector, as in other sectors, not only as a means of raising Exchequer revenue but as a positive instrument for the development of the sector. It was in this context that the Green Paper put forward the option of a resource tax, an instrument which has many development advantages. However, farmers' representatives, in their submissions on the Green Paper, stated their opposition to such a tax. ...</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil programme went on to state:</P>
    <P>Much Irish land is under-used.  A resource tax acts as an incentive either to use available land effectively or to release it to those willing to use it; furthermore, such a tax, since its marginal rate on additional income is zero, does not constitute a disincentive to higher output.  These advantages have been recognised by the NESC in their Report on Policies for Agricultural and Rural Development (No. 42).  The introduction of a resource tax was also recommended by the Inter-Departmental Committee on Land Structure Reform which reported in May 1978. The Government are in favour of a resource tax in principle.  They recognise that local authority rates on land are to a large degree a resource tax but that the present reliefs from rates provided through the Agricultural Grant weakened the effectiveness of rates as one of the means of ensuring proper use of our land resources...</P>
    <P>In line with this and in response to the trade union campaign for a fair taxation system, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, issued a statement on April 24, 1979 detailing the Government's farm tax package for 1980-81.  The resource tax part of this package could only be regarded as a first step.  Of about 120,000 full-time farmers only 14,000 were expected to pay this resource tax &mdash; those on holdings of £70 rateable valuation or more or, in other words, on holdings roughly exceeding 140 acres. The tax was to be levied at a rate of £3.50 <Col N="1357" /> per pound rateable valuation and was to bring in about £7 million per year or an average of £500 per year per farm in respect of the minority of 14,000 big farmers who would be liable to pay it.</P>
    <P>Before the year was out Deputy Haughey had become Taoiseach and subsequently there was a Cabinet reshuffle. On budget day 27 February 1980, the new Minister for Finance, Deputy O'Kennedy, did indeed introduce a resource tax along those lines for 1980-81. A week later, however, the Taoiseach made it clear that he intended disowning the Government's commitments in this regard.  On 5 March 1980 he told the Dáil that his Government looked on resource tax as a short-term expedient, adding that it was not the Government's intention that this should be a permanent feature of the system.  This was tantamount to tearing up the previous year's Government White Paper.  On budget day one year later, January 28 1981, another Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance, Deputy Fitzgerald, confirmed this Fianna Fáil somersault when he told the Dáil that the Government decided earlier that the resource tax would be discontinued after one year and that he was confirming that decision.  He went on to say that the consequent saving to the farming community would be more than £6 million a year on the basis of the tax provisions introduced in the previous year.  He added that resource tax due in the previous year but not paid remained due and would have to be collected during the course of the year.  The 1981 Fianna Fáil election Manifesto boasted of the abolition of resource tax and by implication the tearing up of the Lynch Green and White Papers of 1978-79.  Obviously, Fine Gael acquiesced in this abolition by virtue of their complete silence of the issue in their 1981 election Manifesto.  But this silence meant also that so far as the electorate as a whole were concerned there was no Fine Gael attempt to outbid Fianna Fáil on this issue by promising that the resource tax due in 1980 would not be collected or that the amount which had been collected so far would be returned to the farmers.  Accordingly, when the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> on May 30, 1981, <Col N="1358" /> ran a feature on Fine Gael's farming manifesto, they did not find it possible to hold out any promises regarding the 1980 resource tax.  Within a week, however, Fine Gael campaigners for the farming vote held out a promise which had no place in the manifesto that they had seen fit to put before the people as a whole. On June 6, the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> reported:</P>
    <P>On the farming taxation issue, Garret FitzGerald has now made very clear commitments which he repeated for the Farmers' Journal....</P>
    <P>They went on to say that:</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has also pledged to pay back resource tax already paid and cancel existing bills for it.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, Fine Gael did not win the election outright.  While promises to the farmers which had been written into their election manifesto did find their way into the Coalition Government programme, this extra nod-and-wink understanding did not.  The Coalition document, &ldquo;Programme for Government 1981-1986&rdquo;, accordingly allowed no scope for any behind-the-scenes understanding between Fine Gael and farmers that the resource tax due for 1980 would be given back to the farmers.  When the Labour Party conference endorsed the Coalition arrangement, they certainly did not endorse what remained excluded from the Government programme.  Still less did the Dáil when it endorsed Deputy FitzGerald for Taoiseach on June 30 last year.  Therefore, it is not surprising that when the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> on July 4 1981 ran its first feature on the new Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dukes, and quoted from what he had to say on Government policy regarding farm taxation, not a single word was said about handing back the 1980 resource tax. More significantly still, when the new Minister spoke during the budget debate on July 22 last year he did not make any mention of any such intention.  However, three weeks after the Dáil had risen for the summer recess the behind-the-scenes deal came out into the open.</P>
    <P>In its issue of August 14 1981 the <i>Irish <Col N="1359" /> Independent</i> carried a front page report which revealed, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The Government is to take the unprecedented step of returning about £700,000 to farmers, collected under the controversial Resource Tax which operated for 1980 only.  And rates on agricultural land are to be finally abolished from next year's budget &mdash; a move which will cost the Government £35 million in 1982 in compensation to local authorities.  The original target for revenue for Resource Tax introduced in January 1980, by the Fianna Fáil Government, was £7 million in the first year....  Most refused point-blank to pay it...</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Independent</i> incorrectly stated that the refund had formed part of the Fine Gael election manifesto as did the <i>Irish Farmer's Journal</i> in its report on August 22, 1981, ignoring the fact that they could find no such promise in reporting on the manifesto on May 30.  In the issue of August 22, that paper reported:</P>
    <P>The Government is to refund farmers the £700,000 collected under the controversial Resource Tax.  This announcement was made by the Minister for Agriculture last week... Alan Dukes described the refund as a significant step, as the tax had been legally collected... It was payable by about 14,000 farmers, but was fully resisted ... It was implemented for the year 1980 but was discontinued by the farmer Taoiseach...</P>
    <P>That is a misprint in the <i>Irish Farmer's Journal</i>; perhaps a Freudian slip&mdash;</P>
    <P>... Charles Haughey, when he came to power.  It will probably be late in 1981 before the refunds are made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes had no mandate for such a retrograde step.  The Fine Gael Party did not include such a promise in the manifesto which they saw fit to place before the electorate as a whole.  Fine Gael and Labour included no such promise in the Coalition programme which they placed before the Special Conference of the Labour Party.  The Coalition <Col N="1360" /> Government never even gave a hint of any such promise in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that only a small minority of the richer farmers were liable for the resource tax in the first place.  It is true that the majority of farmers had a bad year in 1980.  The average family income per full-time farmer was £3,685.  There are about 120,000 full-time farmers in this State.  Many did better than average.  For example, 31,000 had an income in excess of £5,000 in that year. More significantly still, 15,000 full-time farmers had a family income per farm in excess of £8,000 for 1980.  These figures are given in the Farm Management Survey, 1980, and are available to every Deputy.  It is this category of better-off farmer for whom the resource tax was intended.  The minority of 14,000 farmers liable for resource tax were expected to contribute only £7 million under it &mdash; in other words, an average of £500 each per year, or £10 per week.  In the event, only £700,000 was collected, or an average of £50 each for the whole year.  This shabby move contained in the Finance Bill is designed to hand back this miserable amount, £700,000, to the better-off or tight-fisted farmers, while workers continue to carry an even heavier burden of taxation measures.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in opposing this section.  To do otherwise would be dishonest, and wrong, and flying in the face of reality.  The reality is that while workers in the PAYE and PRSI sectors are carrying a bigger burden of taxation than ever before in the history of the State, we are now proposing to hand back this miserable sum of £700,000 to people who have creamed off the profits of farming down through the decades.  They paid it for one year at the miserable sum of £10 per week.  Surely that is one of the most ludicrous proposals ever to come before this House in its 60 years history &mdash; to hand them back this money at a time when workers cannot get legitimate refunds or rebates of money which has been stopped incorrectly.  It is very wrong at this time.  The Minister says every amendment will cost more and therefore he is resisting it.  In many cases I suppose he is right.  It is his duty and his job to <Col N="1361" /> resist any attempt to add to public expenditure.  On the other hand, he is now handing back quietly £700,000.  He cannot defend that.  Nor can Fine Gael defend their policy in this regard.  Therefore, I oppose it.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Kemmy had gone into the circumstances he outlined very briefly in his remarks, he would have found a rather different picture from the one he has given.  He gave us a fairly complete outline history of the measure in question, the consideration which led to it in the first place, and the time at which it was adopted.  I would ask him to bear that in mind when we come to finalise our consideration of this measure.</P>
      <P>The point Deputy Kemmy appears to be making, without actually saying it, is that this resource tax is one of the few forms of taxation paid by our farming community.  I would ask him to reflect a little further on what he has been saying. This is not by any means the only form of taxation paid by the farming community. It is not by any means the only form of taxation to which they are subject.  We have an income tax system in operation. This year for a segment of our farming community, we still have the rates system in operation, and I hope we will see the end of it next year.  Contrary to what Deputy Kemmy seems to think, the farming community are like everybody else. They buy all the goods which are subject to indirect taxation.  They are just as much subject to VAT on their family expenditure as anybody else in the community. They pay their share, if you can call it a share, of indirect taxes, excise duties of all kinds, and so on.  There is no way in which it can be said realistically that the farming community escape from the tax net in any way.  That is the first point I want to make, and it should be very clearly understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point I want to make is that the rationale of this resource tax, as indicated by Deputy Kemmy, is a fairly curious one.  The principle underlining it is very simple, and it seems to have a certain air of respectability about it in many quarters.  It says: &ldquo;Here we have people with a productive asset.  In order to make <Col N="1362" /> them use that asset productively, we will impose a tax which has no bearing on and no connection with the use they are making of it, or can make of it, or will make of it, on the principle that the more tax you have to pay the harder you will have to work in order to make enough money to pay the tax and have an income afterwards&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there is any other form of taxation which operates on that principle.  It would be like saying to a PAYE worker: &ldquo;Before you start, we will decide that you will pay £X of income tax.  That will make you work harder, because you will know you will have to meet that bill before you get any income out of the activity you are involved in.&rdquo; I am not sure that there are many people in this House who, if they thought about it very deeply, would be very keen on having in our tax system a range of what you might call coercive taxes to make people be a bit more diligent in their profession, or to hobble people with a tax bill in respect of their profession before they start doing any work.  That is principle contained in this resource tax.</P>
    <P>I know it was enshrined in a Green Paper and further enshrined in a White Paper.  With all due respect to the people who produce Green and White Papers, I am not too sure it is a principle we should be keen to bring into our tax system. I do not see why we should say to somebody who is the owner of a resource which he has to use in order to live; &ldquo;We think we have found a means to ensure that you will work and use this resource economically, and to do that, we will saddle you with tax which you will have to pay whether or not you are able to use that resource.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the fact that a good deal of our land is under-utilised.  I do not think there is any disagreement about that.  Land is not peculiar in that respect.  Many resources are under-utilised. Physical resources in terms of land, machinery, factories, and so on, are under-utilised.  A great many other resources are under-utilised.  Grey matter is one of them.  Many people have a greater capacity for work, for ingenuity, <Col N="1363" /> for innovation, than they bring to bear on their economic activities.</P>
    <P>Does Deputy Kemmy seriously suggest that we should try to find some form of brain tax which would involve us saying to people &ldquo;We think your IQ is a bit higher than the results of your work would indicate and to make sure you use your resources fully and intensively, we are going to tax you&rdquo;?  I do not know what the feeling of the House would be if we were to do that, but I would not expect to see a great deal of enthusiasm for it.  I do not see any reason why we should single out land as a resource particularly suitable for the application of this form of tax.  A possible reason could be that a great many people feel, justifiably, that we could make a lot more income out of land and that we could produce a lot more from the land than we do.  I would not dispute that.  My dispute would be with people who think the application of a tax completely unrelated to earning capacity is the way to do it. Let us look at what is involved in applying a tax of this kind.  There are wider ramifications than just the resource tax.</P>
    <P>A farmer has a given amount of land which was valued at £X under the Griffith Valuation when farming conditions were very different.  The farmer could be a young man in the full bloom of his vigour and health, educated in the skills of farming, involved in farming for a number of years.  He could have built up a stock of capital and could reasonably be expected to use his land intensively.  He could be a man who reads the farming papers, listens to the agricultural advisers, reads the reports of the Agricultural Institute and makes the maximum use of his land. Equally, he could be a person who had a certain amount of land but might not be as intellectually gifted as the first farmer; he might not be physically gifted in the same way, or he might be unable to carry out the amount of work required to fully exploit that land.  He might be one of the many people who are living and working on farms, where in the mid-nineteenth century there was a brisk trade of growing flax which was a remunerative crop but which is no longer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> For that reason, he could find himself saddled with a high valuation on his land which has no bearing on his income earning capacity today, and if he worked all the hours God gave him, he still would not be able to make a substantial living out of that farm.  There are many people like that all over this country, not just in the west or south-west but in the midlands and the south-east as well.  Regardless of the valuation of his land, for one reason or another, he may not be in a position to apply all the latest agricultural techniques and get a high level of production out of land, but because his land has a valuation over the fixed threshold we will tell him he could make a lot more money out of his farm and if an extra tax is imposed he will have another incentive to work harder and increase his income. I am not sure whether Deputy Kemmy really understands the full implications of the measure he is proposing.  We had the same problem in relation to the rating system which was supposed to be the kind of measure which would bring&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate the spirit in which the Chair handed out that reminder.  Sometimes I tend to get carried away.  Deputy Kemmy said I had no mandate for what I said last August.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entering this debate in a spirit of acrimony because I look to people like the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Dukes to find some way forward. It is not good enough for Deputy Dukes to come here and defend the farmers saying I might not understand this question of taxing big farmers.  I do not see how a tax of £10 a week for one year could be a wrong form of taxation, and <Col N="1365" /> it is wrong that this money should be given back to them.  To take £10 a week from them for a year may be a crude tax mechanism, but these people could afford to pay this tax because they are the upper crust of Irish farming.  They deny anybody the right to tax them.  After a great deal of huffing and puffing the Government got £700,000 from them, but to give them back the money is a backward step.</P>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Duke's position representing a constituency in County Kildare, a farming community, and his position as Shadow Minister for Agriculture. It is not good enough that he comes here defending farmers while at the same time ignoring the problems of agriculture and the refusal of our farmers to be efficient. Saying that farmers pay taxes every time they buy shoes and clothing is not good enough.  That logic is flawed.  On the question of taxing intellect in this House, from what I have seen in the short time since I came here and judging by the contributions made, some people would have very little tax to pay.  I would not push that analogy too hard because the least said about some Deputies the better.</P>

      <P>There is no way a farmer with 100 acres of good land cannot pay the resource tax, particularly in view of the fact that farmers have consistently refused to and campaigned against paying tax.  The resource tax, while only being charged on the largest farmers, was the first effort to introduce a land tax to make agriculture a little more progressive and effective.</P>
      <P>We are told night and day that the farming industry is the largest in the country but it is the least effective and efficient.  Until farmers decide to pay their fair share of tax and utilise their resources to create the jobs needed for the 150,000 people unemployed &mdash; a number of the jobs required to take those people off the dole queues could be created if our land was properly utilised &mdash; we will support a resource tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be interesting to know if those people who are opposing the section are proposing also, in respect of those farmers who have not paid the resource tax because they could not afford to do so, that we should proceed to collect it from them.  That should be made clear.  If we are not going to collect the money from those who have not paid the tax, it would be unjust to retain the amount paid by those who met their liability.</P>
      <P>I would point out to those Members who have expressed opposition that farmers pay income tax.  If they make an income they pay tax on it and they have to keep accounts to show that.  If the income tax code does not work properly, if there is a need to restrict the allowances that farmers get, that is the way it should be done.  However, there have been no proposals on that point made by the Deputies who spoke.  I believe that farmers should be taxed on income, just the same as everyone else.  The resource tax principle, based in this instance on the Griffith Valuation, is quite unjust.  As Deputy Dukes clearly pointed out, it has no relationship to actual earning capacity. It should never have been introduced and it was a major mistake to introduce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1367" /> Deputy Kemmy referred to the NESC proposals.  There is a marked difference between their proposals and the actual proposals for the resource tax.  The tax that was introduced was related to the 19th century Griffith Valuation and, as such, it was quite unjust and archaic. There was no connection, except in name, between the resource tax suggested by the NESC in their Report No. 42 and the proposals of the then Government. To defend the proposal of the then Government by referring to Report No. 42 of the NESC is not to make a correct allusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it extraordinary that Deputies are arguing that because someone cannot pay tax it should not be levied.  The PAYE people are not asked if they can afford to pay taxes that are taken out of their wages each week.  As far as I am concerned it is not an argument. A sum of £7 million should have been obtained by way of resource tax in the year 1980-81 but less than £500,000 of that was collected due mainly to pressure from the IFA.  The people who want the abolition of the resource tax not only want to write off the fact that farmers did not pay their due share of tax but they want to give back the few pounds that was collected, and legally collected.</P>

      <P>There is far too much of this kind of argument and it does not help <Col N="1368" /> anyone.  The build up of rivalries and divisions between the community is not good and it is a pity that debate on this section has gone along those lines.  The House should consider the introduction of this tax.  Originally there was a 2 per cent levy proposed on agricultural produce but everyone will agree this led to an enormous amount of confrontation between the farming community and the then Government.  There was a watering down of the levy, there was further discussions and eventually it was accepted that it was unwise to introduce the levy. There was then the suggestion of a resource tax but there was a strong farmer opposition to it.  Some people have paid the tax but others have not done so.</P>
      <P>It is not generally recognised that the agricultural community is going through the most difficult period they have ever experienced and there should be no mistake about that.  I an very concerned at what has happened.  Years ago people talked about raffling calves and playing games of cards for calves.  The situation in rural Ireland at the moment is that farmers are putting their farms up for raffle.  They cannot afford to purchase land.  They are afraid to go near a bank, the ACC or any other financial institution because they will be asked to pay interest rates of 20 per cent on any money they borrow.  People do not realise the seriousness of the situation.  A farmer will not put his farm up for raffle if he thinks he can sell it on the market but this is happening in my constituency.  It is a sad situation for Irishmen that this should happen in our country.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the resource tax was a monumental blunder.  Personally I have reservations about the refunding of tax but because of the initial blunder in introducing the tax and the serious situation of Irish agriculture I am in favour of repaying the resource tax to farmers who have paid it.  Farmers have been hit by our inflation rate which has been running at 18 per cent to 21 per cent for the past few years.  Farmers were granted increases by Brussels after long delays but the rate of inflation was much higher and they were not able to bridge the gap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1369" /> Deputy De Rossa mentioned that a £70 valuation means a farm of 100 acres.  I accept that valuations vary and perhaps that is the case in some areas, but there are other areas in which a £70 valuation means that one could have a 65-acre farm.  There has been a lot of talk about farmers speculating in land purchases.  I do not doubt that some farmers did speculate, but let it be fully understood that so many farmers invested in the building of livestock units, slatted sheds, silage pits and so on, at 10 or 12 per cent and are now paying 20 per cent, that they will never get out of the debts they have incurred because of the ever spiralling interest rates.  It was a monumental blunder to bring in resource tax.  At this stage it should be repaid and the memory forgotten.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>These arguments contribute nothing to getting tax equity.  We are told by Deputy Bruton, Deputy Enright and Deputy Dukes that this is not a suitable form of taxation.  I never heard farmers say that any kind of taxation was suitable for them.  They claim that income tax, notional taxation or resource tax is suitable for PAYE workers but not for them.  To say that the resource tax was a mixture of taxes, one envisaged by the NESC and the other one based on Griffith valuations made over 100 years ago, is not helpful.  For better or worse both Governments agreed with resource taxation and hundreds of thousands of pounds were collected.  Now they say this was a mistake and they want to hand the money back to wealthy farmers who merely paid £10 per week in taxation for one year. That is typical Irish logic.  In any other <Col N="1370" /> country they would go after tax evaders and make them pay the same as everybody else.  The £700,000 is merely a drop in the ocean in terms of the whole financial bill but it will have a very bad psychological effect on the PAYE sector. Giving back this money is like bringing coals to Newcastle or throwing apples into an orchard.</P>
      <P>The arguments I heard today have reinforced my determination to oppose the section.  People outside the House will despair of parliamentary democracy when they hear that £700,000 is going to be handed back to wealthy farmers.  The people who are putting that idea forward should be ashamed of themselves.  The dire consequences of selling farms has also been mentioned.  What happened to the millions of people who left this country in the past 50 or 60 years who had no farms to sell?  The worst that can happen to a farmer who sells his farm is that he will pocket £200,000 or £300,000.  Very few working people have that sort of money and it would represent E1 Dorado to them.  Farmers cannot be cushioned for ever more.  They must work in a productive, efficient way and help to solve the problems we all face.</P>

      <P>I regret that Deputy Kemmy has felt obliged to make the kind of remarks he has just made.  I am not convinced that he sees the situation in such black and white terms.  His last few remarks were nonsensical.  Any farmer today who is raffling or selling his farm in order to get £200,000 is doing so because he has a bank manager on his back looking for something close to that amount. Otherwise he would not be interested in disposing of his farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1979 the then Fianna Fáil Government were looking at means which could be applied in order to increase taxation from the farming community.  I would be extremely happy if I thought that this year, next year or in three or four years' time we could have a situation where we could take in much more income tax from farmers.  That would make me very happy because to do that we would have to be making a lot more money than we are today.  As Deputy Bruton has pointed <Col N="1371" /> out, we take the view that the most appropriate form of taxation is income tax.  If you make an income you pay tax and if you do not make an income you do not pay tax.  I am sure Deputy Kemmy would agree with that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying it now and I do not have to say it any louder for Deputy Kemmy to hear me.  This is not the only place I have said it.  In 1979 we had what I would call an almost desperate effort by the Government to find ways of extracting money from the farming community. They came up with several stratagems, one of which was a 2 per cent tax on farm output.  That was supposed to extract, I forget how many millions of pounds, from the farming community, but was subsequently found to be illegal because it infringed EEC rules and therefore could not be applied.  We then had a resource tax and disease eradication levies.  These were all new taxes designed to extract money from the farming community when, in fact, we had started by then on the biggest decline in farm incomes for decades.  In 1979 we had a very substantial drop in real farm incomes.  In 1980 we had a further drop, in 1981 a further small drop, and here we are with a series of measures designed to extract income tax as a matter of principle from farmers when not alone are real money incomes going down but are falling very fast.</P>
      <P>It all brings us back to the original point of Deputy Kemmy: it is time we had a proper rational system for dealing with the taxation of incomes of people who make their living from farming lands.  We have not found such a system, although there are numerous ways to do it.  There are large numbers of farmers paying income tax who are assessed on the basis of accounts they send to the Revenue Commissioners.  The sooner we devise a system which will make that apply to everybody the better it will be for everybody, because then we will know the basis of the tax and the rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1372" /> A large number of small enterprises in industry have problems.  There are people today who pay accountants £300 or £400 a year to demonstrate to the Revenue Commissioners that their level of income does not give rise to taxation liability.  I do not see much sense in that but when you go to the trouble of paying accountants to demonstrate you are not liable to tax, you must be critical.  PAYE workers have the firms by whom they are employed to pay accountants to do that job and accordingly we know the incomes they are earning.  If there are some people who have incomes which do not render them liable to tax, so be it.</P>
    <P>This is one of a series of totally inappropriate measures designed to get more taxation revenue from farmers whose incomes at the moment are dropping faster all the time.</P>

      <P>I will not keep you until 7 o'clock.  However, there are a few things that need to be said regarding the refund of this £700,000 that we in Fine Gael agreed to refund if elected last June. In fairness, we must say that this resource tax was imposed in 1979 to be collected from farmers who were in that year suffering a 25 per cent fall in incomes.  We in the farming community at that time objected totally to that tax, for two reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither I nor any other farmer objects to paying a fair share of taxation provided it leaves us a little in order to survive and to rear our families.  In 1979 the Minister for Finance was not the present Minister, who became Minister for Agriculture a short time afterwards and who took steps to ensure that farmers would pay this tax, and the refund of that tax is only a token of the damage done by that Government <Col N="1373" /> to the largest industry in the state.  I can assure the House that if that measure had been continued, if the farming community were to be assaulted with taxes such as that at a time when incomes dropped in three years by 52 per cent in real terms, farmers would not now be on the slippery slopes but would have reached rock bottom. Not later than yesterday we heard that 600 companies are looking for help. What about all the farmers who are looking for help?  Every two miles of roadside in the country has &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; signs because farmers are selling bits of land to keep their heads above water in the coming few months.  For these reasons I am delighted that the Minister has agreed to this concession.  It was a mistake in the first place to have proposed such a tax on farmers at a time when there was a serious drop in their real incomes.</P>

Unless the farming community are allowed to prosper in the years to come we will be here saying good bye to many more companies and many more jobs.

      <P>asked the Taoiseach the steps, if any, he took at the recent European Council meeting to seek agreement on the proposed EEC aid for housing in Belfast; and the steps he took to secure the presence of a member of the Government at the meeting of the Ministerial Council on the day on which this matter was discussed by that Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have given their full support at every appropriate stage of the Community's decision-making procedures to this proposal. The Minister for Foreign Affairs attended in the normal way the last Council at which it was discussed.  It was clear, from consultations which the Minister had with the President of the Council and other delegations, that no decision would be taken on the proposal at the meeting.  The matter was not, in fact, reached until late on the last day of meetings extending over three days, after the Minister had had to leave to return to Dublin.  In his absence, a statement, which the Minister had personally <Col N="1375" /> approved, was made by our Permanent Representative urging an immediate favourable decision for political, economic and humanitarian reasons.  The Council then decided to continue its examination of the proposal which we will continue to support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the German Minister who is opposing this &mdash; and Germany is indeed the main source of opposition &mdash; stayed until the end of the meeting to make his objections known and to ensure it did not go through and that the absence of the Irish and British Ministers appeared unhelpful to other members of the Council and gave the impression that we were not as serious as the Germans?  Would the Taoiseach not agree that when matters of this kind which deeply concern us in this island arise we should not give the impression that we are not interested and leave it to those who are opposed to action to make the running?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He knows perfectly well that both I and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government fully support this proposal and will do everything open to us at any stage of Community affairs to support it.  The circumstances of the meeting to which the Deputy refers were not at all as the Deputy has endeavoured to describe them.  Our Minister was compelled to leave that three-day meeting because of the necessity to be back in Dublin and had already fully ascertained the position from other delegations before he left and had made specific arrangements for our views to be put forward.  The interpretation which Deputy FitzGerald is endeavouring now to put on the circumstances is an unworthy one.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the wording and tone of his response suggests a certain sense of unease or guilt in relation to the matter? Is he not aware that when matters that particularly concern the country arise in the Council it is customary for the Minister concerned to remain and make personal representations?  Is he further aware in relation to his accusations in respect of myself that I have taken all possible steps in this matter, including raising it as Taoiseach directly with the French President and in Opposition as one of the countries most directly concerned with a view to helping the Government and all of us in achieving this result?</P>

      <P>The Deputy, in endeavouring to make a cheap political scoring point out of it now, is not doing the proposition any good.  His raising it here in this manner is detrimental.  His attempt to score a cheap debating point over the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the meeting in question is unworthy of him. If we are going to start going into Community affairs I might have to go back over some of the contributions made by Deputy FitzGerald at Council of Europe meetings which were not to the benefit of this country.  I am refraining from doing that.  However, if Deputy FitzGerald persists in this course of political harassment I may have to start taking the gloves off too.</P>

That is what Opposition is about and the Taoiseach when he was in Opposition was quite uninhibited in that regard, and properly so.  If we see any dereliction of duty on the other side of the House, no matter what language or tone of voice the Taoiseach uses, we will pursue the matter; no matter what threats he uses we will pursue the matter.</P>

        <i>Clare</i>): During the course of my Financial Statement of 25 March last I announced that the Government intended to introduce taxation on derelict sites.

Is the Minister aware that this type of payment would have stood as giving women a legal right in terms of contributing to the home in cases of marital breakdowns?

In view of the family income supplement part of the scheme being a component part of a package to give an incentive for low paid workers to stay at work, could the Minister tell the House how the £4 million set aside in the Coalition budget for the family income supplement is being used to give an incentive to the low paid to stay at work?</P>

      <P>There are many low-paid workers whose incomes are less than those of people on social welfare benefit, and even substantially less.  From the figures that the Minister has given, would he not agree that the effect of this would be to deprive 20,000 families of low-paid workers of an average of £4 a week each to supplement their low earnings?  Does he not agree that that is a most regressive and retrogressive step to have taken?  Has he any proposals to do anything to help the families of low-paid workers who are often paid less than those on social welfare? Does he just not care about these people?</P>

        <i>(Clare):</i> As indicated in the Government press statement of 22 April 1982, and my own statement of 23 April, concerning PRSI contributions, the Government decided to ease the burden of the recent increase in PRSI for employees who are liable to pay income tax also on the same income.  This was expressly intended as an interim measure pending examination of the forthcoming report of the Commission on Taxation, which will address all aspects of the general system of taxation and PRSI, with special regard to equity.  In the interim, I have no further proposals other than those already announced which will, in general, be of assistance to low income families.</P>

Will the Minister not agree that this is a further example of not only the Government's lack of concern about the lower paid but, indeed, of a concerted series of measures directed to prevent them from being helped?  Will he not agree that it is now a matter of urgency that this Government show some concern for the lower paid?  We have now, in the space of five minutes, come across two cases where the Government have acted not only in disregard of these people but against their interests?

It is the intention of the Government to look at this group, who number, incidentally, an estimated 44,000.  Broken down further, to a substantial extent, single workers would be involved in this 44,000 who would not have benefited from the previous FIS proposals.  There would also be an element of married workers on incomes below the income tax threshold as well.

      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> It is assumed that, in referring to non-Exchequer agencies, the Deputy is referring to semi-State and private sector concerns.  Losses incurred in guaranteeing the exchange risk on foreign currency borrowings of such concerns are met in different ways.  On certain World Bank loan facilities arranged in the early 1970s for the ICC and the ACC, exchange losses are met from the Central Fund.  Certain later facilities such as those of the European Investment Bank for the agricultural, manufacturing and tourism sectors are met by voted moneys.  Losses on other facilities, the ACC's Productive Investment Scheme for Agriculture, are financed, in the first instance, by premium payable by the borrower, any shortfall to be made good by the Exchequer from voted moneys.</P>
      <P>For the ICC's Working Capital Loan Scheme the former Tripartite Committee on Employment allocated £2 million from the Employment Guarantee Fund against exchange risk; in addition an exchange risk premium is payable by borrowers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that residents of the Republic of Ireland who work in Northern Ireland are obliged to pay tax under the PAYE system under the Double Taxation Convention between the Republic and the United Kingdom; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> The effect of Article 15 of the double taxation convention of 1976 between this country and the United Kingdom is that an individual who is a resident of the State and who is employed in Northern Ireland is chargeable to British tax on his earnings from that employment.  He is also entitled under Article 22 of the Convention to the benefit of the same personal allowances and reliefs for purposes of that tax as a British subject not resident in the United Kingdom.  Such an individual is also chargeable to Irish tax on the earnings referred to but a credit is given for British tax on those earnings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that taxation law makers do not take into consideration the great inconvenience to people living in Border areas where they live on one side of the Border and work on the other?  Does the Minister consider it fair that someone working in Northern Ireland and living in the Republic pays PAYE in the North and if <Col N="1394" /> his earnings exceed his tax free allowance in the Republic he must again pay additional taxation?  This would be reasonable if it balanced out in reverse but the same thing applies if someone living in Northern Ireland is working in the Republic.  He pays PAYE in the Republic and must then pay taxation on his earnings in the North if it exceeds his tax free allowance.  Does the Minister not consider that totally unfair and insensitive as far as these people are concerned?</P>

        <i>(Clare):</i> A bilateral agreement has been in existence for a number of years.  It is one of the many bilateral agreements in operation in this respect. With regard to people living on this side of the Border and working on the other, up to a certain level they pay more tax. In certain instances they would pay more here as their salary would increase.  With regard to the person about whom the Deputy supplied details, it has been explained to that person who lives on this side of the Border.  He accepts that it is a reasonable agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

        <i>(Clare):</i> Surely this was a consideration at the time of the drafting of the bilateral agreement and must have been the subject of discussion.  The taxation law makers would not have been immune to that, yet it is accepted by many people involved that the agreement is reasonable.</P>

This is a bilateral agreement and the only way that anything can be done in that respect is to renegotiate the entire agreement.</P>

        <i>(Clare):</i> It is assumed that the Deputy's question relates to the procedures adopted by the Revenue Commissioners for the collection from employers of tax and contributions under the PAYE/PRSI system.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the scheme of collection is organised so that employers make a declaration every month of the amount due under the PAYE scheme and remit that amount to the Revenue.  At the end of the tax year the employer then sends in a detailed return showing the pay, income tax deducted and PRSI contributions, which is then audited and balanced with the monthly remittances.  The register is so organised that forms of declaration are sent out in time for the monthly returns and at the end of the year.  Any failure to send in the forms is followed up by the Revenue by way either of an estimation procedure or by proceedings in the courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister fo State aware that the factual position is that a number of firms have not paid their PAYE and, therefore, people who are claiming a refund of tax find that the money has not been paid on their behalf <Col N="1397" /> to the Revenue Commissioners?  I have brought a couple of cases to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners.  The people I am concerned about are ordinary hard-working people and they are being deprived of their refund of tax. What action is being taken?  The information has been left in the Revenue Commissioners' office long enough to have a decision taken on it.</P>

        <i>(Clare):</i> At the end of the year the true position can be assessed, but under the system, as I have stated, that is the way the Revenue Commissioners have operated the system and have been doing so on a monthly basis.  In the case of any failure to give a return they allow up to nine days to the end of the month and then they go after the firm or firms with regard to not submitting the returns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister for State aware that there is a very widespread feeling which has been reported to me from several quarters, as I am sure is the case with other Deputies also, that the Revenue Commissioners, whether because of lack of staff or softness of heart, allow a large number of firms to remain in very substantial arrears with their PAYE and VAT payments in order that these firms may use that money in place of the cash flow which they have not got out of their own resources, and that if they were to move in any more rigorously than they do they would be forcing a large number of firms to the wall and that that is an index of the position to which the country has been reduced?</P>

      <P>I will sit here.  What is happening is a scandalous abuse of the system and I object to it vociferously. The Minister of State is now advertising on the radio.  It is an absolute scandal to say the Minister has no responsibility to this House, one might as well tell the House he is not responsible for the Provos advertising on radio and television. I object very strongly to the reply from the Minister that he has no responsibility to this House for the lawfulness of the actions of RTE.  Implicit in that reply is that any Member can advertise on RTE without recourse to this House.  I totally reject that reply.  If I am not permitted to raise the matter by question, if the Minister is not answerable to the House, who is answerable to the House?  Where and when can the matter be raised?  The Bishop of Galway cannot advertise on television without calling himself Chairman of Trocaire.  Surely it is not in order for Ministers and Ministers of State to advertise constantly.  This is the second Minister of State who has done this in the run-up to the Galway by-election.  I am asking the Chair for guidance as to where I can raise the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The Ceann Comhairle shall order a member whose conduct is grossly disorderly to withdraw immediately from the Dáil for the remainder of that day's sitting.  If, however, on any occasion the Ceann Comhairle deems that the powers conferred under this Standing Order are inadequate to deal with the offence, he may, in accordance with the next succeeding Standing Order, name such Member for misconduct, or he may call on the Dáil to adjudge upon his conduct.  Members ordered to withdraw in pursuance of this Standing Order, or who are suspended <Col N="1467" /> in pursuance of the next Standing Order, shall forthwith withdraw from the precincts of the Dáil.</P>

My recollection of procedures in the past is that the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle rose to his feet, struck the bell and clearly warned the Deputy that unless he resumed his seat, or, alternatively, left the House, he would be named.  In this instance the Leas-Cheann Comhairle did not do that.  Most Deputies believe that this procedure should have been adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

As the normal procedure was not gone through and as we were under the impression that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was taking a tolerant view, perhaps unduly tolerant, of Deputy Mitchell's actions, the House was under a misapprehension.  We genuinely thought that Deputy Mitchell had finished and we were going on to the next business.  We were very taken aback to hear he was calling for you with a view to naming Deputy Mitchell, not having gone through the normal procedure.</P>

I can understand you saying that you have a discretion and that you have decided not to exercise it.  I cannot understand you saying that you have not got discretion.  In view of the fact that the procedure has always been adopted of ringing the bell, of standing and so on, and that that has not gone through, it appears to me that the case for exercising your discretion is very strong indeed. Deputies are entitled to rely on the tradition of the House.  If that is not gone through the Chair should exercise his discretion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 17 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not a great deal of time to discuss this Bill and there are some serious amendments to be dealt with, particularly in relation to the imposition of VAT at points of entry.  I wish to refer to the concept of a resource tax on all holdings of £70 rateable valuation and over at a rate of £3.50 per £1 rateable valuation.  I did not think that it was ever a good form of tax.  Neither am I in favour of flat levies on income such as the youth employment levy.  Taxation must be related to income.</P>
      <P>While I am extremely critical of successive Governments from 1977 onwards, to his eternal credit Deputy Richie Ryan when Minister for Finance made a brave and tremendous effort to regularise farm taxation and there was considerable progress between 1974 and 1976.  The Governments should have stuck with that form of tax for a number of years.  I am opposed in principle to the refunding of taxation but nevertheless I will not press to a division my opposition to the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> The Labour Party are opposed to the refunding of tax of this nature which was part of the annual budget.  I was unhappy about it then, but so be it.  The Deputies behind me who have spoken have equally stated their opposition to such refunding. The Labour Party were part of the Government which agreed to make the refund and I do not propose to go back on that.  I am, however, entitled to make my opposition known.  I hope that we can forget about agricultural levies and resource tax on the basis of rateable value because that as a criterion is wholly outdated and does not relate to actual farm income.  I have always thought it inadequate as is the concept of youth employment levies, flat rate health services levies and bank levies.  The income and profits of banks, of farm incomes and of other sectors should be taxed equally on an income tax account basis.  That is the only way to do it.  Otherwise, levy systems are abused and in general are not successful. They are all, as we know, just as the 1 per cent levy on farm incomes was, regretted.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy about the provision in this section but do not wish to waste time. At this stage it is a relatively small amount of money and the whole section on resource tax is being wound down.  I hope that this House, and particularly the main parties, will have the political courage to introduce a comprehensive income tax account system.  I have no doubt that the Commission on Taxation would strongly recommend something along these lines.  That report will vindicate strongly the views expressed by Deputies on this side of the House and in time, no doubt, an effective system will be introduced.  From that system there should be about £60 million to £70 million a year in farm taxation as of now, instead of the messing which has gone on over the past six or seven years.  That would bring equity into the question of farm taxation <i>versus</i> PAYE taxation.  That equity is sadly lacking now in the overall taxation system.  I sympathise with, fully understand and agree with the reaction of PAYE wage and salary earners when they see the discrepancies which exist at the moment.  I quote from an interesting <Col N="1477" /> union magazine <i>Liberty</i> of February 1981, which sums up the position relative to farm taxation.  It states:</P>
    <P>...last year,</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;that was 1980&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>only one-third of all full-time farmers were liable to tax, no matter what their income was.  This minority of full-time farmers, this one-third, only paid an average of £694 income tax while the PAYE workers paid an average of £1,345.  Therefore the 120,000 full-time farmers paid only an average of £208 in 1980.</P>
    <P>It went on:</P>
    <P>The trade union movement wants all farmers to pay income tax in the same way as workers, if their incomes exceed the very low allowances.</P>
    <P>I certainly share that view.  The Commission on Taxation will vindicate a fair segment of all views which I have been expressing in this House since 1969.  I look forward to reading the Commission's report.</P>
    <P>In the interest of expediting the further 80-odd sections of this Bill &mdash; particularly as, since we have now lost one of our more distinguished Members, we are not likely to succeed in any vote in that context &mdash; I formally oppose the section, but do not want it to be put to a division.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>I also do not want to waste the time of the House. A great deal of time has been spent discussing this issue, but I disagree with the previous speaker.  It is a very important issue on which this House should have an opportunity to register its protest &mdash; certainly those members who have spoken against this section and asked for its deletion. I am one of those who put down this amendment and feel very strongly that there should be a division on it.  I will give my reasons for this very briefly.  It is incredible at a time like this that a Government should pay back a tax already legally collected when we are told that the country is in a major financial crisis and when all sections of the community are being urged to show restraint. <Col N="1478" /> We were told yesterday that there was not sufficient money to make income tax concessions to the most vulnerable section of our community: people in private rented dwellings.  In that context it is amazing that any side of the House and any group of Deputies should countenance the handing back of legally collected tax.</P>
      <P>There are two other points which I would like to make in support of deletion of this section.  First, it has been suggested, particularly from Deputy Bruton's side of the House, that farmers in various ways pay a certain amount of taxation.  That argument has been rejected by other speakers.  I will not deal with it at any length, but certainly could not support that view.  With what we all know is an inequitable tax system, weighing heavily on one section of the population and not weighing at all on the farming class, to hand back a legally collected tax just simply is not on.  One point which has not been highlighted and should be is the whole anti-democratic nature of the opposition to the tax.  When the Dáil approved the tax, the farmers refused to pay it.  It was as a result of that rejection of the democratic process that the Government conceded and agreed not only to forget about it but to pay back the amount of tax which had already been collected.  If for no other reason than that there should be a division on this issue and the Deputies who have maintained that they are opposed to the section should be given an opportunity to vote in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 52:</P>
      <P>In page 28, subsection (1) (a), between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following definition:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;heritage garden&rsquo; means a garden to which subsection (4) applies;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" /> In this amendment we are seeking an extension of the section.  It should not cost anything but it would be of considerable benefit to the country.  The Minister is aware of the recommendations of An Taisce and the various points made by owners of heritage gardens.  Many are of particular historical and botanical value and major scientific interest, and in a nation of Philistines their aesthetic value should be of benefit to the nation as a whole.  As a member of a local authority looking around and seeing so many magnificient areas denuded of trees and gardens which were once the pride of our country, I suggest that there is no good reason why, if this tax benefit is given to historic buildings, it should not be extended to the gardens surrounding, and I recommend this to the Minister.  I will be interested in his view.  A finance Bill should encourage the owners of such properties and should give them tax relief.  Finally, the care, maintenance and development of such gardens are labour-intensive and as such would be of benefit in the overall employment situation. With that case on our behalf I ask the Minister to consider the recommendations put to him here and I will be very interested in his response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment proposed by Deputy Desmond.  It is reasonable to include heritage gardens also.  The only concern I would have would be as to how you repair a heritage garden.  I can see how you can repair a building, but then I suppose it is possible to maintain a garden and perhaps this is covered in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have two things to say in general terms about this measure.  First of all, this proposal of introducing tax relief for heritage houses is one that my party supported in their election programme and I am very glad that the Minister is proceeding with it.  I compliment him on that.  It shows a degree of cross-party interest in our heritage, something on which we all congratulate ourselves.  The other point I want to make perhaps would be more appropriate on the section, but I hope that the relief will not be confined solely to big houses.  I would like to see <Col N="1481" /> a typical cross-section of all types of houses including the most humble cottages and agricultural outbuildings preserved, because we must see the totality of our heritage and not just its most flamboyant expressions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the last two points first, it does not matter about the size of a house so long as it is of suitable historical value and the public have access to it, and therefore it will be covered.  The amendments Nos. 52 and 59, inclusive, propose in effect that tax relief be given for expenditure incurred on the repair, maintenance or restoration of a house or garden which is intrinsically of historical, botanical, scientific or aesthetic interest.  It should be noted that the section as it stands is sufficiently wide to grant relief in respect of any buildings there may be in a garden even where there are not dwelling houses.  The amendment could not be accepted in the form proposed because the definition is too loose and would leave the provision open to abuse.  It is not clear what the intention of the word &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; is.  Does Deputy Desmond wish his proposal to embrace only gardens or houses of historic interest?  As Deputy Bruton said, the boundaries of such gardens would be difficult to define.  Most gardens could be claimed to have some aesthetic or botanical if not historic or scientific interest.  It is surely not contended that the wages of every gardener or other staff employed or alleged to be employed on a wholetime or part-time basis in tending such gardens should be subsidised in substantial part by the general taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the broader principles involved, it is considered that the proposal should not be accepted as it would widen the scope of the section far beyond the original intention which was that significant buildings which normally had several hundreds of years of lifespan would be preserved.  It is questionable whether the issue of tax relief in respect of gardens is relevant at all in the context of this section. The proposed amendment is hardly necessary in view of the fact that residence-related relief is already available in respect of a garden attached to <Col N="1482" /> the dwelling.  Under section 7 of the Finance Act, 1979, tax relief is granted in respect of the labour costs comprised in expenditure on the maintenance, repair, improvement etc. of residential premises the definition of which includes the garden or grounds of an ornamental nature. Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1979, is proposed to be continued for 1982-83 by section 12 of the present Bill which we have already dealt with this morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that between now and Report Stage he might have another look at this amendment.  Any such garden would have to be in the first instance submitted to the Commissioners of Public Works as is provided in relation to buildings in question.  We are talking about relief from income tax and corporation tax.  It would not be a widespread relief; it is that element of relief that would be given. We are also talking about gardens to which the public would have access. There are many gardens around the country &mdash; many Deputies can think of them in their own constitutencies &mdash; which have not historical buildings on the site, yet the owners may be considering letting them go to wrack and ruin because the income for the care and maintenance of them would be very minimal.  I am very anxious that such gardens, particularly where, as I have indicated in our amendment, they are of botanical and scientific interest, while not usually very profitable, revenue-making types of garden, are of themselves a major national asset which people in the UK, France, Germany and all over the world would dearly love to visit and indeed in terms of professional work they often avail of facilities therein.  Perhaps between now and Report Stage the Minister will have a look at this.  Some leeway could be given and the relief from income tax and corporation tax would be very small, but it would do what was done effectively for artists.  It would give to those who have a personal inheritance eligibility for that relief which should not be abused because the regulations determing that eligibility should be very tight.  I will leave it with the Minister.  We all recommend <Col N="1483" /> that that be done and it would be of major cultural significance if such relief was available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his views.  One can be sympathetic to the intention here, but the difficulty is the definition of a garden and the dangers of abuse, as I have said.  I am not going to repeat myself and delay the House but the Deputy has requested me to have a look at it and I will ask the officials concerned to look in detail at it between now and Report Stage to see if there is any way in which the intention here can be prescribed in legislation.  However, from the information I have I understand that there are dangers <i>vis-á-vis</i> the definition and the possiblity of abuses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have the greatest sympathy with the Minister in seeking to draft legislation of this sort, I feel that the provisions of section 19 (4) (a) (i) are very vague.  They say that the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland may determine a building to be intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest.  That is so wide that you could almost justify including any building, including the most modern building, under that prescription.</P>

    <P>On the grounds that it represented an innovation in architectural practice, a building built last week could be deemed to be of architectural significance.  Perhaps it could be described as of scientific significance if a new form of material were used in the building even though it was built last week.  On the question of aesthetic significance it is generally accepted that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  I am not sure that everyone would necessarily accept the aesthetic judgment of the Office of Public Works, any more than the Office of Public Works might accept my judgment or the Taoiseach's <Col N="1484" /> judgment or Deputy Desmond's judgment on a matter of aesthetics. There are definitely problems when one is trying to legislate what is or what is not of aesthetic significance.</P>
    <P>I raise this point not because I am concerned to restrict the operation of the allowance.  I realise that I could be criticised by others for raising it because perhaps it might have that effect.  I raise it because I am afraid that the fact that one person might be deemed to have a building of aesthetic significance and another person deemed by the Office of Public Works not to have a building of aesthetic significance, could lead to a sense of injustice and, perhaps, even to litigation which would be to nobody's benefit.</P>
    <P>I realise it will not be possible between now and tomorrow for the Minister to come up with a definition of &ldquo;aesthetically significant&rdquo; which would be acceptable to anyone except himself.  I wonder should we not have in the section a regulation so that, at some time in the future, the Revenue Commissioners and/or the Office of Public Works could be empowered to make regulations which would have to be laid before this House and approved by it, rather than simple regulations which are introduced in the normal course and become law by default, giving a more precise definition of the terms involved here so that there will be a <i>corpus</i> of law, if you like, which will enable people to see a little more clearly whether or not they come within the intended ambit of the concession.</P>
    <P>Otherwise I can see many problems arising with people feeling they should come within it, and the Office of Public Works telling them they do not, when it is one man's aesthetic judgment against that of another, which is not a very sound situation.  It could end up with them taking the matter to court and then the aesthetic judgment of the Chief Justice would over-rule that of the Revenue Commissioners or the applicant.  In a matter of aesthetics, the Chief Justice has no more standing than anyone else.  If that happens, it will be because we in this House were not sufficiently precise in the legislation we enacted.  To avoid having to spend all day arguing about it, perhaps <Col N="1485" /> the suggestion I have made to the Minister about a regulation making power, similar to the one he has included in earlier sections where we were introducing new provisions in regard to rent relief could be incorporated in this section to enable him to ensure that the type of problem I mentioned does not arise.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to raise is the one I raised on the amendment, and I feel extremely strongly about it.  As the House is aware, it is a subject in which I have taken some interest since I was elected.  We do not want this section to be used solely to preserve what is known as the &ldquo;big house&rdquo;.  I have no objection to the people who built the big houses or whatever traditions they represent.  Quite the opposite.  We must be prepared to preserve a broad cross-section of all types of heritage items, down to the most humble thatched cow-shed, or thatched cottage. A broad cross-section of all aspects of our material history must be sought to be preserved.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Commissioners of Public Works may take a conventional view of what is an historic house and go on the basis that it must be a big house with &ldquo;beautiful things&rdquo; in it.  I know the interpretation of beauty the cognoscenti have is not necessarily the same one as other people might have.  We must instruct the Commissioners of Public Works to concern themselves with all aspects of our material history, including the material remains of the poorest of our forebears as well as the best off of our forebears.  I hope the Minister will ensure that that is the attitude the Commissioners of Public Works will take and, if necessary, the legislation can be clarified to make sure that they take that view and do not confine themselves solely to the &ldquo;big house&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Commissioners of Public Works will be liberal in their views.  While I would not argue against or disagree with the general points made by the Deputy, now that we have introduced this we should wait and gain some experience from its operation. The Deputy referred, rightly, to the Office of Public Works.  We are also in the process of setting up a National Heritage <Col N="1486" /> Council and I am sure they will be asked for advice on these matters.  Advice can be sought from various authoritative sources on particular buildings.  We can look at the necessity to have regulations but this would arise only in the light of experience gained.  I am sure the Office of Public Works will be liberal and open.</P>

      <P>For the sake of clarity, I do not agree that simply taking the advice of many people will solve any problem which may be created if the legislation is not sufficiently precise.  If the initial authority is vague, the advice given will be vague particularly on such a subjective matter as this.  We should have a regulation making power to determine these terms more precisely, in the Minister's interests as much as that of anybody else.  I do not want them to be liberal in the sense of giving the allowance to anybody.  They should be sufficiently comprehensive in their view on what is historic in the sense that they will include items of material tradition which are not solely those of the &ldquo;big house&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Subsection (4) (b) (ii) refers to &ldquo;subject to temporary closure necessary for the purposes of the repair, maintenance or restoration of the building, access is so afforded for not less than one hundred days in any year...&rdquo;  That is a little too restrictive.  It is one-third of the year.  We will not get many owners of historic houses to agree to that.  People might be prepared to agree to have their places open on Sundays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1487" /> The hope is that these will be homes in which people are living.  If a thatched cottage is opened to the public there will be no privacy left.  If your house is sufficiently big, you might be happy to allow people to tramp all around one way of it for 100 days in every year, and thereby get the tax allowance for maintaining the whole of it.  If we are talking about opening a three-roomed thatched cottage, which it is just as important to preserve, for 100 days out of 365, the invasion of your privacy will be so great, and the necessity to have somebody there with the key will be so great that the staff costs will far outweigh the benefit to the owner of opening the premises.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that in keeping the house open to the public it is not enough simply to say one will be there on a certain day.  The owner has to stay for the day, has to open up the house and show the people around it.  All of that will cost a significant amount and if they are not there themselves they will have to arrange for someone to be available. I suggest to the Minister that we delete the figure of 100 days and bring it down to, say, 30 days a year.  That would be quite sufficient to meet the requirements.</P>

      <P>This section gives effect to the proposal announced in the budget that entertainment expenses incurred after 25 March 1982 will not be <Col N="1488" /> allowed as a deduction for the purpose of income tax or corporation tax.  Entertainment expenses include expenses incurred in the provision of accommodation, food, drink or any other form of hospitality. Hitherto, 50 per cent of entertainment expenses, to the extent that they were incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily for the purpose of a trade or a profession, were deductible.  The section also provides that capital allowances will not be granted in respect of assets used for entertainment with effect from 1982-83 for income tax purposes and for accounting periods ending on or after 6 April 1982 for corporation tax purposes.</P>

      <P>They are alive and well but are allegedly penniless.  There is a great deal of entertainment done in boardrooms.  The days are gone when business clients are taken to fancy restaurants. However, within the confines of the modern new office blocks there are boardrooms with kitchens attached and I defy any inspector of taxes to put an estimate on the amount of largesse dispensed in that area.  Business entertainment in its conventional sense has changed dramatically.  I should like to know how successful are the Revenue Commissioners in making assessments with regard to this matter.  I am in favour of this section in the Bill.  It is significant there has been a major downturn in the trade of many expensive and middle-priced restaurants and this must be an indication that the benefit in kind was of considerable proportions.  I have often wondered about boardroom entertainment. It must require tremendous powers of detection on the part of the inspectors of taxes if they are to get on top of that problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Desmond, subsection (4) defines business entertainment for the purpose of the section and broadens its meaning. Whereas the definition in existing law describes business entertainment as entertainment, including hospitality of any kind, provided by a person or a member <Col N="1490" /> of his staff in connection with a trade carried on by that person, the term as now defined will cover such entertainment, including the provision of accommodation, food and drink or any other form of hospitality in any circumstances whatever, provided directly or indirectly, in connection with a trade by (a) the trader himself; (b) anyone who is a member of his staff; or (c) anyone providing or performing any service for the trader in the course of which entertainment is provided. This provision is intended to cover, for example, the situation where an advertising agency or public relations firm organises a trade promotion in the course of which entertainment is provided for potential customers and includes the cost of entertainment in the overall agency charges.  The entertainment element of such charges will be disallowed and the inspector of taxes will be empowered in subsection (8) to apportion payment so as to exclude the entertainment element.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there were abuses of the system.  I accept that £3 million is a very considerable amount but against that, as Deputy Desmond pointed out, it is noticeable that there has been a remarkable falling off in the amount of public entertainment in restaurants and hotels.  The sum of £3 million lost to the Exchequer is one thing but the loss to hotels and restaurants may be in excess of that figure.  Business entertainment creates employment for hotels and restaurants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year it was reduced by 50 per cent and evidence shows that there was no reduction or deterioration in business in restaurants as a result and that is accepted by the trade also.  If a concession is removed from a person's business there will obviously be criticism.  This was excessively used &mdash; maybe that is what I should have said rather than saying it was abused &mdash; but the 50 per cent reduction did not reduce that trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Markey is not surprised to hear I do not agree <Col N="1491" /> with him on this matter having introduced this provision.  This provision could lead to a reduction in prices in some of the more expensive restaurants because there are some restaurants which have been living on tax-subsidised custom. The ordinary diner who is not getting a tax subsidy cannot afford the prices now being charged.  Some of these restaurants will now find that in order to keep business they will have to bring down their prices to something that people who are paying their own money can afford.  In the interest of social solidarity &mdash; and we must have much more social solidarity than previously if we are to overcome our problems &mdash; the conspicuous consumption that is represented by some of the prices in some of our more expensive restaurants is not helping us to pull together as a community.  Although this will raise only £3 million, it will ensure that we are all treated the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In that regard may we hope to see a table for two tax inspectors? When people report publicly that in allegedly middle range restaurants they pay £40 or £50 for a routine dinner, which is the equivalent of the total payment to a widow with two childen for a week's social welfare, eyebrows rise at the very point that Deputy Bruton has made, namely social solidarity.  It is an interesting phrase.  I suppose it is Swedish.  I welcome the section and the information provided by the Minister has underlined the need for the abolition of that privilege.</P>

      <P>This is concerned with an anomaly in regard to the restriction that is being introduced here.  It has been represented to me that a problem can arise with regard to the position of a couple who are separating.  It says here that, notwithstanding anything in this section, a loan shall not be a qualifying loan in relation to an individual if it is used for the purpose of defraying money applied in the purchase of residential premises or any interest therein from a person who is the spouse of the purchaser.  I realise that buying a house from your spouse, if relations are normal, would probably be an artificial transaction which would not need to be engaged in.  However, it has been represented to me that where spouses are separated and one of them has remained in the original home of the couple and if the other spouse owns the house or a half share in it, the remaining spouse will have to buy the other spouse out.  That is a transaction which has to be engaged in just as inevitably as the fact that someone has to provide a house in the first place when a marriage is established. It was represented to me that to introduce a restriction here in regard to the right to claim in the very specific circumstances of separation would be unfair.  I hope that my fears in this matter are groundless, but I feel I should raise the matter nonetheless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>While I did not submit an amendment, I would like to draw the Minister's attention to a situation that has arisen for a number of persons.  I do not know how many but I have had a clear representation from one constituent of mine who has found himself in a position of extreme difficulty in consequence of the wording of section 21.  He feels, not because of anyone's intent but because of the words used successively in the budget statement, in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget</i> officially issued and in a statement which the Minister's office issued on 31 March last, that he has been led into a financial trap which will be very difficult and embarrassing for him and from which there is no escape.  I hope I can explain it well to the House.  This constituent was anxious to make plans to acquire a holiday bungalow.  Under the law as it stands and until the passage of <Col N="1494" /> this Finance Bill, he would have been able to set off a mortgage interest incurred in raising the loan to pay for this home, albeit a second home, a holiday bungalow, against income tax up to the familiar limits.</P>
      <P>That possibility would have been open to him, he believed, under the Minister's budget statement because that statement did not contain any reference that would lead him to suppose a distinction was about to be drawn in regard to the purpose for which a mortgage was being raised between houses used as main or principal residences and houses used as holiday homes.  Of course a distinction arose as he saw it &mdash; I understand there are others in the same category but I cannot tell the Minister how many&mdash; because the reference in the Minister's statement of 31 March to a principal home was to the house on which the mortgage was raised and not a reference to the use to which a house in the process of being acquired might be put.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the March budget in so far as mortgage interest relief is concerned were identical with those of the January budget.  The Minister issued an abbreviated set of guidelines for the public and the press to show the principal budget features.  The statement in regard to mortgage loans set out that in so far as mortgages taken out after 5 April were concerned certain rules would apply. Income tax would be allowed in respect of the borrower's main residence and relief would be allowed only at the 25 per cent or 35 per cent rate, as appropriate, and the capital limit for relief would be £35,000.  The next paragraph stated:</P>
      <P>There will be no change in the income tax relief provisions in respect of existing mortgages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That clearly indicated the chronological watershed to be 5 April.  It clearly indicated what the regime would be in relation to mortgages taken out after 5 April &mdash; I did not notice this at the time; I would not be adverting to it now if it had not been brought to my attention by my constituent &mdash; that if that man could arrange a mortgage between the date of the budget and 5 April he would avoid <Col N="1495" /> the subsequent less lenient regime according to which mortgage relief in respect of anything but a principal dwelling would come to an end in 1985.  I understand that other people are in the same position who had been planning to build or to buy small second houses for use in retirement and so on.  They began to press the Department of Finance for a clear indication of what was meant by taking out a mortgage, what stage of the mortgage transaction must one have reached in order to have it taken out by 5 April.  Accordingly, on 31 March, the Department issued a statement and I will read the central part of it:</P>
    <P>Several inquiries in relation to the operative date for the new rules have been received from persons who are in the process of arranging such loans. These rules will apply to loans taken out after 5 April 1982.  A loan will be deemed to be taken out on the date on which a written commitment is given to the persons concerned by a building society or other lending agency to advance a loan of a specified amount in respect of a specified residence being the only or main residence of that person.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, that qualification did not figure in the explanatory material accompanying the budget statement.</P>
    <P>My constituent was anxious not to put a foot wrong in this matter and he brought this statement to his legal adviser who said that in so far as he could understand it the expression &ldquo;in respect of a specified residence&rdquo; referred to the residence on which the mortgage was being raised, otherwise, the residence that would be encumbered by the mortgage to secure the repayment of a particular loan and had no reference to the use to which the object was being put and in order to purchase which the loan is being raised.  It is not clear to an unpredjudiced observer even now that that construction could possibly be put on the Department's 31 March statement, and the Minister did not make it clear.</P>
    <P>Relying on the statement the Department <Col N="1496" /> had put out specifically, in specific response to specific inquiries, my constituent concluded a mortgage deal on his principal residence on 2 April and sat back secure in the knowledge that he had conformed with everything he understood the Minister had told him to do before 5 April in such a way that the mortgage interest relief would be available to him until his loan had been paid off.  Imagine his chagrin when the Finance Bill emerged with an explanatory memorandum which for the first time in express terms introduced this provision in respect of pre-5 April mortgages, differentiating as to use of the house to purchase which the loan was being raised.</P>
    <P>I appreciate this Stage of the Finance Bill must be finished by 7 o'clock and I am not asking the Minister to sort out this matter here, though this seems to me to be an extremely solid point.  I can guarantee to the Minister that it has left this person, and for all I know many other people, in a very severe personal jam, although those people did everything that could possibly be expected of them, including making inquiries to the Department and taking legal advice.  They now feel that the rug has been pulled from under them and that they are in serious difficulties through no fault of their own. I do not mean to assign blame and I do not ask the Minister to reply now off the top of his head.</P>
    <P>I am asking him possibly to introduce an amendment between now and Report Stage in order to take account of what must be a limited number of people who were able to get under the mortgage tape in the matter of those few days.  I am alive to the point that many people would make that the State through the taxpayers should not subsidise people for anything other than their main residences. Indeed I made that point both in and out of Government.  I do not think the second residence ought to qualify for relief, but if the State proposes to amend the law in that respect it should give unambiguous warning to people so that they will not leave themselves in that position.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy <Col N="1497" /> for the manner in which he has raised the point.  Largely what he has said <i>vis-á-vis</i> 21 March and 2 June publication is true, but if the Deputy goes back to 27 January he will find that what was intended was a 35 per cent income tax band and £35,000 capital, and I doubt very much if anybody would be qualifying for a second or holiday home under those criteria. Various administrative problems would have arisen, as I explained on Second Stage.  The individual the Deputy mentioned will still qualify for relief during the next three years, until 1985, in regard to the normal interest limits.  Thereafter, according to the following sections, he would be able to use up to £5,000 if he is a married man for interest relief purpose.</P>
      <P>I do not know any more of the individual concerned other than the details the Deputy has given, but taking into account the position on 27 January and 25 March, if it was possible to implement those provisions it is very doubtful if there would be anybody who would be considering a second home and who would be in the 35 per cent income tax band.</P>

      <P>This is the point, because when the Finance Bill shows deviation from something contained in the budget statement it usually is, although not perhaps always, as a consequence of a public fuss about the rigours of the budget and it usually shows amelioration from the taxpayers' point of view.  Here is an instance of the opposite happening.  I say it uncontentiously.  The Minister's own accompanying statement handed out to the press and public on budget day was that there would be no change in the income tax relief provisions in respect of existing mortgages and existing mortgages cannot be interpreted, looking at this statement, in any other sense than <Col N="1498" /> mortgages up to the date when the law was going to change, which would be 5 April.  Just to avoid all doubt my constituent and others asked what exactly this meant: what is meant by &ldquo;an existing mortgage&rdquo; and what is meant by &ldquo;taken out.&rdquo;  To clarify and remove doubts the Minister's own Department issued a statement on 31 March which did not make clear what has only now become clear with the publication of the Finance Bill and what was open to the absolutely honest construction I have just explained to the House.</P>
      <P>I know that every Minister's anxiety is to get out and be finished and get clear. But before the Minister commits himself to something from which he may find it hard to climb down, would he please undertake to look at this to assess the size of the problem which might be involved in changing his Bill in ease of what I believe must be a relatively small number of people in such a way that the relief will operate not with a dead end stop in 1985 but in the way in which it would have operated without this Finance Bill at all. It is no use to say this individual will have income tax relief for the next three years. The situation of a man who is pushing on in life, who is even over the halfway mark, with regard to mortgages and the length of time he is going to be in a high earning position to repay them becomes, with every passing day, one of diminishing flexibility and mobility.  It is no use telling a man who has passed the middle part of life and can now see winking at him through the leaves the sunshine of his retirement years that he will have this until 1985.  He has made these plans in which he has become heavily involved financially on the basis that the relief, whether rightly or wrongly, available up to then would continue to be available to him in the same way as before.  I appeal to the Minister not to close the door on this case but to consider it overnight or whatever length of time will elapse before the Report Stage to see if what I can absolutely tell the Minister is a 100 per cent genuine case and any other case like it can be facilitated.</P>

      <P>I accept fully what the <Col N="1499" /> Deputy has said.  As he himself suggested, we do not want to get into an argument on the details across the House.  I have already explained the position and I am not going to repeat that.  But the same situation can apply, apart from the period 25 March to 2 June, to many more people.  I am sure there are many more than within that period who made particular arrangements for buying a second home over the last five, six or seven years with mortgages to run for ten, 15 or 20 years and they are all in the same situation.  That is the reality.  It is not just those caught between 25 March and 2 June.  This applies to anybody who had a mortgage for a second house at any time until the mortgage runs out, if it runs out at a later date than 1985.  But the Deputy has asked me to have a look at it and I will do that.  Perhaps the Deputy might give me some particulars of the individual case.</P>

      <P>Before we move on from section 22 of the Bill, the amendment we had down was intended to try to provide for people who are working, paying tax and get tax relief on their mortgage, but who are made redundant or for some reason have to go on social welfare benefit through illness or whatever.  In this situation they are no longer paying tax and are therefore not entitled to tax relief.  We are anxious that some consideration be given to a system whereby the PAYE worker or the person in receipt of tax relief would be able to opt for a direct <Col N="1500" /> subsidy equal to the 35p rate which would be payable directly to the loan agency so that he would not have to fall into arrears in mortgage repayments because of unemployment or sickness.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The granting of mortgage interest relief in a full year costs the Exchequer some £50 million.  I am very strongly of the view that the granting of interest relief should not under any circumstances be at more than the standard rate.  I have always had that view because of the marginal benefit it is to those on higher incomes.  The Minister has seen fit to change that.  The amendments we put down are out of order because they impose a charge on the taxpayer. Again this is an anachronistic situation. But the giving of relief in relation to overdrafts, mortgages and other circumstances should be at the standard rate.  It is manifestly unjust that people who want to spend because they have a high income and want to trade up their dwellings should be getting more relief. The nett effect, as was indicated by An Foras Forbartha, is that in 1975-76 70 per cent of dwellings were three-bedroomed dwellings whereas in 1982 70 per cent of the dwellings are four and five-bedroomed dwellings.  There has not been a <Col N="1501" /> population explosion in the meantime. Demographic trends show that the size of families has fallen.  People are using mortgage interest relief to trade up and get bigger houses and they all finish up with all their family married and the husband and wife together, if they have not been divorced or separated in that period, in a five-bedroomed house and presumably they are sleeping in one bedroom if they are still happily married, and we have the situation where scarce taxation resources are being segregated into the construction sector while at the same time there are 35,000 families with no homes.  Everybody else is getting mortgage interest relief at the marginal rate.</P>
      <P>When discussing income tax with people I ask them what their income is, what their outgoings are and tell them to trade up their dwelling.  They may as well go to live in the more exclusive area of Foxrock and save income tax.  The Finance Bill and the taxation relief measures are an enormous incentive for people to buy more expensive dwellings. This is socially unjust and crazy.  The former Deputy Richie Ryan was an unfortunate man who was much maligned in many ways but he had the conscience to say that this cannot continue. In next year's Finance Bill the Minister should rectify this position and give £15 million to those who have not homes. Such people are being exploited and are paying up to £30 per week for a room which may be only 12 feet by ten feet while they share a toilet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person earning perhaps £18,000 who is married with only one child can buy a house in Foxrock, Cornelscourt or the top end of Killiney and he has an asset which is appreciating at a minimum of 10 per cent per annum.  Even if he is paying 15 per cent on his mortgage his asset is rapidly appreciating while inflation runs at 21 per cent.  I implore the Minister to take action in next year's budget, otherwise we will not have a socially just structure in terms of housing.  Young people wish to marry in their early twenties and have a house.  At present they are marrying around the age of 25 and are living in miserable flats costing up to £30 per week.  These marriages are destroyed <Col N="1502" /> after five or six years and they cannot save a deposit for a house because we have a taxation structure which is manifestly unjust and inequitable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the proposition put forward by Deputy Desmond that reliefs of this sort should be at the standard rate of tax, not at the marginal rate.  This was a provision in my budget. The same argument applies in favour of tax credits as against tax allowances is because the benefit of tax allowances is given disproportionately to those who are best off and have the largest incomes. Likewise the benefit of relief of this sort is greatest in the case of those who have the highest incomes.  A person paying income tax at the rate of 60p in the £ benefits most from tax relief while the person who is not earning enough to pay tax does not benefit in any way.  Interest reliefs generally are a form of subsidisation of the better off by the less well off.</P>
      <P>It has also led to the building of more housing than we need for people in the high income bracket while we are not building enough houses for those in the lower income bracket who really need them.  Many of the latter are being forced on to the local authority housing list but if the cost of housing were not increased by trading up they could afford to buy or build their own homes.  The proposal which has been made here is reasonable. I am sorry the Minister was not able to implement it for what he called &ldquo;technical&rdquo; reasons.  I have no doubt that there are technical difficulties in this as in any new proposal but I do not believe technical reasons should ever be given by a Minister for not doing what he believes to be just.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to introduce an amendment on Report Stage to this and other sections which contain tax reliefs of this sort, requiring the Minister each year to lay before the House simultaneously with the Finance Bill the cost in revenue lost from the tax subsidies implicit in sections of this sort.  In the Government White Paper <i>A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances</i> it was proposed that each year a statement of tax expenditures, tax subsidies such as this, should be made.  Revenue <Col N="1503" /> lost by means of tax allowances is just as real as revenue spent by way of expenditure Estimates which we go through in detail each year after the money has been expended.  Tax expenditure of this sort should also be the subject of an annual debate and I should like to introduce an amendment to achieve that. Possibly in conjunction with the Finance Bill, the Minister would publish each year a report of the cost in terms of revenue lost from each of the tax allowances given from the basic rate to particular categories. The list would be quite long and we would discover that hundreds of millions of pounds are deliberately not being collected.  I am not saying that we should abandon all these tax reliefs but we should see transparently what those reliefs are costing us.  I will be proposing an amendment on Report Stage in respect of relief in this and other sections. The Minister might find that this statement would help him because it would show more clearly that the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister for Finance are not as ungenerous as they appear in the extent of the reliefs already being given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>These points have been raised on a few occasions and it is only right that I should give the advice available to me from the experts in the Revenue Commissioners who administer the system.  Insurmountable difficulties would have arisen in giving effect to this scheme for 1982-83.  One problem which would have arisen in the PAYE area is incapable of satisfactory solution within the existing system.  This stems from the proposal to give relief at the maximum rate of 35 per cent.  In the case of a PAYE taxpayer who is estimated before the start of the tax year to be marginally liable at rates in excess of 35 per cent, the interest allowable would in the first instance have to be converted into tax free allowance. This would involve the marginal rates of each taxpayer paying interest.  If the marginal rate were 60 per cent, tax free allowance on £1,000 interest would be £600. This would have to be reduced to £350 and accordingly the tax free allowance <Col N="1504" /> would be £583 which, at 60 per cent, equals £350.  Some payments of interest might have a number of marginal rates. Even with a satisfactory computer programme, which has not been devised, errors on a large scale would be inevitable because of difficulty in predicting marginal rates.  There would be delays in giving the correct tax relief to many taxpayers. Approximately 230,000 taxpayers are eligible for interest relief.</P>
      <P>Correct relief could be given only by large scale reviews at the end of the tax year.  It would not be possible to undertake this operation without the recruitment and training of a large number of extra staff.  In view of the lateness of the decision to introduce the 35 per cent limit and in view of all the other operating difficulties which would have to be overcome at the same time, there was no possibility that it could have been operated for 1982-83.  If suitable computer programmes could be developed some, but not all, of this additional work would be eliminated.  For instance, the problems inherent in predicting the relevant marginal rate would still remain.  It is likely that some considerable time would elapse before any such programme could become operational.  That is the main technical reason that I have given on a few occasions.  I do not expect the Deputies to fully understand all that I have just read out, but that is the advice that I have been given by the experts who operate this method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the point of the 35 per cent capital limit on loans, under existing interest provisions a simple certificate of interest paid shows the amount to be input to the computer which will automatically reject an amount which exceeds the maximum interest allowable.  There is no information in the computer or in the taxpayer's file which would enable existing cases in which interest is allowable to be put on the basis proposed in the January and March budgets.  Agreement of banks and other lending institutions would have to be obtained for the submission of a more detailed certificate of interest paid which would give, <i>inter alia,</i> the following information: the maximum amount of the loan; the rates <Col N="1505" /> chargeable during the period covered by the certificate; the purpose for which the loan was granted; whether it is secured by a mortgage; the date the loan was taken out.  The additional work involved for the banks in supplying the requirements listed would obviously be considerable and would probably result in special arrangements having to be made with bank staffs, including monetary compensation. Those two are basically the main reasons why it was not possible to implement the 27 January budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be one way of getting around this problem.  I must say that this entirely new explanation has surprised me somewhat.  I presume it was also new to the Minister because he incorporated this measure in his March budget, as I did in mine.  Indeed, it is a proposal which has been knocking around for quite some time and did not arise out of the blue in December.  I am surprised that these difficulties were not foreseen before the matter was incorporated in the budget.  However, would the Minister consider the possibility of converting this into a tax credit, in other words, instead of having an allowance which would affect marginal rates depending on whether one moved up or down, getting a lesser or a larger relief, there should be a fixed tax credit for interest which you either got or did not get.  It would not be affected one way or another by what rate of tax you are at. Would this be a way of achieving equity as between taxpayers?</P>

Would it not be productive to look at the possibility of a tax-free system a little more closely than would seem to have been done as a way of achieving this equality between taxpayers in regard to this matter?  I do not on the face of it accept that if one instituted it as a credit it would be necessary to convert it into an allowance, as the Minister says it is.  I would have <Col N="1507" /> thought that the appropriate method might be to collect tax in the normal way during the year as if there was no allowance for this purpose and at the end of the year, or at a particular point in the year, a refund could be made, either on a six-monthly or a yearly basis, in the form of a tax credit.  By not making the adjustment every week but by making it every year, admittedly people would be out of money for a while as they would be paying more tax, but they would get it all back at the end of the year.  That should make the job a little easier for the computer.  Would the Minister have a look at that?</P>

      <P>In page 38, before section 25, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;26.&mdash;Notwithstanding anything in the Tax Acts, interest paid on deposit accounts with a credit union shall qualify for relief as if it were an interest accruing from the Post Office Savings Bank.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The intention of this amendment is to extend the tax relief available to those saving in post offices and in the Dublin Savings Bank to credit unions, which at present do not have that relief.

      <P>The amendment proposes the extension to interest paid on deposit accounts registered with credit unions of the tax exemption of £150 or £300 in the case of married couples accorded in respect of interest on ordinary deposits with the Post Office Savings Bank and Trustee Savings Banks.  The problem about extending the exemption enjoyed by the various saving banks under section 344 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, to deposit interest paid by registered credit unions is that it would be difficult to justify merely extending the exemption to them.  Many financial institutions which are excluded from the exemption have since its introduction sought extension of the relief to them.  If the relief was extended to credit unions it would be difficult to continue to deny it to other institutions.  Such as extension could result in a disimprovement of the competitive position of those financial institutions which currently qualify for the relief.  There could be a shift of savings away from the Post Office Savings Bank and Trustee Saving Banks which are significant sources of Exchequer finances. The cost of extending it to credit unions would be £1 million in 1982 and £1½ million in a full year.  Deputy Bruton asked me the cost in relation to a building society. It will be £3 million in 1983.</P>

      <P>I should like to know where the money is coming from for it. Does the Minister consider that in general there is a confusing plethora of reliefs in respect of tax regarding interest received by people from a variety of institutions? There is one relief for the first £70 of interest which is invested in a bank. There is another system of relief in respect of a building society.  They only deduct 25 per cent in the pound.  Then there is what applies to post offices and now Deputy De Rossa is seeking to extend it to credit unions, which is not unreasonable in the circumstances.  Who benefits from all these reliefs?  I am not so sure that it is the savers but rather the institutions.  One institution competes with another.</P>
      <P>Representations were made to me by the ACC who felt that savings with them did not get the same tax benefits that savings in a bank or a building society got.  They wondered why they should not get it.  If we continue on like that with one relief leading to demands for other reliefs based on anomaly it would not be a good process.  What is the total cost to the Exchequer of reliefs of this kind?  Do they encourage savings at all?</P>

      <P>The credit union movement is a movement which assists small savers in the main.  There are few tax dodgers saving with credit unions mainly because the interest available is very small.  People usually use it when saving for holidays, household items and so on. When one considers that the commercial banks and building societies have this relief, the credit union movement have a very good case for having the same relief at least as the commercial banks.</P>
      <P>We put down amendment No. 67 which sought to ensure that the tax relief available to those saving up to £70 and £140 in the commercial banks and the relief available in building societies would not be used by people who simply wanted to avoid paying tax.  Unfortunately this has been ruled out of order. However, I ask the Minister to consider it and take it into account if ever he is producing another budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As a socialist I believe that all income should be subject to taxation.  If we start on that premise there is no excuse for giving relief on a sectoral basis to groups of people.  That is why I put down my amendment that interest paid on deposits held by all banks in the State shall have tax at the standard rate deducted at source and any excess of tax paid may be claimed by affected taxpayers. That is a basic principle from which we tend to depart.  If I was a businessman and wanted to put away a few bob without paying tax, all I would have to do is open a few post office accounts and claim relief.  Is that fair or equitable? It is not.  There are substantial sums of money held on deposit in banks which are not subject to tax.  We must put a stop to that.  It is an obvious source of tax avoidance and evasion.  Either we run the country with fairness, equity and justice or we indulge in escape routes and open up the £70 interest reliefs, £90 next year, <Col N="1512" /> £150 the following year and so on.  If we continue along that road we will come to the situation where the Government are bereft of revenue sources, as they are at present.</P>
      <P>Credit unions fulfil a magnificent socially desirable function in the community. If they enjoyed tax relief there are people who to avoid paying tax at a high rate would invest the odd £500 with them because they do not ask their depositors if they have X amount of income before they deposit something.  All one would have to do is go around various institutions, Post Office Savings Bank, the ACC, credit unions, Trustee Savings Bank and so on and invest money like a person putting down money who had obtained prior knowledge of Lady Diana's son's name, William, sure and certain of picking it up at the going rate.</P>
      <P>My amendment has been ruled out of order.  In relation to the section, all money deposited in banking institutions or held by banks in the State should have tax paid at the standard rate and deducted at source.  Massive evasion is going on at the moment which I estimate is to the tune of about £240 million per annum and these moneys are urgently needed by the State to run the country. God only knows what is kept in deposit boxes in banks by people who are also indulging in straightforward deposits without even bothering to collect their interest on the moneys, foolish people as they are because of the various devices which they can get away with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would favour giving assistance to credit unions along different lines.  I would give substantial moneys to the League of Credit Unions on an annual basis to promote the credit union system here and I would give special facilities in relation to giving certain segments of very low income persons an incentive to avail of credit unions.  There is a great need to convince young people particularly that they ought to save some money.  Very many young people here have incomes of £100 or £150 per week and they save no money at all, and particularly those in urban areas and do not have to pay rent because they live at home spend freely. One of the great arguments in favour of <Col N="1513" /> having VAT on clothes &mdash; although it is a past argument now &mdash; was that most clothes are bought by young people who have the highest percentage to spend. Very many young people who should save do not save.  Particularly they should save in order to buy their first home and I would encourage the credit unions to get into that area of saving.  One finds that the credit unions are used frequently by normally thrifty people who want to save, as Deputy De Rossa quite rightly pointed out, for a wedding coming up in the family or to go on a holiday or they put aside £600 or £700, as many an elderly person has said to me, for burial.  All that is done by a highly responsible segment of our saving population.</P>
    <P>I would give money to credit unions in a direction other than the interest-free direction because it is always the sharkie who has money to deposit and before you know where you are that person has an account in the credit union tax free, an account in the savings bank tax free and the daughter has another account in the Post Office Savings Bank tax free.  It is like the money sent home from America and deposited with the ACC, who do not declare the names and addresses of their depositors even to the Revenue Commissioners, and that is tax free.  So what do you do?  When your uncle goes back to America will you give him £1,000 to send home to put into deposit at the ACC?  I defy the Revenue Commissioners to get you into tax on that one.  That is another loophole.  I could go on and on.  Anybody with a reasonable degree of ingenuity could finish up probably paying no tax at all.</P>

I accept Deputy De Rossa's credentials for putting it forward, but it is open to abuse and unfortunately it is not the people who should be availing of credit union savings who will come in on it.  If we closed off the current loopholes <Col N="1514" /> in bank deposits we could bring in revenue of about £200 million a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> In referring to Deputy De Rossa's amendment I would like to comment on what Deputy Desmond has said.  He mentioned £240 million.  What we really want today is to encourage savings by thousands and thousands of young people.  I have often tried to conceive some way of encouraging them to save but the proposals which Deputy Desmond put forward indicated a negative approach.  The encouragement given by the various building societies, the Post Office Savings Bank and so on appeal to the lower paid section of the community.  We are not talking about the big depositors.  We are talking about schemes such as that in the Post Office for persons over 55 which gives special concessions as regards income tax.  Such concessions to such people are socially desirable.  Young people of 17, 18 and 20 years of age can earn substantial incomes now of £100 or £120 a week.  Some compulsory savings scheme should be introduced for people of that age group, although it would be better if they could be encouraged to save voluntarily, because it seems that a large volume of the money spent on luxury goods and so on is spent by that segment of our community.  A young man can go into a job at 18 or 20 years of age and get an income equal to that of somebody who is buying a house and rearing four children. Many such young people spend money in a way that could damage their whole career and we should try to devise a scheme whereby a certain proprtion of that income would be deducted by their employers who would put it into a savings scheme for those young employees.</P>
      <P>Savings should be encouraged and the small concessions given by the various societies are an encouragement to do this but, as Deputy Desmond has said, this is a charge on the Exchequer whereas money could be accruing to the Exchequer and under Deputy De Rossa's amendment it will accrue at some future date to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned here with trying to keep the budget deficit down.  The Minister <Col N="1515" /> has stated that the implementation of this amendment would cost between £1 million and £1.5 million.  We can look at this as our economy expands.  I know many of the credit unions throughout Dublin and they have done an excellent job.  I would encourage the movement because I have met several people who have succeeded in buying houses and getting bridging loans through the credit union system.  The people who organise the credit union movement on a voluntary basis are making a major contribution to society.</P>
    <P>Regarding all the amendments here, every Deputy in this House should take into consideration the financial state of the country and the additional charge that would be put on the Exchequer now. I would not apply the same principles as Deputy Desmond would apply as regards a flat rate of income tax on after the big from deposits.  I would go after the big depositor if that is what Deputy Desmond is talking about, but we were speaking about the small depositor.  Take for instance a single man and his girl friend who are trying to save a deposit for a house.  I see nothing wrong in encouraging them to save £2,000 or £3,000 for a deposit.  Indeed I would encourage them to save beyond that and thereby perhaps avoid being forced into a bridging loan through which many young people are being robbed by some of the lending societies.  Such people need encouragement, and the relief which they get on income tax is an incentive.  I encourage savings.  Savings are of vital importance.  We know the benefit of Post Office savings to the Exchequer.  This is something we must encourage.</P>

We put down the two amendments to close off the loophole used by people who control large amounts of money to avoid having to pay tax.  That is not only the case with the banks.  The building societies have fairly large investors hidden away also because of the standard rate of tax the building societies levy on investments with them rather than the higher rate to which the person investing openly would be liable.

It is proposed in this section to reduce this interval by three months.  If the Deputy's <Col N="1519" /> amendment were accepted the benefit to the Exchequer of the advancement by three months of the dates for payment of corporation tax would be lost.  This loss would amount to about £33 million in the financial year 1982 and would represent the postponement of the receipt of tax into the Exchequer in subsequent years. On that basis I could not accept this amendment.  It is not realistic for Deputies to argue that we should not bring forward the payment dates for corporation profits tax, bearing in mind that the PAYE taxpayer on Friday night or Thursday night, or whenever his pay day is, loses his tax there and then.  We are still talking about concessions of six to nine months after the financial year ends and I do not think this is probibitive.</P>

We will still be left with the same level of corporation profits tax in a normal year but there will be a larger expenditure next year by virtue of the fact that we abandoned aspects of the January budget and are paying for it in this way.  The long term situation will be worse.  We are comparing a once-off gain with a continuing loss.</P>

      <P>As noted in the list of amendments, Deputy Sherlock, Deputy Gallagher and I are opposed to this section on the basis that it is an undesirable precedent where a person enters into an agreement with a bank to borrow money and then finds he is unable to pay, and the Government step in and pay the bank interest or give some form of interest relief simply because the banks are not prepared to stand the loss.</P>
      <P>I believe the commercial banks were to a large degree responsible for the extraordinary high prices charged for agricultural land in the past few years.  It is extraordinary to expect the farmers to produce sufficient from the land to pay the interest, never mind the principal, on the money borrowed.  It was a very foolish and shortsighted policy of the banks to allow themselves to be used, or to use the farmers, to get deeper into the farming community.  It is a mistake at this point that the State should be stepping in to relieve the banks of their responsibilities and losses when one considers their profits run into hundreds of millions of pounds each year.  Therefore it is not unreasonable to expect that they would accept the losses which occur on their deals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief for the benefit of Deputy De Rossa, who may be under some misapprehension as to the intention of this measure, for which I claim paternity in some degree.  It has <Col N="1521" /> very little to do with the level of land prices.  This measure is aimed at not only land prices or the amount of money farmers paid for land; it has to do more with the very simple fact that when one starts a development plan borrowing at 10 per cent and the interest rate increases to 21 per cent, there is no profit left.  Whatever the situation, there is very little possibility that one will be able to earn enough money out of the investment to remunerate in full the 21 per cent interest rate. What has been happening is that people had to pay interest on interest outstanding as well as paying interest on the original sum.</P>
      <P>It is not true to say that this measure bails out the banks for their mistakes.  As the scheme has been set up, the cost of giving this interest reduction to the borrowers is shared between the banks and the State.  I wish the banks had contributed more but part of the reason it took so long to get the scheme into operation was that we were looking for more from the banks.  As the scheme stands, there is participation by the banks in the cost of operating the scheme.</P>
      <P>The benefit of the measure in question plus the banks' contribution goes directly to the people who borrowed from the bank in the form of a reduction in the interest rate payable on that amount of their borrowing which qualifies under the scheme.  This is an enabling measure to allow the banks to operate the scheme as it was agreed.</P>
      <P>Apart from the form of the scheme, there is no new principle involved in substance. We all wish the State did not find itself in a position of having to deal with this problem but, because of economic factors, an important sector of the economy is experiencing very serious difficulties. In my view, it is perfectly normal that the State should step in to protect employment and productive capacity in this sector, as in other sectors, by providing relief as is done in this measure.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Dukes.  Everybody wishes it was not necessary to make this provision but because of very harsh conditions experienced by <Col N="1522" /> the agricultural sector this measure is necessary and therefore is most welcome.</P>
      <P>Some time ago a number of farmers bought land and got into financial difficulties but it should be understood that the majority of farmers in severe financial difficulties did not buy land.  First, there are farmers who improved and modernised their farms &mdash; building improvements, milking parlours, silage pits and so on; second, others suffered losses because of brucellosis in their milking herds; and a third group suffered losses because of the failure of the bovine tubercullosis eradication scheme.  It will be a long time before many of these farmers are free from these debts.  All these problems were compounded by the exorbitantly high interest rates they had to pay. The banks could have gone further&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Looking at Deputy De Rossa, the Chair anticipates that we are getting into round two of the struggle we had earlier of penury versus plenty as far as the agricultural community is concerned.

      <P>Far be it from me to enter into contentious discussions with the Chair or Deputy De Rossa, but I wish to make these points in my own way and I will be brief, bearing in mind the number of sections yet to be covered.  The scheme providing for reduced interest rates for farmers in severe financial difficulty is too restrictive but I accept it has been of benefit to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear Deputy Enright and Deputy Dukes express their support in this matter as they did when in Government.  The majority of people realise that farmers are going through a difficult time.  The unfortunate thing regarding the farmers who will benefit under this interest subsidy is that they were the ones who contributed most to increased output. They developed as they were advised to do and subsequently found themselves in <Col N="1523" /> difficulty.  Deputy Dukes, as former Minister for Agriculture, and I worked both nationally and at EEC level to devise some system to help and two or three such systems were supported by both sides of the House.  This is giving legislative effect to one such system and it should be supported bearing in mind the difficulties of farmers who gave the lead since 1975 but who then found themselves in financial difficulties.  As Deputy Enright said, it would have been lovely to do more but that was not possible. However, what has been done will be of some help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The point has been made that what is happening here is that a subsidy is being paid to the banks for part of the interest due by farmers.  The fact that the banks are carrying part of that burden does not lead me to jump with joy given that they are the people who entered into agreements with the farmers.  Presumably if any of us enters into an agreement with the bank that institution will come after us for payments due but it will be pointless for us to go to the Minister for Finance or to anybody else looking for interest relief. Because of the lending policies of the banks they sucked in hundreds of farmers who got large loans and now they are trying to get out.  I wish to put on record that we oppose the section but I do not intend to drag the House through a division on it.  As Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil failed to support us on the resource tax, I would not expect to get any support from them on this issue either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving aside that rather gratuitous remark, I would like to say that the banks have a lot to answer for in the matter of the lending policies they have pursued.  They have no comprehensive early warning system about crises in any industry.  They do not gather together in any data bank upcoming trends in particular industries, whether it be agriculture or manufacturing.  The result is that those who should know best because they have the information are <Col N="1524" /> not using it to lend wisely to people and prevent them from getting into difficulty. One area of productive reform in the banking system would be to get them to use that information more intelligently than they do at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned regarding the provisions in this section and also in sections 30 and 31.  When the Capital Gains Tax Act was introduced in 1975 the normal rate of capital gains tax was 26 per cent.  Subsequent legislation in 1978 provided for an increase to 30 per cent but now the basic rate has been increased to 40 per cent.</P>
      <P>There is a serious cause of social unrest in that a number of people appear to have made millions without paying any tax.  I will give the House one example.  There were banner headlines in the <i>Irish Independent</i> when Patrick Gallagher spent £750,000 on a racehorse or when he made £3 million or £4 million on some other deal.  It is a cause of social unrest when individuals or families are seen to make much money without paying a proper rate of tax and it is necessary to have capital gains and other taxes to ensure that people do not cream off profits without paying their fair share.  However, unless there is a commonsense approach to capital gains there is the real possibility that considerable harm will be caused to the property market and to property valuse throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to state if he will give any allowances to farmers where they have to sell sites to meet bank repayments. Many farmers, because of pressure <Col N="1525" /> from the banks or financial institutions, are being forced to sell sites to meet their debts.  The present exemption limit of £2,000 for a married couple is not nearly enough.  I ask the Minister to give some proper allowances to people who have to sell land to repay their debts.  I frequently meet farmers who have to sell three or four sites for prices ranging from £3,000 to £5,000 per site but they find that nearly one-third of the sale price goes in capital gains tax.  I ask the Minister to tell the House his views on this matter and to state if he proposes to grant any exemptions.  I am speaking for quite a number of people in the farming community who are faced with this situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When a person decides to meet a commitment to the bank of £30,000 or £40,000 he should be exempt from capital gains tax.  Some farmers at present have debts of £50,000 to £100,000 on their holdings.  This is happening all too frequently.  They are faced with selling their farms, or alternatively, selling sites and portions of their land.  That is why I think this limit should be raised for the benefit of people who are engaged full time in farming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>These matters will be the subject of amendments which Deputy Dukes has put down and which I hope will be taken on Report Stage if we do not reach them now.  We should be very careful about the increase in the rate of capital gains tax.  I know this is not a fashionable view but I am afraid that the new high rate of capital gains tax may lead to a situation where investment will be choked off.  I know people say if you make the gain you should pay 60 per cent <Col N="1526" /> on it.  The reality is that for every person who makes a gain, there are a number of people who make a loss.  Up to now, the fact that capital gains tax was less than income tax took some account of the fact that there was a bigger risk element involved in capital investments as against ordinary income.  I am worried about the impact generally of this higher rate of capital gains tax on investment activity in our economy.  The Minister should watch it very carefully to make sure that this enthusiastic increase which he introduced does not choke off a source of jobs in our economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is merit in part of Deputy Bruton's argument in so far as we have been oscillating in the past five or six years in relation to rates of capital gains tax.  By virtue of the fact that we do not have an established, continued regime of capital taxation, investors are perturbed at the way politicians &mdash; not the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Finance &mdash; have changed the rates of taxation in response to all sorts of pressures and for devious purposes.  In relation to capital taxation they have done what they succeeded in doing in relation to farm taxation, where we have gone from one extreme to the other and back again with levies, resource tax and so on.  Nevertheless, having done all, that there are still substantial loopholes &mdash; for example, guaranteed income bonds.  If one goes to an insurance company and takes out a single premium fixed term insurance policy of three, five or seven years, the insurance company, by availing of the loopholes that exist, will guarantee a return of at present 16 per cent.  Of that 16 per cent only about 2 per cent would be liable for income tax, which is deducted at source at 35 per cent but liable to surcharge in the hands of higher marginal recipients.  The remaining 14 per cent is deemed to be tax free capital and at the end of the term the original sums are returned intact.  I would also like to draw the attention of the Minister to similar tax loopholes in relation to grow bonds and other insurance related to tax avoidance bonds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of equity, we need an examination <Col N="1527" /> into these matters.  I hope the report of the Commission on Taxation has dealt with it as I know the people who have been advising the Minister are more than capable of giving that information. Perhaps it would have been better if we had told the Revenue Commissioners to forget about capital taxation because we drive the Revenue Commissioners out of their minds trying to interpret what the politicians want them to do for a return of 0.5 per cent from capital taxation.  If we are not prepared to have a regime of capital taxation broadly based, properly related, then we should forget about it.  I am in favour of having such a regime but so far in this country we do not have it.</P>

      <P>I must comment on what the last two speakers said.  They have overstated the case and in doing so have distorted the whole picture in relation to the sale of land.  To listen to them one would think that land was sold purely for the purpose of farmers paying back their debts.  That is not so.  That constitutes only a very small section of land sales. Most land here is sold to make money. Some people have made windfall profits from such sales and have paid very little taxation.  I know some farmers are in debt but you cannot ignore the whole picture. If there are concessions for some farmers who are in debt, the rest of them will take advantage of those concessions as they have done over the years.  The Minister should attempt to reconcile the rights of private property with the rights of an increasing population to housing.  The rights of people to housing are paramount <Col N="1528" /> in our society.  We must not be constantly considering a minority of farmers who, through foolishness or greed, have put themselves in debt.  If I could borrow £100,000 tomorrow I would be very pleased.  It says a lot for our society that those people had the money ladled out to them over the years, sometimes for foolish investment.  In order to have housing for our people an effort must be made to control the price of building land and to bring the two into some kind of line.  I have had enough of this béal bocht as far as the farmers are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not reply to that provocation.  There are two specific prefiguring matters I want to refer to which apparently we will now have to bring up on Report Stage.  Both have to do with section 28 of the Principal Act and I had two amendments down in that respect.  I will explain their purpose briefly to the Minister.  One was designed, as far as we could do it, to ensure that when a gain on a capital asset on the sale of farmland is realised and the gain is used to liquidate part or all of an existing debt, the provisions of section 28 of the Principal Act would apply to that capital gain on the sale of that portion of the asset.  The second amendment would cover the sale of a capital asset, the asset being a farm of land.  If a similar asset is bought for a smaller amount of money and development work is carried out on the land of an amount equal to the difference between the two, we were seeking to bring about a situation when the rollover relief would apply to the development. The essential purpose of the two was to bring within the spirit of the section of the Principal Act a wider range of activity which would still have to do with the maintenance of the same type of production from the same kind of assets.</P>

    <P>I wish to raise a few more matters in the short time left to me.  <i>The Irish Times</i> carried an article headed &ldquo;T.D. Sat on (File) for Months&rdquo;.  That was on 30 June. When one considers the time factor in all <Col N="1531" /> this, that the information I had received was given to me on 5 February in the middle of a general election campaign, and that the new Government took over on 9 March, I suggest a more appropriate heading would have been &ldquo;T.D. Sat on (File) for Days&rdquo;, not months.  The author of the article obviously had been given information from inside the Údarás relating to the allegations I made at that time.</P>
    <P>Much of what I said was borne out in one case and the author had the courtesy to point out that payments of PAYE and PRSI which had been in arrears by the company, were being paid at the insistence of Údarás na Gaeltachta at the rate of £5,000 per month.</P>
    <P>The article also referred to me having changed my stance, that I began to talk later about an interdepartmental committee. At no time did I mention an investigation by an interdepartmental committee, good, bad or indifferent.  How this piece of concoction arose I do not know, but I refute it.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refute the allegation that all these matters have already been cleared up within the Údarás.  At the time I referred to an internal audit signed by an auditor within the Údarás stating that all financial control had broken down in this company.  In this article it was stated that the matter was referred to an independent company of accountants.  What I am saying now is that the independence of that company must be in some doubt as some of the people involved in that company have other dealings with the Údarás.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to a company known as ABM, Rosmuc, County Galway, which was closed in April 1980.  But, despite that, the workers in that factory were paid their weekly wage right through the year 1980 up to the end of that year under the heading of a retraining grant.  It so happens that the factory was closed and that no form of retraining took place during that eight or nine month period.  Yet money was paid under that heading.</P>

      <P>1980 i ABM Rosmuc.  I would also like to refer to machinery grants.  I sought to raise this matter with the Údarás at the time because I felt that the payment of machinery grants in certain cases gave rise to abuse because the conditions under which such grants ought to be paid were not being fulfilled.  For example, the machinery grants in respect of things like tractors and other heavier machinery were to be paid to contractors who would carry out work on behalf of their neighbours and so on and these grants were given to people who were never involved in contracting work and whose documentary proof at application time was such that it left a lot to be desired.  In fact in some cases there was very scant evidence of any bookkeeping on the part of the applicants.  These grants, some of them substantial grants, were given to people who were non-contractors. In fact in one case a prominent member of the Údarás itself sought to have such grant paid to a person who lived outside the Gaeltacht and who was an employee in a full-time capacity of the person who was sitting on the board of Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>These are the kinds of things which brought me into this House and which have me saying the things I am saying.  It gives me no pleasure to say this.  The Minister has made certain proposals. What the Minister is dealing with is the future of the Údarás and its future activities and I accept that and I am sure he accepts that.  What I am saying to him is that with the best will in the world he will have the utmost difficulty in implementing the worth-while proposals he is making without the goodwill and the full co-operation of the Údarás.  He knows that as well as I do.</P>

Only yesterday did the Minister have a reaction from the present members of the Údarás to his suggestions. I have no doubt that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong.  The Minister gave the impression last night in this House, or at least my interpretation of what the Minister said was that he came to the conclusion he came to and formulated the proposals he formulated after a long series of consultations with the Údarás.  My information is that the Minister had two short meetings with the board of Údarás na Gaeltachta and that the long consultations he refers to possibly took place with the executive of Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>Is é an rud atá le rá agamsa ná gurb éigean go mbeidh an comhoibriú atá an tAire ag súil leis le fáil aige ó bhaill tofa an Údaráis toisc go gceapann siadsan go ndeachaidh an tAire thar a gcloigeann agus go ndearna sé socruithe le daoine &mdash; ní baill tofa den Údarás nó baill de bhord an Údaráis &mdash; daoine atá ar fáil ag an Údarás, daoine a bhí istigh ar na cainteanna a bhí ag an Aire leis an Údarás, má bhí sé i gcainteanna leo.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances I do not think the Minister can expect the kind of co-operation that he seeks and which he will need to perform in the way in which he expects the Údarás to perform.  In the light of all I have said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Tá a fhios go bhfuil an <Col N="1534" /> tAire ag súil, but surely, to sit down in Dáil Éireann and say he will be &ldquo;ag súil leis&rdquo; is just not good enough in these circumstances?  Again we are talking about the future operation of Údarás na Gaeltachta.  What this motion is about is their past activities which is a different thing.</P>
      <P>I understand from what the Minister said last night that he is prepared to go some distance towards meeting the demands made by us in relation to an inquiry into the activities of the Údarás.  What I am saying is I welcome the distance the Minister has come towards us in that line. But I put it to him that unless he is prepared to go some little bit further and take into his own hands the means and wherewithal so that he can implement what he proposes, which is the absolute minimum that any Minister would seek, we will have to press ahead with our demand for a judicial inquiry.</P>
      <P>I would also like to get clarification on the outcome of an inquiry by the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies. To whom do this committee report?  If they establish that there was corruption, can they refer their findings to the DPP or are they confined to reporting to this House?  These are matters which ought to be clarified because the occasion may arise.  The whole question depends on how far the Minister is prepared to go.  I do not want to be accused of seeking a pound of flesh.  I am not bloody minded in this matter.</P>
      <P>Tá mé ag iarraidh, mar a dúirt mé cheana, an oiread agus is féidir a dhéanamh comhoibriú leis an Aire.  Tá mé ag iarraidh sin ar son muintir na Gaeltachta agus ar son na hoibre atá ar siúl ag Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Mar a dúirt mé cheana, ní chuireann sé pioc áthais ormsa seasamh anseo agus na rudaí seo a rá.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh deireadh leis an obair seo sar i bhfad agus go mbeidh chuile thaobh den Teach seo sásta glacadh leis an cinneadh atá déanta.  Ach muna mbeidh an tAire sásta teacht ar an dá bhóthar, bóthar an Achta agus an bóthar atá á mholadh aige féin, ní dóigh liom gur féidir linn géilleadh dó.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom á rá ar <Col N="1535" /> dtús gurb é an príomh pointe sa díospóireacht seo aréir agus anocht ná an saghas fiosruithe ba chóir a chur ar fáil i leith imeachtaí Udarás na Gaeltachta agus níl sé i gceist an cóir nó nach cóir an fiosrú sin a dhéanamh.  Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil mé féin agus mo pháirtí i bhfabhar Údarás láidir daonlathach saor ó pholaitíocht agus ó pháirtíocht.  Ar eagla go bhfuil míthuiscint ann, is mian liom a rá nach bhfulimid in aghaidh na Gaeilge nó in aghaidh na Gaeltachta.  A mhalairt ar fad atá i gceist.</P>
      <P>Tá sé ráite agam cheana, agus deirim aris é, nach aontaím le monarchana a chur ar bun in áiteanna nach bhfuil fiú aon tseans acu.  Tá géarghá le plean forbartha ceart do na réimsí eagsúla a bhaineann le saol na Gaeltachta agus ag cur san áireamh oideachas le béim ar an saol teicneolaíochta, talmhaíochta, iascaireachta agus forbairt chalafort, seirbhísí mar bhóithre, séarachas, uisce agus teileafón. Go dtí go dtugtar faoi na rudaí seo is beag seans atá ag tionsclaíocht dul chun cinn a dhéanamh sa Ghaeltacht.  Ba chóir go mbeadh béim faoi leith ar achmhainní nádúrtha na háite mar iascaireacht, talmhaíocht agus feirmeoireacht éisc.  Mar a cheapann Udarás na Gaeltachta féin faoi láthair, tá job do-dhéanta caite chucu.  Chomh maith le sin tá brú polaitíochta á chur orthu cabhrú le tacaíocht costasach pé páirtí a bhíonn i gcumhacht. Ba mhaith liom go ndéanfaí fiosrú poibli ar obair Údarás na Gaeltachta féachaint an bhféadfaí cabhrú leo job níos fearr agus níos eiféachtúla a dhéanamh.  Ba mhaith liom go bpléfí pleanáil forbairt agus na cumhachtaí a theastódh ón Údarás i dtreo is go ndéanfaí forbairt ar bhonn réadúil cuimsitheach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point of this discussion is not whether there should be an inquiry.  That battle has already been fought and won. The Minister declared on taking office that there was no need for an inquiry. Subsequently he said he was not convinced of the need for an inquiry but that he was prepared to try to put things right. Now he is willing to admit that there may be something wrong and that an inquiry is needed.  What we are trying to decide in this debate is whether this would best <Col N="1536" /> be achieved by a judicial inquiry or by an examination carried out by the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.</P>
    <P>It is agreed by all in this House that the language and the Gaeltacht are an important part of our culture and should be assisted.  Despite the fact that this has been the policy of various Governments throughout more than 50 years, the Gaeltacht has continued to decline and the language has continued to die.  During the past ten or 12 years £100 million has been lost through investments in enterprises which were not merely lame ducks but dead ducks.  The control and the policy formation of the Údurás has been lacking.  We have not at any time implied that the staff were in any way misappropriating this money.  We consider that it was a question of mismanagement and miscalculation, simply an over-enthuasism to show that some progress was being made.  While this was being done the language was dying and the Gaeltacht was shrinking.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party were criticised recently because we refused to support an attempt by Fine Gael to defeat the Gaeltacht Estimate.  It was said that if we had supported Fine Gael we would have been doing something for the people of the Gaelatacht and would have been voting in favour of an inquiry.  We rejected that line of argument.  An attempt was being made to use the people of the Gaeltacht as a political football at a time when Fine Gael were looking for an opportunity to embarrass the Government.  We rejected that attempt because to defeat the Estimate would have been to cause hardship to the people of the Gaeltacht, something we are supposed to be trying to avoid and something which the Department of the Gaeltacht were established to prevent.</P>
    <P>We must decide whether a judicial inquiry or examination by the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies is the best course.  The Fine Gael Deputies who have spoken have not indicated the advantages of a judicial inquiry over the latter.  I am inclined to lean towards the Government's proposal because it appears that a judicial inquiry would be very costly and could take a long time to establish.  In the meantime the Údarás <Col N="1537" /> must continue to function.  Perhaps the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies could investigate the operation of the Údarás more effectively and efficiently and without causing the disruption which an official inquiry might cause. I would ask speakers who follow me to indicate what they see as the advantages or disadvantages of the two possible forms of inquiry.  If the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party are willing to accept the Minister's proposal for an examination by the Joint Committee, we are willing to agree with that, given whatever information we receive on the merits or otherwise of that course.</P>
    <P>There is an urgency about this matter. Discussions as to whether there have been malpractices or mismanagement of the Údarás companies and functions have gone on too long.  We have been raising the matter since 1977, which is five years. It is only in the past week, however, that the Government have agreed that something needs to be looked into.  Whatever judicial system we decide on tonight, or whether it be the responsibility of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, it must be got under way within the next few weeks, if untold and irreparable harm is not be be done to the Gaeltachtaí.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, tá súil agam nach gceapfaidh éinne go bhfuilim siniciúil nuair adeirim gur labhraíodh níos mó Gaeilge an mhí seo sa Dháil ná ar labhraíodh le fada, agus is maith an rud sin.  Tá díomá orm féin go gcaithfimid cúrsaí na Gaeltachta a phlé sna téarmaí seo, ach ag an am chéanna, táim sásta glacadh go bhfuil gach duine i ndáiríre faoin méid adúirt siad san díospóireacht seo go dtí an t-am seo.  Is é mo thuairim gurb é an toradh is fearr a thiocfaidh as ná go mbeimid d'aon guth faoi chursaí na Gaeltachta agus faoi chúrsaí an Údaráis amach anseo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ón am a bunaíodh an Stát, glac Teachtaí Dála le chuile shórt dearcadh polaitíochta go raibh tábhacht ar leith ag baint leis an teanga agus go háirithe go raibh tábhacht ag baint leis na Gaeltachtaí éagsúla.  Ón chéad lá san Dáil, ghlac Teachtaí leis an cúram speisialta a <Col N="1538" /> bhí orthu rud fiúntach a dhéanamh i leith na Gaeilge agus i leith na nGaeltachtaí. Caithfidh mé mo thuairimí pearsanta a nochtadh ar an gcéad dul síos, is é sin, go gcuireann sé iontas orm i gcónaí an méid tuarascálacha atá curtha i gcló faoi chúrsaí Ghaeilge agus Gaeltachtaí agus, ag an am chéanna, an chaoi ina bhfuilimid ag teip aon dul chun cinn fiúntacht a dhéanamh &mdash; nílim ag caitheamh anuas ar aon mhaitheas atá bainte amach, ach ag an am chéanna tá gá le polasaí níos éifeachtaí chun na fadhbanna atá sna Gaeltachtaí a shárú.</P>
    <P>Ar 4 Márta 1925, scríobh Uachtarán an Executive a bhí ann ag an am, an tUasal Mac Cosgair, go dtí General Mulcahy agus leag sé síos bun-téarmaí an chéad iniúcadh a déanadh ar chúrsaí Ghaeltachta.  On am sin, cuireadh ar bun an chéad Coimisiún um Chúrsaí Ghaeltachta. Ceapaim gur iontach an méid a mhol an tuarascáil sin.  Is suimiúil a choimeád i gcuimhne i gcónaí gur chuir an coimisiún an tuarascáil i gcló, agus an tsuim go léir a bhí ag baint leis, leis na costais chlódóireachta na £625.  Caitheadh a lán airgid ó 1925 ar thuarascálacha éagsúla faoi chúrsaí Ghaeilge agus Gaeltachta.  Cuirfeadh sé iontas ar éinne an fiúntas atá ag baint leis na moltaí a cuireadh os cómhair an phobail i 1925, mar shampla, cúrsaí talmhaíochta.  Ar alt 134 den tuarascáil, chuir siad moladh os comhair na Dála i leith cúrsaí tréidliachta, mar shampla, veterinary services:</P>
    <P>It is urged upon the Commission by different witnesses that very serious loss occurs throughout the Gaeltacht through disease and death of farm stock, including poultry.  The Commission is convinced that this is so and recommends the assistance of local veterinary services.</P>
    <P>That a system of local veterinary services, including dispensaries be established.  A veterinary surgeon should be located as centrally as possible in suitable districts and his services given entirely free to any bona fide land holder or cottager the total valuation of whose holding does not exceed £10.  He should give similar <Col N="1539" /> services on a graduated scale of charges to land holders whose total valuation exceeds £10.</P>
    <P>I 1975 chuala mé an moladh sin ó dhuine a bhí i ndáiríre faoin Ghaeltacht, vet óg, agus cheap mé go raibh mé ag éisteacht don chéad uair le moladh maith, ach bhí sé ann agus i gcló ó 1925.</P>
    <P>Má léann éinne na moltaí éagsúla a cuireadh os comhair an phobail ag an am, tuigfidh sé chomh leathan is a bhí na moltaí éagsúla.  Níor bhain siad amháin le cúrsaí talmhaíochta: bhain siad le cúrsaí tionsclaíochta agus mar sin, mar shampla, cúrsaí margaíochta éisc, an tábhacht agus na buntáistí a bhí ag baint le brand name a bheith ann maidir le díol scadán.  Mar adúirt mé, is iontach an chiall atá ag baint leis na moltaí sin. Bhíodar an-ionraiciúl ar fad faoi na deacrachtaí a bhí ann ar leibhéal teanga agus ar leibhéal cúrsaí sóisialta agus eacnamaíochta agus an tábhacht a bhí ag baint leo, gan na ghnáth-gnéithe a mheascadh suas le chéile.  In alt 2 ar leathanach 3 den tuarsacáil a luaigh mé, dúirt Liam Mac Cogair ina litir go dtí General Mulcahy:</P>
    <P>We recognise the facts and the factors that have militated in the past and, by force of continuity, still militate in large part against the very existence of the Irish language; its exclusion from most of the activities of public life, from court and bar and business, its exclusion for generations from nearly all our schools, how it fell under a kind of social ban and became, in the minds of many, a badge of poverty and backwardness. The neglect and contempt, the ignominy and the abuse to which it has been subjected are a part of our tragic history.  These very things and their unfortunate effects, instead of infecting us with their spirit and making us also contemptuous and apathetic ought rightly to enliven our purpose to undo the damage of the past, the more so because the possession of a cultivated national language is known by every people who has it to be a secure guarantee of the national future.  Our language has been waylaid, beaten and <Col N="1540" /> robbed and left for dead by the wayside and we have to ask ourselves is it to be allowed to lie there, or if we are to heal its wounds, place it in safety and under proper case and have it restored to health and vigour?</P>
    <P>On am sin ar aghaidh, cuireadh a lán tuarascálacha i gcló, tuarascálacha éagsúla a raibh téarmaí tagartha éagsúla acu, mar shampla, is féidir tuarascáil Chomisiúin um Athbheochain na Gaeilge, 1963, a lua a dhírigh ar chúrsaí ceart.  Is féidir <i>Gníomh don Ghaeltacht</i> a cuireadh i gcló i 1971 a lua.</P>
    <P>An rud a chuireann íontas orm, agus deirim arís é, an chaoi ina rabhamar ag tosnú an t-am go léir.  Idir na blianta 1926 agus 1971, cailleadh an chuid is mó de dhaonra na ndaoine óga, go háirithe iad san faoi bhun 30 bhliain d'aois.  Tháining meath ar bunstructúr na Gaeltachta, ar na scoileanna, ar na tithe agus ar an saol sóisialta.  Gan dabht ar bith, is féidir a rá go raibh an imirce ar cheann des na galair is measa a bhrú riamh ar mhuintir na hÉireann.  Is muintir na Gaeltachta a d'fhulaing an galar sin i bhfad níos measa ná aon dream eile san oileán seo.  Táim ag déanamh tagartha do chúrsaí mar seo chun an cás a dhéanamh go gcaithfimid aon rud atá ann sa Ghaeltacht a chothbháil agus a fheabhsú.  Dírím meon an Tí seo ar an méid a dúirt Liam Mac Cosgair i 1925 go gcaithfimid foghlaim as na botúin atá thart, go gcaithfimid tús nua b'fhéidir a dhéanamh agus sin an fáth go mbeadh feabhas iontach agus toradh maith ag baint leis más féidir linn bheith ar aon ghuth ag deireadh na hoibre anocht.  Tá Teachtaí ar chuile thaobh den Teach seo sásta glacadh leis go dtarlaíonn a leithéid i dtaobh comhlachtaí eile de ghnáth.  Tarlaíonn sin go minic.  Táim sásta nach bhfuil siad, b'fhéidir, ag cómhlíonadh na gcoinníollacha atá leagtha síos sa Companies Act.  Glacaim go bhfuil cás ann, b'fhéidir, ceisteanna a fhreagairt i dtaobh sin, ach tar éis sin a rá, caithfidh mé filleadh i gcónaí don bhuncheist atá agam, is é sin, an bhfuilimid ar leas na Gaeltachta nó an Ghaeilge muna gcuirimid fiosrúchán breithiúnach ar siúl?</P>
    <P>Dúirt daoine atá i bhfogus dom go <Col N="1541" /> bhfuil amhras ar an phobail i leith cúrsaí an Údaráis, go bhfuil ceisteanna ann futhu agus go mba cheart na ceisteanna sin a fhreagairt.  Im thuairim féin, tá costas mór ag baint le fiosrúchán den tsórt sin.  Ag an am chéanna, bhí gach seans ag na polaiteoirí ceisteanna a chur. Caithimid rogha a dhéanamh idir fiosrúchán breithiúnach agus fiósrúchán ag an chomhchoiste.  B'fhéidir go mba cheart dúinn ar an gcéad dul síos ceisteanna a chur ar an Aire, agus tiocfaidh mé ar ais air sin.  Dúirt an Teachta Kenny nach mbeidh buntáiste ag baint le fíosrúchán an chomhchoiste mar nach féidir leis an fiosrúchán sin a bheith ann go dtí an fomhar.  Iarraim ar an Aire an féidir linn na cruinnithe den chomhchoiste a bheith againn roimh deireadh na míosa seo?  An féidir linn na baill den chomhchoiste a cheapadh, an Cathaoirleach a cheapadh agus glacadh leis go mbeidh cúrsaí Údarás na Gaeltachta ar an chlár acu taobh istigh de mhí?</P>
    <P>Más féidir leis an Aire geallúint mar sin a thabhairt dúinn, athríonn sé an argóint i bhfábhar fiosrúcháin sa chomhchoiste. Chomh maith le sin tá a lán den fhírinne ag baint leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an dara Teachta a labhair ar son Fhine Gael sa Teach anocht, i dtaobh cumhachtaí an Aire i leith cúrsaí na nGaeltachtaí. An chaoi is fearr chun an cheist sin a réiteach, sílim, ná más féidir leis an chomhchoiste cruinniú a bheith acu taobh istigh de chúpla seachtain.  Más féidir, bheadh siad in ann a gcéad tuarascáil, nó réamhthuarascáil a bheith os comhair na Dála acu taobh istigh de chúpla mí.  Bheadh a lán buntáistí ag baint leis sin.</P>
    <P>Ansin, nuair thagaimid ar ais sa bhfómhar b'fhéidir go mbeidh reamhthuarascáil, preliminary report, againn taobh istigh de achar beag.  Bheadh ciall ag baint le sin.  Bheadh an comhchoiste in ann a gceisteanna a dhíriú ar chúrsaí an Tí.  Má tá gá leis an mbun-Acht a leasú tar éis sin, bheadh an comhchoiste in ann díriú ar an cheist sin agus bheadh Teachtaí in ann an díospóireacht a dhéanamh faoi na leasuithe ba chóir a ghlacadh.</P>
    <P>Sa méid atá le rá agam táim ag iarraidh aontas a bhaint amach faoi chúrsaí an <Col N="1542" /> Údaráis Fillfidh mé anois ar an bhuncheist. Tá cúrsaí dífhostaíochta go dona ar fud na tíre.  Sa Ghaeltacht táimid ag cailliúint postanna go fairsing agus má ghlactar gurb é céad aidhm eagraisí forbartha ar bith fostaíocht a chur ar fáil, caithfidh siad bheith saor chun tionsclaíocht a lorg thar lear agus tionsclóirí a mhealladh chun tionscail a bhunadh.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh seans againn sa Teach structúir bhunúsacha an Údaráis a phlé nuair a thiocfaidh an tuarascáil ar ais ón chomhchoiste.  Ar an ábhar sin, ba cheart dúinn na bunstructúir sin a phlé anseo.</P>
    <P>Is é mo thuairimse, agus mé ag iarraidh rogha a dhéanamh idir fhiosrúchán breithiúnach agus fiosrúchán sa chomhchoiste, nach mbeadh ámhras ar éinne tar éis fhiosrúchán bhreithiúnach a chur i ngnó, ach chuirfeadh fiosrúchán den tsórt sin stop le obair an Údaráis agus bheadh gnáth-mhuintir na Gaeltachta níos measa as.  Chomh maith le sin, bheadh costas ag baint leis agus ní bheadh aon dualgas ar an bhfiosrúchán moltaí a dhéanamh chun forbairt na Gaeltachta. Ar an lámh eile, b'fhéidir leis an chomhchoiste airgead a chaitheamh chun saothar taighde, mar a dhéanann siad, mar shampla, ar structúir éagusla in eagraisí forbartha ar fud na hEorpa.  Bheadh an comhchoiste in ann moltaí a chur os ár gcomhair agus bheadh seans againn léarmheas a dhéanamh ar na moltaí sin. Chomh maith le sin, na ceisteanna i dtaobh an Údaráis, cuireadh iad ó pholaiteoirí agus ba cheart go mbeadh seans ag na polaiteoirí féachaint isteach iontu agus ceisteanna a chur ar bhaill den Údarás.  Bheadh sé sin i bhfad níos fearr ná dlíodóirí a bheith ag tuilleadh airgid uafásach as an rud go léir.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh mé rud amháin ar mo shon féin a dhéanamh soiléir agus iarr aim ar lucht an Phreasa bheith an-soiléir faoi seo. Cúpla mí ó shin cuireadh alt í gcló faoin teideal &ldquo;Caimiléireacht san Údarás&rdquo; agus pictiúr dom féin faoi bhun an teidil sin. Chuir mé ceartúchán amach agus cuireadh i gcló an ceartúchán sin san pháipéar céanna agus dúirt mé nár bhain mé úsáid riamh &mdash; agus níl mé ag baint usáid as anois &mdash; as an téarma seo &ldquo;caimiléireacht&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1543" /> Deirim arís an méid a dúirt mé ag an am agus tá sé tábhachtach.  Má tá tú chun eagraíocht a bhunadh chun cúram na forbartha a thógaint san Ghaeltacht caithfidh tú ligean don eagraíocht sin i gcúrsaí riaracháin bheith saor ó aon chur isteach ó na polaiteoirí.  Dúirt mé go raibh deacrachtaí ann i gcónaí ón chéad uair a bunaíodh an tUdarás.  Bhí trí ghnéithe meascaithe suas le chéile a ba cheart dúinn a choinneail óna chéile.  Ceann acu an gné pholasaí.  Glacaim go hiomlán go mba cheart do muintir na Gaeltachta seans a bheith acu i gceapacháin pholasaithe. Tar éis sin a dhéanamh má ghlacann tú, mar shampla, le straitéis agus go bhfuil an tionsclaíocht, an talmhaíocht agus seirbhísí mar chuid de, caithfidh tú i ngnáth riaracháin an pholasaí sin an seans a thabhairt do na hoifigigh lán-aimseartha den Údarás na polasaithe sin a chur i gcrích.</P>
    <P>Dúirt mé go raibh an iomarca cur isteach ag an ghné pholaitíochta den Údarás ar an ghné riaracháin.  Deirim é seo arís anocht &mdash; agus tá súil agam go mbeidh seans agam filleadh ar an téama seo &mdash; go gceapaim go bhfuil laige mór ag baint leis an Údarás.  Impim ar an Aire é seo a mheabhrú nuair a bheidh an plean eacnamaíochta ar leibhéal náisiúnta á phlé san Teach seo.  Táimid ag déanamh iarracht rud a dhéanamh nach bhfuil aon tír eile ag déanamh agus ba cheart go mbeadh, ní amháin plean ann ar leibhéal náisiúnta ach plean réigiúnach ann.  Tá mé ag rá arís agus arís eile nach féidir leat aon pholasaí fiúntach i leith na Gaeltachta a chur i gcrích ach amháin i gcomhthéasc pleanáil réigiúnach.  Má ghlactar le sin tá mé sásta níos mó cumhachtaí a thabhairt don Údarás ná mar atá acu faoi láthair.  Níl aon mhaitheas bheith ag cur an chúraim ar an Údarás dífhostaíocht a leigheas agus postanna a chur ar fáil agus gan na háiseanna acu é sin a dhéanamh. Nuair a thosnaigh Gaeltarra bhí buntáistí ag Gaeltarra thar an IDA.  Níl na buntáistí atá ag an Údarás anois i gcomparáid leis an IDA, ach táimid ag iarraidh ar an Údarás go minic an tionsclaiocht céanna a chur ar fáil i gcoinníollacha i bhfad níos deacra ná aon áit eile san tír. Caithfidh Teachtaí bheith sásta a n-aghaidh <Col N="1544" /> a dhíriú ar na constaicí sin agus bheith sásta, más gá leis, níos mó cumhachtaí a thabhairt don Údarás.</P>
    <P>Ar deireadh na díospóireachta seo anocht i leith an Údaráis, tá mé ag súil go mbeimid d'aonghuth go bhfuil gá le fiosrúchán ar céard atá tar éis tarlú agus go ndíreófar an fiosrúchán ar cérb é an polasaí is ceart a bheith ag an Údarás amach anseo, agus tar éis sin go mbeadh misneach ag iadsan atá ag obair don Údarás.  Nuair atáimid ag caint faoi na daoine atá ag obair do Údarás na Gaeltachta caithimid cuimhniú gur iontach an méid daoine a thugann cúl le bheith ag obair san chuid phríobháideach den chóras eacnamaíochta agus atá sásta glacadh leis an dúshlán bheith in a seirbhísigh phoiblí.  Smaoinímis ar na daoine atá sásta ní hé amháin sin a dhéanamh ach an Ghaeilge a úsáid chuile lá i bhforbairt na hEireann agus ar son na daoine atá ag iarraidh an teanga a choinneáil beo.  Ba cheart go mbeimís an-mhórálach as na hoifigigh sin.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh níos mó misnigh acu taréis anocht; go mbeidh siad in ann a rá go bhfuil gach duine i nDáil Éireann sásta gnáth-uirlísí an Stáit a úsáid chun iniúchadh a dhéanamh ar chúrsaí an Údaráis agus gur féidir leo leanúint leis an obair atá le déanamh ag súil go dtiocfaidh rud fiúntach as.  Mar shampla, mar a dúirt mé, tá laige ann i leith an chaoi in a measctar suas cúrsaí riaracháin, cúrsaí polaitíochta, cúrsaí eacnamaíochta agus chomh maith le sin tá an polasaí tionsclaíochta an-chúng ar fad.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Teachta De Rossa agus is minic a dúirt mé féin go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos fearr dá gcuirfí jobanna san Ghaeltacht ar siúl ar rátaí níos moille dá mba rud é go raibh siad ar bhonn níos fearr.  Mar aon uair a theipeann ar aon rud i réigiún lag i dtír ar bith éalaíonn ráflaí mórthimpeall nach bhfuil chun éirí leis i gcúrsaí tionsclaíochta.  Mar shampla, theip ar chúpla crainn san 19ú aois agus tá daoine ag rá beagnach inniu nach féidir leat crainn a chur i gConamara. Tá rud éigin ag tarlú faoi chúrsaí tionsclaíochta agus tá seans iontach againn ach amháin bheith sásta pleanáil i gceart agus úsáid a bhaint as fionntraíocht Stáit, cur i gcás, structúr <Col N="1545" /> ceart tionsclaíochta a bhunadh sa Ghaeltacht ar acmhainní nádúrtha.  Ba cheart bheith dóchasach i gcónaí i gcúrsaí mar seo.  Tá daonra nua sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá daoine óga ann.  Is féidir seans nach raibh ann riamh cheana a thabhairt dóibh.  Mar shampla, ní raibh aon eolas againn faoi chúrsaí feirmeoireachta éisc deich mbliain ó shin.  Tá eolas againn anois agus is féidir linn torthaí iontacha a bhaint amach ar son an daonra ach cur faoi.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart dúinn an fiosrúchán a chur ar siúl agus na cúrsaí go bhfuil amhras ag an bpobal futhu a scrúdú chun deireadh a chur leis an amhras trí fhreagraí a thabhairt ar na ceisteanna go poiblí, le ceart agus go rialta.  Dá réir sin impím ar an Aire glacadh leis an moladh atá déanta againn, is é sin, freagra a thabhairt ar an argóint sin atá déanta ag an Teachta Kenny &mdash; más rud é go nglacaimid leis an leasú &mdash; go mbeidh moill ag baint leis an chomhcoiste.  Más féidir le urlabhraí ar son Fhianna Fháil glacadh leis an moladh go mbeidh an comhchoiste ann, go mbeidh cruinniú againn, go mbeidh na baill ceapaithe agus an cathaoirleach tofa agus an tÚdarás ar an chlár, ceapaim go mbeidh a lán de na hargóintí freagraithe ag an bpointe sin.  Chomh maith le sin, tar éis b'fhédiir don chéad réamh-thuarascáil teacht isteach, tar éis argóintí a chloisteáil agus argóintí a phlé, má tá gá le haon leasú don Acht go bunúsach a bhaineas leis an Údarás, mar shampla, chun aidhmeanna an Aire féin a bhaint amach, tá súil agam go mbeidh an tAire sásta glacadh leis an moladh sin nó aon leasú eile a bheidh riachtanach.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé nuair a thosaigh mé, is maith an rud é go bhfuil suim chomh mór sa Teach seo i gcúrsaí Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachtaí.  Tá súil agam go leanfar leis an suim sin san am atá le teacht.</P>
    <P>Tá rud eile fós, agus iarraim ar an Aire rud éigin a dhéanamh faoi.  Is é sin an chaoi ina measctar polasaí teanga agus polasaí eacnamíochta agus sóisialta. Nuair a bhíomar ag plé an Mheastacháin do Roinn na Galetachta, dúirt mé nach raibh ciall ar bith ag baint leis na cuspóirí sin a mheascadh.  Mar shampla, má tá daoine sásta filleadh don Ghaeltacht lena gclann a bhunadh ann agus teagasc a <Col N="1546" /> thabhairt dóibh sna limistéir Ghaeltachta, agus má tá tithe ag teastáil uathu, tá sé tábhactach cabhair a thabhairt dóibh agus gan bheith ag cur ceisteanna orthu i dtaobh chomh líofa is atá na páistí, agus mar sin.  Níl sé ceart go leanfaí leis an sean-tuairimíocht sin, ag meascadh suas cúrsaí teanga le cúrsaí sóisialta agus eacnamíochta. Tá sé sin ag cur i gcoinne muintir na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Nuair a tháinig mise go Gaillimh an chéad uair scór bliain ó shin ní raibh seans agam go dtí an t-am sin Gaeilge a chloisteáil riamh roimhe.  Tá an Ghaeilge ag teacht ar ais anois, agus is é mo thuairim go bhfuil a lán daoine ar fud na tíre sásta rud breise a dhéanamh ar son na teanga. Ach maidin Dé Sathairn tagann bean suas liom agus deireann sí: &ldquo;Ní raibh an cigire sásta leis an Ghaeilge a bhí ag mo mhac óg.  Tá sé cúthaileach, níl sé in ann an Ghaeilge a labhairt os comhair an chigire&rdquo;, agus mar sin de.  Baineann an sean-dearcadh sin le tithe na muc, agus iarraim ar an Aire deireadh a chur leis. Má táimid chun tionsclaíocht a bhunadh sna Gaeltachtaí beidh gá le tithíocht, le bunstructúir, le bóithre, le seirbhísí leictreachais agus mar sin de.  Ach más fíor nach bhfuil an t-airgead ag na comhairlí chontae chun na bunstructúir a chur ar fáil, níl aon chiall le bheith ag iarraidh ar Údarás na Gaeltachta tionsclaíocht a chur i gcrích.</P>
    <P>Rud eile ar fad isea ceist na teanga.  Ní ceart an t-ualach i dtaobh athbheochaint na teanga a chur ar mhuintir na nGaeltachtaí amháin.  Bhí orthu sin an t-ualach a ghlacadh le ró-fhada.  Níl na daoine sa Ghalltacht sásta a ndóthain a dhéanamh faoi.  Tá mé ag cur milleáin ar na daoine sin, daoine a bhfuil i bhfad níos compórdaí sa saol.  Tá orthu níos mó a dhéanamh faoin Ghaeilge.  Tá níos mó acu ann.  An t-easaontas atá idir an Ghaeltacht agus an Ghaeilge ar leibhéal amháin, agus an Ghaeilge san Ghalltacht ar an dtaobh eile, is é atá ciontach faoi go bhfuil an Ghaeilge go neamhfhaiseanta san Ghalltacht.  Má chuireann tú ceist orthu i dtaobh an sórt post ba mhaith leo a fháil, deireann siad &ldquo;Múinteoireacht nó rud mar sin,&rdquo; mar tá sórt stádais ag baint le sin.  Ach bhí daoine ann, ar nós Máirtin Ó Cadhain agus <Col N="1547" /> Caitlín Maude, a thuig céard a bhí ann, an náisiún Gaelach a bhí briste, muintir na Gaeltachta a bhí briste, an aidhm a bhí ann faoin Ghaeilge a leathnú taobh istigh de na ceárdchumainn agus in áiteanna éagsúla eile sa tír imithe.</P>
    <P>Tá mise i bhfábhar sin a dhéanamh agus tá súil agam ag deireadh na diospóireachta seo go mbeidh réim nua ag an Udarás, agus go mbeidh siadsan a ligean orthu go bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge agus i gcúrsaí na Gaeltachta, agus i gcúrsaí caiteachais i leith na Gaeilge agus na nGaeltachtaí, sásta i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh chun an Ghaeilge a thabhairt arais.  Ní brionglóid atá ag gabháil liom anseo.  Is iontach an méid daoine sa Teach seo, cibé cén páirtí ina bhfuil siad, atá sásta rud éigin a dhéanamh faoin Ghaeilge.  Tá súil agam ní hé amháin go mbeimid ag déanamh léirmheasa ar an am atá imithe ach go mbeimid ag ullmhú faoin méid is féidir a dhéanamh san am atá le teacht.</P>

      <P>Tá go leor cainte déanta le mí anuas, agus mar adúirt an Teachta Higgins, agus tagaim go hiomlán leis, le blianta fada anuas, ar chúrsaí na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta. Tháinig mise isteach anseo i ndáiríre aréir agus thuig mé, dáiríre, go mbeadh cás á chur suas ag Páirtí Fhine Gael atá ag moladh an fhiosrúcháin breithiúnaigh seo. Cheap mé go n-inseodh siad don Teach cén chúis leis an moladh seo, cén fáth gur chóir fiosrúchán breithiúnach a cur ar siúl.  D'éist mé go géar aréir le beirt chainteoir ó Pháirtí Fhine Gael.  D'éist mé leis an Teachta Kenny ag rá gur cuireadh isteach anseo é le gnó áirithe a dhéanamh agus nár chreid sé féin go pearsanta nó go bunúsach san ghnó a chuireadh isteach é lena dhéanamh.  Tá a fhios agam nach féidir leis an Teachta sin teacht amach sa Teach go poiblí agus é sin a rá &mdash; creidim go láidir go bhfuil an ceart agam ansin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>D'éist mé go suimiúil agus go haireach leis an iar-Aire O'Toole, agus feicim go bhfuil níos mó iar-Airí de chuid na Gaeltachta sa Teach seo ná mar a fheictear de ghnáth de iar-Airí nuair a bhíonn ceisteanna <Col N="1548" /> áirithe dá gcuid Aireachtaí á bplé go hiondúil sa Teach.  Chuir an Teachta sin an-iontas orm ó tharla gurb é ba chúis le go leor den chaint atá ag dul ar aghaidh le roinnt mí anuas.  Beidh mé ag éisteacht nios géire fós leis an Teachta Begley, mar i ndáiríre creidimse gurb eisean an t-aon Ball den Teach a chreideann na rudaí atá á rá amuigh faoin tir, na innuendos, má tá Gaeilge ar an bhfocal mór sin, atá curtha i gcéill ag an Teachta Begley le míonna fada anois, ach ní raibh sé sásta seasamh suas in aon áit agus innsint dúinn cé acu a tugadh airgead an Stáit dóibh.</P>
    <P>D'éist mé go géar leis an Teachta Higgins, agus níl dabht ar bith ná gur féidir leis an chomhchoiste teacht le chéile taobh istigh de am áirithe &mdash; nil a fhios agam an féidir linn a rá annseo anocht taobh istigh de mhí &mdash; mar ceapaim, agus ceapann an tAire, go gcaithfidh PríomhAoirí na bpáirtí éagsúla teacht le chéile ar an gcás go bhféadfaidh an comhchoiste teacht le chéile.  Bheadh an tAire agus muid ar fad ag súil go mbrostófaí ar aghaidh leis mar tá an chaint seo atá ar siúl ag cur isteach ar pholasaí an Udaráis agus ar pholasaí Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Caithimid cuimhniú gur duine de Pháirtí Fhine Gael a bhéas mar Chathaoirleach ar an chomhchoiste seo.  Tá sé soiléir ón méid atá ráite go mbeidh lán-tacaíocht le fáil ó Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre.  Tá sé soiléir ón méid atá ráite againn nach mbeidh aon mhoill ón taobh seo.  Má bhíonn aon mhoill, agus má bhíonn aon deacrachtaí i dtaobh moille, glacaim gurb iad Fine Gael a bhéas ag déanamh sin.  Beidh mé ag súil go mbeidh an Teachta Begley in ann a rá linn nach gcuirfidh siad isteach air, go rachaidh siad ar aghaidh agus go mbróstófar leis.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta O'Toole i dtaobh easpa comhoibriú ó bhaill tofa an Údaráis agus dúirt sé go mbeadh gá le athruithe chun na treóraí atá leaghta síos ag an Aire a chur i bhfeidhm.  Nach é sin an fáth go mbeidh fiosrúchán ag an gcomhchoiste, go mbeidh siad san ag teacht ar ais chun moltaí a cur os comhair an Aire le go mbeidh seisean in ann teacht os comhair an Tí agus na moltaí sin a chur os ár gcomhair.  Os rud é go mbeidh siad aontaithe ag an gcomhchoiste &mdash; tá súil agam go mbeidh &mdash; beidh aontas le fáil <Col N="1549" /> sa Teach seo.  Má bhíonn siad aontaithe sa chomhchoiste ní bheidh deacracht ar bith ag aon Aire Ghaeltachta teacht isteach anseo agus lán-chomhoibriú a fháil sa Teach.</P>
    <P>Ach tá dochar mór déanta ag an gcaint seo le mí anuas.  Is cosúil anois go bhfuil Páirtí Fhine Gael sásta glacadh leis go gcuirfí é seo os comhair an chomhchoiste. Anois tá an trioblóid agus an chaint ar fad le dhá oíche anuas agus le trí mhí curtha amú.  Táimid tugtha anseo agus gan fáth ar bith leis &mdash; ach tá damáiste i bhfad níos measa ná sin déanta ag an gcaint seo.  Tá an damáiste seo deánta: go bhfuil lámha an Udaráis, feidhmeannaigh an Údaráis, agus baill den Údarás ceangailte le sé mhí, nach féidir leo aon rud a dhéanamh, nach féidir aon fhorbairt tionsclaíoch a dhéanamh sa Ghaeltacht, go bhfuil an infheistíocht a bheadh ann imithe beagnach ar fad mar nach bhfuil comhlachtaí nó tionsclóirí taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, taobh amuigh den tír nó fiú amháin sa tír, sásta airgead a chur isteach san Údarás nó i gcomhlachtaí san Údarás mar go gcreideann siad go bhfuil airgead curtha i bpócaí ag feidhmeannaigh taobh istigh den Údarás.  Ní muide ná an páirtí sin a chuir an cheist sin i gcroíthe nó i gcloigne tionsclóirí ach an páirtí ar an dtaobh thall, agus níl aon chruthúnas curtha in ár láthair le dhá oíche go bhufil bunús ar bith leis sin.</P>
    <P>Creidimse go bhfuil rud i bhfad níos measa fós déanta ag an gcaint seo ar fad. Tá deireadh curtha aige le postanna nua a bheadh le cur ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí ar fad le sé mhí anuas.  Tá ceisteanna curtha i gcloigne fir airgid sa tír seo, na bainc, comhlachtaí árachais agus na comhlachtaí a mbeadh airgead acu le cur isteach mar infheistíocht san Ghaeltacht agus le cur isteach i gcomhlachtaí de chuid an Údaráis, mar creideann chuile dhuine go bhfuil an scamall seo os cionn an Údaráis le sé mhí agus go bhfuil bunús de shaghas éigin leis.  An fáth go mbeadh díospóireacht den chineál seo ar siúl sa Dáil ná nuair a chuireann páirtí moladh os comhair na Dála seasann siad agus tugann siad fianaise agus insíonn siad cén bunús atá leis an moladh.  Tá Teachtaí anseo nach bhfuil fhios acu cén taobh ar cheart dóibh vóta a chaitheamh anocht. <Col N="1550" /> Chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé liomsa, creidim nach bhfuil an cás déanta ach ag páirte amháin, agus gur chuidigh Páirtí an Lucht Oibre leis sin, gur chuig an chomhchoiste is ceart dul chun fiosrúchán a dhéanamh.  Níl sé cruthaithe fós ag Fine Gael, ag éinne de bheirt chainteoirí Fhine Gael, agus bhí mé ag éisteacht go haireach leo, gur ceart an fiosrúchán a bheith mar fhiosrúchán bhreithiúnach.</P>
    <P>Tá pointe déanta ag an Teachta Higgins, agus tagaim go hiomlán leis, go mbeadh muid ag íoc amach airgead le fir dlí, le breithimh, le go leor abhcóidí agus dlíodóirí ar fud na tíre, le daoine a thabhairt os a gcomhair, le fianaise a lorg, agus gur féidir é sin ar fad a dhéanamh taobh istigh den chomhchoiste.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liomsa iarraidh ar an Teachta Kenny, mar is eisean an boss, mar a déarfá, nó tá siúl agam gurb é, ar an dtaobh thall comh fada agus a bhaineann sé le rudaí atá faoi phlé anseo anocht faoi chúrsaí Ghaeltachta, gur cheart dó smaoineadh go géar agus gur cheart dó aontú linne gur os comhair an chomchoiste ba cheart an fiosrúchán seo a dhul, agus nár chóir muidne bheith ag caint ar airgead a chaitheamh go fánach, airgead go bhféadfadh muid a chaitheamh go maith le postanna a chruthú sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>An fáth go bhfuil sé molta ag an Aire é a chur os comhair an chomhchoiste ná gur féidir leo sin a chruthadh nach bhfuil aon rud bun os cionn, nach bhfuil aon rud le clúdú ag an Údarás &mdash; cloisimid go leor faoi chlúdú an aimsir seo &mdash; ach níos tábhachtaí fós, chun an t-aer a ghlanadh. Creidimid gur féidir leis an chomhchoiste é sin a dhéanamh, go ndearna siad é go han-éifeachtach chomh fada is a bhain sé le comhlachtaí eile sna blianta a chuaigh thart, agus go mbeidh an tÚdarás, de bharr sin, in ann dul ar aghaidh le forbairt na Gaeltachta, an fáth gur cuireadh ar bun iad sa chéad lá riamh, agus nach mbeidh an scamall seo atá os cionn an Údaráis agus a bhfuil damáiste thar chuimse déanta aige chomh fada is a bhaineann sé le infheistíocht sa Ghaeltacht, le postanna nua a chrothú sa Ghaeltacht, agus tá fhios ag an iar-Aire O'Toole é seo, go bhfuil an damáiste sin déanta.  Tá fhios aige nach bhfuil rud ar bith ag tarlú <Col N="1551" /> ó thaobh forbairt sa Ghaeltacht faoi láthair.  Cónaímse agus rugadh agus tógadh mé sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá go leor Teachtaí ar chuile thaobh anseo go bhfuil baint díreach acu leis an Ghaeltacht agus tá a fhios acu go bhfuil an fhírinne ansin, nach bhfuil rud ar bith ag tarlú sa Ghaeltacht ó thaobh forbairt tionscail le sé mhí nó níos mó mar gheall ar an gcineál seo scamaill atá os cionn an Údaráis.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bunaítear an comhchoiste tá dóchas ann go mbeidh an chéad cruinniú acu taobh istigh de mhí, ach creidim gurb é an bealach is fearr len é sin a dhéanamh ná aontú a fháil ó na príomh aoirí.  Tá sé soiléir go mbeadh sé sin ar fáil ó Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre agus ó Fhianna Fáil. Beimid ag fanacht go bhfeicimid an mbeidh an chomhoibriú sin le fáil ó Pháirtí Fhine Ghael.</P>

Má bhíonn féadfaimid dul ar aghaidh ansin leis an bhfiosrúchán agus na moltaí curtha ar ais ag an Aire chuig an Teach agus féadfaidh an tÚdarás dul ar aghaidh leis an obair atá le déanamh acu an fhorbairt tionsclaíochta Ghaeltachta a chur chun cinn. Creidim gurb é sin an bealach is fearr dúinn a bheith ag breathnú leis, agus go ndéanfar é chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>

      <P>Tá a fhios agam cad tá agus a bhí ar siúl ag an Teachta leis na blianta, agus caithfidh mé a rá anocht gur cúis áthais dom gur tháinig Aire na Gaeltachta isteach sa Teach aréir.  Bhí leasú aige don rún a bhí againne, agus ins an leasú tá sé soiléir nach bhfuil sé féin sásta leis an tslí ina raibh Údarás na Gaeltachta ag obair.  Deireann sé:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, recognising the need for continued support and development of the Gaeltacht and concerned with recent publicity about the operation of Údarás na Gaeltachta, declares that it is expedient that the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies examine the affairs of Údarás na Gaeltachta as a matter of urgency and make recommendations for the better functioning of Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar sin níl an tAire sásta go raibh gach rud i gceart san Údarás.  Ó tháinig an Teachta Flynn i gcumhacht mar Aire na Gaeltachta chuaigh sé ar Raidio na Gaeltachta gach uile sheachtain.  Bhí sé ar theilifís agus dúirt sé nach raibh aon ghá le fiosrúchán d'aon sórt istigh in Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Tá áthas orm go bhfuil athrú aigne ag teacht air.  Aréir agus arís anocht dúirt Aire na Gaeltachta agus an t-iar-Aire, an Teachta Geoghegan-Quinn <Col N="1553" /> go raibh siad ag feitheamh ormsa caint i dtaobh an Údaráis.</P>

Chuir mé ceist ar an iar-Aire cathain a mbeadh an 1979 report amach agus is é an freagra a fuair mé ná go raibh na cuntais réidh le tamall ach go mba chúis dhíomá dóibh nach raibh cóipeanna clóbuailte ar fáil go fóill agus gur thuig sé go mbeadh cóipeanna ó na clódóirí taobh istigh de cúpla seachtain. Agus níor tháinig an tuarascáil bhiantúil ar feadh bliain go leith ina dhiaidh sin. Bhí na seachtainí sin an-fhada ar fad.  Tá a fhios ag gach éinne mar a dúirt an Roinn Airgeadais inniu, go raibh argóint ar siúl idir Roinn na Gaeltachta agus an Roinn Airgeadais agus níl a fhios ag éinne cad é an freagra atá ar sin.  B'fhéidir go dtiocfaidh an freagra amach uair éigin eile. Arís chuir mé cheist isteach mar gheall ar an 1981 tuarascáil agus mar fhreagra air duirt an tAire, an Teachta Flynn, go raibh súil leo go gairid.  Arís cá bhfuil sé?

I did at the time &mdash; and I repeat now &mdash; thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate for the other side of the House and from this side.  I listened very carefully to the views expressed and in the time available I shall try to cover most of the points made.</P>
      <P>Before the debate of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill was adjourned on Wednesday, 23 June, I had expressed my surprise at some of the points made, by the Labour Party particularly, about the Bill.  Deputies Bermingham, Kavanagh, Moynihan, Ryan and Spring indicated that they intended to oppose the Bill because they disagreed with the proposed reorganisation.  They claimed that by handing over responsibility for day-to-day management of the postal and telecommunications services to the proposed State-sponsored bodies, Parliament would be reneging on its responsibilities for these two services which have been run by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs since before the State was founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They considered that, if adequate finances were provided, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs could manage the services just as well as the State-sponsored bodies, they feared that the reorganisation would result in a deterioration in services, particularly in rural areas, and that more lucrative areas of business would be creamed off by private contractors, and that a statutory corporation rather than a statutory company would <Col N="1560" /> be a more suitable structure if the reorganisation must take place.  Deputy Desmond said that he would have no objection to the postal and telecommunications services being transferred to a single public corporation.</P>
    <P>I want to explain to the House that when I was constructing my reply to the debate I did so on a thematic basis rather than on the order in which Deputies contributed.  Deputies Bermingham, Spring and Taylor opposed the proposals to set up two separate State-sponsored companies.</P>
    <P>Concern for the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs seemed to be the most important factor which influenced the opposition put forward by the Labour Party to the reorganisation.  Virtually every Deputy who spoke in the House on the Bill expressed concern in this area and stressed the importance of full consultation with the staff and of allaying their fears.  The Government and I, as the responsible Minister, are just as concerned about the future of the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as Opposition Deputies.  I have personally committed myself to ensuring that the legitimate interests of the staff will be protected.  I reiterate this commitment here.  The reorganisation will not be implemented until I have satisfied myself that this has been done.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that there have been inadequate consultations with staff about the reorganisation.  I must vehemently assert that from the very outset there have been detailed consultations with recognised unions and associations, and individual staff members have been kept advised of developments as they occurred.  Going back to 1979, staff organisations were consulted when the Government decisions on Dr. Dargan's report were announced.  The appointment of members of the staff organisations to each of the two interim boards is evidence of the concern at that early stage that staff should be fully involved in the planning for the reorganisation.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper of May 1980 and the submissions made in response to it by virtually all the staff organisations representing staff employed in the Department <Col N="1561" /> provided the basis for comprehensive consultations.  Each member of the staff and each postmaster was given a copy of the Green Paper and an explanatory message from the Minister.  Each staff organisation's comments on the Green Paper were discussed directly with that organisation, and following this process a comprehensive memorandum was issued in May 1981 to provide a basis for detailed consultation through the appropriate agreed channels.  The White Paper was published about the same time and a copy, again with an explanatory message from the Minister, was given to each member of the staff and to each postmaster.</P>
    <P>Each member of the staff and every postmaster received a personal message from the Minister on the occasion of publication of the Bill giving extracts from the Bill.  Copies of the Bill and of the Explanatory Memorandum have also been made widely available for reference by members of the staff.</P>
    <P>A special joint working party of management and staff organisations were established to pursue comprehensive and detailed consultations following publication of Government decisions in the White Paper of May 1981.  That working party have held a number of meetings.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for a further meeting were put in train immediately the Bill was ready and a detailed memorandum, dealing with outstanding points which were waiting on the Government decisions embodied in the Bill, was issued to the staff organisations.  Further detailed consultations are necessary.  For my part I will see that everything possible will be done to achieve arrangements which will be acceptable to all concerned and I recently met representatives of some of the major unions representing staff affected by the reorganisation to hear their views at first hand.  Indeed, I went into the points in the Bill at a long meeting with the major union concerned and we discussed points of particular concern to that union.</P>
    <P>It was also suggested that the Bill should not be enacted until agreement has been reached with staff unions and associations about all aspects of the reorganisation <Col N="1562" /> likely to affect them.  I cannot overstress that this is essentially an enabling piece of legislation.  It is designed, among other things, to provide certain essential safeguards for the staff of my Department.  It does not purport to cover all the aspects of the reorganisation about which the staff are concerned, nor indeed would it be appropriate for it to do so. Most of these are not matters for legislative provisions.  They have not been dealt with in any legislation in this country dealing with the civil service, with earlier transfers of civil servants to the State-sponsored sector or with protection of employees generally.  I refer, for example, to guarantees sought regarding security of tenure, promotion outlets, and so on.  The fact that these matters are not covered in the Bill does not take from their importance.  I am fully aware of staff concerns.  They have already been identified very clearly in the ongoing consultations in the working party to which I referred earlier and to me personally at meetings I had with some of the major unions involved.  They will continue to be dealt with in that forum.</P>
    <P>However, there is one area on which I would like to comment and which I know is of major importance, that is, the question of security of tenure of staff in the proposed State-sponsored companies. It must be recognised that civil servants do not enjoy statutory security of tenure and it cannot reasonably be expected that the staff of the new bodies should be given such a statutory guarantee. But the fact is that this aspect of the reorganisation is of major concern to the staff.  In recognition of this I have arranged to have the matter reconsidered in depth.  It will be discussed further at the working party.</P>
    <P>As regards possible job losses by telephone operators, I am glad of this opportunity to allay staff fears which may have been caused by comments in this House, particularly refernces to figures of 1,000 or 1,500 operators as the number of operators that would be required.  These were genuine fears, and representations were made to me even in my constituency.</P>
    <P>The first point I would like to make on <Col N="1563" /> this question is that the change in the traditional work done by telephone operators has no connection whatsoever with the proposed reorganisation of postal and telecommunications services.  The trend is an inevitable consequence of modernisation of the telecommunications system. The Development Programme, 1980 to 1984, has resulted in an acceleration in the trend primarily because of the large number of manual telephone exchanges which have been and are being converted to automatic working.  This situation would exist irrespective of the reorganisation, that is, if the Department of Posts and Telegraphs had remained unchanged.</P>
    <P>The second point is that the figures mentioned in this House about the reduction in the number of operators likely to be required when the system is fully converted to automatic working are grossly exaggerated.  It is true that there will be a continuing reduction in the number of telephone operators required, but the reductions will not be anything like the figures quoted.</P>
    <P>There have been discussions with the unions concerned about this question. Up to now all permanent operators who became surplus when the telephone exchange at which they were employed was converted to automatic working were offered the same type of employment at other telephone exchanges.  The expectation is that it will be possible to make the same or similar arrangements in the case of the vast majority if not all permanent operators who become surplus over the next few years as a result of the automatisation programme.  Further discussions are necessary with the unions on this matter and these will be arranged shortly.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with every Deputy who spoke about the need to allay staff fears. Change of any kind tends to arouse fear. I fully understand and appreciate that a major change of the kind involved in this reorganisation is bound to cause fear and uncertainty among the staff.  I and the Government will do everything practicable to allay these fears.  I only hope that my task will not have been made more <Col N="1564" /> difficult by some of the statements made in this House suggesting that the boards of the new companies will behave less than responsibly and considerately in their dealings with staff or that they will ignore the social obligations associated with the functions and powers to be assigned to them under the Bill.</P>
    <P>From the conversations I have had with the chairmen and chief executives of An Bord Poist and An Bord Telecom I know that they are fully conscious of the need to allay staff fears, to use the best personnel practices in the new bodies, and to create viable companies providing efficient services to which the staff will be proud and happy to belong.  I have every confidence that they will achieve these aims.</P>
    <P>As an earnest of my intention to do everything possible to protect the legitimate interests of the staff and to meet them to the maximum extent practicable, I have decided to introduce a number of amendments on the Committee Stage of the Bill in the case of some sections which have caused unease to staff organisations. The sections concerned are Nos. 16, 42, 43, 64, 73 and 105.  In the case of section 16, I will propose that the negotiation machinery which the companies will be required to set up will have to be agreed by the appropriate unions.  The section as it stands provides for consultation only.</P>
    <P>The amendments to sections 42 and 43 will make it clear beyond all shadow of doubt that any variation of pay and conditions including pensions introduced by either company in the future may not be such that they would worsen the pay and conditions enjoyed by the staff on transfer to the new companies.</P>
    <P>While the other sections to which I referred do not directly affect the staff, nevertheless I have decided to meet points made by some of their unions in order to demonstrate in a practical way my willingness to go as far as possible to meet them.</P>
    <P>The amendment to section 64 will provide that the Minister for Finance will be required to consult the postal company if he proposes to make an order or to revoke an order made under the section <Col N="1565" /> enabling the company to provide banking services.  Similarly, under the amendment to section 73 the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will be required to consult the company if he proposes to revoke an order made under the section delegating to the company functions in regard to collection of television licence fees.</P>
    <P>Finally, I will propose an amendment to section 105 to provide that if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs proposes to issue a licence to a third party to provide services covered by the exclusive privilege of either company he will be required to announce his intention to do so by order.</P>
    <P>I will circulate details of these amendments in due course together with a few technical amendments about which I will not trouble the House at this stage.  I need hardly say that any amendments proposed by Deputies in this area or indeed regarding any other aspect of the Bill will be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>There is one final point before I leave the staff relations aspect.  Deputy Keating said that the intention was to supply staff personnel files to the new companies.  I do not know how he formed this impression. Deputy Cosgrave also referred to staff worries about the transfer of such files.  No such decision has been made.</P>
    <P>Before the debate on the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill was adjourned on Wednesday, 23 June, I had explained in some detail the provisions proposed about superannuation. Because of the number of Deputies who commented on this aspect during the course of the debate &mdash; Deputies Cooney, Fitzpatrick, Bermingham, Gallagher and Harte &mdash; I just had ten minutes at the time and I thought it was important to get it on the record of the House.  I want to put it on the record of the House a second time because I regard it as being of some importance.  I want to reaffirm what I said then.  The companies are being required to make provision only to cover pension liability for service arising after the vesting day.  The Exchequer will accept liability for all service prior to that day including the cost of existing pensions. The arrangement that the Exchequer contingent liability is not expected to <Col N="1566" /> be called on for about 30 years does not involve any extra costs on the companies.</P>
    <P>There is one final point on the superannuation question.  Deputy Cooney asked what the provision needed for post-vesting day would cost the companies over and above the amount included in the Post Office commercial accounts at present.  In the case of the telecommunications service it would represent an extra £9 million in 1982 as compared with a turnover of £300 million and £6 million in the case of the postal service, as compared with a turnover of £105 million.</P>
    <P>The next point that Deputy Cooney raised was the financing of postal development. He asked for an assurance that the £50 million to be provided under the Bill will be made available by way of equity.  Deputies O'Sullivan, Birmingham and Treacy claimed that the amount of £50 million was inadequate.</P>
    <P>The Government have recognised that An Post will not be in a strong financial position initially.  This is self-evident from my introductory speech and from the provisions of the Bill.  However, the Government are not prepared to make a commitment about the method of financing postal development until they have had an opportunity of studying the five year development plan to be produced by the company, despite the commitments in the Bill in terms of hard money.  Having said that, I am confident that this Government will take sympathetic and realistic decisions about financing future postal development.  I do not have to remind Deputy Cooney, after his experience of framing this year's Estimate, that the State has not a bottomless purse and that blank cheques cannot be written for postal development or for anything else.</P>
    <P>As regards the figure of £50 million, this is the amount estimated to be needed for an initial programme.  If the Members of the House check the expenditure over the last few years they will see that £50 million would have covered a great number of years before this Bill was introduced at all.  Admittedly I said on Second Stage that there was inadequate expenditure and we are trying to make amends for that.</P>
    <P>Deputies Cooney, O'Sullivan and <Col N="1567" /> Harte questioned the adequacy of the grants for current expenditure.  Deputy Cooney asked for specific information about losses projected for the postal service which he apparently considers to be inevitable.  The out-turn for the service will depend primarily on the volume of postal traffic handled.  I know that the chief executive of the interim Postal Board, who will also be chief executive of An Post, is determined that the volume of postal traffic will be increased and he intends to use all his expertise to do that. The forecast for the present year is that the service will break even but that is subject to how traffic performs in the next six months.</P>
    <P>On the basis of optimistic but reasonable forecasts of traffic growth and costs, deficits over a five year period could be considerably less than £20 million.  They could be less than £10 million.  If pessimistic projections of traffic growth and/or costs were used the deficits could be in excess of £20 million.  I have confidence myself that the new company will, by stimulating growth, by introducing new services, and by, and through, increased productivity of the staff, justify the more optimistic forecasts.</P>
    <P>As regards telecommunications, Deptuty Cooney claimed that the burden of loan capital proposed would involve an undue drain on the current income of the company leaving little money available to finance development.  He also disagreed with the proposal to require the company to pay dividends to meet the loan charges on the £355 million being transferred to the company in exchange for shares.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham asked where the money to finance development was going to come from.  Deputies Desmond, Gallagher, Harte and O'Sullivan questioned the adequacy of the arrangements.</P>
    <P>The capital structure proposed for the telecommunications service will provide a debt equity ratio of 1: 1.35 which in my view is very favourable and is much more favourable than that of many State-sponsored companies.  As a matter of fact, I can tell the House that I was very pleased when I succeeded in achieving <Col N="1568" /> the arrangements we came to for the halving of the amount to be paid in 1983 by An Bord Telecom Éireann to the Government from £96 million to £48 million through halving the amount, of repayable Exchequer loans by converting £355 million to equity, because as the House will know if they listened to my Second Stage speech, £710 million was the amount that had been advanced and on which interest of £96 million was supposed to have been paid back to the Government in 1983.</P>
    <P>This represents a much improved financial structure to that hitherto applicable to the Department. That is why I was pleased to achieve this and very surprised when it came under criticism from speakers during this debate.  The decision to convert £355 million of Exchequer loans to equity will, as I explained, result in a reduction of £48 million in current expenditure in 1983.  The burden on Bord Telecom would have been £96 million had I not succeeded in halving it.  The Minister for Finance will have to make up the £48 million and he generously allowed that halving to take place.  If such a financial structure had been available to the Department in the past, the commercial accounts for the telecommunications service would have shown surpluses in 1977, 1978, 1980 and 1981 with a small deficit in 1979.  In 1982, there would be a substantial surplus.  It is reasonable to expect the new commercially oriented State-sponsored company to do better, particularly as they are inheriting a service which is poised to become as good as the best in the EEC and as the heavy capital investment of recent years will become increasingly revenue-earning from now on.  Deputy Cooney made that point during his contribution.</P>
    <P>The requirement that Bord Telecom Éireann will have to pay dividends which over a period of at most 10 years will offset the loan charges on the £355 million advances which will be met in the meantime by the general taxpayer was questioned, very surprisingly, by Deputy Cooney on the ground that this would be inconsistent with the financial duties of <Col N="1569" /> the company and their commercial freedom. He considered that it should be left to the company to decide what dividend payments would be made on the State shares.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Deputy's views in this regard are inconsistent with his comment to which I have already referred, that profits from a public monopoly should accrue to the Exchequer, or his later one that shareholders in a company are entitled to look for an adequate return on their investment.  The position is that the company will be State-owned with State assets valued at over £1,400 million.  It is reasonable in these circumstances that the State should have a say in the dividends to be paid, particularly in relation to debts which will have to be financed by the general taxpayer initially &mdash; and altogether in the absence of adequate dividend receipts from the company.  I think that we can assume that no Government will require dividend payments at a level that will cripple the company, and there is provision for consultation with Bord Telecom Éireann about dividend payments in section 104 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As regards where the money for development will come from, Bord Telecom Éireann will be required under the Bill to finance a reasonable proportion of their capital needs from internal sources, including depreciation provisions which will be quite substantial.  The balance will be financed by borrowing from commercial sources.  This does not establish a new principle.  Most of the money needed for telecommunications development this year is being raised by Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited from commercial sources such as the banks.</P>
    <P>One final point on the financial aspects of the reorganisation.  Deputy Cooney asked what the position would be about VAT and the implications for the financing of the companies.  There will be no change in the present position.  Both postal and telecommunications services will be exempt from VAT, as they have been in the past.  Accordingly there are no new implications involved for the financing of either company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will now deal with the opposition expressed by the Labour Deputies to the fundamental concept of the reorganisation.  I might add that Deputy Harte also seemed to have an ambiguous approach to the Bill.  While expressing support for the Bill, the tenor of many of his remarks seemed to indicate that he would prefer alternative structures to those proposed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I did not expect to have to defend the basic concept of the reorganisation to members of the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  In their <i>&ldquo;Programme for Government 1981-1986&rdquo;</i>, published in 1981, both parties committed themselves to giving statutory authority to An Bord Poist and An Bord Telecom and to facilitate in every way their restructuring of these vital national services.  During their period in office, the Coalition Government played a large part in putting this Bill together.  Indeed, as I mentioned earlier the Long and Short Titles of the Bill were put on the Order Paper before Christmas 1981.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooney was totally dedicated to the advancement of this Bill but he did not get the support from his Minister for Finance which I received from my Minister for Finance, enabling me to bring this Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I will deal briefly with the points on which opposition to the concept of the reorganisation was based.  I do not accept that by transferring responsibility for day-to-day management of postal and telecommunications services to two separate State-sponsored bodies, Parliament would be reneging on its responsibilities. Parliament is not involved in matters of day-to-day management of any of the other main infrastructural services available in the community for example, electricity, water supplies, transport, roads, etc.  It has been involved in this aspect of postal and telecommunications services because the services were being run by a Government Department when the State was set up.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Government of the day will still be responsible, when the new State-sponsored bodies are set up, <Col N="1571" /> for policy aspects of development of postal and telecommunications services. A close reading of the Bill will indicate that.  The Bill provides enabling power for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to direct the company to comply with Government policies in this regard.  The annual Estimates for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will have to be approved by the Oireachtas in the normal way and Deputies will have an opportunity of dealing with policy matters in relation to posts and telecommunications.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if it was so decided by Parliament, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs could continue to manage postal and telecommunications services as they have done in the past. The point at issue is whether the services could be developed more quickly and more efficiently by two State-sponsored bodies.  As I mentioned in my introductory speech, the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group examined the question of the most suitable environment for development of the new services at considerable length in their report.  They concluded that a Government Department which by its very nature is subject to constraints necessary for the purposes of central Government, does not create a suitable environment for management of large businesses such as post and telecommunications. The present Government and the two previous Governments accepted the recommendation of the review group that management of the two services should be transferred to State-sponsored companies because they would provide a better environment for more rapid development of efficient services.  The fears expressed that the reorganisation would result in serious deterioration in services available in rural areas are quite without foundation.  An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann would be statutorily required to meet the industrial, commercial and social needs of the State for efficient postal and telecommunications services and, so far as is reasonably practicable, to satisfy all reasonable demands, for such services throughout the State.  If either company <Col N="1572" /> fail to do so, they would be in breach of their statutory duties.</P>
    <P>As regards the suggestions that more lucrative portions of the services would be hived off to private contractors and that the reorganisation involves handling over the postal and telecommunications services to private interests, the position is as follows.  It would be illegal for anybody to provide services covered by the exclusive privilege to be assigned to the companies under the Bill except under licence issued by the company or by the Minister.  The companies would have power to issue licences only with the consent of the Minister.  It is inconceivable that they would wish to hive off lucrative portions of their business to private interests and should they be tempted to do so, the Minister would not countenance such an arrangement.  The only circumstances in which issue of licences by either company is envisaged at present is in cases where they are unable or unwilling to provide special types of services themselves. This does not establish a new principle. In the case of telecommunications, commercial interests have been permitted to provide, for example, private automatic branch exchanges for connection to the public network for many years past.  The enabling power for issue of licences by the Minister is a fall-back provision.  The present Bill should provide a framework for development of postal and telecommunications services for the rest of the century.  Circumstances might arise in the future in which the issue of such a licence might be considered desirable in the public interest where, for example, despite its exclusive privilege, either company was not meeting the industrial, commercial and social needs of the State for efficient postal or telecommunications services.</P>
    <P>In case there should be any doubt in the matter, I would like to stress that the two new companies will be wholly State-owned.  The directors will be appointed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs with the exception of three who will be elected by the workers.  If there was any question in the future of allowing public participation in the equity of either company, amending legislation <Col N="1573" /> would be necessary to increase the authorised share capital of the company in question.  We are not talking, therefore, about handing over management of postal and telecommunications services to private interests.  What is involved is transferring management of the services from the civil service of the public service.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the question of whether a statutory corporation would be preferable to a statutory company and whether the provision in the Bill for providing two separate companies is preferable to having the two services managed by a single body.  Here again, the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group in their report considered both of these issues.  I also dealt with them in my introductory speech on this Stage.  Briefly the statutory company seems to offer scope for greater flexibility than the statutory corporation. From the staff point of view there is no essential difference between a statutory corporation and a statutory company</P>
    <P>Two separate companies are being proposed, basically because this Government and the two previous Governments accepted the validity of the reasons quoted by the review group in their report when they recommended two companies rather than one.  I quoted fully from the report of the review group on this aspect in my introductory speech. Nothing I have heard during the course of the debate here has convinced me that the eminent review group came to the wrong conclusion.  Before leaving this particular subject, I should refer to one other point mentioned by quite a number of Deputies, that is a fear that the reorganisation will result in huge increases in administrative costs.  The State-sponsored companies will take over the existing staff who are running these services at present.  I do not see any need for, nor do I think that the two new companies would propose any significant increases in administrative staff.  They will have available to them, as Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, a very experienced staff who have been managing the services for many years.  If either company were tempted to build up a large empire, the provision in the Bill which will require <Col N="1574" /> them to publish particulars of the cost-effectiveness of their operations should prevent them from succumbing to such a temptation.  The residual Department of Posts and Telegraphs will, it is estimated, have a staff of somewhere between 100 and 200.  This staff will be engaged in functions which are not being transferred to either company.  Consequently the question of duplication of costs will not arise in this area, either.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with the social aspects of the services.  Deputies Kavanagh, O'Sullivan, Ryan and Taylor claimed that the social aspects of the two services where not adequately covered in the Bill. I would like to reassure Deputies in this regard.  The Bill provides for reserved powers for the Minister and the Government which would enable them to take appropriate action in the unlikely event of failure by either company to have regard to the social obligations which inevitably follow from the fact that they will be public companies operating monopolies in provision of essential infrastructural services.  For example, the companies may charge only the minimum necessary to meet financial targets which will be set by the Minister.  The Minister will also have power to direct the companies to provide loss-making services and to comply with Government policy in relation to development of the two services.  These two provisions provide clear recognition of the social aspects of postal and telecommunications services.</P>
    <P>Deputies E. Collins, Cosgrave, Desmond, Faulkner, Fennell, Gallagher, Harte, Kavanagh, Keating, Kelly, Mitchell, Moynihan, O'Sullivan, Ryan, Shatter, Spring and Treacy commented on individual sections of the Bill, or on other matters that they considered should be dealt with in the Bill.  Time prevents me from replying in detail on this occasion. Deputies might, perhaps, raise them again on Committee Stage and I shall deal with them.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points that I would like to make, but time is running out on me.  Deputy Kelly claims that the only reason we were doing this was that we were imitating Britain in this and in other things as well.  The direct <Col N="1575" /> opposite is the case.  Britain started off with a single company&mdash;</P>

      <P>Britain started off with a single company and after we had made the decision to have two companies dealing with the services, they decided to split their single company into two, one to deal with postal services and the other to deal with telecommunications. I would like to commend Deputy Flanagan on a long, detailed, enthusiastic and encouraging speech.  He encouraged me very much to get ahead with the Bill.  He referred to the developments in communications technology and its possible application to the postal services.  I am glad to say that a new service using the most up-to-date technology will be introduced in the coming months.  The FAXPOST service will involve transmission and receipt of document facsimiles between offices in Dublin, Cork, Britain, the USA and Canada and these transmissions will be done in a matter of minutes.</P>

      <P>I only wish to say again that I have had conversations with the representative unions and also with the executives of the new boards.  I am convinced that their dedication, their mastery of the problems involved and of new <Col N="1576" /> techniques, expertise and new developments will assure a development which will be worthy of this country both in the postal service which needs it very badly and in the telecommunications area which is also in need of updating.  We are on target with our programme which was launched some years ago.</P>
      <P>One final point, I mentioned earlier that is an enabling Bill and I wish to stress that.  Section 9 requires me to arrange for the setting up of the two new companies and to appoint a vesting day for them.  It does not contain any time limit in this regard.  I mentioned earlier that I wanted to have the Bill enacted in the current session and to have the two companies set up in the autumn.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies thought that I was rushing the Bill unduly.  I do not accept this.  This reorganisation was announced three years ago and the White Paper on which the legislation is based was published over 12 months ago.  There was nothing new in the Bill from the point of view of aspects affecting the staff that had not already been dealt with in the White Paper.  As I said earlier, the only new thing was my success in getting from the Government adequate finance to launch this Bill.  Even if the Bill had been enacted during the current session it would not necessarily have meant that the vesting day would have been in the autumn.  Progress in discussions with the staff would obviously be taken into account and I would, of course, have consulted the boards in the matter also. However, this is largely academic now as Committee Stage will not be taken until the Dáil resumes later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I again thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate?  I hope that I have commented on the main points raised.  No doubt many of these will come up again for discussion on Committee Stage, together with comments on individual sections made by some Deputies. Questions of detail on the existing services raised by Deputies will be replied to separately.  I welcome the support expressed by many Deputies for the Bill, which is designed to provide an environment more favourable than that available in a Government Department, for the <Col N="1577" /> more rapid development and provision of more efficient postal and telecommunications services.  It should be a source of encouragement to the two boards that they have the goodwill of many in this House in the task they are facing.  The many congratulatory remarks made about the staff of my Department and the obvious concern on all sides of the House that they should find satisfaction, security <Col N="1578" /> and scope for development in their new employment will I hope, help to reassure the staff that their future will be bright in An Post and in An Bord Telecom Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Córas Beostoic agus Feola Act, 1979 (Levy on Slaughtered or Exported Livestock) Order, 1982</P>
      <P>a copy of which was laid in draft before the Dáil on the 14th day of June, 1982.</P>
      <P>It is proposed in this order to increase the levy payable to CBF in respect of cattle and sheep slaughtered within the state or exported live.  The present rates, at 50p per head for cattle and 5p per head for sheep, have remained unchanged since October 1979.  The new rates proposed are 70p per head for cattle and 7p per head for sheep.  Section 28 of the Córas Beostoic agus Feola Act, 1979, requires that the draft of such orders must be approved by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Córas Beostoic agus Feola are a statutory body who replaced Córas Beostoic agus Feola Teoranta, a company limited by guarantee, in 1979.  Its purposes are, broadly, to promote the export of beef, mutton and lamb and of cattle and sheep and to furnish promotion and marketing support to exporters and the promotion of beef, mutton and lamb on the home market.  The body's activities in the past year included intensive promotion of vacuum-packed beef, particularly in Germany, together with the <Col N="1580" /> market intelligence work which they developed in previous years.</P>
    <P>CBF have two sources of income, namely an Exchequer grant-in-aid from the Vote for Agriculture and the proceeds of a levy on cattle and sheep slaughtered within the state or exported live.  In considering the Estimates for 1982 the previous Government provided an increased grant-in-aid of £765,000 for CBF on condition that an additional £300,000 was raised in levy income in 1982.  To meet this condition the board of CBF have agreed that the levy rates should be increased to 70p for cattle and 7p for sheep.  The new rates of levy are expected to yield a total income of £1 million in 1982 which, together with the Exchequer grant-in-aid of £765,000, is considered to be the minimum amount necessary to enable CBF to meet their planned work programme for the current year.</P>
    <P>I propose to bring the new rates into effect on 26 July 1982.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see this order coming before the House.  The procedure we are following tonight is in many ways a culmination of a very long and difficult discussion over some months which had to do with the best means of going about providing for a continuation and possible improvement in the promotion of exports of our livestock and meat.  The Minister pointed out that the previous Government in their Estimates for 1982 have provided an increased grant-in-aid of £765,000 for CBF on condition that an additional £300,000 was raised from the CBF levy during this year.  This agreement is a good example of the kind of constructive co-operation we can bring about between the industry and the Government even in difficult financial circumstances&mdash;on both sides, let me add&mdash;in order to achieve the objective we all want to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has pointed out and as many Members of the House are aware, CBF have achieved a considerable amount of success in promotion over a number of areas.  They have substantial ambitions for the promotion of our livestock and meat products.  They have <Col N="1581" /> helped in a very real way to achieve breakthroughs in markets, and particularly in export markets.  The House should be aware that CBF have been involved in a number of promotion ventures which have led to Irish exporters of meat and meat products securing very valuable markets in other countries for our products.</P>
    <P>The order which the Minister laid before us tonight is designed to facilitate these activities and they are being contributed to both by the Government by way of grant-in-aid and the industry by way of the levy collected on slaughterings of cattle and sheep.  It is only fair to put on record the fact that, in agreeing to an increase of this amount in the levy, that is, an increase of 20p per head in respect of cattle and 2p per head in respect of sheep, the industry &mdash; and by that I mean the farmers, the meat factories and all the people involved in the trade &mdash; are doing something which is difficult enough for them to do in today's straitened circumstances.  I am sure the Minister appreciates that.</P>
    <P>To some extent they have made an act of faith in the ability of CBF to get results in terms of the effectiveness of their promotional work.  They have also made a very real contribution in difficult economic circumstances to bringing about the success of that promotional work. They are saying: &ldquo;We are prepared to dig into our own pockets to make our contribution to the national effort to improve and develop promotional work&rdquo;.  The new rates of levy are expected to yield a total income of £1 million this year.  That, together with the grant-in-aid made available from Exchequer funds, will bring the budget of CBF on these two counts to over £1,750 million.</P>
    <P>I hope &mdash; and I am sure the Minister will agree with me &mdash; that we can find a very useful application for considerably more money than that, that we can find a useful application for a sum of more than £765,000 from the Exchequer and more than £1 million from the industry. When we were drawing up the Estimate and the agreement which led to this order being brought forward, we were in fairly straitened circumstances on both sides of <Col N="1582" /> the table.  The result we have before us now represents the best agreement which the collective wisdom of the Minister of the day, the present Minister and the industry could achieve.  It represents a very substantial contribution from the industry towards development.  We should record our appreciation to the industry for going about their business in this very constructive way.  For those reasons I welcome the order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Dukes that we should emphasise the contribution from the industry as being a special act of faith on their part in the future of the industry.  A mutual input from the State and the industry, together with the closest possible consultation, is likely to provide the best results in the future.  We are emphasising the necessity to have a differential in favour of export refunds on processed and added-value agricultural products, and in particular meat products as against livestock export refunds.  This is an area in which there has been co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission recognised the importance of extending export refunds into the processed and added-value area to a far greater extent than heretofore, and recognise the fact that the agri-business and industry are important features of the whole agricultural scene.  The financing of CBF which is geared to the whole area of market advisory work and development on the processed side of the industry &mdash; I agree that the live side of the industry is part of its mandate too &mdash; and in particular the more sophisticated added value side in all the meat areas, but particularly in beef, will be a growing factor in the future.  We must pay particular attention to it because we have very serious under-utilisation of the meat factory capacity available to us.  Any way in which the industry can become involved in the financing of CBF, as they are in this proposed order, is welcome.  The involvement of the industry in CBF to this extent is welcome.  The processed side has to stressed, although I appreciate that we must also have the live side in regard to sheep and cattle as a safety <Col N="1583" /> valve.  We must have the emphasis on the processed side without overdoing it, and greater involvement by that side of the industry in the financing of CBF as the export promotion agency, where a voice can be raised and heard and listened to by reason of a direct financing involvement. That is important.</P>
    <P>I welcome the approach adopted by Deputy Dukes to this matter and I appreciate the work he has done in this respect.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate: Sandyford (Dublin) Industrial Estate.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for delaying the House.  I raised this matter because I have made repeated efforts to establish the position of not just the Sandyford industrial estate but the installation of telephones in south Dublin generally. It gives me no great pleasure to detain the Minister but I made repeated efforts to elicit the necessary information. It requires a great deal of my time and the time of other Deputies to try to cut through bureaucracy.  Naturally I do not lay particular blame on the Minister, but I feel strongly that the situation in Sandyford industrial estate has become critical.</P>
      <P>These people invested £300,000, half of which is foreign investment, in a new plant which is to begin operation in the middle of this month.  The plant is geared to distribution and export.  Unless telephone and telex services are installed in these premises the investment will be lost and with it a great number of jobs.  The company are likely to employ 20 people immediately, and as they expand the number of workers will increase.  There has been enormous interest in this company and their operations not merely in Britain but in continental countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is tragic that I have to come into this House to express the general frustration experienced by Deputies who are unable to establish the exact position of the installation of telephones, particularly for industrialists.  My colleague, Deputy <Col N="1584" /> S. Brennan, raised this matter and received a reply which was not by any means satisfactory.  I hope the Minister will consider this position because there are office blocks going up beside this factory offering prospective tenants telephones and a telex service immediately on occupation.  This seems to be an enormous contradiction.</P>
    <P>The telephone cabling appears to be into the factory and I understand from the engineering staff that their work will be done by the end of the month.  However, there is no indication when the telephone service will be provided.  This means these people will lose their investment and jobs for my constituents in Dún Laoghaire will also be lost.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that it is very nice to have a choice of colour and type of telephone, but that does not compensate for the fact that people who have made investments here and have confidence in this country are unable to get a telephone service. Rather than quote chapter and verse of what has happened, I would like the Minister to give an undertaking to me, as a public representative, that a telephone service will be provided in time to avoid the loss of investment and jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to detain the House.  I fully appreciate that every Government have difficulty supplying telephones and I know the much-harassed Minister, Deputy Wilson, is under extreme pressure to provide phones in every corner of Ireland.  I do not suppose he is short of listening to arguments as to the absolute necessity, vitality and urgency of supplying a telephone system here or there and at this stage there is probably no claim, demand or excuse the Minister has not heard over and over again.  What we are doing is adding our voices to that on behalf of our constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin South is the fastest growing part of the country; it is the fastest growing suburban area in Europe, growing at an astronomical rate.  Because of that growth rate it must have particular infrastructural attention and in that regard one must consider the telephone <Col N="1585" /> system.  Our area is not just a dormitory area where people get into their cars and travel to distant parts for jobs and return at night.  It is an area in which people work and where there are factories.  We are fortunate to have a fine industrial estate on our doorstep and it would be a pity if we were not able to supply that estate with the infrastructural assistance it needs.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to do what he can to ensure that the telephone system is improved in the Sandyford estate.  I am aware that the whole telephone programme has come on in leaps and bounds in recent times.  Much has been achieved but much remains to be done also.  I am thankful that the industrial estates are still growing and providing employment and we should try to do our best to help in every way.  At the end of the day the priority has to be to provide employment. If the infrastructure is not there and if this damages the prospect of employment it could have the effect of undoing the tremendous work of the IDA and the other agencies who are trying desperately to provide the much-needed jobs.</P>
    <P>I add my voice to that of my constituency colleague in asking that this fast growing area should receive some special attention.  This is not a party political issue in any way.  It affects people in their everyday lives.  I am conscious and appreciative of the work the Minister has done in this area but I ask him to have a special look at this estate to see if matters could be improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that it has not been possible to provide service for firms in the Sandyford industrial estate when they need it.  Clearly, I recognise the need of the industrialists and others there for telephone and telex service.  Obviously it would be much more satisfactory from every point of view and much easier for me to be able to meet requirements as and when they arise than to have to explain why service cannot be provided but we are dealing here with facts and we must be realistic in facing them.  I will outline these briefly in the time at my disposal and put the situation in Sandyford <Col N="1586" /> industrial estate in context.</P>
      <P>The present unsatisfactory position of the telephone service stems from underinvestment in the service over many years to a point where, as the independent Posts and Telegraphs Review Group pointed out in 1979, it was in a state of crisis.  The Government recognised that fact, accepted the importance of a high quality telecommunications service for the economic and social life of the country and embarked on a five-year telephone development programme.  That programme, costing about £850 million at 1981 prices, is designed to bring the standard of service here up to the level in other countries in terms of availability and quality.</P>
      <P>When the programme got under way in 1980, the waiting list for telephones was about 85,000.  The highest rate of connections made in any year up to then was marginally over 40,000.  Demand was over 60,000 a year.  The STD failure rate on some of the main routes in the country was 40 per cent.  These two statistics put the current position in context.</P>
      <P>The time-scale for meeting the targets is five years.  The Posts and Telegraphs Review Group saw this as a minimum period and recognised the difficulties there would be in meeting the programme targets in such a short time.  It is interesting to note that what we were aiming at at the end of the five-year programme was to reach the standard that had obtained in other EEC countries when we started the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first requirement in improving the telephone service is to build up the infrastructure of the service itself in terms of buildings &mdash; some 500 of which were needed &mdash; replacing or extending all existing telephone exchanges, strengthening the various trunk routes throughout the country and developing the local cabling network.  The recruitment and training of some thousands of staff are also involved.  It is understandable, therefore, that it would take some time before the results of the substantial investment made in the telephone service become evident in the form of a much improved performance.  The programme is broadly on target and I am confident that the <Col N="1587" /> objectives of a high quality service, with applications being met promptly by the end of 1984, will be achieved.  If I say that the waiting list at present is a little over 80,000 and that we would hope to instal at least 80,000 telephones this year, it may put conveniently in perspective the progress made.</P>
    <P>I might add that without seeking to score any political points, and the Deputy mentioned he was not making a political point, the position in Dublin both in regard to repairs and to installation of new phones would be better than it were if not for an embargo placed by the Government in July 1981 on the recruitment of staff, preventing badly needed staff for cabling and jointing work from being recruited.  While that embargo was subsequently lifted and the men are being recruited and trained, valuable time has been lost.</P>
    <P>I have thought it desirable to spell out at some length the background to the current position in regard to the installation of telephones in the hope that there will be a somewhat better appreciation of the problems involved.</P>
    <P>Turning to the position now in the Sandyford and Stillorgan industrial estates, these are major ongoing developments. To provide for the general development in the area, a new telephone exchange building is being erected on Kilgobbin Road.  This building will house a modern telephone exchange which will have the capacity to handle up to 20,000 lines eventually.  Pending that exchange being brought into service, telephone service in the area is being provided by a number of mobile automatic exchanges which are currently serving over 1,000 working lines and have capacity to serve a further 2,000.  Underground cabling is being laid and brought into service as quickly as possible.  A new 2,000 line main underground cable to the industrial estate has recently been laid <Col N="1588" /> and work is currently in progress in laying distribution feeder cables to individual buildings.  These are the essential preliminary works to enable telephone service to be provided.</P>
    <P>Altogether there are at present applications for some 1,000 lines awaiting attention in the general area, at least 400 of which are for lines in the industrial estates.  These applications will be met as quickly as practicable with the available manpower resources and subject to the constraints of the various site development works in progress in the industrial estates by builders.  I would hope that provision of service will not be unduly delayed for Sun Freeze and others and everything possible will be done to meet the applications as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Finally, might I say that throughout the country there are pressing needs on the part of industrialists and business firms generally for new and additional telephone, telex and data lines, conversion of manual exchanges to automatic working, provision of improved STD services and for better maintenance of existing services.  Deputies will be well aware of the constant volume of representations being received every day from every corner of the country.  Clearly it is essential that we should press ahead with developments throughout the country with the maximum possible speed involving a major commitment of finance, manpower and other resources.  This is being done to the maximum extent practicable but I must emphasise that it is not expected to be possible to eliminate the waiting list generally, including that in Dublin, until the end of 1984.  There is a clear limit to the amount that can be achieved in the short term and, regrettably, many companies and individuals will continue to experience some difficulties and delays meantime but on a gradually diminished scale.</P>

      <P>Since 1972, Ireland has joined with her Community partners in imposing trade sanctions against the Soviet Union, Iran and Argentina.  In addition, Ireland has complied with relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council concerning South Africa and Rhodesia.  Security Council Resolution 418 (1977) prohibits the export of arms <Col N="1407" /> and related material to South Africa. Security Council Resolution 252 (1968) provided for trade sanctions against Rhodesia and was in force until the end of December 1979 following the independence settlement for Zimbabwe.</P>
      <P>In response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979, the EEC Council of Ministers decided on 15 January 1980 that, while respecting traditional tradeflows, Community exports of agricultural products to the USSR should not directly or indirectly replace US exports affected by an embargo introduced by the US Government.  Following the suspension on 24 April 1981 by the US of its embargo on grain sales to the Soviet Union, the Community lifted its restrictions on agricultural exports to the Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>After the seizure of the 50 American hostages by Iranian students on 4 November 1979, and the imposition of sanctions against Iran by the US on 7 April 1980, the Foreign Ministers of the Nine decided to impose sanctions against Iran if no progress towards the release of the hostages was made by 17 May 1980.  On 22 May 1980 Ireland applied economic sanctions against Iran.  These sanctions were removed on 23 January 1981, following the release of the hostages.</P>
      <P>On 10 April 1982 the Ten decided, in the wake of the invasion of the Falkland Islands by Argentina and Argentina's refusal to comply with Resolution 502 of the United Nations Security Council, to ban all imports of Argentine origin into the Community.  This decision was implemented through a Council Regulation of 16 April 1982, which expired on 17 May 1982.  Ireland decided not to continue sanctions after this date but took steps to ensure that the measures which were maintained in force by our Community partners until 22 June 1982 were not circumvented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 21/22 February 1982, in view of the Soviet responsibility in the imposition of material law in Poland and the continuation of the martial law régime despite Community protests, the EEC Foreign Affairs Council decided that economic measures should be taken to demonstrate <Col N="1408" /> the Community's disapproval of the Soviet attitude.  A regulation was accordingly adopted on 15 March by the Council of Ministers (Finance) restricting the import of certain products from the Soviet Union to the Community during 1982.  This regulation remains in force.</P>

He was awarded a pension at the maximum rate appropriate to a married man with effect from 27 November 1981. A pension order book containing orders valid for payment from 29 January 1982 issued to the designated post office on 20 January 1982 for collection by him.</P>
      <P>The arrears due for the period from 27 November 1981 to 28 January 1982 were paid direct to the claimant by payable order on 18 June 1982.  The delay in the payment of the arrears was due to an administrative error.</P>

On inquiry it was ascertained that he had been employed from 1972 to January 1982 but that the employer, who has since died, failed to pay the social insurance contributions due in respect of him for that period.  The local social welfare officer is dealing with the representatives of the employer in an effort to obtain payment of the outstanding contributions. When these inquiries have been completed the claimant's disability benefit claim will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer applied for the renewal of a sub-contractor's certificate on 6 April 1981.  His application was not accepted as he does not satisfy the statutory conditions governing the issue of a sub-contractor's certificate which, <i>inter alia,</i> require him to carry on a trade from a fixed place of business established in a permanent building with adequate equipment, stock and other facilities.</P>
      <P>It should be pointed out that the refusal to issue a sub-contractor's certificate does not prevent the taxpayer from carrying on business as a sub-contractor.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 413 and 414 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cattle headage rates of payment were practically doubled in 1980 and sheep headage payments were increased substantially in 1981.  In the light of these increases no further increase was provided for in the 1982 Estimates by the previous administration.  The present Government have, however, taken a positive step for 1982 by allowing payment on up to 30 livestock units separately under each of the cattle and the sheep headage schemes.  In accordance with normal practice, the headage rates that will apply in 1982 will be announced <Col N="1415" /> as soon as they have been cleared by the EEC Standing Committee on Agricultural Structures.  It is hoped that this clearance will be given within the next few weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant EEC directive lays down the requirement that the level of headage payments rates be set by reference to the degree of permanent natural handicap affecting farming activities which is suffered by any particular area.</P>
      <P>As the degree of permanent natural handicap in mountain areas is obviously greater than that suffered by lowland areas, some differentiation in treatment between those areas must be maintained as indeed applied under the previous administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>416.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the manifest unfairness of the present system whereby a farmer with as little as 50p in off-farm income in excess of the comparable income loses his entire headage payments, he will change the regulations to enable affected farmers to get headage payments less the amount by which off-farm income exceeds the comparable income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The limit on non-farm income under the disadvantaged areas schemes is designed to ensure that the limited resources available are used to benefit those most in need of assistance, that is those who depend mainly on farming for their livelihood.  While there will always be marginal cases the present cut-off point represents a substantial non-farm income and I do not propose to change the arrangements which also applied under the previous administration.</P>

      <P>The final draft of the new comprehensive scheme for transferring <Col N="1417" /> service for superannuation purposes has been circulated to all organisations covered by the existing arrangements for transferring pension rights, asking them to indicate whether they are prepared to accept its terms.  Other public sector organisations were also circulated. Definitive replies are still outstanding from a small number of organisations. The attached schedule shows the position in relation to each of the semi-State bodies circulated.</P>
      <P>The terms of the new scheme provide that organisations may participate with effect from an agreed date which must be not earlier than 1 June 1973.  A person transferring between two participating organisations on or after the relevant operative date would automatically benefit; the scheme may also be applied, at the discretion of the final employing organisation, to persons who transferred before the operative date and are still serving on that date, and, in so far as pensions are concerned, to persons who retired before the operative date.  Pending the formal implementation of the scheme it is open to each organisation in paragraph 1 of the schedule to operate the new arrangements on a provisional basis in relation to any other organisation listed in that paragraph.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the schedule, most of the organisations concerned have accepted the new scheme and the majority of those who are still considering the position have indicated that they are, in principle, favourably disposed towards it. The scheme will have a vital role to play in furthering mobility of labour within the public sector and its importance in this respect has been brought to the attention of the organisations concerned. However, it will be appreciated that general policy on the operational independence of semi-State bodies requires that each organisation, after considering the alternatives and the stated preference of my Department, should be allowed to take its own decision as to whether, and on what basis, it would join the scheme.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made to expedite the finalisation of the new scheme and it is expected to be given full statutory effect in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Draft by-laws relative to the discharging, loading, handling, storage and distribution of petroleum have been submitted for my approval by Drogheda Harbour Commissioners.  The usual statutory requirements regarding publication of the proposed by-laws have been complied with and no objections have been received.  Consultations with other Government Departments have already been completed by my Department and I expect to be in a position to approve the proposed by-laws in the near future.</P>
      <P>I should point out that regulations made by the Minister for Labour under the Dangerous Substances Act in September 1979 which impose stringent requirements in regard to the loading, unloading and storage of petroleum, apply and are being enforced at Drogheda harbour.</P>
      <P>The Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1956-77, prohibit the discharge of oil into the territorial seas of the State or into its inland waters navigable by sea-going vessels. The areas covered by these Acts include Drogheda harbour.</P>

      <P>Under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978, the rated occupiers of hotels and guesthouses, registered under the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939 to 1975, may apply to the local authorities for relief of a proportion of their rates provided part of their premises is used wholly for ordinary dwelling purposes.  I have no proposals to extend this relief to the commercial element of their premises.  If individual hotel or guesthouse owners have difficulties in paying their rates it is, of course, open to them to make their case to the local authority.</P>
