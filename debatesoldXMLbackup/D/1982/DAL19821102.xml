      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> On a point of order, on Thursday last I asked for permission to raise on the Adjournment the closure of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and the <i>Daily News</i> newspapers and permission was granted.  At 5 p.m. when I tried to raise the matter, due to the rowdy behaviour of some members of the Labour Party the Leas-Cheann Comhairle saw fit to leave the Chair.  I would like a ruling from the Ceann Comhairle on this because the Leas-Cheann Comhairle did not formally adjourn the Dáil using the usual words; he simply got up from the Chair and walked out.  Am I not, by right, entitled to continue the Adjournment Debate on this question on the Adjournment tonight?</P>

      <P>(<i>Waterford):</i> The behaviour of Deputies in this House last Thursday should be condemned.  If a Deputy has permission to raise a matter of importance on the Adjournment and other Deputies engage in the disruptive practice of the Labour Deputies, as seen here last Thursday, it would make a farce of parliamentary procedure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>The foregoing are the main areas of expenditure of Government Departments and State bodies in the area of preservation and development of artistic and cultural heritage.  The costs shown do not include certain Departmental administrative expenses.  For the Deputy's convenience the natural heritage functions of Departments have also been included.  Note also that legislation, promoted by the Minister for the Public Service, to establish a National Heritage Council is at present before the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>(a)  The provision made for first, second and third level schools and colleges and for institutions such as Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann, the Royal Irish Academy, the Royal Irish Academy of Music, the National Library and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, contain elements related to teaching and/or research in the areas of Irish language, history and culture, Irish manuscripts and Celtic Studies.  It is not possible to detail these elements separate from the overall provision.  A section within the Department, An Gúm, deals with the publication of textbooks and general reading material in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>(b)  All of the work of the Department and of the two statutory boards under their aegis relates to the development of the Irish language, Irish culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>(c)  The activities of the Irish Film Board are not primarily related to cultural or artistic heritage but, insofar as it considers appropriate, the board shall have regard to the need for the expression of national culture through the medium of film making. Assistance for the Crafts Council of Ireland and Craft Centres is provided by the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>(d)  These projects are funded by AnCO.  It is not possible, in the time available, to provide separate details of the funding for the 19 projects involved, many of which are ongoing.</P>
    <P>(e)  Relates to Radio na Gaeltachta and the RTE orchestras, singers and players. It is not possible to give a breakdown in relation to programme-making generally insofar as it relates to artistic and cultural heritage.</P>
    <P>(f)  Relates to the upkeep of the Royal Canal and Grand Canal systems.</P>
    <P>(g)  Includes the Department's grant under section 17 (i) (a) of the Public Libraries Act, 1947, towards the running expenses of An Chomhairle Leabharlanna and grants to An Chomhairle to provide financial aid to library authorities.</P>

      <P>Is it not the case that the Arts Council made an announcement that the Irish Theatre Company would not be funded for the second half of 1982 and that during the February general election the Taoiseach undertook that his Department would guarantee funds for that company to keep them in existence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not recall saying that during the general election campaign and I hope the Deputy is not suggesting that one is related to the other.  I made a special once-off arrangement to keep the Irish Theatre Company going in 1982.  At the moment we are examining how that company can be financed in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that the Irish Theatre Company will be funded separately and that the Taoiseach intends to change the 1973 Arts Act and the functions of the Arts Council in relation to the Irish Theatre Company?  The Arts Council made a decision, within their terms of reference, concerning the Irish Theatre Company and the funding of touring theatre in Ireland and they decided touring theatre could be better achieved in another way.  Given this change in the organisation of the Arts Council <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Irish Theatre Company am I to understand that the Irish <Col N="396" /> Theatre Company are now directly under the Department of the Taoiseach and removed from the aegis of the Arts Council?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach to clarify whether the Arts Council have a role to play in organising the touring theatre in Ireland considering there has been a two-fold increase in the number of touring theatre in Ireland under the new arrangements of the Arts Council.  I want to know if the Taoiseach is running a parallel touring agency directly through his Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department are not getting into the theatre business; we put on our theatrical performances in this House.  In 1982 there was a crisis prevailing in the Irish Theatre Company, perhaps as much as anything else because of the general election situation at the beginning of the year when decisions which should have been taken were postponed. In order to deal with that emergency situation for 1982 I made a special arrangement of which the Deputy is aware.  The future of the Irish Theatre Company in 1983 and further years is at present under discussion.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach clarify for the benefit of the House and members of the cultural division of a transport workers' union employed by the Irish Theatre Company if in future all decisions relating to the funding of that company will be made exclusively by the Arts Council or will his Department continue to have a participatory role?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer if my Department did not have any participatory role because we are not a theatre people.  The 1982 arrangement was to meet an emergency and I am sure the Deputy supported it.</P>

      <P>There is no question of my Department wishing to assume anything under their jurisdiction.  We intervened as an emergency operation in 1982 and operated solely on the basis that it was a special once-off emergency arrangement for 1982.  The situation of the Irish Theatre Company can now be discussed with all concerned.  The Abbey Theatre are not involved in any way in this question.</P>

This concert hall has been built with public money and holds an important place in our cultural life.

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am so satisfied. The normal company rules apply and all the members of the board hold office subject to those limitations and restrictions. I hope the Deputy would agree with me that the concert hall is one of the most important and successful things that has happened for some time in the artistic world.  The building itself is ideal and has won praise and acclaim from all sides.  So far the company and the board have been very successful in discharging their obligations to run this national institution within the terms of the brief they have been given.  The board are fully aware of their obligations under the Companies Acts and I have no reason to doubt that they will adhere scrupulously to those limitations and restrictions.</P>

      <P>I am putting the ball back into the Deputy's court.  He was a member of the Government who made the allocation of £1.5 million for the Department of Lands.  Those estimates were accepted by the Government.  I agree that the money is not sufficient for the number of applications.  We are endeavouring to bring forward a new land policy, as I made quite plain last week in reply to a question put down to me by the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dukes. Our big problem lies in the fact that the rateable valuation system, which a good deal of the legislation depended upon, has been appealed to the Supreme Court. Until that matter has been cleared out of the way we are not in a position to bring forward an up-to-date land policy.</P>

      <P>The western drainage scheme came into operation on 1 January 1979 and initially provided for field drainage of 100,000 hectares over a five-year period.  The scheme was extended in July 1981 to provide for field drainage of an additional 50,000 hectares up to 31 December 1986.  Due to the very large number of applications received initially, approximately 60 per cent in 1979, and the limited acreage provided for in the programme, it was found necessary in the interests of fair and reasonable administration of the scheme to process applications in strict order of date of receipt.</P>

      <P>I am aware that delays in inspections can cause hardship particularly for the smaller and less well-off producers and, for this reason, I have made arrangements that applicants under the disadvantaged areas cattle and EEC suckler cow schemes with four livestock units or less are not to be inspected this year.  The 14,000 applicants who are affected are being asked to submit the cattle identity cards of their animals to the local office of the Department for noting.  When the cards are returned, the applicants will be free to dispose of their cattle without fear of losing headage grants.</P>
      <P>In regard to applicants with more than four livestock units, extra field staff have already been drawn from other areas of the Department to assist in the cattle inspections and to ensure that these will be completed in all counties before the end of November, about two weeks earlier than last year.

      <P>In accordance with international law, Ireland's sovereignty extends beyond its land territory to an adjacent belt of sea, described as the territorial sea, as well as its bed and subsoil. The outer limits of Ireland's territorial seas, in accordance with section 3 of the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959, is the line every part of which is at a distance of three nautical miles from the nearest point of the baseline.  Sovereignty is exercised subject to the rules of international law, which include the right of innocent passage for the ships of all States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland also enjoys sovereign rights over the Continental Shelf for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources.  The Continental Shelf comprises the sea-bed and subsoil of the <Col N="419" /> submarine areas that extend beyond the territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of the land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin. This means in some areas for Ireland Continental Shelf jurisdiction out as far as 350 nautical miles.  The rights of the State to explore and exploit the Continental Shelf are vested in the Minister for Industry and Energy by virtue of section 2 of the Continental Shelf Act, 1968. These rights do not affect the legal status of the superjacent waters, or of the air space above the waters and the exercise of the rights must not infringe navigation or other rights of other States.  The Government have by various orders made under this Act designated the areas within which these rights are exercisable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is bound by the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons not to manufacture or acquire nuclear weapons and there is, of course, no question of allowing other States to place their nuclear weapons here.  The main characteristics of a nuclear weapon-free zone, which are non-possession, non-deployment and non-use of nuclear weapons, are therefore met in our case.  I should point out, however, that the concept of a nuclear weapon-free zone is understood internationally to mean arrangements to be free of nuclear weapons entered into by a group of States in a region.  No State <Col N="421" /> has alone declared itself a nuclear weapon-free zone.</P>
      <P>If the term &ldquo;nuclear free zone&rdquo; used in the Deputy's question is intended also to refer to nuclear power plants, I can say, while pointing out that this matter is mainly one for my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Energy, that it is not the intention to approve any nuclear power station in the State as long as any doubts remain about the environmental or waste disposal risks of such a project.</P>
      <P>I might add, in regard to nuclear weapon-free zones, that aside from the special case of the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 which prohibits measures of a military nature in the Antarctic, the only nuclear weapon-free zone to be created by an international agreement is that established for Latin America by the 1967 Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America.</P>

      <P>The only meeting in the Anglo-Irish Inter-governmental Council framework since 28 May last was held on 16 August 1982 when the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, Deputy Daly, met the Northern Ireland Office Minister of State, Mr. Adam Butler, in Derry.  The discussions centred mainly on the Foyle Fisheries Commission which, as the Deputy will be aware, is responsible for protecting and improving the fisheries of the Foyle Catchment Area.  The Ministers agreed that the present intensity of fishing, both legal and illegal, constituted a major threat to salmon stocks and emphasised their commitment to the elimination of poaching both in the Foyle area and off-shore.</P>

There were five such meetings between January and May last.  Would the Minister like to offer any explanation why there has been a reduction in the number of meetings, which all the time have been regarded as important from the point of view of Anglo-Irish relations?  Can the Minister say if it is the intention to have a meeting in the near future between the heads of Government?

Indeed, it is the view of this Government that such an approach is no less desirable now in the aftermath of the recent election in Northern Ireland.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if the Government participated in the recent meeting in Stockholm of Foreign Ministers of the European Neutral States prior to the reconvening of the CSCE Conference in Madrid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government were not represented at the meeting to which the Deputy refers.  The meeting was one of Foreign Ministers of European neutral and non-aligned States &mdash; the NNA, as they are called, in the context of the Conference on Security and Co-operaton <Col N="425" /> in Europe (CSCE) &mdash; which took place at the end of August.  It is understood that the purpose of this meeting of the NNA was to prepare for the resumption of the Madrid follow-up meeting of the CSCE on 9 November next.</P>
      <P>During the CSCE negotiations and follow-up meetings caucuses have emerged for the purposes of consultation and co-ordination between different groups of participants.  Ireland, as a member of the European Community, through the process of European political co-operation, takes part in the work of co-ordination and consultation between the ten member states of the Community.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, other caucuses at the CSCE &mdash; for example NATO, the Warsaw Treaty Organisation and the NNA.  The Irish delegation at the CSCE had working contacts with all of these other groups but does not participate in their meetings.</P>
      <P>As regards consultation and co-ordination on the CSCE between the Ten and the NNA outside the Madrid meeting, there are periodic exchanges of view in the Council of Europe at ministerial and at expert level.  Informal ministerial discussions on the CSCE will take place at Strasbourg on 9 November.  We have always found these exchanges at Strasbourg useful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

If that is the case, why have we not been represented at the <Col N="426" /> Stockholm conference and why did we not participate in the NNA caucus at Madrid?</P>

Our particular concerns are taken into account when the positions of the ten are being worked out. I might add that we share many of the objectives of the NNA and that our representatives at the Madrid meeting keep in close contact with the NNA delegation.</P>

        <i>(Waterford)</i> asked the Minister for Industry and Energy if he is aware of the grave threat posed to the 240 employees of Waterford Ironfounders Limited, following the receiver being called in to that company on Friday, and of the additional burden this would place on the city of Waterford, which has an unacceptably high rate of unemployment above the national average; the steps he proposes to take to safeguard these jobs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern at the decision to appoint a receiver to the company in question.  I had hoped that the restructuring package, involving substantial contributions by the IDA and by Fóir Teoranta, worked out in 1981 for the TMG Group, would have put the <Col N="427" /> position of the group as a whole on a sound footing.  However, in the case of Waterford Ironfounders, the market situation deteriorated in the meantime.</P>
      <P>I understand that the receiver is at present assessing the situation and a report is awaited from him as to his intentions regarding the continuance of operations in the short term.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made by the IDA and Fóir Teoranta to ensure the survival of the company and the maintenance of employment there.  To that end, talks regarding a takeover are in progress.</P>

        <i>(Waterford):</i> Will the Minister accept that in relation to the restructuring package of 1981 which he referred to not a single shilling of that £6.5 million package went to Waterford Ironfounders?  It appears that Waterford Ironfounders are to be sacrificed in order that the TMG group can continue.  Is the Minister aware that there is a tremendous potential for Waterford Ironfounders inasmuch as two of their products, Stanley Firefront, a new product which is recognised as an energy saver, and the Stanley Cooker have a good market?  The consensus of opinion is that there is a great future for those products and for Waterford Ironfounders as a foundry in its own right.  Will the Minister be prepared to commit himself, and his Department, to finance the company until the IDA and Fóir Teoranta have prepared a rescue package?</P>

The threat to those jobs as part of a <Col N="428" /> package from Fóir Teoranta was not communicated to the workers involved until after we discussed the matter in the House on 27 October.

When we offer them a Committee, as suggested by Deputy Bruton, and, I believe, by Deputy Desmond, to discuss the plan they do not seem to welcome that suggestion either.

The assumptions behind the plan have now been published and they have been discredited by every economic writer as being absurd and having no possible reality.  The idea at this stage that such a document so discredited would be referred to a committee of the House is an obvious evasion because the Taoiseach is afraid to face the House on the plan.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I said on the last occasion, that there was one thing in the document <i>The Way Forward,</i> with which I agreed, that it was recognised by the <Col N="536" /> Government that there is a crisis in the economy.  A few months ago the Minister for Finance talked about boom and bloom but he now recognises that there is a little problem in the economy.  Some months ago the Government and the Minister for Finance gave the impression that there was not any problem whatsoever, that things were flying along grand and that they had everything under control. I am glad that a real debate can now take place, that the people on the Government benches have come to earth and have decided that there are problems in the economy.  A large proportion of those problems have been created because the Government failed to recognise that there were problems.  It is late in the day to do this and I believe great harm has been caused to the economy by the Government failing to recognise this. For years Fianna Fáil have continued to say there was boom and bloom when they knew in their hearts that was not true. Now they have been forced by circumstances to recognise that there is need for this debate on the economy.  Our party recognised that when we were part of a Coalition Government.  We recognised that steps had to be taken to bring the economy under control.  Now the very people who laughed us to scorn for that are coming to the same conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inflation which averaged 17½ per cent last year will be nearer to 13½ per cent this year.  It is clearly on the way down, but no thanks to the Government.  This is due to outside influences, the reduction of interest rates and many other things. It could have fallen faster and sooner but for taxation increases necessary to deal with the situation in the public finances which were faced up to for the first time last July.  That situation was a direct result of Fianna Fáil Government policy when they ran riot offering this, that and the other to everybody when they must have known as responsible people that those things could not be achieved.  Germany and Britain now have low single rates of inflation but both have rising unemployment, especially Britain.  I want to make clear that the Labour Party will not support this plan or any other plan which proposes to reduce inflation by cutting <Col N="537" /> wages and increasing unemployment.  If the inflation is to be brought down by cutting workers' living standards and creating further unemployment we will have no part in backing that plan.  That kind of plan has been tried in other countries such as Britain and undoubtedly they have brought down inflation but they have created a huge unemployment problem. The Labour Party want it clearly understood that we will not support a plan that increases unemployment which we regard as the major problem.</P>
    <P>Our wage levels are among the lowest in Europe but this has not produced the results it should have produced in the industrial sector that could have been achieved by proper management and competitiveness in other fields.  What we want is productivity and we are prepared to support any plan that shows how productivity can be increased.  There is no evidence to show that this can be done by lowering the ordinary workers' wages and their standard of living.  If it is to be done in that way &mdash; and that is how we see it spelled out in this plan because it is admitted that there will be increasing unemployment for three years &mdash; then I say the matter should be put to the people for decision.</P>
    <P>The way to increase productivity is by well-planned investment and ensuring co-operation between workers and management in industry.  Irish workers will co-operate in increasing productivity and industrial profits.  They will accept moderation in wage payments if they get by right something in return for the implementation of such a policy.  I think I speak for most workers when I say that certainly they will help.  I have evidence of people who have foregone increases and are prepared to forego increases in order to keep industry going in these times.  I can produce case after case where such co-operation has been offered.  What do the workers get in return?  They must have a right to share in the profits of the business which will increase with increased production. Are they to have no share in the profit in that case?  Must they just work harder and earn less?  With inflation their earnings become less.  Are they to do that so that other people can get all the profit? <Col N="538" /> Would anybody ask one component of industry to agree to such an arrangement?</P>
    <P>There are three factors in industry, management, capital and workers and one is as important as the other.  Does anybody suggest that because of the economic situation workers should forego increases, work harder and produce more in order to increase profits through greater competitiveness while foregoing any right to a share in the extra profit for extra sales?  No sane person would expect an equal partner to accept this.  I should dearly like to see realised the Government's objective of increasing employment in manufacturing industry by 9,500 per annum in the years 1983 to 1987. Employment in manufacturing industry is not much higher now than it was seven years ago.  I remember Deputy O'Donoghue, as Minister for Economic Planning and Development when his party introduced the budget giving handouts all over the place &mdash; no car tax, tax concessions for industrialists and so on &mdash; saying &mdash; I do not quote him but this is the impact of what he said &mdash; that if the strategy of full employment by 1985 did not work he would consider the proposals I offered.  He told me that across the floor of the House.  He knows and I know now how well it worked.  We now have the worst unemployment problem in the history of the State as a direct result of the policies introduced by him and his party on that occasion.  In a statement on this policy he said he would rely totally on private enterprise to provide the necessary jobs and would give them budgetary incentives to do so.  How did it turn out?  He knows how many jobs they created. We never had such a high unemployment figure.  We have no work for the young and no prospect of it within the next few years.</P>
    <P>In the document it is stated that private enterprise will be boosted so as to create jobs.  That will not happen.  With modern technology fewer people will be employed in private enterprise.  We envisaged setting up a corporation to create jobs and set aside £20 million for it. However, the Government formed some <Col N="539" /> new kind of enterprise board and set aside £5 million for it.  This has now been cut back to £3 million.  The Government stand condemned on the creation of employment.  There is a lot of waffle in the document.  There is no constructive proposal on how the Government will help sectors which could produce jobs.</P>
    <P>As regards agriculture, the Government are closing down two research stations. We have a great opportunity to process food and develop the meat industry, but instead we are cutting back.  We should be ashamed.  There has been a lot of talk about finding oil and so on but our greatest wealth is on top of the ground &mdash; the soil which is capable of producing food which is eaten all over the world. The food processing industry has been deliberately run down.  Erin Foods closed their plants because market research was not carried out into the kind of product produced.  That will be evident to anyone who gives a cursory glance at the agricultural situation.  The Government intend to cut back on the money available to agricultural research and close down two testing stations.  If we intend to bring down inflation and get rid of our debt by closing off every prospect of advancing in industry so that our bookkeeping can be tidied up, God help us.  Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael both say that the national debt must be wiped out and that we must have a clean sheet in four years' time.  Is there something sacred about four years?  Is it necessary that it must be done in that time?  Is there a case to be made for taking longer than that and so have money available for investment to produce jobs and develop the food processing industry and offal industry?  The leather tannery in Waterford has closed down.  Yet leather is rammed in here from South American countries and we have allowed it without any protest being made to the EEC.</P>
    <P>One section of Erin Foods was closed down in Carlow because they were producing an article which was out of date. One thousand acres in Carlow and south Kildare were under vegetables.  People made a living out of it and about 400 people were employed in the plant.  The <Col N="540" /> workers met every target set by management and farmers never failed to deliver on their contracts.  These are indisputable facts.  No market research was carried out and the article could not be sold because it was out of date even while it was being produced.  The Minister should deny what I am saying if it is wrong.  We had the material, the work force and the farmers, but the finished product was out of date.  Now we are told the Government intend to cut back on research and so on in order to balance the books in a period of four years.  We in the Labour Party do not accept that programme and never will.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to introduce company development plans.  We need this kind of approach and if we are to concentrate our resources on the expansion of a more select number of firms our present grants policy will have to be changed.  The National Development Corporation, who were opposed by this Government and attacked by the media, are recognised in this document.  We were intent on giving a major investment role to the National Development Corporation with power to invest selectively in existing companies and form joint ventures with companies, mainly Irish domestic firms.  The one weakness in the Government's proposal for a company development plan is that they do not discuss how the present grants policy of the IDA, which is for capital grants, can be married to the objectives of the company by company approach.  Our primary objective must be the creation of jobs and the employment of young people.  If we are to achieve that objective there must be cutbacks in the capital programme and investment by banks and financial institutions will have to be controlled by the Government.</P>
    <P>Many people accuse my party of wanting to nationalise the banks.  They seem to have the idea that we will get guns, hold up the bank managers and then take over.  If the Government do not have control over the banks and financial institutions they do not have control over the country and cannot direct economic or other growth.  There is nothing in this document to show how this investment <Col N="541" /> plan will be implemented or where the money will come from.  I know it will not come from the ordinary workers' savings. These ordinary people will not be able to save because the increase in wages will be about half that of inflation.  This means that the Government cannot depend on the savings of the 90 per cent of the population, the ordinary people whose living standards will be reduced.</P>
    <P>In the Coalition budget we provided £20 million to set up the National Development Corporation to help industry.  It was decided that the Government would take over and nationalise the paper manufacturing industry and I agreed with them.  As a people we should recognise that nationalising an industry is not the end of the story.  We should ensure that the industry is profit-making and can be run economically.  If the company is not run economically, the decision to take it over was wrong.  All State industries should be run economically and in a businesslike way.</P>
    <P>I cannot see anything in this document which will produce the extra jobs necessary. We must give young people hope. It does not matter if we do away with our budget deficits in ten, 15 or even 20 years. If the Government aim at clearing the budget deficit within four years, they are doing that at the expense of providing jobs.</P>
    <P>No one would deny that many of the objectives outlined in this plan are desirable. The Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party tell us this plan will be the saviour of our nation but there is no evidence to show where the employment will be provided. I went through this document with a fine-comb and cannot find where these jobs will be provided.  We are told there will be a drop in employment for the next few years but that is not acceptable because there are about 200,000 people of all ages unemployed and every day we have more redundancies.  Recently the last foundry, which produced machinery parts for Bord na Móna and the Sugar Company, closed in Athy.  Is the Minister for Industry and Energy going to allow that firm to remain closed?  If so, the Sugar Company, Wavin and other firms will have to import spare parts.  Is the <Col N="542" /> Minister saying nothing can be done unless somebody buys this foundry which provided a service?  Some of the people were employed there for 40 years and many workers acquired special skills there.  The foundry had been in existence for the last 50 years and had withstood the pressures of the war years when raw materials had to be dug out of dykes and ditches to keep the company viable.  We must now tell Bord na Móna, who were one of this firm's big customers, that they must import their spare parts. Because of political pressure certain industries are nationalised.  That is not a good idea.  The IDA had 40 per cent of the shares in that company and believed it was essential that we have our own foundry.  Unless someone buys this foundry, which is unlikely, our industrialists will have to buy their machinery and spare parts in other countries.  This is the type of industry we should nationalise because it is essential that we have a foundry within the State.</P>
    <P>The plan contains no ideas about where the State should participate. Apparently £370 million is to be allocated to the public sector during the first three years of the plan for restructuring but there will be no more money during 1986 and 1987.  There will be no funds available during those last two years of the plan.  The Government should go before the people and try to defend this policy.</P>
    <P>We have a much more realistic approach.  While recognising the problems in State commercial companies we would identify their growth areas and give them funds to enable them to engage in profitable ventures either on their own or in partnership with the private sector. We must make the necessary money available to the public sector if our young people are to have any hope for the future.  The Fine Gael plan at least proposes a role for the National Development Corporation but the plans put forward by both the major parties lack a recognition that private enterprise has been a massive failure in employment terms.  It has failed to produce the kind of jobs necessary to give employment to our people.</P>
    <P>There is no use in waving flags and <Col N="543" /> talking about freedom.  Security is a lot more important to ordinary people than freedom and security for our young people is sadly lacking.  If we want jobs to be created in the private sector the level of grant-aid paid out as distinct from grants approved should vary with the number of jobs created.  We should not worry about offending some American or British investor.  Grants should be paid on the actual number of jobs created and not on the number of jobs projected. American businessmen in my constituency have set up industries which were to have employed 800 or 1,000 people but the number of new jobs is only 300 or sometimes as low as 100.  We give these people the money to buy their factories and machinery and to train workers but place no binding commitment on them as to the number of jobs to be created or production levels.  The business of the private sector is to make profits.  I do not object to that because profits are a necessary ingredient for future investment in public and private ventures.  However, as politicians our job is to generate employment for our growing labour force and we must be businesslike about spending State money and get the best value in terms of lasting employment.</P>
    <P>The section on jobs contained in this plan depends on three things: a growth in exports of 12.25 per cent per annum, a growth in international trade of 4 per cent per annum and a 6.25 per cent growth in investment.  What evidence have we that exports will increase at all? The economist who called this plan &ldquo;the road to God knows where&rdquo; was slightly off the mark.  Considering the kinds of assumptions on which the plan is based, it might more appropriately be called &ldquo;the road to Hell&rdquo; because as we all know the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. There is not a shred of evidence as to how these desirable objectives are to be achieved.  They are just wishful thinking. I would hope that these assumptions would be proved right because God help us all if they are not.  There is little else in the form of hope for the future in this document.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the actions taken by <Col N="544" /> the Government when they were belatedly forced to admit that there was something of an economic crisis.  What did they do?  During the recess they crucified the poor.  Our party will tonight challenge the Government in a motion condemning their actions on the cutbacks in the health service.  An unfortunate woman in my constituency has been told that the tablets she has been taking for some time will not now be available free on the medical card and will cost £10 per week. This woman is aged 90 and lives alone and she has no income other than the old age pension.  Is this how the Government expect people to tighten their belts to put this plan into operation?  The Government will be obstructed by this party if they attempt to implement that kind of policy.  They often tell us of their concern for the poor but I challenge any Minister who claims that this is the way to cut back on expenditure.  It reminds me of a county manager telling the county council that he must lay off workers while increasing staff in the office.  If these are the kinds of criteria to be adopted, let us say to the lower income group that they will have to pay so that our finances can be put into order within four years.</P>
    <P>I can point out many places where we could save money.  I will not stand idly by and allow the Minister to take tablets from a woman of 90 years of age living on an old age pension.  Her doctor told her she needs these tablets to keep fit and well.  Anybody who is in touch with ordinary people will appreciate that we cannot allow the Government to make savings in these areas.</P>
    <P>A great deal of work needs to be done throughout the length and breadth of the land.  Councillors have proposed schemes which need to be implemented, but we are told money cannot be spent on them. We will not allow the Government to cut back in these areas while our people are unemployed.  The only suggestion the Government can make to the local authorities is that they should charge for services.  I have no objection to imposing charges on people who are able to pay. This year our county manager introduced an increased charge of £25 for water connection to houses, irrespective of the type <Col N="545" /> of house.  The old rating system was bad, but it was not as bad as charging £25 to connect water to a caravan where an unfortunate man and his wife and family are condemned to live because of the lack of a housing policy.  A man with six bedrooms in his house has to contribute the same amount.  Unfortunate people are being asked to subsidise the bigger man. We in the Labour Party will have no part in such a plan and we will do our best to obstruct its passage through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to rebut one point made just now by Deputy Bermingham concerning a matter in which the Labour Party have an interest which they refused to follow up because they saw the successful outcome of our policies in recent months on the meat processing factories. They have had a motion down for a number of months calling on me to introduce measures equalising the conditions of competition between live cattle exports and exports of boneless beef to non-EEC countries.  That has been done by this Government and by me as Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The net result is that in today's <i>Irish Press,</i> in the Farm Press section, under the heading &ldquo;Many Meat Plants Back to 5-Day Week&rdquo; the agricultural correspondent Stephen O'Byrnes mentions that the latest figure for cattle into meat factories for killing is now running at 34,000 head compared to 26,000 head a year ago.  We have there a substantial increase of over 25 per cent in the number of cattle going for killing.  This has been achieved by a deliberate change which I secured in the aid given by the EEC by way of market refund grants for beef exports to third countries.  As a result of this incentive there is a far bigger export refund in the case of dead meat as against live meat, and the export refund also goes right back to boned out meat and more sophisticated forms of dead meat to which it did not attach until this change was made a few months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party have had that motion down since early on in my present position and they refused to follow it up because the meat factories are now making <Col N="546" /> the recovery they would have made, but for neglect.  We have persuaded the Commission to switch their aid towards dead meat, processed meat and sophisticated meat exports by way of market export refunds as well as operating the intervention system.  This gives direct encouragement for sending cattle into factories for killing and for further processing. I mention that point because Deputy Bermingham made a lot of play with it.  I sent out for <i>The Irish Press</i> and I also happened to remember the Labour Party motion which has lain on the Order Paper over the past six months and was not moved by them because they knew action was being taken.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the main purpose of the debate, which is the whole question of the national economic plan. As was emphasised by the Taoiseach, there is no point in scoring party political points in this House about this plan. There is no other way forward but to follow the disciplines and the economic schemes by way of public investment, incentives and restraints on financial expenditure.  There is no way forward except through the economic plan.  No matter who is in Government in the years ahead, or what combination of parties are in Government, there is no other way forward except to follow the broad outline of that plan.  It is only through a rigorous implementation of the Government's national economic plan that we can come to grips finally with our serious inflation problem and attack it in such a way as to reduce Government expenditure and level off our taxation burden which was becoming impossible to bear.</P>
    <P>The decision was taken to publicise the plan.  I should like us in this House as leaders of public opinion to recognise that there is no other way forward.  Anyone making a honest appraisal of our economy must admit that this plan represents the way forward and that the Government must follow the broad outline and the details of the national economic plan to achieve the objective of reducing inflation by reducing public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The facts of economic life are inescapable. We cannot achieve better standards <Col N="547" /> of living by deciding we deserve them. We cannot achieve them by awarding ourselves more money without the backing of new wealth and production.  We must learn that selling enough abroad to pay for all the goods we import is the way we must go forward.  We must learn to earn our living in that way.</P>
    <P>The national plan goes on to say that public services cannot be provided on the basis of what is desirable, however desirable they might be.  They must be based on what can be paid for out of taxation. These are hard facts.  There are no soft options in the plan.  There is no magic wand which can be waved to provide us all with what we would wish to have. Other countries throughout the world, whether in the EEC or outside it, are now seeing the hard facts of economic life today.  The rising expectations which so characterised the sixties and seventies no longer represent a valid philosophy, for, first of all, getting public expenditure into order and then providing through that the environment for economic growth.</P>
    <P>One optimistic feature in our situation is that throughout the seventies, since our membership of the EEC from 1 January 1973, we had a large amount of on-farm investment.  In the difficult days of the late seventies some of that went wrong for some of our farmers, but there is a basic, hard, substantial investment in the soil of the country, in improved fencing, improved machinery, improved milking methods, improved stocking, better breeding of stocking in particular although not in numbers.  In areas of that kind substantial investments have been made that will last and provide the basis on which we can build and develop.</P>
    <P>In preparing the plan the Government had to take into account both the advantages and opportunities that we enjoy and the difficulties we must overcome. Considering first of all the advantages, we have a high population of young people with a high level of education.  We have technical skills in that young population which are very suitable for modern industrial development and have proved suitable as such in the modern computer, <Col N="548" /> high technology type of industrial development that we have secured from North America in particular.  We have been able to attract industries which require these skills and their products are selling in the highly competitive world markets to which they are attuned.  Apart from that type of industrial development, we have the potential of Irish soil to produce high quality farm products in greater volume then heretofore and the skills of our farmers to exploit that potential.  I remain optimistic in this respect, particularly as we continue to sustain the common agricultural policy and participate in that grouping of 250 million people with an on-going CAP.  The important battle in that was won in securing this year's farm price package which we secured by a majority vote.  For the first time ever the farm price package was implemented by a majority vote and showed loudly and clearly that that interpretation of the Treaty of Rome was the correct one and that no country, such as the UK was attempting to do, would ever go along the road of eroding or destroying that policy again.  That message has been well received and represents a watershed decision.</P>
    <P>However, as well as the plus aspects I have mentioned, the plan also recognises realistically our economic weaknesses. We are creating jobs but we are losing them in older industries also.  Imported products are coming in to a greater degree in our home markets.  We have been running large deficits on our trade with other countries, due in large part to operating costs having risen, and we have the problem of energy costs.  Our level of borrowing to meet Exchequer expenditure on day-to-day current spending has also increased too much.  These matters must be rectified.  Therefore, in the plan are an element of rectification or correction on the one hand and a basic element or orientation towards productive investment on the other hand, recognising our strengths where investment should be attracted.</P>
    <P>The overall purpose of the plan must be to reduce unemployment, but we cannot do that until we increase cost competitiveness, and we cannot increase cost <Col N="549" /> competitiveness without increasing inflation. That makes sense.  The increasing of job opportunities requires an economy that will withstand competition from imports and be able to compete effectively on export markets.  Here again agriculture can play a substantial part as an industry that has a significant proportion of our exports but also the added value as far as the nation is concerned of being an industry with a relatively small import content.  Therefore, every £1 of agricultural produce exported is of significantly greater value to the community as a whole than all other industries that have in varying degrees a higher import content in regard to raw materials and inputs.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, we stand on the threshold of a new economic era and not just in Ireland but throughout the world.  We are a small trading country living now in a world environment in which competitiveness is all-important.  In this type of environment, particularly for small trading countries such as ours, the pursuit of sectional interests is a disastrous course which must be replaced by an approach which takes account fully of our common interest in resolving the economic and social dangers which threaten us.  In the face of adversity and challenge we must unite not only to overcome these difficulties but also to ensure a secure future for ourselves and our children.</P>
    <P>In that connection I would like to emphasise the recent rapport established between the Government and the trade union movement in working out the difficulty in regard to public sector pay.  That showed an example of a new approach, a real partnership approach between the trade union movement and the Government. Step by step over August, September and October, until the recent successful conclusion of these discussions, there was very close consultation, co-ordination and co-operation at every stage between the trade union movement and the Government and a recognition by the trade union movement of the Government's problems in the community interest.  The trade union movement has a responsibility to all its members throughout industry, and there was recognition <Col N="550" /> by the Government of their problems.  That was one excellent example of both good Government and good trade union leadership.</P>
    <P>The open economy to which I have referred which exists in this country emphasises the importance of international trade and again, unfortunately, makes us very susceptible to changes on the international economic scene. Growth in output during the three years to 1981 averaged at 2 per cent per annum, which compared reasonably well with that of our main trading partners but is clearly far below our potential.  Whereas our main trading partners have reached a high level of development in which a percentage increase of that order may be acceptable, our potential is not fully realised.  What is required in order to provide employment in our situation is a far higher scale of increase.  More than in most other countries, economic prospects here are dependant on international developments.  I will mention one statistic that is very relevant here. Our imports represent some 70 per cent of our GNP and our exports 55 per cent. These two percentages are more than double the average among EEC countries and have important implications for us.  Again they emphasise the importance of competitiveness and of Ireland standing together in a national sense in the face of an international recession such as we are witnessing now which affects us, by reason of the figures I have just mentioned, to a far greater degree than it affects our trading partners or other countries within the EEC.  This dependence on international development is as true for agriculture as for industry and in terms of the importance of export outlets for our products and the influence of internal factors and the prices received by our producers, here again the agricultural sector is susceptible to international economic pressures of the kind I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Heavy expenditure in public investment which the Government undertook during the current recession has softened the impact of the recession and has helped to improve the economic infrastructure, but unless the economy is competitive <Col N="551" /> Government action alone cannot achieve growth at the rate required to reduce unemployment.  That basic message is now clearly seen and understood. The creation of sufficient increases in employment to reduce our existing high level of unemployment and provide jobs for the expected rise in the labour force will require substantial increases in output in the traded goods of the economy. We must produce more goods and services that other countries are prepared to purchase.  In other words, we must secure a greater share of domestic and world markets for Irish products and services.  This basic requirement in regard to competitiveness is, as I said earlier, equally important to the farming sector where we must concentrate on improving the productivity of the sources used and the quality of products produced.</P>
    <P>All of this is emphasised and underlined in the National Economic Plan.  A crucial element in the response to the Government's efforts in the plan must be the recognition that as a people we just cannot continue to demand ever higher levels of wage increases and still compete in the world markets.  Our ability to compete is determined principally by wage costs per unit of output and until we can increase our productivity to levels comparable to those of our major trading partners we will not get the increased standard of living which we desire and certainly not the employment required in our situation.</P>
    <P>Given the need to eliminate the current budget deficit over the next few years and to reduce the balance of payments deficit to an acceptable level, the ability of the Government to finance measures which will improve our competitive position is severely limited.  Within this constraint, however, the Government are determined to provide a favourable environment for growth.  When one talks about a favourable environment for growth, one is talking about the totally unacceptable level of inflation and, in particular, the way that factor has hindered our basic industry and our greatest asset as a nation &mdash; our land.  A large proportion of Irish farms are highly productive, or are capable <Col N="552" /> of being rendered so by well directed endeavour.  It is our responsibility as a community to ensure that our land is utilised to the greatest extent possible and to create the necessary environment. To do that, inflation must be tackled.  The whole tenor of the plan as related to agriculture is basically geared in this direction.</P>
    <P>What we are setting out to do over the coming four years is to create the economic framework or environment in which farmers primarily through their own efforts, can achieve a significant increase in output from their farms and as a consequence increase their incomes. Output and income are, of course, inter-related as far as the farmer is concerned. Within the financial constraints obtaining the Government will encourage and assist them to do this.  However, the present year does require a certain basis for optimism in this respect.  The most recent estimate made by my Department for 1982 suggests that we will have a volume increase of 3 per cent in gross agricultural output and 5 per cent in net output and that farm incomes will rise by some 25 per cent in nominal terms, or about 7 per cent in real terms, after discounting inflation.  I would regard the latter figure as conservative.  Inflation seems to be coming down faster than originally thought.  I believe that inflation will come down considerably more and raise that 7 per cent figure in real terms by the end of the year to a higher percentage. However I am at present staying with the conservative figure.</P>
    <P>The major determining factors of such an output will be developments of the beef and dairy sectors, as these account for such a large proportion of farming activity.  Milk output for this sector for this year has a projected increase of 6 per cent in volume terms following a decline in 1980 and 1981.  We have now a whole panoply of schemes designed to improve the national herd.  This will represent the main thrust of the farm development plan, when it emerges.  In addition to the headage grant and the new in-calf heifer grant of £75 &mdash; which is an extension of Deputy Dukes' interest grant scheme and which will be converted into a grant <Col N="553" /> scheme for next year and the following year &mdash; there is the cow suckler scheme and the new-calf premium scheme.  Over the four schemes designed to increase cattle production, one is talking of a figure in the region of £170 to £180, which is important.  I would like to see emerging from this plan, the final discussions of which I expect will be completed in a matter of weeks, strong emphasis on the whole question of raising cattle and sheep numbers.  The potential is there.  We have shown this year that increased output can mean increased incomes.  The quickest and best way to achieve this is by increasing livestock numbers.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that inflation is the main target in the plan, anti-inflation measures being a very important aspect.  These will do more than anything else to provide the proper environment as far as farming is concerned.  That is linked with another aspect which is a reflection of the inflationary pressures to which we have been subjected, that of high interest rates.  These have been a bedevilling factor in Irish farming in recent times.  I look forward to some form of credit facility emerging from the deliberations of the committee which is sitting at present.  Again, I do not wish to preempt or anticipate their recommendations, but obviously something requires to be done in that area for farmers going in for the purchase of new stock, or improvement in the breeding of existing stock.  There is a gap in regard to the interest schemes which apply to past operations.  In the future, if we are going to embark on a positive policy of encouragement with regard to breeding stock, we must do something in this area also to complement the existing grant schemes.</P>
    <P>I mentioned one aspect of the National Economic Plan which will be amplified considerably in the proposed farm development plan, which will be fully published when I receive it.  That is the emphasis in the national economic plan on raising output to direct the use of resources to the highest degree possible towards increasing farm output and, through that route, farm incomes.  That is the main message in the plan.  The farming organisations who have commented <Col N="554" /> on this plan have welcomed it. The Taoiseach and I met the farming organisations and I am also glad to see that the other ancillary organisations, such as the ICOS and the Irish Dairy Industries' Association also endorse the broad thrust of the plan as it related to curbing inflation and raising farm input and income.  I have already mentioned that these organisations are represented on the farm development plan.  It has been a very excellent development, has worked very well, with the voluntary farm organisations sitting in on the preparation of the plan with the State agencies and the relevant Government Departments.</P>
    <P>A similar approach in regard to making existing schemes more production orientated is being studied in regard to the farm modernisation scheme and also the disadvantaged areas scheme.  While maintaining the present schemes, there can be an orientation towards production written into them, which is desirable.  For instance, the number of development farmers within the farm modernisation scheme is still very disappointing &mdash; only about 25 per cent of farmers.  We hope that there will be a greater degree of flexibility which will allow for an extension of that category of development farmers and also grants encouraging farmers to proceed with farm development plans involving planned investment over a period of years.  Under the western package full-time farmers secure a higher rate of grant when they follow a farm plan, even though not up to development standards.  An extension of that idea is being examined.</P>
    <P>Under the plan, overall Government action is designed to organise agricultural growth of 3 per cent a year. Achievement of this will depend on the success of policy measures as a whole in the atmosphere of the economic environment I mentioned.  Under the farm modernisation system another improvement will be building grants towards the provision of livestock accommodation and winter feed facilities.  As well, an improved financial appraisal procedure will be introduced so that plans will be approved <Col N="555" /> only when it has been established clearly that the prospective returns will justify the investment.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary, of course, to improve the marketing of farm produce and, though there is no easy answer in regard to further incentives to producer groups, in my view it is essential particularly in the livestock, horticulture and potato-growing sectors that incentives to producer groups will represent a way forward &mdash; in other words, we should have incentives and aid directed more towards production.</P>
    <P>In regard to disease eradication, we are seeing the end of brucellosis and we should be rid of it in four years.  We are not having the same success in regard to bovine TB, although the blitz campaigns carried out this year have proved successful.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Bermingham, earlier I referred to the importance of added value production.  I was glad to read in today's <i>Irish Press</i> that meat plants appear to be back on a five-day week as a norm.  The number of cattle going in increased by between 25 per cent and 30 per cent in the last week.  The export refund encouragement is having an effect.  The grants are now tilted to the benefit of those sending cattle for slaughter. The grants are also encouraging more sophisticated dead-meat processes and that innovation can be seen to be having a practical effect already.  That is very welcome and I am assured by the Commission that it will be a continuing feature of the CAP rather than relying on intervention alone.  I welcome that because I believe selling in the market place with the aid of export refunds, particularly in third countries, is a far more beneficial way to do business because it is more productive for everybody concerned than selling out of intervention, although the intervention mechanism can still be retained.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the importance of the CAP to all of us.  It has been underrated here. Sometimes we tend to be receptive to a high degree of criticism in regard to the CAP in the British media.  I reject the criticism we get from that source because <Col N="556" /> the CAP represents a cornerstone of our policy in the Community.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by referring to the tone of the debate last week, particularly Deputy FitzGerald's contribution.  The leader of Fine Gael was guilty of innuendo and character assassination of members of the Government.  When debating such a serious matter as an economic plan, that sort of smear campaign or character assassination by Members of the House does not do us any good outside with the public, with the voluntary organisations who are genuinely interested in sectors of our economic development or, in particular, with our young people.  I will quote some remarks by Deputy FitzGerald which I regard as particularly deplorable.  They are to be found at column 115 of the Official Report for 27 October:</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has been responsible for the most massive and sudden drop in support any party have experienced ever, to our knowledge, in this State. One fifth of those who said they would vote for the party in May has evaporated in five months.  He is responsible for the erosion of confidence in our institutions, growing disillusionment with politics among the electorate.  He is responsible for deep concern among the Garda Síochána that justice is being subverted by interference of a type and on a scale that endangers the morale of the force and its effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is responsible for the collapse of the Anglo-Irish relationship&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>There were similar innuendoes in his references to the various Ministers.  I do not mind what he said about me &mdash; I have been too long here to let it worry me &mdash; but he referred to the Minister for Foreign Affairs who, he said, lacks credibility outside Ireland, &ldquo;as anyone with international contacts will know&rdquo;.  He went through all the Ministers and made smear remarks about them all.</P>
    <P>That is the type of thing that does enormous damage in politics today.  I sincerely believe that Deputy FitzGerald is more responsible for this than anyone in <Col N="557" /> the House, this erosion of regard for this House, for Deputies and for others in public life.  He embarked on this campaign the first day the Taoiseach was appointed nearly three years ago.  I happened to have been sitting here then and I was horrified to hear him engage in that type of invective and vituperation against the Taoiseach.  He spoke about the man with the flawed character.</P>
    <P>The remarks Deputy FitzGerald made here last week reminded me very much of that.  It is very bad that we should conduct our politics in that way.  That sort of talk begets talk, rumour begets rumour, and the media feed out of it. The people in pubs feed out of it, everybody talks about it.  All we are doing is dragging down ourselves in Irish politics. I happen to know that practically all of it is utter lies.  The sort of rumours that have been going round in recent times about my colleagues, and propagated in the media &mdash; the sort of remarks, for instance, about the Minister for Justice &mdash; are absolute lies.  I am personally satisfied that there is no truth whatever, good bad or indifferent, in those remarks.  One cannot catch up with these offhand remarks, these innuendoes, like the remark about the Minister for Foreign Affairs, a typical smear remark. There is not the slightest rational basis or reason to sustain that point of view.  It is merely stated in that generalised sort of manner.  That is very dangerous.  It has become a fashion, particularly with Deputy FitzGerald, in the House.  I must select him out for comment because I have not heard any other Fine Gael or Labour Member going in for that.  I have not heard any Member of The Workers Party or Independents indulging in that. Deputy FitzGerald is the only Member who goes in for this type of selective innuendo comment.  It is the sort of comment that is taken up by the media, travels well through the media and into the rumour machine.  Such comments can seriously erode public life and values of people and their regard for people in public life.  It is bad all round.  We can do our business without engaging in that sort of personality slagging There is no need for it.  It is unnecessary. <Col N="558" /> I have never met any Member &mdash; I am longer here than most &mdash; who deserves the sort of comment I have heard Deputy FitzGerald engage in deliberately in regard to colleagues here.  I have never heard anything that would even remotely motivate me to making the sort of comment Deputy FitzGerald has made.  I do not think such comments are justified. There have been excellent Members on all sides of the House who have made a positive contribution&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I should like to ask the Minister to return to the matter under discussion and not deal with something else.  If he finds the report all that uninteresting he should cease his contribution.</P>

      <P>I am concluding my remarks and I am certain that other speakers will be equally constructive.  It is incumbent on me to appeal to Deputies, particularly to Deputy FitzGerald, to cease that sort of politics.  That does not do any good but will contribute only to further denigration of the political life to which we are all, in one way or another, doing our best to subscribe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall return to the debate on the Government's economic plan.  The plan reveals a lack of learning on the part of the Government from their planning exercises in the early sixties.  A series of plans were introduced then and ambitious targets set but they were not backed by any policy to implement them. As a result they failed.  This plan repeats that mistake.  We have before us an eternally consistent target but it is held <Col N="559" /> together by pious appeals to the capacity of community self sacrifice.  That is not what we want from the Government.  A plan must have some form of policy instruments that link what it aims to do to a policy that will achieve it.  That is what is missing in the Government's plan and it is the key criticism I have of it.</P>
      <P>The Government have issued a vague list of what they are willing to do but that reads more like a list from the Estimates of what is taking place in various Departments. A willingness is expressed to examine various means of improving things but fundamental policies to change the way the economy is working are absent.  That would be all right were it not for the fact that what is proposed by the Government in the economic plan is a serious fundamental change in the way our economy is working.  The projections in that plan have never been achieved for a sustained period in the past history of our economy.  We want real policy initiatives but they are not there.</P>
      <P>The Government have made much play of the fact that those who criticise the plan are selling our people short and are expecting too little of our people but the failure of the Government to come up with any constructive policies and the faulty analysis that underpins the plan means that what is being offered to the people is a complete deception.  The plan does not offer any long-term hope for our people that there will be employment. In summary, the plan states that there will be a boom output.  It proposed that output growth will grow cumulatively over the next five years by 28 per cent. At the same time workers are supposed to cheerfully produce that output while accepting a 12½ per cent cut in their real take home pay.  In the public sector workers are expected to accept even more severe cuts.  Meanwhile, it is projected that profits will grow by 84 per cent in real terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That sort of a projection for the economy represents dramatic change not only in the output growth it proposes but in the fundamental redistribution of income within the community, away from workers towards profits.  To make that <Col N="560" /> work there would have to be an underpinning incomes policy which is absent in the plan.  The Government propose that the output boom will generate the tax revenue to solve the budget deficit and will also generate the exports to sort out the problem with our balance of payments. To judge from the response from the Government benches to questioning of this strategy it seems that they consider it almost anti-national to question some of the assumptions that underpin the plan.  Some of them seem to think that it is more serious, that it is a questioning of the moral fibre of the community.  The plan is proposed to us as a strategy of economic faith, not of policy, and that is a serious fall down for the Government.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing to see that there are no policies.  The private sector, so long struggling for survival, expect that if it is to come forward with new growth of the nature indicated by the Government there will be some change in the economic environment it faces.  What are the main areas of the economic environment faced by companies that are influenced by the Government?  They are the tax codes, the system of expenditure incentives and grants offered by the Government, the exchange rate strategy followed by the Government and the incomes policy strategy adopted by the Government.  In those four key areas the Government have not proposed any change.  There is no change in the tax code, the grant system, the exchange rate policy or any initiative to provide the community with an incomes policy that can achieve the sort of sacrifices the Government are looking for.  In that context how can the Government conceivably expect a dramatic improvement in performances?  They cannot hide behind pious appeals to people any more.  They must provide some concrete proposals.</P>
    <P>We are told that we should look at the sectoral strategy, the nuts and bolts of the plan, to see what the Government propose.  At best the sectoral strategy will achieve something in the long run but it takes a long time for small changes in emphasis in policy to come through to achieve real change in industrial performance. The macro-economic policy targets <Col N="561" /> are unrelated to policies.  The most serious criticism is that when we look at the sectoral sections we find a list of what existing state agencies are doing and some things that the Government are willing to examine but no significant new policies.  The worst one of all is where the plan describes what the Government intend to do in regard to the area of tourism.  The plan states that an examination will be undertaken with a view to eliminating the cost disadvantages arising from higher charges borne by the tourism sector and also refers to an assessment of the appropriate ways and means to stimulate the provision of additional tourist accommodation.  In the first case the Government mentioned an examination while in the second instance they refer to an assessment.  The plan states that the Government will pay greater attention to those of their activities which impinge on tourism.  There is nothing of any content in that statement.  The plan also states that special emphasis will continue to be placed on the protection and preservation of the environment and there is talk about the possibility of extending the tourist season.  The Government are appealing to people to stay at home on holidays but there is nothing concrete that will lead a person involved in the tourist industry to say: there is something worthwhile that will make it more profitable for me to expand output.  That is the type of response we got in the plan on sectoral strategy.</P>
    <P>It is important, when responding to the plan to look at some of the analyses that underpin it.  A speaker from the Labour Party referred to the fact that export growth of 12¼ per cent is projected.  The plan implies that manufacturing industry will have to come forward with an unprecedented 17 per cent growth in exports.  How is this to be achieved?  In the plan two key assumptions are made as being the basis of this performance. The first is that there will be 4 per cent growth in our export markets and the second is that our foreign competitors will face unit-wage-cost growths of 7½ per cent per annum over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>All recent forecasts indicate that lower <Col N="562" /> growth in trading markets is to be expected and that the growth in unit wage costs will be far lower than stated in the Government's plan.  A recent outlook document dealt with this.  In 1983, the first year of the programme, far from 7½ per cent, they are projecting in the case of our major trading partners, in the United States 4 per cent, Japan 2¼ per cent, Germany less than 1 per cent, the UK 3 per cent and, overall, an average of 4½ per cent.  It has already been proved that the fundamental basis on which the Government are planning their strategy is now a year out of date.  It seems that the forecasts were made a year ago and a lot has happened since then.  It is a very serious criticism of the Government that they have failed to keep up to date with development in the world economy.  If they are going to put such emphasis on export performance they should see what is happening in those export markets.</P>
    <P>They propose, based on those forecasts, that a 9 per cent wage increase will give us major competitive gains.  All the elements of this forecast hang together very closely and a slippage in any element will mean quite a serious shortfall of the target.  While admitting this knife-edge nature in the economic plan, the Government have failed to provide any real incomes framework within which we could expect that the wage moderation the Government demand could be achieved.  Their failure to tackle that aspect, to give a real incomes policy to underpin what they are looking for, is the most wanting part of the economic plan.</P>
    <P>When we turn to discussion of the manufacturing sector we find that the Government have not given us any sort of analysis of past performance.  We do not find any discussion of what the cause of job losses has been in our manufacturing sector.  We do not find any discussion of the degree of success in getting industries that are integrated with linkages to other forms of industry providing demand for other types of industry.  This sort of criticism was brought forward in the recent Telesis Report.  The Government have not tackled them in any sense. They have not analysed them to provide a background to the sort of policies they <Col N="563" /> wish to adopt.  The lack of that sort of context makes a nonsense of any strategy that is adopted because we cannot link what they are talking about to the past performance or the future performance of the economy.</P>
    <P>I would like to dwell on some of the very dramatic implications that are built into the plan.  The most serious one deals with the distribution of income that is involved.  The pre-tax pay of industrial workers is set to fall by 4 per cent in real terms over the period of the plan but in after-tax terms, even with the £100 million tax refund to PAYE workers, which the Government propose, the ordinary worker will find that his average tax rates have grown on an average of 5 per cent. In effect, workers are being asked to take, over the period of this plan, a 12½ per cent cut in their real take-home pay. At the same time profits are projected to grow by 85 per cent in real terms which it is proposed will bring profit-sharing from 14½ per cent of income up to 23 per cent in 1987.  That projection by the Government is a higher profit share than has ever been achieved by profit earnings in the country.  The Government have smudged this side of their economic plan. If such a redistribution of income is to be achieved the onus is on the Government to provide the sort of framework within which that sort of target could be achieved.</P>
    <P>Where is there an incomes policy in this document?  There is none.  The Government's record over the past few months and, before they came into Government, their response to the efforts of the previous Government, to provide a framework for the growth of incomes has proved that they are not considering an incomes policy.  The Government lampooned the Coalition Government's attempt to gain consensus on what could be afforded by the economy.  When the Coalition Government set up a committee on competitiveness which proposed what could be afforded by the Government, the Fianna Fáil Party made a mockery of that attempt.  That was a serious mistake because establishing wage norms agreed <Col N="564" /> by all sections of the community is the only way in which we can get a firm foundation for income settlements.</P>
    <P>The Government during the past few months have seriously damaged the possibility of any sort of pay settlement by their provocative refusal to proceed with the negotiated pay settlement undertaken by the previous Government.  In the economic plan the Government turned their back on any tax reforms. They state that they assume the existing tax structures and tax rates will continue up to 1987.  That must be the most serious blow to industrial peace and to moderate income settlements.  In recent years we had massive protests from the ordinary workers against the tax structure and the way it has been administered.  The Government, in two short lines in this document, turned their back on any reforms in that system.  It is nonsense to turn around and expect tremendous wage moderation.</P>
    <P>With regard to their proposals about existing tax rates and tax structures I would like to hear what exactly they propose. Do they mean any indexation in the present structure?  If we are to face a situation where the allowances and the bands will not be indexed in any way even the 12½ per cent cut in real wages I have suggested would be far exceeded by the strategy of the Government.  The Government in their document recognise a special problem raised by special pay claims.  This refers to public sector pay settlements.  They deal with this subject on page 19.  They state that a basic economic question is to what extent the process of special pay claims based on relativities can continue if the economy is to achieve its full potential.  They state:</P>
    <P>There appears to be no end to this process as each settlement triggers off another until the process starts all over again.</P>
    <P>On the next page the Government state what their strategy is to deal with this. They state:</P>
    <P>It is intended to explore with all interests the possibility of a Commission representative of Government, <Col N="565" /> trade unions and employers to examine the entire question of special pay claims in the context of the long-term optimum development of our economy and employment.</P>
    <P>They intend to explore the possibility. That is the sort of response which belies any type of incomes policy.  It is a combination of words designed to confuse people rather than to say what they intend to do.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations, which is the last key pillar of an incomes policy is dealt with in the economic plan in just one paragraph.  We find on page 50 their inspiring words on industrial relations in which they state:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour will enter into further discussions with both sides of industry to identify the immediate action required to secure an improved industrial relations framework for the development of industry.</P>
    <P>That is no policy.  They have failed to answer any of the weaknesses in our industrial relations environment.  They offer an agreement to enter into discussions. If this is &ldquo;the way forward&rdquo; the Government had better go back to their drawing board and see if they can come up with any real policy.</P>
    <P>There are some other confusing aspects of the economic plan upon which I should like to hear some elaboration by the Government.  They are projecting severe wage cuts.  Yet they expect consumer spending to remain buoyant.  The only way that can be achieved, it seems, is if there is a dramatic fall in personal savings.  To realise what the Government is suggesting personal savings will have to fall to a mere 13 per cent of income. The implications of that for the ownership of wealth have not been elaborated by the Government.  It would be very sad to see personal savings go down to that extent; but apart from whether it is desirable to have such a fall, the Government have founded a major part of the growth in employment on the fall in personal savings.  They have forecast that there will be not only this fall in personal savings but also that the consumption pattern of <Col N="566" /> ordinary consumer spending will change dramatically.  They say the purchase of domestic manufacturers by consumers will drop by almost 50 per cent and they say the consumers will shift their spending to domestically produced services, which are forecast to grow by 32 per cent. That sort of change in the consumption pattern of our population is dramatic.  It is suggested that people will stop buying goods and start buying services.  Yet, there is no foundation in the economic plan to show how this can be done.</P>
    <P>One may say that this is just petty criticism of the plan, that I am dealing with small aspects of it.  This is not a small aspect.  The projected growth in consumer spending on services is supposed to generate 49,000 of the jobs the Government seek over the five year period.  Those 49,000 jobs hinge on the success of this switch, but no indication has been given as to why it should be undertaken by consumers.</P>
    <P>These are the usual aspects of the plan that drop out all along &ldquo;the way forward&rdquo; that we are being offered.  It is scarcely a wonder that the Government have not taken the opportunity in this plan to spell out year by year what they intend to happen in the economy.  Basically, their projections do not hang together.  If such changes in consumer patterns were itemised on a year-to-year basis they would be seen for what they are &mdash; totally implausible with no backing in fact or in policy by the Government.  There is also failure to list what they expect employment to be over the five years of the programme.  That should be stated.  The Government seem to be avoiding dealing with it and are hiding behind some projections which they are making on a five year basis for job creation.  The reality is that the Government see virtually no change in the level of unemployment at the end of this five year period, a period in which wages are expected to fall by 12½ per cent in real terms.</P>
    <P>This is a very despondent strategy that is offered by the Government to wage earners.  What we need is a new policy in the manufacturing areas which will put emphasis on value added.  There has not been a serious attempt to get to grips with <Col N="567" /> industrial strategy.  The Telesis Report dealt in great detail with how there might be a restructuring of our grants system. This has not been dealt with in the economic plan, which did not mention those conclusions.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot go on trying to placate all views.  Their references to the manufacturing sector are saying that they are committed to encourage almost every conceivable virtue in manufacturing industry.  But that is not the basis of a policy which must deal with choices, not a commitment to encourage in a vague way everything going on.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to public spending, which is the area in which a Government economic plan should dwell at greater length because it is in that area the Government take decisions entirely by themselves.  It should have been the real meat of this economic plan.  We find in the economic plan no discussion of the major issues in public spending that have come before the House in the last few years.  We are all aware of the inadequacy of the way Estimates are presented to the House for decision.  We get a single annual budget in which no programme is spelt out for more than one year ahead.  There are no details about output or performance under various programmes.  We have also seen in the last few years that the Government are increasingly unable to stay within the budgetary cost of schemes for even one year ahead.  This year we face the likelihood that the budget deficit will have been misforecast by almost 80 per cent. These are two fundamental points that should have been tackled in the plan, which is entirely silent on why overruns occur and what can be done to prevent them.  It is also silent on how we can provide the Oireachtas with more details of the various programmes so that real choices can be made.  The Government have challenged the Opposition to make real choices and discuss them.  Yet the plan does not contain any of the information needed to make those choices.</P>
    <P>I believe the lack of those two factors in the plan means that the Government's commitment to eliminate the budget deficit <Col N="568" /> is virtually impossible to accept.  The doubtful assumptions about growth that have underpinned much of the discussion in the economic plan suggest that the Government are building in over the next five years a willingness to overestimate tax buoyancy and underestimate demands that will be made on the Exchequer.  It seems that the Government are set to aggravate the errors that have been made in the past.</P>
    <P>Briefly, I shall outline what should have been done under the plan for the public sector.  To take the area of health as an example, the least we could have expected from the Government in making an economic plan for the next five years was that in this area it would have examined the existing pattern of demand on health services from various sections of the population and that it would have gone on to project the number of people in those sections over the five year period and from that deduce the volume of demand over the period on health services.  The plan has not dealt with any of those aspects.  That sort of framework or backdrop is essential for any rational choice on the issues such as the extent of free provision of medical services, accommodation needed in hospitals, the types of personnel to be recruited and trained.  Presumably those decisions are being made within the economic plan but we have not the context necessary to make them.  Our medical service is one of the least rational that could have been designed.  We have free hospital maintenance but we do not have full free treatment.  People are encouraged to go into hospital and it is scarcely any wonder that we have one of the highest hospitalisation rates.  As regards medical cards we have no economic controls on the level of drug prescription or visits by doctors. We have unrestricted subsidies for people whose drugs exceed a certain limit.  That kind of strategy needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>If this plan had given details of the health services we would have had an opportunity to see if the present system could continue unaltered and to see what choices we had.  However, we have not been given an opportunity to delve into <Col N="569" /> this.  This lack pervades not only the health area but all areas of Government social spending.  The recent response in the health area shows that the Government are not tackling the areas of social spending in a planned way.  The cuts made were a short-term expedient.  They hit the poorest sections of the community and are not likely to provide the economies needed.  A full discussion on all areas of public spending could have been the key section of the economic plan instead of pious appeals for moderation. Further resources could have been released to provide employment opportunities if the Government tackled those areas.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed to provide any kind of policy back-up for the ambitious targets they set.  They appeal for moderation in a pious fashion.  That is not what we expect from economic plans.  The vote of lack of confidence in the Government's response to the economic plan is entirely founded and I will vote with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>In this House on 27 October the Leader of the Fine Gael Party called into question my credibility as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He alleged that I lacked &ldquo;credibility outside Ireland, as anybody with international contacts will know&rdquo;.  It is not my intention to let this remark pass unchallenged, not because I have anything to fear from a casual jibe by the Fine Gael leader but because it raises an important issue of principle.</P>
      <P>There can hardly be a Member of this House who fails to acknowledge the long-standing convention whereby the Irish political parties do not air their political differences abroad.  While we are quite properly engaged in the cut and thrust of political debate within the State, it is long established practice that we do not, as it were, export our grievances. However sharp our differences may be and however vigorously they may be voiced, it is accepted on all sides that the uninhibited expression of political views represents a cornerstone of our democratic system of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This convention has a very particular <Col N="570" /> application to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It is part of the responsibility of a Minister in Government to uphold the dignity and integrity of the public office conferred upon him.  In the case of the Foreign Minister, as previous holders of this office are or should be aware, the practice invariably has been to refrain when in Opposition from undermining the personal integrity of the Minister in the vital task of seeking support and understanding abroad for the policies of the Government of the day.  There is an important and simple reason for this.  If Irish public representatives call into question abroad the standing or policies of their Government there is some risk that the external interests of the State could be compromised.  For a country like Ireland, which depends so heavily on foreign trade and investment, there is overriding necessity to maintain close and cordial relations with a wide range of countries with which we share economic and political interests.  Those interests must be pursued sensitively and intelligently. Accordingly, if an Opposition spokesman in his dealings with &ldquo;international contacts&rdquo; should delve into the Government's credibility, then, Sir, it becomes a matter of serious concern.  To say the least, it is a tactless and potentially damaging exercise.</P>
    <P>The remarks of the leader of Fine Gael are all the more objectionable because he of all people should be fully aware of the established convention.  As a former Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs he cannot plead ignorance of the correct manner in which to develop and pursue contacts outside the country.  It is undoubtedly the case that he maintains his own network of international contacts. Nobody suggests that he should be placed under any constraint in doing so. What is at issue is the dubious and questionable manner in which he apparently deals with his foreign contacts.  In his own words, it is through these contacts that he claims to know that I lack credibility as a Foreign Minister.  I feel entitled to ask him and the House should know, who precisely these contacts are.  Whom do they represent?  Do they include influential members of or spokesmen for foreign <Col N="571" /> Governments?  What is the nature of their interests in Ireland?  Do their interests coincide with our national interests or do they collide with them?  What has been the nature of Deputy FitzGerald's conversations with these international contacts of his?  Is it to probe the standing abroad of the Irish Government?  Would the Fine Gael leader not think it appropriate to dispel any notion of connivance with unnamed outsiders to undermine the standing of the Government?</P>
    <P>I have been in politics long enough now to learn to recognise the personal slur for what it reveals.  It reveals the inability of one's political opponent to address policy issues in a coherent fashion.  So that my position will not be misunderstood, I say to Deputy FitzGerald that I very much regret his offensive remark and hope he will now, in the light of what I have said, agree not to breach this established convention in the future.  I want to place on record my appreciation to the Members of the Fine Gael Party who came to me and apologised for the attack made on me by their leader on 27 October.</P>
    <P>The National Economic Plan devised by this Government sets out plainly and in detail the realities of economic life facing this country.  We have to face these realities; it is not possible to avoid them. If we try to avoid them we will bring down even more serious consequences upon ourselves.  The most fundamental reality we have to take account of is that Ireland is a country whose economy depends largely on foreign trade.  More than half of our gross national product, 55 per cent, comes from exports.  We can earn our living only by our ability to sell our goods and services abroad.  If we are not able to do that successfully, then nothing else is possible.  We will not be able to maintain our living standards, let alone increase them.  We will not be able to provide jobs for our young people in the fastest-growing labour force in Europe.  We will not be able to keep up our current present level of welfare and unemployment benefits, continuing recession, unemployment, lay-offs, business failures, falling living standards &mdash; these are the alternatives to a determined <Col N="572" /> and successful effort to sell Irish goods and services in an increasingly competitive international market.</P>
    <P>With the possible exception of Belgium we are the most dependent of any of the European Community countries on foreign trade.  We have a small population, a small home market, few domestic resources and our industrialisation is still recent.  Against this background we have done remarkably well.  We export more than half of what we produce.  I have no doubt that we possess the ability and drive to succeed, but I do not have any illusions that this is going to be an easy task.  We have to achieve a 12.25 per cent increase in our exports.  Our target is 12,000 new jobs a year in manufacturing in the later stages of the plan.  This will require a sustained and intensive effort. It cannot be brought about simply by wishing it into being.  The private sector and in the case of some services certain semi-State bodies have the major role in this drive.  No one should underestimate the difficulties, not only at home but also abroad, which is my major concern as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  At the same time we must not be discouraged by these difficulties.  We know what needs to be done at home.  The necessary steps are set out in the White Paper and it is in our power to take these steps.  Conditions abroad are not something over which we have much control, although we do have some ability to shape our external environment through our participation in the European Communities, GATT, UNC TAD, OECD, the Economic Commission for Europe and other multilateral bodies.  This constitutes a major part of the work of my Department and to the extent possible we try to influence these bodies in a direction favourable to our interests.  I will have more to say about this later.</P>
    <P>I see the promotion of Ireland's external economic interests as one of the major roles that I and my Department have to fulfil.  This is an essential part of any country's foreign policy and it is especially so in the case of a country like Ireland which is so heavily dependent on foreign trade and investment.  Maintaining good relations with a wide range of <Col N="573" /> countries where we have economic or political interests in one of our fundamental objectives.  This is the basic task of the Department, our embassies and consulates, and our permanent missions to the European Communities, the United Nations and other international bodies. We have to make our own contribution to help preserve a stable and secure external environment.  We cannot afford to take a passive role or pretend we are not deeply affected by events beyond our own shores.  We need to pursue an active diplomacy with other states and to participate actively in all forms of international co-operation relevant to our own situation.</P>
    <P>The need for effective representation of our economic as well as our political interests overseas has increased, and increased considerably, in the last ten years or so.  Our interests have to be pursued through the existing international system of embassies, international organisations and conferences. This is not something we can opt out of or to which we can devote only marginal attention.  It is clearly to our advantage to take full part in this system, to defend our own interests and to advance them where we can, either on our own or working together with other countries who have similar interests.</P>
    <P>Our economic interests abroad are wide and varied and so, necessarily, are the means by which they are pursued. This is not, of course, the sole responsibility of my Department.  Other Departments and semi-State bodies have always been deeply involved and this involvement has greatly expanded since we joined the European Community.  But the Department of Foreign Affairs is, by its very nature, particularly concerned with the promotion of our external economic interests.  This is by no means an ancillary or secondary concern.  It is an integral and basic part of the Department's functions.  The expansion of our diplomatic representation in recent years &mdash; for example, the establishment of embassies in such countries as Japan, the USSR, Lebanon, Egypt, Iran and Saudi Arabia &mdash; has been largely determined by economic interests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> The state of the external economic environment is of crucial importance to a very open economy such as Ireland's. Our ability to influence that environment is necessarily limited &mdash; we are a very small country &mdash; but the Government are determined that whatever instruments are available to us on the external front will continue to be used to the full in the national interest.  My Department has a central role in this regard.</P>
    <P>The most obvious and immediate example arises from our membership of the European Communities, which has brought about a fundamental change in the international framework within which we pursue our economic objectives. This has opened up a whole new range of possibilities and transformed much of the economic life of this country. It has also brought with it new responsibilities in the international sphere, such as the Presidency of the Community, which we will shoulder again for the third time in less than two years from now, and our participation in the efforts of the ten member states to co-operate on foreign policy questions.</P>
    <P>One of the Department's most important functions is to act as the co-ordinating mechanism for our membership of the European Community.  Just what that membership at present means to Ireland can be judged from the fact that in 1981 our direct receipts from the Community budget alone, less our contributions to that budget, came to nearly 4 per cent of our GNP.  This takes no account of the very substantial additional benefits which our farmers and the economy generally received directly through our trading gains and from the price support system of the common agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that these very substantial benefits cannot be maintained or improved upon without unremitting effort on the part of the Government.  A particularly heavy burden falls on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Department, who are charged with the central co-ordination of our Community membership.  It is a truism to say that the Community is nearly always in a state of semi-crisis and that it is only through the <Col N="575" /> mastering of successive crises that it can make progress.  Each of these crises, however, presents dangers of regression as well as opportunities of progress, and these dangers are particularly acute in the present situation, where the world recession coincides with the prospect of a financially demanding enlargement of the Community, and a strong new effort by a major member state to renegotiate the terms of her participation in common financing.</P>
    <P>Elements of this crisis, particularly those arising out of the British demands for lower net contributions to the budget, have been with us now for the best part of three years, and for most of that period my predecessors and I have been obliged to devote long hours to a defence of the common agricultural policy, which some people saw as the cause of the so-called budget problem.  Time and again, at one meeting after another, we repeated what was clear to us: that a solution to that problem could not be achieved by undermining the Community's one developed policy, the CAP, but only by building up the totally inadequate non-agricultural Community policies such as the regional and social funds, by developing new ones, and by providing additional funds for the Community.  The danger to the CAP has, as a result of our efforts and those of like-minded countries, receded for the moment &mdash; but it has not gone away, and we have to be ready at all times for a resumption of the struggle. Meanwhile, the need for fresh financial resources becomes clearer each day, but has not yet found an adequate response from the member states.</P>
    <P>Those are only the more dramatic examples of the importance to our economy of a properly functioning, foreign service.  On a day-to-day basis, and on all fronts of our economic interrelationship with the outside world, I and my Department have to act vigorously to defend our interests.  In the EEC in particular, piecemeal reactions to individual proposals could harm our overall position. To be effective, our approach to each individual problem must be consistent with the overall aims of our policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="576" /> We must maintain coherent and co-ordinated positions in our dealings with the organs of the Communities and with our partners.  Since 1973, when we entered the European Communities, my Department have had overall responsibility for co-ordinating the work of all Departments in relation to EEC matters.  This involves, initially, channelling information received from the permanent representation in Brussels and our embassies in the member states to other Departments, and ensuring, whenever necessary, that decisions taken are consistent with overall national policy and with overall developments in the Communities. This often requires my Department to take the lead in promoting a reconciliation or concertation of the views of different Departments to ensure that our best interests are protected. Finally, our Permanent Representative in Brussels and our ambassadors in the member states ensure that the Commission and our partners are kept fully aware of our views.</P>
    <P>This co-ordinating and monitoring role will assume even greater importance over the coming months as the Community faces up to the problems associated with, amongst other things, negotiations on the British contribution for 1983 and the years ahead and the enlargement of the Community.  I can assure Deputies that my Department will continue to fulfil this role as it has done since 1973.</P>
    <P>The European Community obviously has enormous economic influence in the world.  However, it does not on its own determine the structure of international trade and management of the world economy.  The framework for international trade in the post-war period has been laid down in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in the various rounds of negotiations in the GATT context, such as the recent Toyko round.  So far, in spite of the difficulties in the world economy, the GATT has remained strong and prevented a slide into competitive protectionism that could have made the present world recession much worse than it has been.  We have taken an active part to help reinforce this system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> I and my Department will continue, both in our bilateral relations and in the multilateral fora where we are represented, to emphasise the need to maintain the open world trading system.  In our situation it is essential that world markets remain open to our exports.  It is only through increased economic activity and increased trade all round that a recovery of the world economy can be brought about.  The other path, that of competitive protectionism and reduced trade, would deepen the recession and lower living standards to an unacceptable degree.  We will emphasise this point both in international fora and in our bilateral contacts.  This is a point we have stressed in the preparations for the GATT Ministerial Conference to be held later this month.  This is the first such meeting since 1973 and it comes at an appropriate moment.  It offers Ireland and the Community the opportunity to work with our GATT partners to maintain a sensible and balanced world open trading system.</P>
    <P>The international economic environment will be a crucial determining factor in our economic progress.  There are signs of improvement.  The improvement is slow rather than dramatic.  But the improvement is visible.  For the first time in three years, as inflation slows and interest rates drop, the international background offers us the prospect of increased exports.  We must put ourselves in the position to take full advantage of the opportunities which are gradually opening up.  This requires an improved performance on the part of everyone, not only of those directly involved in selling goods and services abroad, but also on the part of the State sector in providing the necessary back-up service.</P>
    <P>The ability to sell our goods and services abroad is the essential requirement if we are to succeed in maintaining and increasing employment and raising our living standards.  Our export performance is already impressive.  It will have to be even better in the future.  Our exporters are entitled to expect the full support and backing of State services. The Department of Foreign Affairs with 29 embassies and four consulates abroad see this as one of their most important <Col N="578" /> functions.  An embassy provides a continuing Irish presence in a particular country &mdash; in many parts of the world, the only continuing Irish presence &mdash; and through its official position, its knowledge of the local situation and its contacts, the embassy can give invaluable assistance to the prospective exporter.  In addition to the 29 resident embassies we maintain diplomatic relations with 28 other countries on a non-resident basis.  Several of these embassies have officers engaged full time in trade and economic work.  In a number of embassies trade promotion is the major preoccupation.  For all our embassies, however, trade promotion is a priority.  In the Department in Dublin there is a full section devoted exclusively to foreign trade.  The range of activities covered is very broad.  The work of the Department includes negotiating co-operation agreements with other countries, preparing market reports, helping firms pursue service contracts, and making arrangements for visiting businessmen. This work is carried out in conjunction with other Government Departments and semi-State bodies such as Coras Tráchtála and the IDA.</P>
    <P>Markets in the developing world and in Eastern Europe are often the most difficult and those in which the assistance of an embassy is most needed.  Business practice in those countries can be very different from ours.  For example, several countries in the Middle East and all in Eastern Europe conduct trade more or less exclusively through State organisations. In those countries a state-to-state bilateral co-operation agreement is a virtual pre-condition for the satisfactory development of trade.  In recent years the Department have negotiated such inter-governmental agreements with the Soviet Union, Poland and Iraq.  These provide for the development of bilateral economic, commercial and other exchanges. Joint commissions have been established under these agreements which meet annually to review progress and to examine ways in which co-operation can be improved.  Further co-operation agreements are under active consideration.</P>
    <P>These agreements can lead to a dramatic improvement in trade.  The agreement <Col N="579" /> signed with Iraq in 1981 provides a good example.  In the second half of the seventies our exports to Iraq varied between £2 and £7 million.  The year the agreement was signed exports exceeded £21 million.  This year they have already passed the £41 million mark.  This shows the results exporters can achieve well outside our traditional markets.</P>
    <P>Another example is provided by the Soviet Union, a country which has a strong preference for doing business on the basis of a co-operation agreement and which makes all its purchases through State-trading organisations.  In 1976 we exported less than £2 million worth to the Soviet Union.  A co-operation agreement was signed and entered into force at the end of that year.  In 1977 exports stood at £6.3 million and last year they reached nearly £25 million.  In 1974, the year we opened our embassy in Moscow, exports were still only £½ million. Apart from the embassy in Moscow, we have non-resident diplomatic relations with most of the other Eastern European countries.  Exports to the entire area last year were over £59 million compared with £3 million ten years earlier when we had no diplomatic links at all with Eastern Europe and before we had concluded any bilateral co-operation agreement.</P>
    <P>Increasingly, we will have to look beyond our traditional markets in Western Europe and North America.  The developing world offers very substantial opportunities.  For instance, in the first six months of this year our exports to Nigeria were £27½ million and our exports to Egypt were just over £26 million.  This shows again what can be achieved, despite the undoubted difficulties which an exporter has to face in many developing countries.  The local knowledge acquired by an embassy can be particularly helpful in identifying key decision-makers, cultivating contacts, providing advance information, clearing visa and customs formalities, arranging meetings and following up on business.</P>
    <P>I have just mentioned Nigeria and Egypt, two countries where a major part of the embassies' work consists in providing this kind of assistance to exporters. <Col N="580" /> Another example is Saudi Arabia.  Last year our exports to that country were worth £27 million.  Up to June this year exports have already exceeded £15 ½ million. Service exports and joint ventures are also of major importance to us in Saudi Arabia.  The range of operations involving the embassy in Jeddah includes ESB consultancy work, manufacturing milk and milk products, construction, electrical-mechanical engineering, work undertaken by the Agricultural Institute, and teaching and training in Ireland. Among DEVCO agencies the ESB, ACOT, IIRS, IDA and Aer Rianta have had good results this year.  Medical care, agriculture and teaching-training are further areas of promise.</P>
    <P>I have recently returned from an official visit to the People's Republic of China, a country with which I believe there is great potential for expanding trade and economic co-operation.  I had talks there with, among others, the Chinese Minister for Foreign Economic Relations and Trade.  We discussed the various possibilities for developing trade in both countries and specific projects in dairy products, animal husbandry, grassland development and fertilisers.</P>
    <P>China is another example of a state-trading country where the presence of an embassy can be of great assistance to exporters.  Since the opening of our embassy in Peking in 1979, exports have increased from under £¾ million to an expected £4 million this year.  Another opportunity for the sale of Irish goods and services to the developing world is provided by multilateral aid agencies such as the European Development Fund, the UN Development Programme and the World Bank.  These agencies fund projects by international tender throughout the developing world.  The current European Development Fund and the European Investment Bank will provide over £3 million in grants and loans over a five-year period for development projects in the ACP countries. These are the 63 African, Caribbean and Pacific States which are parties to the Lomé Convention with the EEC countries. The Department provide documentation on individual projects and country <Col N="581" /> programmes to CTT, CII, CIF and DEVCO.  Our embassies and development offices provide information on prospective contracts in the countries where they are accredited.</P>
    <P>This applies as well to contracts with the UN Development Programme and the World Bank who also devote vast sums to such projects.  Most of the contracts &mdash; whether funded by multilateral agencies or by individual countries &mdash; won by Irish firms and agencies have been for consultancy work.  I hope to see us branching out to win supply and works contracts as well.  This whole area is one which we have begun to exploit only fairly recently and it holds great potential. My Department are anxious to encourage interest here and in every way possible to help Irish firms win contracts.</P>
    <P>Apart from the support provided by our embassies and other offices abroad, another aspect I might mention here is the spin-off from the development assistance programme administered by my Department through our contribution to international development agencies, through our own bilateral aid programme and through APSO &mdash; the Agency for Personal Service Overseas.  This takes the form both of providing funds and of making available the skills and expertise we have acquired during the course of our own development.  Our objective in the development assistance programme is to contribute to alleviating the poverty in some of the poorest countries in the world and of the poorest sections of the population in those countries.</P>
    <P>The export of Irish services to developing countries through our bilateral aid programme has brought tangible benefits to these countries.  But the bilateral aid programme has also benefited the Irish bodies providing these services.  Through their participation in the bilateral aid programme, many Irish bodies have obtained the experience and &ldquo;track-record&rdquo; necessary to obtain contracts from the larger multilateral funding agencies such as the World Bank and the European Development Fund.  I could give many examples of Irish bodies that have won lucrative contracts for development projects in the Third World as a <Col N="582" /> direct result of participating in projects under our bilateral aid programme.</P>
    <P>The extent to which Irish bodies, both State, semi-State and private, are earning valuable exchange from the export of services to developing countries is constantly increasing.  Devco, the State Agencies Development Co-operation Organisation, calculate that semi-State bodies alone earned over £28 million from projects in developing countries last year.  Not all of this would, of course, be directly attributable to the bilateral aid programme but there is no doubt that many of the State agencies that are now active in this field receive their first experience through our bilateral aid programme.</P>
    <P>I have spoken mainly of our embassies' activities in developing countries both because these are the countries where the assistance of an embassy is most required and because the embassy is usually the only Irish State agency in the area.  In the industrialised countries &mdash; which are, of course, our major markets &mdash; we are also actively engaged in promoting our economic interests, working closely with other State agencies, such as CTT, IDA, Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte.  We maintain a close study of the political, economic and market situation in the countries we deal with.  We report on developments which affect our interests and where necessary, if for example a Government are taking action prejudicial to our economic interests, we will raise this officially.</P>
    <P>We also maintain contacts in Government and official circles and in commerce and the media.  These can often be very useful in gaining access for Irish firms interested in doing business in a particular country.  We are also able to provide reliable information on Government regulations, tariffs and taxes, import regulations, standards and other requirements. We can also advise on market characteristics, distribution channels and various aspects of doing business in a particular country.  In these ways embassies and consulates act as a ready source of operational assistance for Irish commercial interests.</P>
    <P>In many countries outside the European Community, the Community itself <Col N="583" /> has a responsibility and is represented. This does not in any way reduce the need for us to look after our own interests, to look out for opportunities to watch developments which affect us and to make sure at every level in every way possible that this country's interests are represented effectively.  Nobody else will do it for us, and I want to stress that.  We are in competition with these countries.  They all maintain a regular presence and a continuing effort to advance their external interests.  Being a small country does not mean that we can afford to do less than our larger neighbours.  We do not have the support of a substantial home marketing base which they have, nor have we the high profile of a long-established industrial and trading reputation.  That means that we must do more for ourselves if we are not to lose out on all kinds of opportunities.  We simply cannot afford to neglect our interests abroad.</P>
    <P>There are a number of factors which go into determining the extent to which we realise our objectives abroad.  One of these, an important one, is the national image we project.  How successful we will be in selling our produce, in securing foreign investment or encouraging tourism depends to a large extent on how people in other countries view us.  A major part of our work is to promote a favourable image of this country to counter any adverse publicity.  People in other countries often have ill-formed attitudes about our country.  Media coverage often concentrates on the tragic violence afflicting Northern Ireland and, quite apart from any other considerations such as the need to have our own policies in Northern Ireland known and understood, this can be very damaging to our prospects for trade investment and tourism. There is a need for constant effort to ensure that this country is seen for what it is, a stable western democracy, a reliable trading partner capable of producing and delivering goods and services of high quality.  This is the image of Ireland which we must promote, and again we must do it for ourselves.  We must go out and take the initiative because others certainly will not do it for <Col N="584" /> us.  If we want the kind of image which will help our efforts rather than hindering them we must work at it on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>This country has demonstrated in the past that it has the resources and the determination to overcome the most serious economic difficulties.  The late Séan Lemass introduced the first programme of economic development in 1958 when the country faced problems at least as great as those we face today, moreover at a time when national confidence was at an all-time low, and the success of that programme restored our self-confidence and gave us a new image of ourselves as a people capable of achieving their goals.  We are in a far better position to respond to the challenge of economic recession today than we were then and we now possess an industrial base, a trained labour force, technical and managerial experience, and through our membership of the EEC we have a voice in the decision-making of the world's largest trading bloc.  I have every confidence that we can and will get this country moving forward again.  Even in the last few years of exceptional difficulty and against intense competition our exports have increased dramatically.  Last year our exports were £4,846 million and this year they are expected to reach close to £6 billion.  This Government are determined to face the problem honestly and courageously but we do so in the confident belief that the Irish people are capable of winning through.  The last thing the country needs now is hand-wringing defeatism.  Of course we must recognise the size of the task in front of us, but let us recognise equally that there are opportunities as well as difficulties.  Let us make sure that we put ourselves in a position to take advantage of these opportunities. We need an intensive, sustained and co-ordinated national effort involving industry, agriculture and the public sector. This means essentially, as I have said, that we must increase our sale of goods and services abroad.  Unless we are successful in doing that none of our social and economic objectives at home is attainable.  Our exporters will need every support that can be provided, and as far <Col N="585" /> as we are concerned we are under an obligation to do everything we can to assist this effort and to achieve the objectives of the national plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my 26 years in public life I have seen white papers, green papers and project objectives described in many ways put to the people of Ireland for their support and in the interests of their goodwill and well-being and the future prospects of our economy.  Always I have judged or gauged the sincerity of those documents on the basis of the credibility of the team or Government who supported such a document and put it to the Irish people for their support.  Therefore, I feel straightway that I must gauge this document on the credibility of the Government who have put it forward to us for adoption.  As the Taoiseach has said, its objective is simply the future welfare of the Irish people.  I must gauge its credibility on the performance of the Government in the seven months they have been in office because we owe it to the people to examine in detail the threads of economic development, the welfare of our people, young and old, and the effect of the plan on all our people.</P>
      <P>Therefore, at the outset I must say that I have very little belief in the outcome of this document.  This Government have been led by an indecisive Taoiseach in that seven months, staggering from one crisis to another, looking to the people for national support, asking for belt-tightening from all our people.  Here last week in his own area of responsibility, instead of carrying on with a restricted Cabinet and junior ministerial team, he introduced more appointments to his Cabinet costing more money, while asking people in the lower income group to put up with sacrifices and live much below the standard they were used to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must also look at the credibility of the members of the Cabinet.  I am not a doom and gloom man.  I believe in realism, but I am not a boom and bloom man either. Five months ago I read in the newspapers that Minister MacSharry on his return to his native county stated that the days of <Col N="586" /> gloom were over and the boom days were back, yet he had not the guts or courage to come into this House before the Dáil went into recession to indicate the necessity for cutting back on essential services.</P>
    <P>There is grave disquiet about the Minister for Justice.  Last week the Taoiseach should have made three ministerial appointments, the two replacements for Deputy O'Malley and Deputy O'Donoghue and the Minister for Justice should have been removed from his post because too many rumours and too much talk are going throughout the country about this very sensitive area of administration. It amazed me, and I assure the House that it amazed many people, to see the self-same Deputies O'Malley and O'Donoghue, who in only the past couple of weeks had publicly voted no confidence in the leadership of their Toaiseach, come into the House last Tuesday night to vote for their successors in their own ministries.  Lest we forget the other 20 backbenchers, where does their credibility stand in the crises in the last couple of months?  They are not prepared to vote here against the Taoiseach.  They will do it in party rooms but they are the silent minority in the backbenches when it comes to defeating the lobby and keeping the Taoiseach in office.</P>
    <P>That is why I say that this document must be taken on the basis of the credibility or otherwise of the Cabinet which has produced this document.  For that reason alone, I cannot see it being accepted by the people.  We have a bankrupt economy, a divisive administration and are staggering from one crisis to another.  We are asked to tighten our belts and told that the money is not there. It cannot be repeated too often that this trouble all started in 1977.  The last century was noted for black 1847; this one will be remembered for black 1977.  All the ills and sickness of our economy emanated from the document of the party which in 1977 bought the people by promises and started this steamrolling process of overspending.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there is a budget deficit and that something must be done to rectify the situation.  However, my party and I disagree entirely with the plans <Col N="587" /> made by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael regarding budget deficits.  Their objective is to have the budget deficit phased out in four years, but this is not a plan worthy of any Government in power.  We are talking, not about money, economies, or budget deficits, but about people &mdash; the ordinary people.  These are the people that we are asking to tighten their belts, accept a lower living standard and respond to this document.</P>
    <P>Recently, as a member of the Council of Europe, I attended a plenary session in Strasbourg.  We had there a one day seminar on the unemployment dimension on the European Continent.  Ministers of several States, experts from the OECD and the EEC indicated their views on the recession and the prospects of the situation improving in the years ahead.  The consensus of the experts in Strasbourg was that at the very earliest 1990 would see a levelling off and improvement in the world recession.  This consensus was based on one very important factor &mdash; that the major powers, such as the United States, Germany, France and Japan, would take steps to lift the rest out of the recession and that smaller countries such as Ireland and Denmark would then benefit from this uplift in the economies of the greater powers.  We are not being forthright and honest with our people, because according to these experts, we have not seen the worst yet.  I am not an economist, but I believe in listening attentively to people who know what they are talking about.  We should not produce a document saying that in four years the unemployment figure will be reduced and more jobs created.  Being an open-ended economy we cannot resolve our problems alone but we must depend on the outside world for help.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my party and myself I reject this document as fallacious.  It contains no prospects of optimism for young people, for those who have lost their jobs, or are barely holding on to them. The private sector has failed the country. Millions of pounds have been spent on investment plans, with incentives being given to the private sector, without any response being forthcoming.  I have said <Col N="588" /> publicly elsewhere that with a growing young population, if the unease which at the moment I can detect amongst the young increases, they will turn away from our democratic institutions and may unfortunately look elsewhere if they lose faith and hope in our Executive and elected representatives.</P>
    <P>How can we reconcile a figure of 12 per cent increase in our exports with the realism of Strasbourg that the demands from those countries will be nothing like half that percentage figure?  I listened to the Minister for Agriculture speaking about the meat trade and the meat processing industry.  I have the good fortune to represent a constituency which has a major industry based on natural resources &mdash; the sugar factory in Thurles. Prior to the last election, a special handout was given to the electorate of North Tipperary.  I can assure the House that the viability of the Thurles factory is vital to my constituency and I must relate everything in this document to that constituency. If I see something worthwhile in it, I will support it.  If I see it as empty and void of interest in my constituents, I will criticise it, which is what I am doing here tonight.  A very straightforward promise was made in my constituency by the people in power, in particular to the workers of the Thurles factory, a factory which at peak can employ up to 600.  The House will thus appreciate what this means to the commercial life of my region.  It was made very clear that a commitment would be given that, in the allocation to the sugar factory in the current year, outside the budget, £5 million would be included for the modernisation of the Thurles plant and that the people in that area need have no fear, that if they returned Fianna Fáil to office, money would be forthcoming to ensure the viability of that factory and the factory in Tuam.  I want to put on the record of the House the hypocrisy of the promises made.  Last week, the announcement of the national allocation to the Sugar Company was very clear to the people of North Tipperary and of the rest of Ireland.  Out of a total of £30 million allocated to the Sugar Company only <Col N="589" /> £300,000 is to go to Thurles, a figure which normally was allocated for annual maintenance.</P>
    <P>In the mid-west we had already suffered from the shutdown of the Bombardier enterprise because of Government rejection.  Then we heard about the £20 million allocated to the Dublin Gas Company, and this miserable allocation to the Thurles sugar factory.  That is what we have got in the mid-west.  The main concern in my constituency is for industry. Instead of getting new industry we have seen existing industries being closed down.  We had 600 miners disemployed. God help us in that region in 1983 because there is nothing in the pipeline for us.</P>
    <P>Today the Minister for Agriculture referred to the plans for agriculture.  In Thurles we have an industry based on agriculture but because of the miserable finance being made available the Thurles factory will be in the same position as Tuam was last year.  Despite all the promises made there is no talk about renewal of machinery in our sugar factory.  Somebody from the Government side must be prepared to go to the Minister for Finance and do something about that. The machinery there should be renewed to such an extent that the factory would be viable.  That would be the case if preelection promises had been lived up to. The people of Tipperary now know where they stand with this Government.</P>
    <P>At page 103 of the Government document we have reference to decentralisation. There is this statement:</P>
    <P>The Government have, however, recently approved a decentralisation programme to twelve provincial centres.  Proposals have been sought for private sector participation in the provision of the accommodation required.</P>
    <P>That means that the Government are not prepared to finance the programme, that they are depending on the private sector. Therefore there cannot be any optimism that that programme will be introduced in the immediate future.  Early this year, Ennis, Limerick and Nenagh were promised that offices of the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="590" /> would be located in those centres. I am afraid we are many years away from that now that we have been told the private sector will be asked to finance the Government project.</P>
    <P>As a member of a health board I should like to refer to the effect this plan will have, the difficulties it will present to health boards.  Last January the Coalition Government which I supported produced a budget which would have cut back the services by £3 million in a period of 12 months.  This Government have decided that £2 million will be cut from the services in three months.  I am not talking about easing budget deficits.  I am talking about people being enabled to get medical cards, to get medicines, an ambulance service.  Instead, people have to thumb lifts to and home from hospitals in my region.  We had several meetings and the health board executive went back to the Minister for Health to explain the emergency, the crisis that existed because of lack of finance.  Now we may have to close wards and even hospitals.</P>
    <P>Surely the Taoiseach does not expect our people to support that type of plan. He has asked the people to rally round him with optimism.  How can any Government expect the people to co-operate with such action on such an issue?  Paragraph 19 of the plan proposes to hold an investigation into the workings of local authorities and health boards.  In my experience, local authorities have stopped working in the past three years and this administration can be blamed directly for that because in 1977 they abolished rates, the only source of revenue, the only cash flow local authorities had.  Before that they were able to plan and to carry out their plans.  Now we have managers with nothing to manage.</P>
    <P>That recommendation is amazing, as is the one in regard to health boards.  I was a county councillor in the seventies when the late Deputy Childers was Minister for Health.  He travelled the length and breadth of Ireland to try to prove to local representatives that the best way forward in regard to the health services was by way of regional health boards.  At that time local authorities maintained the services in the counties among their <Col N="591" /> people.  I attended a meeting in Limerick with the Minister for Health at that time and even members of his own party indicated that regionalisation of the health services was not the way forward. Despite that, Fianna Fáil brought in the Health Act and now we have a colossus of eight health boards, and outside Dublin the facilities are so removed from the people, although they cost so much, that the entire medical services are in chaos.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is no need to investigate the health boards.  We know the reason for the collapse of the medical services.  I heard the Taoiseach say that we are spoiling ourselves, becoming too sophisticated.  How can he say that when people have to wait unsuccessfully for ambulances &mdash; old people and children? It is to provide facilities for such people that we should be planning.  This plan is only about saving money at all costs, and that means that ordinary people will suffer. That is why I reject this plan out of hand.</P>
    <P>I publicly opposed budget deficits when the Coalition were in power because ultimately they are harmful and affect the welfare of our people.  In spite of all the talk by accountants about the need for budget deficits, we have here a bankrupt economy.  The way to look for co-operation is not to turn in the other direction, to cut costs, but to provide our people with proper health and education services.</P>
    <P>On the question of local authorities I notice that another plan has been produced for our national primary roads. One was produced two years ago and we also had one five years ago.  Roads in my county are so bad that it would be possible to join all the potholes up by lowering the road.  There is no mention in the plan of providing money for maintenance although there is mention of a huge investment in our national road network. In the last three years local authorities have been endeavouring to deal with a crisis in regard to roads.</P>
    <P>The plan also refers to local authority housing.  It appears that over the next four years it is proposed that there will <Col N="592" /> be a levelling of investment in local authority houses.  Couples are getting married at an earlier age with the result that there are many more on local authority housing lists.  The finance to help deal with the ever-increasing housing priority list is not forthcoming from the Exchequer. People must live in houses that were not considered habitable 100 years ago. I am not dealing with the sophisticated aspects of the plan but I am anxious to indicate how the financial objectives will affect our people.  We have heard a lot of talk about social welfare abuses, a trump card that is played very often.  An inquisition team is being established to go around the country chasing people.  I accept that there are dodgers and people who abuse the system but 99 per cent of those who are drawing unemployment benefit would prefer to be at work because they have a pride in their work. It is ironic that an inquisition team is being established by Fianna Fáil who also abolished the Combat Poverty Committee.</P>
    <P>I do not see a lot of light at the end of the tunnel for the PAYE sector.  I reckon that this year £1,500 million will be extracted from the pay packets of workers under the PAYE system and the plan proposes, most generously, that £100 million will be taken off those people over a four year period.  That will only amount to pennies.  That proposal is being introduced at a time when more money could be collected in other areas but no effort is made to do so.  We must have an equitable tax system and everybody at a time of crisis must carry an equal share of the burden.  Until that happens our people will not be prepared to accept the proposals in the plan.  Inequality is getting worse.  About 20 years ago a politician remarked to me that the rich were getting richer and the poor were getting poorer and that situation still exists today.  Inequality is not the answer in times of crisis when we must ask people to make sacrifices.  Everybody must make a sacrifice and because that is not happening I consider that the document is not logical or reasonable and will not appeal to the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>The more one discusses the plan the <Col N="593" /> more one realises how farcical it is.  I have read several economic plans but I award this the Pulitzer prize as the greatest documentary evidence of long-term thinking on high finance in cuckoo land.  Our people cannot and will not accept such a plan.  We all accept that we are facing a crisis but the plan does not propose a way for dealing with it.  Punishment, if there is to be punishment, should be divided equally.  To carry us through the crisis we must come up with revolutionary ideas. A lot of the material in the plan was issued in 1980 when Deputy Haughey took over the leadership of Fianna Fáil and it was contained in the document produced by the former Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Deputy O'Donoghue, in 1978.  It is a repetition of the same old dose.  If we are to survive we must come up with a different answer to our problems.  The Taoiseach seemed to accept today that the document would not be accepted by the majority of the House because he proposed that it be debated by an all-party Committee, like fielding the ball inside the 25 and kicking it to touch.  The Taoiseach accepts that he will be beaten on it and consequently is not prepared to put it to a vote.  The Labour Party reject this document out of hand.  We will not accept any such plan until there is an indication that everybody will make a sacrifice and contribute to the national well-being of the economy.  Nobody should be allowed to get off the hook.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the plan.  Before I dwell on the details as they affect the area of my responsibility, Transport and Posts and Telegraphs, I should like to condemn the activities of the main Opposition party, Fine Gael, in placing a motion of no confidence before the Dáil.  Where is the concern for the unemployed?  Where is the concern to right our economy?  Fine Gael are availing of this opportunity to ensure that our plan does not proceed.  That surely is a most irresponsible attitude at a time of grave national crisis in our economy.  I do not think their attitude has the support of <Col N="594" /> our people.  I hope the vote, if it is taken, on this confidence motion will fail and that the Dáil will give a clear vote of confidence to the Government to continue with their work and implement the economic plan.  The plan should be accepted by all right-thinking Members of the Dáil.  It has been widely acclaimed and accepted by the public.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed at the attitude adopted by Fine Gael at a time when the Dáil is engaged in a critical analysis of the economic plan.  Until that is complete there should not be any question of a vote of confidence in the Government. We are in a position to implement the measures contained in the plan with the support and goodwill of the House.  If that is not forthcoming and if we are not in a position to proceed in Government, Fianna Fáil have the cornerstone and plank for any campaign which they will be asked to fight.  I would fight any election on a document which contains proposals such as those in <i>The Way Forward.</i> It is a clear statement of policy that was prepared following months of discussion. I believe that it will be given the backing of the Irish people if it is put before them. I hope that occasion does not come for some time because our term of office is not due to expire until 1987.  In the intervening years we will implement the proposals in the plan and right the many ills in our economy.  The main proposals in the plan must be carried through by any Government because they represent the only way forward.  I appeal to the right thinking Members in the Opposition to do the honourable thing and support the plan.</P>
      <P>I should like to sympathise with the Labour Party on the defection of their leader, Deputy Michael O'Leary.  I do not know if I should congratulate Fine Gael on the fact that Deputy O'Leary has applied to join that party but the move confirms my view of the Labour Party down the years.  I have always believed that Fianna Fáil is the only socialist party in Ireland.  That is made clear when one considers that a former leader left the party and joined the most right wing conservative party in the state, Fine Gael.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. E. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, while conscious of the need to eliminate wasteful State expenditure in the delivery of health care services, condemns the Government and the Minister for Health for the arbitrary and excessive reductions in the provision of State moneys for vital programmes of the health boards and for essential health care services for the poor and the elderly under the general medical services scheme and calls on the Government to review urgently this policy decision.</P>
      <P>As we have stated in the motion we are conscious of the need to eliminate wasteful expenditure in health care services. Our concern is for the arbitrary reductions in the provision of State moneys for vital health care services and our concern is that the poor and the elderly are, under the cuts that have been applied and under the methods by which they are applied at the moment, the main sufferers.  We believe, when the health boards have assessed their situations and communicated their findings to the Minister for Health, that the time is right for review of the policy decisions taken with regard to expenditure on health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health services have been used by successive Governments as soft targets for cutting public expenditure to meet any crisis in the nation's finances.  Both the present and previous Ministers for Finance zoned in on the health services. They have looked to the old, the sick, the chronically ill people as well as the handicapped to bear a very heavy share of the burden of putting our finances in order. I submit that the health services are being used as a financial scapegoat in the <Col N="596" /> absence of any serious attempt to tackle priorities in public spending or any serious attempt to root out the undoubted areas of waste and inefficiency in our public services and in the absence of any attempt to get the wealthy and powerful groups in our society to shoulder their fair share of the burden as it arises.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party cannot accept that arbitrary cuts in basic health care available to the poorest and the weakest in our community is the answer to our current economic difficulties.  We cannot accept that chronically ill, pensioners and others on like income should have to pay dearly for essential medicines while public moneys are being frittered away on projects such as Knock Airport.  We cannot accept that the lowest income families in the country should suffer while modest tax proposals for taxing wealthy investors in discretionary trusts are abandoned by the Government.  This is the context in which we are putting forward our motion this evening.  If one were to pay heed to what one hears it would seem that the principle is accepted by all that those who can most afford to pay should carry the burden of coping with the difficult financial situation but we find that this is not the case.  It is the weakest and the poorest that are hit hardest.  This applies under the present system to every crisis that arises.</P>
    <P>We all recognise the problems that the country faces at present but these problems cannot be tackled fairly and effectively without a comprehensive appraisal of public spending, both current and capital, without a comprehensive appraisal of the potential of raising further revenue, particularly in capital taxation.  The present health cuts and the cuts in other vital areas that affect the weaker sections do not come as a result of this comprehensive appraisal.  They are an arbitrary response conceived in financial panic and bluntly and harshly implemented.</P>
    <P>We all know that there are many areas of public spending which do not give value for money.  We have not had any satisfactory explanation in the House of the cost over-runs on many large capital projects.  The Department of Lands, who currently employ 807 people at a net cost <Col N="597" /> to the taxpayer of £15 million, this year have a total land purchase fund, according to the Book of Estimates, of £10. There are many examples such as this where value for money and prudent spending is in question.  To illustrate that, there is no serious attempt made to look at our priorities, to look at who benefits from public spending, to look at the obvious waste and ineffeciency that exists.  Instead, we have always taken the easy option.  In this case it is the poor and their basic health care which are in danger of suffering.  In the society in which we live, where lobbying and pressure have a greater bearing on what Governments do you will always find that the weak, those who have no lobbies, those who are not organised and those who have cannot exert pressure will lose out.</P>
    <P>Revenue from capital taxation is not only a quarter in real terms of what it was in 1974.  It is now £16 million as against a real value at todays' prices of £64 million in 1974.  Since the abolition of domestic rates the taxation on business premises has fallen by a quarter in real terms. There is virtually no revenue from capital gains tax, from profits in land speculation. This area is highlighted very considerably at the moment.  Surely the public accept the need to tax profits in this area and so bring money into the Exchequer at a time of drastic shortage, which we all acknowledge we are going through. Despite this, this years' Finance Act saw the Government shy away even from modest taxation proposals which could hurt their wealthy backers.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have repeatedly put forward the idea of a property tax.  I believe the potential yield from an income-related property tax is about £200 million a year.  We certainly put that forward in Government.  The principle was accepted but we are always told that the mechanics of putting a project such as this into operation delays its implementation. If we had remained in Government I hope that we would have had a property tax.  I believe that if the Government were anxious to respond to the financial crisis they would have explored the potential for increased capital taxation instead of seeking to have the whole <Col N="598" /> burden of adjustment on the expenditure side.  The Fianna Fáil Government are not alone in this kind of response.  As far as the major parties in the House are concerned they have been equally reluctant in Government to tackle the thorny problem of capital taxation and find it equally difficult to get down to the serious economics of appraising individual spending programmes rather than go for the easy options where they hit the rich and poor alike.  It is the contention of the Labour Party that if we are to have equity in our society this approach must stop and we must have a new appraisal of how we treat costs, how we treat spending, what the benefit to the public is and stop the cuts which hit rich and poor alike but of their very nature hurt the poor and the weak to a far greater extent.</P>
    <P>I believe that the approach adopted by Ministers for Finance to date in tackling the deficits and trying to make ends meet is approaching the problem the wrong way around.  They look for global cuts in spending across different Departments instead of examining programmes on their merits and in relation to the real needs of the people they serve.  The Minister for Health in a press statement yesterday said that cuts are being made in the health services following sensitive examination of the services and the finances for them.  I suggest, from the limited experience I had in the Minister's Department, that this is not exactly the case.  A detailed on the ground examination takes place at health board level after the cuts have been imposed and the grants have been allocated.  That detailed examination has been going on for many months and in some cases is going on at the moment.  I believe that the boards have by now communicated to the Minister the alarming implications of this.  I sympathise with the Minister.  I understand the difficulty a Minister for Health has at a time of crisis like this.  I understand the problem a Minister for Health has under the present system.  Under this system the most cogent, the most well-informed arguments, the most lengthy and detailed arguments advanced by his Department and the officials of his Department to their counterparts in the <Col N="599" /> Department of Finance and ultimately through the Ministers involved, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance, cannot get the consideration they deserve.</P>
    <P>The Health Department is a big spender; it is growing rapidly by its very nature and there is a perception &mdash; in some instances rightly &mdash; that there is wastage in the health services.  In every period of recession Health is the first target of the Department of Finance because they look to the &ldquo;big ones&rdquo; regardless of the social implications. There is very little time or facility to get the social implications across to the people who will bear the impact.  It is a head-on conflict between the Department of Health and the Department of Finance.  I suggest to the Minister that at this time he knows the full implications of the effects of the health cuts.  These have been conveyed to him by various health boards and agencies and he has ample evidence to present them &mdash; and I hope there is some mechanism by which he can be heard &mdash; in support of the case for an urgent review by the Government of their policy in this area.  The principal point in our motion is a call on the Government for an urgent review.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health should welcome this review.  It is a period of retrenchment or at least a period of trying to make ends meet as regards the national finances.  His Department are the first to suffer and he will be the main beneficiary from a review of this nature.  If I were in his position I would welcome such a move and a new approach to the needs of the health services in relation to the moneys being made available by the Department of Finance for them.</P>
    <P>Very many areas of the health services are still seriously deficient, not fully developed, many areas that in the long term we would do well to develop such as services for the elderly.  Although a good deal of progress has been made these services are still deficient in the case of elderly people living at home or discharged in some cases &mdash; perhaps now more than ever &mdash; prematurely from hospital. They do not have the facilities they <Col N="600" /> require to live in their own community. Community care services particularly need improvement.  Also conditions in our psychiatric hospitals, I think we agree, are very far from perfect.  They have lagged behind the higher-profile acute hospitals for many years.  In keeping with the theme I have been expounding in the main they cater for people who have no voice, no lobby, and are not powerful in the political arena.  During my term of office together with the officials of the Department I began a programme of visiting psychiatric hospitals and bringing in a plan for the long-term improvement and upgrading of these hospitals so as to enable many patients who are now long-term incumbents of psychiatric hospitals to resume normal life as residents in their community.  This is an area in which development is definitely needed and we must devote more resources to it in future.</P>
    <P>There are many health services areas that are not developed and delays in development cannot be brooked even in times such as these.  We must therefore have an appraisal of the entire building programme in regard to health and, in the larger context, in regard to public spending generally.  I would be one of the first &mdash; and the Labour Party motion makes this point &mdash; to recognise that there are very many areas in which we need to review the manner in which we spend our resources.  There are many areas of health care services where reform of our spending is required.  There will be all these priorities.  There are many areas where their is profiteering and waste.  In the case of health service cuts such as these what merits criticism is the harsh and cruel way in which they are being implemented.  The cuts fall on the patients rather than on those who are creaming off profits from the services. Health services exist for the patients in the first instance but in the way the whole system operates one would wonder if they are for the patients.  We must get back to realising that the patient has priority in the ordering of health services.</P>
    <P>The Trident report, with which we are all familiar, has documented for us the bonanza our health system represents for <Col N="601" /> the major drug companies.  Last year drug costs in the GMS alone amounted to £38 million and Trident showed us that brand-name drugs in the main cost one-third more than their generic equivalent. It also shows the absence of proper stock control.  I know that if the Minister's Department, which is very serious about stock control, got sufficient funds from the Department of Finance it would probably be carrying out more stock control in hospitals and from what I have heard from those working in the health services it would mean a considerable saving if stocks in medical institutions or health care institutions were controlled more effectively.</P>
    <P>The report also showed the absence of centralised purchasing of drugs, which is very important.  The way we organise drug ordering and purchase allows easy pickings for the drug multi-nationals at the expense of the taxpayer.  In my short period as Minister I was working on centralised drug purchasing for the entire health service, on comparative tendering for drugs, on limiting State subsidies and return to generic drugs and other competitively-tendered products.  The drug companies can spend millions of pounds promoting their products.  We all know of instances where vast seminars and other costly gatherings are financed to promote a single drug.  Doctors operating within the system will tell you quite honestly &mdash; I understand it &mdash; that a particular drug is so well promoted that it is the one that immediately jumps to the doctor's mind when he is about to prescribe. He knows from the vast array of information he has and which he has accumulated through the years that there is a cheaper product available but he has not the time nor the facility to reach for it.  The one being promoted so effectively by the drug company is the one that comes to his mind.  Obviously, in the interests of time and of the health of the patient, and probably of many other patients in his waiting room, he promotes that drug.  This is big business.  Profits from big businesses should not be allowed to soar in an area as sensitive as health.  Companies which can spend millions of pounds on promoting drugs <Col N="602" /> should bear the cost of the economies in the nation's drugs bill and not medical card-holders.</P>
    <P>Drug companies get information from the Department of Health regarding the prescription and popularity of drugs.  This helps the companies to plan for the future.  There is a levy which they pay to the Department for this.  However, I do not believe they pay that levy promptly. The Minister might look into this in balancing the budget.  I know it will take time and that the Minister will not be able to do anything overnight.  There are many problems to tackle.  However, it is important to go after the areas where we know the money is and not cut back on essential care services for people without money or resources.</P>
    <P>There is a misuse of resources in the division of the health care services between public care and private care. Some 35 per cent of hospital consultants' time is devoted to caring for 15 per cent of patients who are private.  We have the scandal of poor families waiting for months or years to have necessary treatment carried out while those who can afford it can see top specialists in a week. We all know of cases where, for example, children with tonsilitis have been left on a waiting list and when parents were advised to go privately, the children were in hospital within a week.  That kind of situation cannot be tolerated.  I do not say that the Minister can put these things right overnight but we can address ourselves to this problem and make sure that we do not have two levels of health care available, one for the haves and one for the have nots.  The most valuable possession a person has is his or her health. Everyone is entitled to the best health care.  We should not have these divisions.</P>
    <P>There are vested interests in the health area and many problems to be overcome before we can have the just health service we on these benches aspire to.  Any person can qualify for free maintenance in a public ward but we give substantial subsidies to those who choose private care. Can we afford, when money is scarce and many areas of the health service are not developed, to channel money to those who seek the privileged position of private <Col N="603" /> care?  As Minister I opted to increase the charges for private patients.  That was an unpopular move but in my estimation it was the lesser of two evils and better than curtailing services for public patients.  To charge private patients the full economic cost of their beds could yield an additional £20 million a year. That would be more just than some of the measures taken which have been brought about by the scarcity of funds at present.</P>
    <P>We cannot continue to tolerate the waste and inefficiency of starving community care services of necessary funds. It would be cheaper for the State to care for a sick person in the community rather than in an institutionalised setting.  Care in the community with the support of the patient's family, friends and neighbours is more acceptable than the impersonal setting of a hospital or home however sympathetically and professionally well-treated the patient might be.  His recovery would be better facilitated in the setting to which he is accustomed without the traumatic experience of having to go to hospital unless medical needs dictate otherwise.  That would be a different matter.</P>
    <P>In many cases patients could be cared for with greater benefit in the community if community care services were developed to a higher level.  It is cheaper for a patient to go into hospital.  It costs the State £400 a week but sometimes his family would be unable to afford his drugs and family doctor bills if he were at home.  This is an ironical situation.  The Labour Party have always supported a free family doctor service to provide necessary medical care without a price barrier and encourage further use of community based services.  Almost three-quarters of the health budget is spent each year on institutional care and an increasing amount on glamorous high technology.  The community care services still remain the cinderella of the health services.  Despite the lip service we pay to the ideal of community care, election promises and the political power wielded by powerful lobbies ensure that we spend <Col N="604" /> money on high technology at the expense of the basic needs of the community.</P>
    <P>If cuts have to be made in the health services it makes more sense to defer some of the prestige projects rather than cut back on community care and on grants to voluntary bodies who are in the front line of medical care services generally. I am very concerned that the community care services are not sufficiently developed and that cutbacks will force hospitals, in their efforts to live within their budgets, to discharge elderly patients.  As community services are not sufficiently developed such patients could be placed at risk.  These are the dire effects of the cuts and measures which health boards might take.  I wonder what, if any, other steps the Minister has taken to tackle the abuses in the fee per item system of remuneration for doctors in the general medical services.  I made the point &mdash; it was not well received, perhaps understandably so &mdash; that the number of patient visits per doctor in the general medical services is twice that of Britain under the UK national health services. The rate has increased steadily.  Had it been maintained at the 1973 level, savings last year under the general medical services would have amounted to £9 million. Nobody who is working conscientiously within the services need fear an investigation into this.  This is something which should be looked into.  Vested interest in health needs to be tackled rather than the patient for whom the services exist.</P>
    <P>Because various health boards will have different methods of effecting savings and implementing cuts to meet their budgets eligibility for health services will vary in different parts of the country. Some areas will impose charges or close wards while others will cut back on transport. Every board give effect to the views of their board members to keep within their budget.  There is no uniform scheme with the result that people in different parts of the country will not know where they stand.  There was never complete conformity between the health boards but the situation will be even more confused now and it would be better if there <Col N="605" /> was an overall appraisal of the health services.</P>
    <P>It has come to my notice that in one health board area &mdash; I assume similar things have happened in other areas &mdash; the daily newspaper which was provided free in the wards occupied by long-stay, chronic patients, many of whom had no income, was discontinued.  I cannot imagine what difference the price of that paper would make to the budget of that health board.  I have heard also that at tea time two slices of bread were reduced to one slice per patient.  This is taking things too far.  I cannot imagine the present Minister agreeing to that kind of saving.  I was told &mdash; and I question this &mdash; that in the area where the bread supply was reduced and the paper was discontinued, lunch was provided for board members.  This is typical of what happens when we are asked to make cuts in our budgets.  In certain circumstances it is only natural to play up to people with power and to walk on those who do not have power, but this is very serious when applied to the health services.</P>
    <P>When the Minister announced on the radio the 900 items which were removed from the drug scheme he said he was concerned that patients, such as the elderly, the chronically ill, children, pregnant women and so on, were not deprived of essential dressings and vitamins.  This might be the last opportunity we will have to discuss the health services here and I would like to ask the Minister to what extent he has been able to operate that scheme and bring about those cuts without imposing hardship on the people I have mentioned.  There was a danger that when these 900 items were removed from the drugs scheme patients would stock up to beat the ban.  That would be very dangerous.</P>
    <P>I read a press statement by the Minister yesterday in which he described this motion as cynical posturing, and spoke about the cuts which would have been implemented had we stayed in power. We budgeted for a year.  The worst thing one could do is to give more money to the health boards and then withdraw it. Under the present situation the health <Col N="606" /> boards do not know where they stand. Our tabling this motion was not cynical posturing.  As a previous Minister for Health I would not indulge in such a thing nor would I accuse the present Minister of doing so.  Our main concern was that essential health care services for the poor and the elderly should not be reduced and that those capable of bearing the burden should bear it.  The sentiments contained in this motion would have been expressed by the Labour Party at this stage when the effects of the cuts had become evident whether we were in or out of Government, by whatever mechanism was appropriate.  A Labour Minister unable to provide the Government with alternative means of raising funds or lessening the hardship on the poor or weaker sections of the community would have no option but to discontinue as Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>I hope this motion will be taken by the Minister in the spirit in which it was put down.  It was intended to help him.  I understand the difficulty facing any Minister for Health in getting finance from the central Exchequer for a service that is so costly, so labour-intensive and underdeveloped that new schemes, charges and demands are always being made to meet very desirable objectives. It is reasonable that a Minister for Health would require more money but he must ensure that the reductions which must be made do not fall on the underprivileged sections of the community.  Our motion will only strengthen his hand.  My main concern in putting down this motion was to ensure that there would not be any hardship or suffering by the people I mentioned.  There is no cynical posturing involved.</P>
    <P>Political reality is that the Taoiseach assured us that whether or not this motion is carried makes no difference to the continuation of Government.  Every Deputy is, to a greater or lesser degree an expert in the health area.  We should all share our experience in order to bring about a more just and equitable service and to ensure that in time of stringency and cutbacks, the burden does not fall on the sick and the poor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the points made by Deputy Desmond about the spirit in which this motion was put down.  I am aware that the Fine Gael Party are supporting this motion and using it in the present political situation.  For that reason we are faced tonight with very serious issues of credibility.</P>
      <P>As a Government the Coalition of Labour and Fine Gael earlier this year decided on measures to bring our public finances into better balance.  Deputy Desmond has indicted the role of the Fine Gael Minister for Finance in this process. All of the measures taken were severe but some were so excessive that they were rejected by this House and subsequently by the people.  Deputies will recall the proposed 18 per cent VAT on footwear and clothing and the removal of food subsidies.  Nevertheless, all parties now profess that difficult decisions must be taken in the national interest to bring expenditure under control and to ensure that funds are available for genuine needs.</P>
      <P>The main difference between the actions proposed by the Fine Gael and Labour Coalition and those taken by the present Government relate to the manner, extent and the timing required to bring about the necessary changes.  Our approach has not been as harsh as was proposed by our predecessors and it has certainly been more sensitive in its application. How then can Labour with the support of Fine Gael retain any shred of credibility when they put down a motion condemning the Government for taking measures which were less severe than they had themselves decided to take earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, when I took up office as Minister for Health I found the amount approved by the previous Government to meet the running costs of health services in the current year was £48 million short of what was needed to maintain services at 1981 levels.  If one takes the cuts in services which went with that the total figure was £60 million.  The measures which were regarded by health agencies as needed to cope with a budgetary deficiency of that magnitude included the <Col N="608" /> closure of hospital wards for lengthy periods; significant reductions in the numbers covered by medical cards; severe curtailment of vital community services such as home help services and meals on wheels as well as cutbacks in services for the mentally ill, the mentally handicapped and other disadvantaged groups.  I appreciate what Deputy Desmond said about the position which she might have had to take later in the year.</P>
    <P>When I brought the situation to the notice of the Government it was decided that because of the hardships involved extra funds should be provided to ensure that community based services could be maintained at a reasonable level and that large-scale disruption of hospital services could be avoided.  For this reason the Government provided an extra £28 million for the health services in the March 1982 budget.  This reduced the deficiency in the funds available for health services to £20 million.</P>
    <P>When the Government found it necessary in July because of the deepening recession to effect further reductions in public expenditure it was inevitable that the health services, because of the extent of the Exchequer liability in financing them, would have to provide part of the savings needed.  The further saving required from the health services allocations was £12 million.  Even with this reduction, however, the finances available for the health services were still £16 million above the previous Government's allocation.  One must bear in mind that the Coalition Government at the midpoint last year also made cuts and introduced a mini-budget.</P>
    <P>One of the areas which has generated most public discussion in recent months has been that of changes in the community drugs schemes.  Much of this discussion has been based upon a misunderstanding of the extent and implications of the changes.  Equally, however, much of the debate has ignored the origins of these decisions.  Therefore, I propose to describe in some detail the background to these particular changes.</P>
    <P>From the first of October last most drugs which do not legally require a doctor's prescription have not been available <Col N="609" /> free of charge under the medical card scheme.  Many of the excluded items were not, in fact, drugs but were items such as medicated shampoos and disinfectants which, arguably, should never have been included in a scheme of this kind.  Furthermore, there was evidence that there was a significant level of abuse of many of these items, including some examples of the re-sale of products dispensed under the medical card scheme.  Such abuses served to underline just how questionable was the retention of many of these items in a public health care programme.</P>
    <P>Besides the evidence of abuse, the decision to exclude most of these over-the-counter items from the GMS was recommended by the Trident Management Consultants in their report on arrangements for the supply of drugs.  That report highlighted the savings which could be made if non-prescription medicines were excluded from the GMS.  Their exclusion is, I believe, justified on a number of grounds.  First of all, the mast majority of the items in question are very cheap and, in the private sector, many are sold through non-pharmaceutical outlets as part of normal household shopping.</P>
    <P>At retail prices the majority of the excluded items cost less than 50p for one week's supply.  It is, therefore, unlikely that their purchase would involve hardship for medical card holders.  Secondly, many of the items in question are of dubious value to health and a substantial number have no proven therapeutic effectiveness whatsoever.  My view on this matter was confirmed by the fact that the professional organisations with whom I had discussions did not oppose the exclusion of the vast majority of the items which were ultimately deleted from the first of October last.  The third factor which influenced the Government in their decision was the fact that the supply of these cheap, everyday items through the GMS scheme cost the taxpayer many times their price to the individual customer in a retail pharmacy.  The difference was accounted for by a doctor's fee £2.92 which must be paid for each prescription written and the pharmacist's fee, 97p, for dispensing every item on that prescription to a medical card <Col N="610" /> holder.  In practice, that dispensing fee was, in the majority of cases, more than twice the level of the ingredient cost of one weeks' supply of these items.  In short, not only was the taxpayer funding the cost of cheap items which, in private practice, do not require a doctor's prescription but he was also paying for an extremely expensive method of supplying these items.</P>
    <P>Not all over-the-counter items are cheap.  Therefore, from the very beginning I ensured that a range of items would continue to be available to medical card holders.  This was because I realised that the cost of these items, including PKU foods and Stoma appliances, would represent a major burden on medical card holders.  Following discussions with relevant professional organisations I extended the list of items which would be retained in the GMS.  The items so retained were selected on the basis of their importance on public health grounds, such as items for the treatment of scabies.  I also arranged for the retention of iron and folic acid tablets for expectant mothers, as well as bandages and dressings for use by doctors in their surgeries.  The exclusion of over-the-counter items will result in savings of approximately £8 million pounds in a full year.  I assure Deputy Desmond that there is a constant monitoring process on these items.  I intend to see that there is no hardship involved, although we must face up to practicalities.</P>
    <P>No Government and no Minister for Health is happy to order the deletion of items from free availability.  I say this simply to underline the fact that the present financial situation obliged all of us to examine those areas of expenditure where economies can be made with least damage to patient care.  Because of my natural reluctance to implement decisions of this kind I made every effort to ensure that negative consequences for patients would be avoided.  My belief that such would be the case was strengthened by the fact that the representations I received about retaining items in the scheme focuses upon a narrow range of products, the majority of which in fact were retained.  Indeed of the total of <Col N="611" /> more than nine hundred items originally scheduled for deletion from the scheme, about fifty have been retained following discussions with the relevant parties.  Of course, the vast majority of drugs on the market, some 3,500 items, continue to be available free of charge to medical card holders when prescribed by their doctor. I am satisfied that the savings which will result from this decision will help to secure the future of the GMS scheme which provides patients with a free medical service with full choice of doctor.  I am sure that all Members of the House will agree that this scheme is the backbone of our primary health care system and will share my determination to ensure that this vital service will continue to be available to those who need it.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, very concerned that in exceptional individual cases the purchase of excluded items may involve hardship. I am satisfied that this will be a rare occurrence.  Where it does arise, however, I would encourage medical card holders to contact their nearest health board office with full details of their requirements and difficulties.  Health boards have been requested to view such cases sympathetically and they will be provided with the means by which such hardship can readily be overcome.</P>
    <P>The impact of this decision is being kept under careful scrutiny and review to ensure that no hardship will occur and I can assure the House of my personal commitment in this regard.  Earlier this year incontinence sheets were excluded from the GMS.  These cost the taxpayer £1.25 million last year and the quantities used appeared to be excessive.  There was also evidence of serious abuse in their supply.  This matter is now being investigated by the Director of Public Prosecutions. Meanwhile, I directed that in future incontinence sheets should be supplied by health boards through the public health nursing service.  As a result, their cost in the current year will be of the order of £0.25 million.  This represents a total saving of £1 million for the State and the taxpayer and I defy anybody in this House to show where any hardship was caused.  We could go through all the <Col N="612" /> other items and show the savings that will be made.  All the vested interests used the political people in the front to make the appropriate noises to prevent these changes being made.  If Deputy O'Keeffe's party want to set about righting the finances of the country they must stand up and do it but without causing hardship.  Some of the approach tonight is highly hypocritical.  These items will be available to all who need them as part of a comprehensive domiciliary care service.  This is an example of the type of saving which can be made without affecting the quality of care received by patients.  I believe that the decision to exclude most over-the-counter items from the GMS is in the same category.</P>
    <P>The amendment tabled by The Workers Party calls for the re-establishment of the services available to the public under the general medical services scheme and the programme of the health boards to the level and under the terms operating prior to the introduction of the cutbacks and for effecting savings in expenditure through (a) replacing the fee per item system of payment for doctors and pharmacists, by a capitation system of payment, and (b) empowering the National Drugs Board to establish a national drugs formulary to rationalise the number of drugs used and force competition on the drugs companies.</P>
    <P>Do I assume that the savings under these two headings are expected to meet the cost involved in re-establishing the services to their former levels?  If this is so, then I am afraid that the proposers are mistaken as to the practicality of what they are calling for.  The present systems for payment of doctors and pharmacists under the GMS and for the supply of medicines under that scheme were the result of detailed and protracted negotiations with the interested parties concerned. There is no way in which radical changes of the nature proposed could be negotiated or, indeed, even imposed unilaterally in the time scale which would be needed to produce savings of the order required.</P>
    <P>As to the change mentioned in the method of payment of doctors, I do not think it would be appropriate to take a <Col N="613" /> view on this matter just now.  In August this year I set up a working party representative of my Department, the Departments of Finance and the Public Service, the health boards and the medical organisations to carry out a wide-ranging review of the scheme and its operation. Having regard to the working party's terms of reference, they will consider carefully the present method of payment and make early recommendations to me on any changes which they consider desirable. This approach has already been taken by me and I have had a working party functioning since August of this year.</P>
    <P>This aspect of the scheme cannot be treated in isolation.  The medical organisations' desire for appropriate superannuation arrangements is a significant new factor in any consideration of the scheme and may well have a major bearing on any recommendations which the working party may make on the future arrangements for payments to doctors under a revised scheme.</P>
    <P>Pharmacists are paid a flat fee for their professional service in dispensing doctors prescriptions; they do not get any markup in respect of the drugs and medicines supplied.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the National Drugs Advisory Board be empowered to establish a national drugs formulary to rationalise the number of drugs used and to force competition on the drug companies is not a practical one in current circumstances. We have already prepared a drugs formulary which was devised, under the chairmanship of Dr. Phil Brennan, by representatives of the Eastern Health Board and the medical organisations. The function of this formulary, and of formularies in general, is to encourage good prescribing practice.</P>
    <P>In the preparation of formularies, it is customary to give information in regard to the cost of the appropriate prescribing practices which are mentioned.  The one which has been prepared has already had a major influence on prescribing practice in the profession and in the hospitals. Formularies are, however, essentially advisory documents and the objective mentioned in the amendment could not be attained unless a decision were taken <Col N="614" /> to restrict the supply of drugs available or to restrict reimbursement of prescribed drugs to a specified list.  Current practice in this country, and in most other European countries, is that doctors prescribing is not restricted in this manner.  In some countries the reimbursement to patients of prescribed drugs is limited to a specific list.  The effect of this is to restrict the freedom of action of doctors and its introduction in this country would be seen as a major intrusion into the professional freedom of doctors.  It would also have serious implications for the pharmaceutical industry as a whole which Members of this House will know is one of our major exporters, earning over £600 million of much-needed foreign currencies each year and is also employing over 15,000 people, many of whom are skilled technical and professional personnel. However, I have initiated discussions with the industry to improve the existing purchasing arrangements.  Needless to say this information in the formulary will be very relevant to the discussions.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier my concern to ensure that all were aware of the background to the decisions about funding which had to be taken.  I am amazed that members of the former administration have been so quick to condemn the decisions. When in Government they decided on the same course of action.  My Department prepared Estimates for 1982 which included provision for savings of £2 million arising from implementation of the Trident Report's recommendations.  The previous Government, with a Labour Minister for Health, altered that estimate to increase the savings from implementation of Trident by £4.5 million, making a total saving of £6.5 million.  I accept what the former Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, said about the functions of the Minister for Finance in that regard.</P>
    <P>In the short term, the only way such a saving could be made was by deletion of over-the-counter items.  Clearly this is what the previous administration intended.  It is, therefore, very surprising that it should be the subject of their condemnation. There are, of course, many other recommendations in that report <Col N="615" /> relating to savings in the supply of drugs. I have initiated discussions with the pharmaceutical industry in regard to these other recommendations and I can assure the House that I am anxious to secure the maximum level of savings in this area. The changes involved, however, are such that the necessary discussions cannot be concluded in a short time.  However, I am confident that these discussions will come to an early and fruitful conclusion.</P>
    <P>The other area of drugs policy in which there have been economies is that of the refund of the cost of drugs scheme.  The figure above which monthly expenditure on drugs is recouped by health boards was increased from £12 to £16 with effect from 1 September last.  The figure had been last increased in August of the previous year.  This was a relatively minor change which, in part, reflected inflation alone.  However, the previous administration in their Estimates for 1982 made provisions for savings of £4 million from changes in the refund scheme.  Such a saving could have been realised only by increasing the threshold figure from £12 to £20 from an early date.  This was the figure included at that time.</P>
    <P>This was another element in the Estimate which I inherited as Minister for Health on coming to office.  This Government reduced the proposed threshold figure as part of our reappraisal of health expenditure because we considered a figure of £20 per month would cause hardship to some eligible households, particularly those in the middle income group. I have this scheme under examination at present, in common with many other health schemes, to see whether its objectives could be achieved at lower cost.  At this stage, however, I merely wish to point out that the previous administration, whose members are so quick to criticise the economies which have now been made, contemplated more severe measures when in office earlier this year.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the extra funds provided for health services in the March budget reduced the deficiency in the allocation for health services to £20 million. The withdrawal of £12 million from the provision for health services in August <Col N="616" /> increased the deficiency to £32 million.  I met the chairman and the chief executive officers of health boards in September and sought their co-operation in achieving the target reductions in expenditure and stressed that the measures to secure economies should not cause hardship or distress to the poor and weaker sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The co-operation of the authorities of voluntary health hospitals was sought in achieving the necessary savings.  I also held meetings with all the authorities of voluntary hospitals and, incidentally, this was the first time they were ever brought together for such a meeting.  I am pleased to say that the response, in general, has been very encouraging.  The main thrust of the efforts to effect savings has been directed at the hospital area.  It is estimated that about 85 per cent of the savings needed will have to be secured in expenditure on hospital services.  The main areas of expenditure on which savings are planned are overtime, on-call payments, employment of locums, purchasing arrangements, heating, catering, maintenance and general overheads and in administrative costs.</P>
    <P>Many of the major hospitals proposed that moderate charges for public wards and out-patient services should be introduced for patients not covered by medical cards.  The House will be aware that I have already responded to the introduction of contributions in respect of out-patient services.  Indeed, one board introduced such a contribution very early this year and have been operating it successfully throughout the year.  It has worked particularly well and has had a major impact without creating hardship.  I advise Deputies to have a look at it before they go too far in their criticisms of relatively modest and moderate measures to contain costs and maintain the services which we want to maintain.</P>
    <P>The contribution is at a standard £5 rate and is being applied in respect of both casualty and other out-patient services.  Persons covered by medical cards are not being asked to contribute, nor will it apply in the case of emergency cases brought to hospital by ambulance. Many of those who at present turn up at <Col N="617" /> hospital casualty departments could be treated equally well by their own doctor. The contribution can scarcely be regarded as excessive.  The going rate being charged by doctors for a surgery consultation is generally higher.</P>
    <P>I intend to ensure that no hardship will arise as a result of this payment arrangement for out-patient services.  I have arranged for my Department to monitor the situation and, if any changes in the detailed arrangements prove to be necessary on hardship grounds, I will ensure that they are made.  This will apply in particular to people who must attend for treatment on a regular and frequent basis; as well as for patients who may need a range of tests and treatments on the one visit.</P>
    <P>There is no problem in dealing with cases like this because the total cost of dealing with hardship cases or people in particular circumstances is relatively small.  The savings are made on the very big number of people who can quite readily afford to pay £5.  That is where the money needs to be obtained.  This is one of the measures which was put to me by the hospitals.  The measures currently being applied to contain Exchequer outgoings on health services are the result of what can be described as dramatic increases in health costs in recent years.</P>
    <P>In 1977 the net non-capital expenditure on health services amounted to £328 million or about 6 per cent of GNP.  Expenditure in the current year is estimated at £952 million or about 8 per cent of GNP. It is pretty obvious that something had to be done about the containment of this rate of increase.  If we look at increases on a programme basis we find that, in the case of community health services, costs have increased from about £46 million to about £143 million between 1977 and 1982.  In the same period expenditure on community welfare services has increased from about £27½ million to £72 million.  While a large part of the increase in costs has been caused by pay and price inflation, community based services have been expanded considerably.  Nevertheless there are still many gaps and deficiencies. This situation can only be remedied by allocating additional resources <Col N="618" /> to the community area.  In the present economic climate extra resources for expanding services can only be obtained from savings in existing services.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to expect that in the organisation and management of a service costing up to £1,000 million there is some scope for saving without damaging the quality of the service being provided. Studies which have recently been carried out indicate wide variations in hospital expenditure levels which cannot be explained by differences in treatment requirements or activity levels.  In a study which I have had done recently covering three similar hospitals, for example, it was shown that two of the hospitals spent more than twice as much on drugs per patient as the third.  Again we have found that one large general teaching hospital is spending £.25 million more on medicines each year than a similar sized hospital offering an equally wide range of treatment.  Studies carried out in respect of psychiatric hospitals with broadly comparable staffing ratios have revealed the existence of quite substantial differences in the levels of overtime payments.  For example in two comparable psychiatric institutions staffing in one was found to be 20 per cent higher than the other, but overtime rates were 50 per cent greater. As Minister for Health there is a serious responsibility on me to tackle this kind of problem, and I am doing so.  When the smokescreens are left aside, somebody must tackle this kind of problem.  Deputy Desmond said in her contribution that she recognises such problems exist.  Even in an area such as provisions, which might be expected to confirm to a regular pattern, costs per patient in a number of hospitals appear to be considerably greater than those in similar hospitals. While it is a matter for the medical profession to determine the relative merits of different forms of treatment, nevertheless I am convinced that effective management and rigorous examination of our services can produce savings without disrupting the level and quality of the service being provided.</P>
    <P>I have recently established a special unit in my Department to assist the health <Col N="619" /> boards, the voluntary hospitals and other health agencies to meet the problems which they face in living within restricted budgets.  The function of the unit is to identify areas where money can be saved. The unit will obtain outside assistance of specialists in the use of management techniques and in their application to the health services.  Indeed, one of the features which I found in talking to the voluntary hospitals when I brought them all together was that they said, &ldquo;We will do it if we are sure that they will do it too&rdquo;. This is the situation we face.  Somebody must bring them all together and say that we must have norms and terms, and a great deal of wailing can be expected while that process is going on.  That is the process that is seen publicly now because everybody when challenged to get his management in order will put up the poor or the little child in the pram or whatever else and say, &ldquo;For goodness sake, do not look searchingly into my management because you might find it is not quite as good as it should be&rdquo;.  However, that is being done now in a very fair way by providing the supports to the hospitals and the health boards to get down to the brass tacks and to help them to find these within their own resources.</P>
    <P>While it would be unrealistic to expect that all savings which must be made in our expenditure on the health services can be achieved in this way, I see this as a most important move to safeguard the real benefits of our health services while we are passing through the present difficult time.</P>
    <P>Health services which are effective in prevention or cure result in a healthier and more productive work force.  The Government remain committed to the provision of health services that are caring and cost-effective.  We want to ensure that the service provided is related to need and that there is an appropriate balance between need and supply.</P>
    <P>We are committed to maintaining the fabric of a service that contains within it complementary public and private strands.  We believe that it is better to ask those who can afford to do so to make some contribution, however nominal, to <Col N="620" /> the cost of their own health care than to dismantle a service which cannot be fully supported at present by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The present Government's concern for the poorer and weaker sections of the community and their determination to tackle the social inequalities in our society are evidenced by their decision to establish the National Community Development Agency.  The necessary legislation was enacted during the last session of the Oireachtas.  I shall be announcing the membership of the agency very shortly.</P>
    <P>The agency will be a permanent body with wide-ranging powers to promote and encourage community development and self-help and particularly to tackle areas of poverty and deprivation.  It will have a substantial budget from which it will be in a position to make grants available for pilot schemes and innovatory projects aimed at overcoming particular social needs.  In order to underline our view that this body should have some &ldquo;teeth&rdquo; the legislation has given power to appropriate Ministers to direct statutory bodies to co-operate with the new agency where this co-operation is not otherwise forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Despite the present reductions, I am happy to be able to say that we have in <i>The Way Forward</i> a five-year programme for the capital services and this will enable us to carry out very worthwhile developments in the health services and to include for the first time long term plans for community-based services for psychiatric cases and for the mentally handicapped, together with a number of other projects which I have not time to go into here at this stage.</P>
    <P>This is not a time for doctrinaire, inflexible approaches, of whatever hue, to the problem of preserving a quantum and quality of care that represents the cumulative work of many Governments and many agencies over a very long period.  We are devoting a large part of our resources to keeping up a health service which keeps us among the most developed countries.  We are finding it necessary to hold the line at about this level and we are trying to balance need for health care against many other competing <Col N="621" /> priorities for resources.  There may well be room for further adjustments in the strategy which we have adopted and on this I have taken careful note of all that has been said both inside and outside this House.</P>
    <P>I cannot, however, accept that our strategy has been either excessive or arbitrary.  Governments of far wealthier countries have gone further more quickly in curbing expenditure on health services.  What has been done had been necessary.  It has reflected local opportunities and priorities within broad national guidelines and has been a good deal better than people on the other side of the House were prepared to do at the beginning of this year.  Everyone knows and agrees that money must be saved, no-one wants it to be done in his or her area, and in the national interest we must contain expenditure in health as well as elsewhere.  The alternative to what we are doing here is to take the option of the right-wing Fine Gael approach which is a harsh, severe and uncaring attitude which was demonstrated clearly in the steps they took at the beginning of this year.</P>
    <P>In looking at the motion generally I would like to give my assurance to Deputy Desmond that I appreciate the points she makes and the spirit in which she made her contribution.  I give her my assurance that I am reviewing and will review these developments as the end of the year comes up and I am very concerned about the application of them. Some of the points she made are more relevant to the Estimates debate which was to take place very early this time to give an opportunity to say whether the Estimates are adequate for next year and in those Estimates what adjustments should be made.  I would have hoped that Deputy Desmond would have been here to help me in that respect in relation to the coming budget.  Nevertheless, some of the comments are useful.  I give my assurance that as far as review is concerned I am very anxious to review and I accept that point but I do not accept the charge of excessive or arbitrary cuts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment <Col N="622" /> No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann,&rdquo; and substitute:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;while recognising the need for an efficient health service and, pending a total restructuring and reorganisastion of our present health services, calls upon the Government to:</P>
      <P>(1)  Re-establish the services available to the public under the General Medical Services Scheme and the programme of the Health Boards to the level and under the terms operating prior to the introduction of the cutbacks,</P>
      <P>(2)  Effect savings in expenditure through (a) replacing the fee per item system of payment for doctors and pharmacists, by a capitation system of payment, and (b) empowering the National Drugs Board to establish a National Drugs Formulary to rationalise the number of drugs used, and force competition on the drugs companies.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of all the Government-ordered cutbacks over the past few months those affecting the health services have caused us in The Workers Party most concern because of their consequences in terms of suffering and even possible loss of life.  The hallmark of any civilised society should be its treatment of the sick and elderly, yet it is these who suffer most as a result of these cutbacks.  The Minister's decision on the cutbacks was typical of the <i>ad hoc</i> approach adopted by successive Fianna Fáil and Coalition Governments in relation to health services.  They were started on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, developed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and now they are being cut back on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  We are opposed to these cutbacks, not only because they are likely to cause suffering but also because they will be inefficient.  I cannot believe that the Government's medical advisers did not alert them to the consequences of removing such common drugs as aspirin and paracetamol from the list of drugs available.  These two drugs are used for the relief of mild and moderate pain. <Col N="623" /> There is no problem for anyone needing a packet of aspirin to deal with the odd headache.  However, these drugs are also used for the treatment of long-term ailments such as arthritis, heart disease and recurrent strokes.  Doctors are now faced with the task of telling people who need these simple and safe medical preparations that they must go elsewhere and pay for them and regular purchasing of these preparations would be beyond the capacity of many poor and elderly people. Alternatively, doctors will be forced to prescribe one of the drugs remaining on the list which will be more expensive, stronger and possibly more dangerous. There are many examples which I could list of cheaper and relatively safe drugs being withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Most reasonable people will accept that expenditure on drugs must be kept under control, but this can be done without affecting the welfare of the ill.  However, the Government have obviously decided that it is easier to confront the old and the sick than the vested interests of the drug companies and medical and pharmaceutical societies.  There is no doubt that there is considerable scope for rationalisation in the area of drug prescription. It has been estimated that there are up to 15,000 prescribable drugs available here at present.  A huge number of these are the same basic drug under a different name, in a different colour or packed in a different carton.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, the World Health Organisation estimated that all medical eventualities could be covered by about 300 basic drugs.  Certainly, we estimate that not more than 1,000 would be required.  In our amendment, we call for the establishment of a national drugs formulary or list of the 1,000 or so essential drugs needed for the health services.  The list would be revised annually and the drug companies should be requested to tender each year for the supply of a particular drug to the health services.  Tenders would then be awarded each year, based on cost, delivery date and safety standards.  These would then be the only drugs which the doctors would be asked to prescribe.  Such a formulary would <Col N="624" /> force price competition on drug companies. At present there is no effective competition between them and the Government, as the largest buyer of drugs, have done nothing to bring about competition. One example will illustrate the point. Penicillin is the most commonly prescribed antibiotic drug in Ireland.  At present there are no less than nine companies producing it and all marketing it at the same price.</P>
    <P>The Workers Party are totally opposed to the fee per item system of payment of doctors and pharmacists and our amendment calls upon the Government to end it.  No advanced country which has tried to introduce a civilised health service, where services are free at the point of delivery, has been able to do it.  The fee per item of payment has been a major contributing factor in the spiralling cost of our health services.  It has led to the overprescription of drugs, and payments to some doctors by health boards clearly show that there is the potential there for overvisiting.  It has produced a goldmine for some pharmacists.  Why else do we have three times as many pharmacists per head of population as in Britain?  A capitation system of payment would mean that doctors and pharmacists would be paid a particular sum of money for each patient on their books, irrespective of the number of visits or prescriptions issued. The implementation of these two suggestions would effect a major reduction in expenditure on the health service, without imposing the hardship which the Minister's cutbacks are undoubtedly going to cause to the weakest sections of our society &mdash; the poor and the elderly.</P>
    <P>The reduction in hospital services which has resulted from the Government cutbacks raises serious questions about the standard of patient care now available in hospitals.  The effects of the cutbacks have been made even greater because the budgetary reductions forced upon the health boards have been compressed into the last three months of 1982.  The indisputable fact is that, arising from these cutbacks, patient care is being adversely affected by the staffing rundown, the reduction in weekend working and the cutback in overtime working.  Psychiatric <Col N="625" /> services &mdash; for long the poor relation of the health services &mdash; have been particularly hit and face even further rundown. Indeed, the trade unions are worried that the reduction in staffing levels in some acute psychiatric wards is so severe as to create a situation of danger for staff and patients alike.  If this policy is pursued and if staffing levels are cut, as demanded, by 2 per cent by mid-1983 and a total of 5 per cent by 1985, this will mean total job losses of 4,000 in the health services.  Can the Minister really ask us to believe that this will not seriously affect the standard of patient care?</P>
    <P>In addition, the arbitrary implementation of unilateral changes has serious implications for industrial relations in the health services.  The so-called consultation with the unions has been a sham. Agreements are being set aside, Labour Court recommendations ignored, and working conditions arbitrarily changed. To give just one example &mdash; in my own area, the Southern Health Board have increased meal charges for staff from £1.30 to £4 per meal.  This has very serious implications for the many low paid workers who are employed in hospitals. In all health board areas temporary staff are being let go and permanent staff are being threatened in some areas.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the health board area of Cork, where heating in a hospital in which elderly patients are being cared for is being turned off and patients who were previously getting three slices of bread are now getting two slices, you can say that things have reached an all-time low. At this time, it should be mentioned that successive Governments have perhaps failed to supervise the housekeeping of the health boards in the matter of expenditure of capital.  In a recent relevant newspaper report of hospital staff in the Cork area, the following are some examples quoted of abuse of public money: the spending of £30,000 in 1981 on a large air extractor for a hospital kitchen which was only in use for one or two weeks; the spending, about three years ago, of £30,000 for the repair of turf burning boilers, only to have them scrapped shortly afterwards and replaced by two new turf burning boilers at <Col N="626" /> £35,000 each; the spending, two years ago, of £50,000 on X-ray equipment of which little or no use is being made due to the downgrading of the hospital.  These are examples of what has been going on.</P>
    <P>The health services, and the hospital services in particular, are in need of reorganisation and restructuring, but these are the wrong changes and they are being made at such a speed and in such a manner that patients' lives are being put at risk.  The correct thing would have been to approach the trade unions and initiate discussions with them to see how improvements in efficiency could be phased in over the next two or three years.  The unions are responsible bodies. They recognise that improvements can be made and I am confident that they would have responded favourably to such an initiative.</P>
    <P>The Workers Party are committed to the establishment of a national health service that would be free at the point of use and would be open to all without discrimination.  Such a service can be introduced without committing very much additional finance to the health services.  In Ireland, the pharmaceutical and medical professions have been allowed to serve their own interests.  The paradox is that public expenditure of £900 million, more than 7 per cent of GNP, provides very limited health care services here, though a small proportion of the GNP of the UK provides 100 per cent coverage.  The main reason is, of course, that we have an illness service rather than a health service.</P>
    <P>We have a young population on whom the future of the country depends.  They deserve the best possible health services that can be provided.  Our amendment would be a start towards giving them that service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael recognise the need for restraint in expenditure on the health services.  Figures speak for themselves, and we accept that when you have expenditure of almost £1,000 million any responsible Government must consider ways and means to find economies.  But we say that any measures taken to achieve such economies first of all must <Col N="627" /> be planned carefully.  Secondly, the matter must be discussed fully with relevant interested groups, and number three, and above all, we must ensure that the weaker sections will be adequately protected and catered for.</P>
      <P>On all three criteria the Government and the Minister for Health stand condemned. In regard to planning, on the basis of the speech he has just made, how can the Minister justify increasing the allocation of funds for health services in March and then cutting it back a few months later?  The Minister tried to make a virtue of this, which makes it even worse.  Any objective assessment of that approach clearly indicates that the Minister did not know what he was up to.</P>
      <P>I will give some examples.  Under the present Minister for Health and Government the health boards do not know if they are coming or going.  I will take my own region.  In March last the health board got an increase of £2.3 million and, lo and behold, three months later there was a reduction of £1.84 million.  How in the name of goodness can this crazy planning, or lack of it, be justified?  The Minister had the effrontry to come in here to attempt to make a virtue of that.  The same applied to all the health boards: <i>in toto,</i> they got an increased allocation of £12 million in March to be followed a couple of months later by a reduction of £9.6 million.  The health boards had been managing funds of more than £500 million, trying to organise their budgets, trying to meet constraints that had been put on them and I cannot understand how the Minister can say he gave them the slightest assistance by promising them extra money in March and taking it away a couple of months later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That shows clearly a lack of planning. We had other examples of this lack of planning by the Minister.  In August he produced his famous list of 900.  It is quite clear that the list was drawn up with unseemly haste, that the Minister did not have any clear perception of what was in that list.  In the original list there were certain items whose sale is covered under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  How can the Minister say that any planning went into <Col N="628" /> the drawing up of that list when that happened?  It is beyond all credibility.</P>
    <P>A second criterion is necessary when one speaks about containing costs in the health services.  It is the need for consultation with all the interested bodies, the health boards, the unions who are affected by cutbacks, the medical people, the nurses, the pharmacists.  To suggest that such consultations took place on the August announcement is not correct.  I have been speaking to the various bodies, and the discussions that took place were not in any way related to the proposals that were produced.  Those vague discussions could not be classified as consultations in the accepted sense.</P>
    <P>The third and most important criterion is that any cutbacks or constraints must take into consideration the care of the weakest sections first.  On that criterion the Minister has failed miserably.  He has come in here in defence of himself but he omitted a very major item.  I wondered for a while if he was trying to mislead the House in regard to the GMS.  The major thing in regard to the GMS this year is that the Minister extended the medical card system to 78,000 extra people without reference to their means.  Then he came in to try to justify cutting back available facilities and services to people who had medical cards on the basic of lack of means.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the most significant feature of the Minister's speech is what he left out &mdash; the people to whom he extended the GMS facilities without reference to their means, without reference to whether their incomes were £10,000 a year or £40,000 a year.  Under the Minister's edict they got medical cards.  The cost involved this year will be of the order of £8 million.  Then, the Minister comes in in an attempt to justify a saving of a similar amount by taking from the poor, the old and those who have been dependent on the GMS over the years.</P>
    <P>On that basis alone the Government and the Minister for Health must stand totally condemned.  The Minister did not make any attempt &mdash; indeed he did not mention it &mdash; to defend that decision or to explain to the House a decision as a consequence of which people, without <Col N="629" /> reference to means, can get free services from the State at a cost which is being recouped by cutting back on the services available to the poor and the old.</P>
    <P>I do not believe any party in the House can, with any conscience, justify that approach.  I reiterate that Fine Gael fully recognise that the escalation in health service costs over the last number of years must be contained.  The figure has increased from £372 million in 1977 to £960 million in the current year.</P>

      <P>Permission has been given to raise on the Adjournment the question of the closure, with consequent loss of jobs, of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and the <i>Daily News.</i> I understand that Deputy Gallagher <i>(Waterford)</i> is agreeable to share his time with Deputy O'Higgins.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> I thank the Chair for having given me an opportunity of raising this question.  As a former newspaper employee I have a personal interest in the operation of these newspapers. Indeed it is a fair comment to say that to anybody in the media and those of us connected with the printing business the loss of a newspaper, even a provincial one, no matter what the circumstances is a very traumatic matter as it is to the community at large and the individuals involved.  But the loss of a weekly newspaper and a national daily constitutes something of real national concern.  The loss of the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> and the <i>Daily News</i> and more particularly the circumstances surrounding their closure and the dismissal of 150 employees, print workers, reporters and so on, and the placing of other employees in the Sandyford Press in jeopardy is a matter of serious national concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to highlight here this evening is the question raised about the adequacy of legislation governing the <Col N="630" /> operation of private companies and the effectiveness of employee protection legislation. It would be in order for me to sketch briefly the background leading to the closure of these two newspapers.  The <i>Sunday Tribune</i> and the <i>Daily News</i> were owned by a company called Sunday Tribune Limited.  Over the holiday weekend it appears that the ownership of the two titles of these papers was transferred, indeed without the knowledge of or consultation with the employees concerned, to another firm called Daily News Limited. Both Sunday Tribune Limited and Daily News Limited are owned and controlled by a Mr. Hugh McLoughlin who, for obvious reasons, is well known in the publishing industry.  On 27 October last, at the request of Mr. McLoughlin, the High Court appointed a liquidator to Sunday Tribune Limited.  By transferring the ownership of the titles from Sunday Tribune Limited to Daily News Limited and liquidating the former it appears that Mr. McLoughlin hoped to be able to sell the titles to another concern outside the country, at the same time evading his legal and moral responsibilities to the employees concerned.  Members will recollect that on Thursday last we sought an adjournment debate to raise this matter but, due to circumstances beyond our control, this did not take place.  But up to Thursday last Daily News Limited, which now purports to own the two titles, had not even been registered at the Companies Office in Dublin Castle.  It appears to me that the effect of this strategy will be to deny the workers the wages and salaries to which they are legally and morally entitled.  For example, Daily News Limited operated for less than two weeks only and some staff have received no wages at all.  Some of those people came to work on the paper from other parts of the country, indeed some from England.  I do not need to outline for the Minister or anybody else in the House the inconvenience and expense involved in relation to setting up accommodation and so on.  Such staff have suffered grievously in financial terms in addition to the loss of security of jobs, jobs they were given an absolute assurance would last at least 12 months, in particular to afford <Col N="631" /> the <i>Daily News</i> an opportunity to make its circulation impact and then continue in operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from fulltime staff there are also some 50 freelance journalists owed large amounts of money for work carried out for both newspapers in recent weeks.  I recollect speaking to some of the staff involved.  For example, last Thursday afternoon one of the people involved, who happens to be a female member of the NUJ, was left with no less than 2 pence in her pocket because substantial sums of money amounting to hundreds of pounds had not been paid to her.  Some members of the staff of both papers received salary cheques on Friday, 22 October, after 3 o'clock when the banks had closed, cheques they endeavoured to cash.  Like others of us, who are paid by cheque they have an arrangement with a supermarket or some other establishment for the encashment of their cheques; an understanding whereby cheques would be cashed and honoured. On the following Tuesday morning when attempts were made to redeem the cheques it was found that they had bounced.  Indeed the print unions involved estimated that the money due to employees amounts to approximately £200,000.  Apart from money losses to employees and the fact that their jobs have been lost it appears that as much as £300,000 is due to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of outstanding PAYE, PRSI and VAT payments.</P>
    <P>It is as well to reflect that this is not the first occasion on which Mr. McLoughlin has been involved in a publishing venture which has failed in the most doubtful of circumstances.  It might be of interest to remember that seven years ago the same individual was the owner of the Creation Publishing Group which closed, again with considerable job losses.  On that occasion also employees were left without moneys due to them.  On that occasion also moneys due to the Revenue Commissioners were not paid.  It appears that no attempt was made in the intervening years to clear these debts, debts to the State of approximately £250,000. It is deplorable that Mr. McLoughlin <Col N="632" /> should have been allowed to repeat the same exercise with the <i>Daily News</i> and <i>The Sunday Tribune.</i>  Because of Mr. McLoughlin's track record I would have thought that the Government particularly &mdash; in relation to overseeing the operation of companies &mdash; would have looked very sceptically at this operation. Indeed before the <i>Daily News</i> commenced publication &mdash; again because of his track record &mdash; the trade unions involved sought certain guarantees from him to the effect that there would be sufficient funds available to operate both the <i>Daily News</i> and <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> over a reasonable period of time.  A trade union representative was given to understand that a sum of £400,000 was available in cash from Northern Bank Finance Limited, through a mortgage on unit 10 of Sandyford Industrial Estate, and that property to the value of an additional £800,000 would be available also as collateral. Mr. McLoughlin also gave assurances that there would be a 21-month minimal trial of the new publication.  As the <i>Daily News</i> lasted for 15 issues only it is clear to any objective outsider either that Mr. McLoughlin seriously misled the union representatives and personnel involved or changed his mind about the viability of the project and failed to inform the unions.  Whatever may have been the motives Mr. McLoughlin has shown total disregard for the rights and interests of his employees and must be condemned without reservation by any right-minded person.</P>
    <P>It appears at the time that Mr. McLoughlin was attempting unsuccessfully to sell the two titles to a Mr. Robert Maxwell, a British businessman.  Those of us who take an interest in media matters are well aware of the pedigree of the same Mr. Maxwell.  For example, in 1970 a British Board of Trade investigation into the relationship between two companies owned by Mr. Maxwell &mdash; Pergamon Press and Leasco Limited &mdash; described Mr. Maxwell, in cold hard print, as being not fit to run a public company.  I understand that Mr. Maxwell has stated in the media recently that he is not prepared to pursue the question of acquisition of these two titles.  I am very <Col N="633" /> glad to hear that.  I am sure the employees and unions involved &mdash; anxious though they may be to salvage jobs &mdash; would find it extremely difficult to accept somebody of the reputation of Mr. Maxwell.</P>
    <P>The facts I have outlined here to the House merit urgent and serious investigation by the Minister.  I would ask the Minister to instruct the Fraud Squad to investigate all the circumstances.  The time is well overdue for the Government to take immediate measures to prevent the disposal of the two titles without absolute, copper fastened guarantees that the wages owed to staff will be paid, their jobs guaranteed and the debts to the Revenue Commissioners cleared. That is a prerequisite and I formally request that the Fraud Squad be brought in as a matter of urgency to investigate the operation and the collapse of the two newspapers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment on this his first formal appearance in the House.  I am indebted to Deputy Gallagher for sharing his time with me on this important topic.  On behalf of the Labour Party I should like to state that we share his concern and the demands that have been made for an immediate investigation into the background of the situation with regard to the employees of the <i>Daily News</i> and <i>The Sunday Tribune.</i> In the brief time at my disposal I should like to put as succinctly as possible the feelings of the Labour Party with regard to what has happened.  The individual at the root of this problem represents to me probably one of the most despicable of the new class in Ireland that has, unfortunately, been frequently granted the adulation of the public and, sometimes, the people working in the media, a new form of buccaneer capitalism who invests money for purely speculative return.  In so doing that person pursues that speculative profit across the bodies of employees relentlessly and without feeling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point I should like to make is that the actions that have created this problem are of a class of actions that have crushed families and workers previously. It is a reprehensible type of behaviour <Col N="634" /> and I am glad that the focus is being turned on it tonight.  I agree with Deputy Gallagher on what usually happens in a case like this.  There are the bounced cheques and the unpaid revenues due to the State.  They are all of a type that usually follow this kind of operation.  I remember once when cheques were bouncing for employees of a closed firm and I asked a man who works in the State service why he did not pursue people more and his reply was that he could waste one whole day but the person would only get a small fine.  In this respect the law clearly indicates what the preferences of the society have been, to protect the companies and money and not to protect individuals.  It is interesting to contrast the breaches in relation to such things as shoplifting and the sanctions, if any, that will be brought to bear on the individual who has ruined the lives of people in this matter.</P>
    <P>The second point I should like to make concerns the ethics of this type of operation, the idea that individuals without resources can set up paper corporations and on the basis of that issue contracts which have no meaning in fact.  When I say that I mean that there is no material basis that those contracts will ever be fulfilled.  Those contracts are given to individuals in good faith but they in turn are broken.  That calls into question the whole nature of the law in this regard.  I have no doubt that the editor of one of the newspapers &mdash; I read the interview with him &mdash; entered into contractual arrangements in good faith.  I am equally in no doubt that the other side of that contract, the person who was providing the speculative money, had every intention if the venture worked of taking profit and if it did not work abandoning the implications which are usual in contractual relationships.  It is in that sense that I think the ethics &mdash; the activities are those of a reprehensible form of buccaneer capitalism &mdash; are those of the sewer. They are an invitation to enter into contract and then to welsh on it.</P>
    <P>Another point which is important and goes far beyond the matter of the unpaid salaries to which I have referred is the <Col N="635" /> question of inviting people at a stage of their professional competence and practice to leave other jobs and occupations and enter contracts in good faith on what they feel to be the development of their means to make a livelihood and then suddenly, abandon over a weekend those people and tell them: &ldquo;Now, resume where you were.&rdquo;  It is indicative of what is happening in our economy.  That has been a response which has been usual, unfortunately in a number of closures towards employees.  I hope the investigative procedures go ahead.  There is also the question as to the appropriateness of the people to run a newspaper.</P>
    <P>There is the general principle about the weakness of company law in this respect and in relation to that there is no point in saying that yet again our hands are tied and there is only so much we can do.  The fact of the matter is that the Vraderling Directive of the European Parliament emphasises the rights of employees to have access to full information about the ventures in which they find themselves seeking to make their livelihood.</P>
    <P>Beyond all this there is the question of the two newspapers concerned.  I have my own views about the aesthetic standards that seem to have been pursued in relation to the <i>Daily News</i> but they are minor by comparison with the rights of employees to have time to test the market for a new newspaper.  I believe <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> was a quality newspaper that sought to achieve things in the newspaper world which were welcome in Irish journalism. I wonder when employees who work for a newspaper like <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> are abandoned &mdash; I hope that the purpose of raising this matter on the Adjournment is that it will not be abandoned &mdash; what type of space is left in the Irish newspaper world.  We will see in the other newspapers people in the business for exactly the same reason in at least one for purely speculative purposes.  It is tragic when we see speculative chancers playing havoc with the livelihoods of people who want to improve the standards of journalism in Ireland.  The position of the Labour Party is that we condemn <Col N="636" /> this behaviour in general and in the specific instance raised by Deputy Gallagher we condemn it in particular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Higgins of the Labour Party and Deputy Gallagher in expressing solidarity with the journalists and workers involved in the newspapers concerned.  They have been treated in a despicable and unprincipled manner.  I am in a unique position in one sense in that when one of the newspapers was being launched one of the journalists asked me to make a small contribution that might in some way contribute to the success of the newspapers.  I was anxious not to do anything that would conflict with the NUJ or trade union regulations in regard to journalists and I agreed on the basis that I might aid one of the newspapers.  This country needs more newspapers of the calibre of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and <i>Daily News.</i>  I regret the way those newspapers have been allowed to slip because they could have made a great contribution.  I hope the Minister when replying will deal with the difficult situation in regard to company law.  I hope the changes we consider necessary arising from this matter will be introduced to ensure that we do not have such occurrences again.  An individual should not be permitted to treat workers, irrespective of who they are, in such a despicable way.  I am pleased that I have had an opportunity of expressing my solidarity with the workers and I join with other Members in calling for action and assistance on their behalf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the abhorrence and concern of the Deputies who spoke in relation to the recent events in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and the <i>Daily News.</i>  I read both newspapers.  I have been a reader of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> since it was first printed.  The editor of the <i>Daily News</i> was born in my constituency and the editor of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> had the good sense to marry a girl from my constituency. Apart from the quality of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and the different market the <i>Daily News</i> was aiming for I had an interest in the process of both newspapers. I, like the other people who spoke tonight, share the concern of the employees of both newspapers.</P>
      <P>The establishment of those newspapers resulted from decisions by private interests and did not involve or require any prior consultation with the Minister for Industry and Energy.  Similarly, the decision to cease activity did not require any notification to the Minister.  The setting up of those papers did not involve any assistance from any of the State agencies for which the Minister is responsible.</P>
      <P>The special position of newspapers in our society is recognised and taken specially into account under the provisions of the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies Order, 1979.  This order was made by the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism and it requires the notification of any takeover proposal involving a newspaper.  Its purpose is to guard against any undesirable trend towards concentration in the control of existing newspapers.  Such proposals would require clearance by the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of Deputy Gallagher's fine address was related to the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism rather than to the Minister for Industry and Energy.  Everything the Deputy said related to that Department.  The Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism is the Minister concerned with the Companies Act.  Deputy Gallagher mentioned the Fraud Squad being brought in to look into the situation.  Clearly the ethics and actions of Mr. McLaughlin are questionable, undesirable and perhaps, as Deputy <Col N="638" /> Higgins said, &ldquo;despicable&rdquo; is a better word.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it is not a matter in which I have any function.  When I knew what was to be discussed here this evening I had a discussion with the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism about having this matter examined.  It is clearly wrong to have a situation whereby, whether individuals have resources or have not any, people should be duped, as they undoubtedly were on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Mr. McLaughlin produced certified documentation some weeks ago to the editor of the <i>Daily News,</i> the NUJ and other people associated with the launching of the newspaper that he had £600,000 accommodation available from three different banks.  He argued that this, coupled with the cash flow from sales and advertising, would adequately fund the <i>Daily News</i> for a reasonable launch period of from six to 12 months.  This documentation in regard to bank accommodation was certified by the bank's solicitors and was secured in two cases on two factory premises in south Dublin. Those who acted on sight of this documentation did not anticipate that Mr. McLaughlin would refuse to draw on these available funds.  It is for him to answer why he so acted.</P>
    <P>The salient facts are that after 15 issues the <i>Daily News</i> had settled down to a base of approximately 80,000 copies a day and a market survey shows that this base was consistent with success.  However, to move the base from 80,000 to 100,000 copies per day, a circulation which would have made the project very viable, funds for the promotion and development of the package would have been necessary.  These funds of £600,000, which everybody was assured would be available, plus the revenue from circulation &mdash; approximately £10,000 per day at the time of the closure &mdash; would have made possible the goal to drive the circulation up to 100,000 copies.  There is no doubt that this goal could have been achieved and the <i>Daily News</i> would have been a successful paper.</P>
    <P>I agree that in future if we have situations like this Governments should have <Col N="639" /> a look at such promotions to ensure that when financial accommodation is available, as in this instance, those concerns should be legally obliged to draw on that accommodation.  That involves the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism rather than the Minister for Industry and Energy.  I have already spoken to him about this matter.  Deputy Higgins implied that the resources were not there. Of the £600,000 Mr. McLaughlin had available, approximately £60,000 was expended on that newspaper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The resources were stripped from one newspaper to be put towards the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  The debts were not known to the staff and the people who accepted what Mr. McLaughlin had told them.  The Smurfit group are owed in the region of £900,000 for printing.  I understand that Mr. McLaughlin is a debtor for something like £700,000.  There are a number of other creditors.  Many of the best journalists in the country left good, secure employment in other newspapers because of what they saw in the development <Col N="640" /> of these two newspapers, particularly the latter, which did not get a great opportunity when one considers the amount of time it was allowed to develop. There were about 150 employees in both newspapers.  In the <i>Daily News</i> there were about 80.  About 20 per cent of those 80 left secure employment in other newspapers, a top-class bunch of journalists who did not draw any salaries for the time the paper was in operation.  In fact, they paid their expenses out of their own pockets in the belief they were with a viable operation.  It was a despicable act that within a couple of days of receiving their first pay cheques the plug was pulled from the operation.</P>
      <P>I share the apprehension of the other speakers.  The arresting of any future situations which may occur should be directed to the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  It is undesirable that this should happen.  I hope that the employees involved, who have given their skills to these newspapers, will find a future in other newspapers in the country.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 3 November 1982.</P>

      <P>The information available in my Department regarding the number of unfilled permanent posts in local authorities is related to the position at the end of each calendar year, the latest year for which figures are available being 31 December, 1981.  There is no information in my Department regarding the length of time each such post may have remained unfilled.  It is assumed that the Deputy's reference to permanent posts relates to officer posts only.

      <P>I understand that there have been local demands for increased Garda strength particularly at Tallow.</P>
      <P>The position is that the detailed deployment of Garda manpower is a matter to be decided primarily by the Garda authorities.  The authorities have informed me that the current strength assigned to the stations in the west Waterford area is the maximum that can be provided at present having regard to overall resources and other demands on Garda services.</P>
      <P>I understand that, while the strength at Tallow station was reduced by one Garda earlier this year, the current overall strength in the Dungarvan District shows an increase of one over the strength on 31 December, 1981.  The Divisional Officer proposes to allocate an additional Garda to Tallow as soon as circumstances permit and it can be taken that the police needs of the district as a whole will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>As the plan itself provides sufficient information to enable its thrust and underlying policies to be assessed I do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by providing the information sought in these questions. Medium-term projections of their nature must be flexible enough to allow of modification from time to time in the light of extraneous developments in the economy, interest rates, the public finances, etc.  Detailed elaboration of the plan figures would not be compatible with this requirement.</P>

      <P>In relation to table 5, chapter 3, there are no comprehensive statistics available for job gains and job losses in the economy. Official annual employment estimates are prepared for mid-April of each year from which estimates of the net change in employment in the previous year can be derived.  On that basis the following tabular statement sets out the estimated net change in employment in each year in the period 1960 to 1980, the latest date for which comprehensive statistics are available.</P>

    <P>* It should be noted that the estimates for 1975 onwards are based on the results of the bi-annual series of labour force surveys initiated in that year whereas the estimates for the period prior to 1975 are based on census of population results with estimates for inter-censal years based on trend indicators.  As the labour force survey involves a number of differences in methodology and in definitions which affect the measurement of the labour force, the survey results are not strictly comparable to the census based figures.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Table 1 of Chapter IV</P>
    <P>Due to the considerable changes over the years in the classification of expenditure as capital or current, it is regretted that it is not possible to give the Deputy a functional breakdown of public capital expenditure for the years 1960 to 1982.  Production of such a breakdown would involve many weeks of research and it is not considered that the cost of this would be justified at the present time.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state in relation to the Government's White Paper <i>The Way Forward</i> which was published on Thursday, 21 October 1982, which of the two investment levels of £970 million and <Col N="456" /> £1,200 million mentioned in connection with telecommunications has been assumed for the purposes of the plan; what proportion of the investment capital it has been assumed will be raised from private sources; and, throughout the plan period, the level of telecommunications investment under the auspices of the Public Capital Programme the Government envisage being undertaken in each of the years 1983-87, inclusive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in Chapter VIII, it was assumed that the appropriate level of investment would be within the range of £970 million to £1,200 million for the period 1983-87.  The Public Capital Programme and global contingency provision allocations included in Chapter IV, Table 1, allow for such a range.</P>
      <P>With regard to the financing of the telecommunications programme it is proposed, as indicated in Chapter VIII, that an appreciable amount will be raised from private sources.  The level of average annual investment envisaged for the years 1983-87 inclusive is in the range of £194 million to £240 million at 1983 prices.</P>

      <P>Wage cost competitiveness was only one of the factors which were taken into account in estimating the employment projection in the plan.  Other factors included the growth in Irish export markets, the development measures proposed and the ability of the traded-goods sector to take advantage of the more favourable trading environment.  It would be unrealistic to attempt to separate from the total estimated effect of these factors the employment impact of each one per cent gain in competitiveness.</P>

      <P>The opening current budget deficit for 1983 will as usual be set out in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure which will be published shortly before the 1983 budget is introduced.  The opening position will, <i>inter alia</i>, depend on policy decisions and measures already taken, or to be taken, by the Government so as to ensure that the objectives of the plan for 1983 are realised.  As regards the tax revenue projections, these were based generally on the 1982 budget Estimates adjusted, <i>inter alia</i>, for emerging shortfalls the broad details of which have already been indicated to the Deputy in reply to a parliamentary question on 28 October 1982.</P>

It should be noted that the estimates for 1975 onwards are based on the results of the bi-annual series of labour force surveys initiated in that year whereas the estimates for the period prior to 1975 are based on census of population results with estimates for inter censal years based on trend indicators.  As the labour force survey involves a number of differences in methodology and in definitions which effect the measurement of the labour force, the survey results are not strictly comparable with the census based figures.</P>

      <P>As regards 1 (a) the position is that the estimated full year cost to the Exchequer pay and pensions bill of special pay increases which have been implemented in 1982 is £8 million. This covers adjudication findings and negotiated settlements implemented in 1982.</P>
      <P>As regards 1 (b), it is not possible, without detailed examination by Departments, to say what increases are in course of negotiations at any partucular date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards 1(c), since in many cases the staff side put forward multiple arguments in support of their claims it is not possible without the expenditure of an inordinate amount of time to say what agreements or adjudications are likely to arise directly &mdash; and what indirectly &mdash; from negotiations under 1(a) and 1(b) because of comparability or relativity. The full year cost of all special increases which might have been expected to have arisen in the ordinary way up to end 1983 &mdash;whether on comparability grounds or otherwise&mdash;is estimated in round terms at £250 million.  If the draft proposals for amending the Public Service Pay Agreement <Col N="467" /> are implemented, the estimated additions to the annual pay bill in 1983 and 1984 &mdash; over and above the previous years figure in each case&mdash;in respect of these increases will be: 1983, £28 million &mdash;including £13 million in respect of increases deferred from 1982 &mdash; 1984, £65 million.</P>
    <P>The draft proposals provide that the parties shall meet at the request of either side in 1983 to discuss certain specified aspects of special increases in the light of the then existing economic situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>The Way Forward</i> stated as follows in paragraph 9 of Chapter III:</P>
      <P>Excluding carry-over effects from 1982, the Exchequer pay bill will have to be contained to an average growth rate of 5 per cent a year to 1986 inclusive of general and special pay increases.</P>
      <P>It will be noted that no specific commitment was made in relation to 1983.  The 5 per cent related to an annual average for the period to 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incorrect to speak of a £60 million pay increase allocation having been already negotiated between the Government and the public service trade unions. The position is that draft proposals arrived at between representatives of the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and myself for amending the Public Service Pay Agreement are at present being considered by the trade unions concerned who will, I <Col N="468" /> understand, make their response at a meeting of the Public Services Committee on 10 November 1982.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost in 1983 of the proposals under consideration by the public service trade unions contains a significant element in respect of special increases payable from 1 October 1983.  This element would be subsumed in such growth during 1983 of the Exchequer Pay Bill as is consistent with the average growth rate to 1986 as envisaged in the Government's document.</P>

      <P>It is planned to provide a new digital exchange at Clondalkin next year to replace the existing exchanges there.  This should result in a substantial improvement of service in the area.  In the meantime every effort is being made to provide the best possible standard of service with the existing equipment.</P>

      <P>(b)  23 February to 29 March 1982.</P>
      <P>He was not entitled to payment initially on these claims as he had not sufficient contributions to his credit to qualify him for benefit.  Following inquiries, however, it was established that he had additional contributions which served to qualify him for payment.  All benefit due on the claims was paid by cheques which issued on 25 March, 29 March and 14 April 1982.  The payments were at the maximum rate appropriate to a married man with five children.</P>
      <P>The claimant had a number of subsequent claims on which payment was not made to him in full because of a request for separate payment by his wife, in respect of herself and five qualified children. It was necessary to have this matter investigated by an inspector before a decision could be made regarding the claimant's entitlement.  On completion of the inquiries all benefit due to the claimant at the maximum personal rate on these claims was issued.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit from 4 March 1981 following an accident at work.  Before payment could be allowed it was necessary to make inquiries as to the nature and origin of the incapacity.  On completion of these inquiries it was accepted that the incapacity was due to an occupational injury and a cheque paying all injury benefit <Col N="506" /> due for the statutory period of 26 weeks from the date of the accident was issued on 29 April 1982.</P>
      <P>From 1 September 1981 the claim was treated as one for disability benefit.  As the claimant had not the required minimum of 26 paid or credited contributions in the governing contribution year 1979-80 he was not entitled to payment of benefit.  According to the records of the Department he had 25 contributions in the period.  As a result of inquiries, however, it was recently established that the claimant had an additional three contributions which qualified him for benefit from that date.</P>
      <P>Payment of all disability benefit due for the period of 52 weeks from 2 September 1981 to 31 August 1982 was made on 7 October 1982.</P>
      <P>The claimant is not entitled to payment from 2 September 1982 as he has not sufficient contributions since his entry into insurance to entitle him to payment beyond a period of 52 weeks.  According to the records of the Department he has only a total of 49 contributions.  In order to requalify for payment of disability benefit he would require a further 13 weeks of insurable employment.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 26 March 1981 and was paid for 52 weeks to 27 March 1982. He was not entitled to further payment as he had not the required minimum of 26 paid or credited contributions in the contribution year 1980-81 which governed his claim from 29 March 1982. According to the records of the Department he had only 11 contributions in that period.</P>
      <P>When the position was explained to the claimant he stated that his illness had commenced in May 1980.  As he was not in a position to furnish medical evidence of incapacity from that date it was necessary to have inquiries made locally by an inspector of the Department with a view to establishing the nature and duration of the incapacity.  These inquiries were completed only recently and it has been decided on the basis of the inspector's report to award credited contributions for the period May 1980 to March 1981.  The additional contributions entitle the claimant to payment of benefit from 29 March 1982.</P>
      <P>Payment of all benefit due for the period 29 March to 6 November 1982, less the amount of suplementary welfare allowance advanced, was made on 29 October 1982.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy if he will provide in relation to the Government's White Paper <i>The Way Forward,</i> which was published on Thursday, 21st October, 1982 a breakdown of the spare plant capacity of the ESB in each of the years 1977 to 1981, indicating the level of supply and demand in each year upon which the calculations are made, together with <Col N="514" /> similar figures for the years 1982 to 1987 on the basis of investment currently under way or in respect of which commitments have been entered into; and if he will state for each year the percentage by which electricity costs have been or are likely to be higher than if spare capacity had been kept to the minimum level consonant with security of supply, indicating what that level is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">

      <P>Table 1 sets out for each of the years ended 31 March, 1977 to 1982 (1) total generating capacity, (2) peak demand, (3) the proportionate excess of total generating capacity over peak demand, (4) volume of sales and (5) year on year growth in volume of sales.  Table 2 sets out the annual additions to plant capacity under present plans up to 1987. The measurement of actual spare capacity and its consequential cost is difficult and must have regard to an appropriate margin of capacity over projected demand in order to provide for routine maintenance, accidental outtages, availability of fuel as well as an element of security from fuel supply constraints.</P>
      <P>As mentioned in paragraph 24 of the National Economic Plan (1983-1987), the Government are concerned about the cost to the consumer of both present and prospective levels of capacity.  An examination of all ESB costs has been instituted with a view to reducing the present high levels of the ESB's borrowings. Obviously this review will have regard to whether, taking into account the factors mentioned above, overcapacity exists at present and, if so, what its level is and its cost in terms of operating and capital servicing; what can be done in terms of the reduction of total capacity (by, say, closing older, inefficient plant). It will be appreciated, therefore, that the particular data sought by the Deputy is not available.</P>
      <P>In regard to electricity prices generally, the Government have decided that a review should be conducted into the reasons for high electricity prices.  The terms of reference of this review, and the composition of the review group, are at present being settled.</P>

The design for the proposed Ballyglass-Fiddane group water scheme, County Galway, has been approved by my Department and by Galway County Council.  Work may go ahead on the scheme provided the necessary insurance and road opening licence have been obtained.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Brady,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dublin South-East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 600 and 601 together.</P>
      <P>County Dublin Vocational Education Committee were given official sanction in 1973 for a new school in Lucan to replace their existing school.  The committee subsequently acquired a site in the Esker area and appointed consultants for the project which has reached the outline sketch scheme stage.  Such school would not be ready for the admission of pupils until September 1985 at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Representations have been made to former Ministers for Education that the school to be provided should be a community school rather than a school administered by the Vocational Education Committee.  The former Minister for Education, Mr. John Boland, T.D., met a deputation in this connection on 26 January 1982 and drew their attention to the fact that the Vocational Education Committee had been given sanction to build the school, had appointed consultants and had commenced the planning of the project.  The Minister subsequently sent a letter to this effect to Deputies Mitchell, Burke and Fleming, on 10 February 1982.</P>
      <P>I am having the representations from the residents given further consideration in my Department and the question is being considered whether, in the context of the anticipated growth in the school-going population in the general area, a more satisfactory arrangement would be two medium sized schools rather than one large sized school to accommodate a number of pupils in excess of 700.  Such review of the matter will be expedited as much as possible.</P>
