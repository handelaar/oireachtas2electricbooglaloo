    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the extent to which the social partners are being officially consulted on the objectives and strategies of the National Economic Plan.</P>

    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the achievement of full employment will figure as the predominant policy objective of the National Economic Plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>It is intended to publish the National Economic Plan within three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preparation of the plan is the responsibility of a Government committee, under my chairmanship, to which a <Col N="658" /> steering group consisting of departmental representatives and experts will report. Relevant Departments and State agencies are involved in the preparation of the plan.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federated Union of Employers, the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Irish Farmers' Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, and the National Economic and Social Council have been consulted and will continue to be consulted in the preparation of the plan.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the National Economic Plan, as I indicated in my speech on 5 May on the budget debate, will include:</P>
    <P>(1) the generation of the maximum increase in sustainable employment; (2) the restoration of the balance of payments to more acceptable levels; (3) the reduction of the rate of inflation; (4) the maintenance of living standards and making them more equitable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach inform the House if it is true that unemployment rose by 40 per cent during his last short term as Taoiseach and if he will assure the House that he will take every step, in preparing this economic plan, to see that there is no repeat of that performance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were a member of a party who subscribed to the last Coalition Government I would be very reluctant even to mention unemployment in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is 40 per cent accurate? Please answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there will be considerable concern, on the part of the National Youth Council and other bodies representing young people, at his omission from the list of social partners consulting and to be consulted of these bodies who, when we were in Government it was agreed would become full social partners with the same <Col N="659" /> right of consultation as the others which he mentioned?  Does he not accept that the dropping of the youth bodies as social partners is a retrograde step?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misreading the situation.  I have always, as Taoiseach, made it a permanent feature of my activities to meet with the representatives of the youth organisations and discuss fully with them any matters of concern to them.  I will continue to do that.  Anybody involved who would wish to make any submissions in regard to the economic plan which is being prepared is, of course, welcome to do so.  However, in order to get work under way we have to make an approach to a number of specific organisations with a view to consulting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not accept that this is a step backwards? What he has now said makes one feel that the omission of these bodies from consultation is deliberate and that they are simply to be relegated to other miscellaneous groups who may, if they so wish, make submissions.  This is something which will give rise to intense dissatisfaction among young people whose interests are not represented by the various interest groups which the Taoiseach has mentioned.  Will he reconsider his decision and consider entering into full consultation with them regarding the plan, as it is they who, above all, are concerned with the plan and its consequences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a well established practice of full consultation with representatives of youth organisations in regard to all matters of economic and social importance and will continue to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Other than the plan, which is the one the Taoiseach alleges is important?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask two questions? Firstly, will the plan, in terms of its philosophical approach to the economic management of our economy, be significantly <Col N="660" /> different from previous plans published by the Fianna Fáil administration?  If the answer to that question is in the affirmative, could the Taoiseach indicate in which way specifically, with particular reference to the direction of financial institutions in our society?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the plan, on the preparation of which we are engaged at present, must differ significantly from previous plans in that circumstances have radically altered. For instance, I am sure the Deputy will recall that the First Programme for Economic Expansion set a very modest target of a 2 per cent increase in gross national product.  A figure of that sort would hardly be relevant to our circumstances today.  The major difference is that the plan which we are preparing now will be directly related to current circumstances and conditions and current needs and requirements.  The Deputy also asked about financial institutions.  Our financial situation and the public finances will be an integral part of the plan, and arrangements have been made for full consultation in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's reply and his association of the suggested plan with previous programmes, perhaps he would tell the House how it will qualitively differ from previous programmes and, if it is a programme that is similar to the others in methodology, why is it being called a plan?  If it is being called a plan, will it list social objectives that the first programme to which the Taoiseach has alluded did not state?  Will it have a statement as to the combination of resources and likely outcomes that we might expect in a plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go too much further into details at this stage, except perhaps to repeat for the Deputy what I gave as the broad outline objectives of the plan, namely, the generation of the maximum increase in sustainable employment, the restoration of the balance of payments to more acceptable levels, reduction in the rate of inflation and <Col N="661" /> maintenance of living standards and making them more equitable.  I have already explained that this is a short- or medium-term plan to try to deal with the immediate problems confronting us and, at the same time and in parallel, we will be preparing long-term planning structures which would probably be a more appropriate place in which to incorporate the Deputy's suggestion about social requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe for one moment that this plan will be any more successful than their plan for full employment in the 1977 manifesto? Is the Taoiseach further aware that in 1977 when there were 103,000 unemployed, the Fianna Fáil manifesto promised to reduce unemployment in the next four years by 80,000?  If Fianna Fáil had kept their promise, there would have been only 23,000 people unemployed in 1981 when we took office.  Is the Taoiseach further aware that there were 127,000 people unemployed and that they were 100,000 out in their promise at that time?  Can the Taoiseach say what he intends to do now to ensure full employment for all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why Deputy O'Donoghue is Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our entire approach to economic planning is based on the need to invest in this country, to raise the level of economic activity and provide increased employment opportunities for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Taoiseach not raise the level of economic opportunities from 1977 to 1981 when he had a majority of 20 in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be unaware of the fact that in recent years there has been an economic depression, unprecedented in its extent and intensity, and unemployment figures for the OECD area at present represent the seriousness of that economic recession.  Our economic planning and endeavours are directed towards bringing this country as <Col N="662" /> safely as possible through that economic recession, and we are achieving considerable success in those endeavours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not reply to the question.  Could he tell us if, despite the fact that 25,000 people were taken into the public service for jobs which did not really exist, the 40 per cent figure I quoted for the increase in unemployment during his period in office is accurate?  If so, what special steps does he intend to take in this economic plan to prevent a recurrence of that outrageous performance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously we cannot have a reply.  The Taoiseach referred to investment as being the solution to the problems of unemployment and growth. Is the Taoiseach not aware that, despite the fact that during the period of the Fianna Fáil administration the ratio of our national output devoted to investment was one of the highest among developed countries, nevertheless, during that period unemployment rose very sharply? Does this not suggest that the quality of investment during the period of Fianna Fáil Government must have been extremely poor if it yielded such a negative return?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that we have such a high rate of investment &mdash; probably the highest in the OECD area next to Japan &mdash; is something we should value. It is important that we should continue to pursue high investment programmes.  I am somewhat puzzled by the approach of Deputies to these questions and to my outlining of our efforts.  We are endeavouring to have some sort of coherent approach and an organised effort to deal with current economic problems.  I imagine that Deputies on all sides of the House would welcome our efforts in this regard.  I have endeavoured to give the House as much information as I can about how we are going about the preparation of the plan and it would not be unreasonable to expect some encouraging support from Deputies or at least some constructive suggestions in regard to the plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the House be correct in assuming that this Government's approach will not be significantly different from that of previous Government in relation to the degree of State control of natural and financial resources, that the exercise the Taoiseach is currently embarking on is similar to what could be described as indicative programming, and that the State, under his direction, will not take full charge of financial institutions and direct investment in a positive, planned manner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the plan on which we are engaged at present will be more than indicative.  I want to assure the Deputy that we regard the financial aspects of the plan as being of considerable importance and we are arranging to have an input to the plan from financial institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach consider when circulating his speech, which I found interesting but factually off target, bringing to the attention of Members, particularly those of his own party, policies of the Grattan Parliament in our relationship with Great Britain, which I consider to be of paramount importance, namely, political independence, economic union, monetary stability and free trade?  Does the Taoiseach consider those four principles outlined by the Grattan administration to be as relevant today as they were then, and would the Taoiseach care to comment on them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said a great deal about my view of Grattan as an individual, a statesman and politician and of the lessons we have inherited from Grattan's Parliament and the contribution Grattan's Parliament made to the evolution of the Irish nation.  I do not think I have any further comment to make at this stage.  I am preparing a very learned article on the subject and I will send the Deputy a copy of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of dental and optical benefits for the spouses of insured workers is under consideration in my Department but it is too early as yet to say when this can be done.  I will, however, be pressing ahead with the matter as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>When he is faced with these questions, when will the Minister discard this mickey mouse approach to this issue?  During election after election the Fianna Fáil operators have been saying this will be a priority which can be instituted at a stroke of a pen.  Now the Minister comes in here once more with a lot of waffle which is being repeated in the Dublin West by-election campaign. He is being run out of the place, quite rightly.  The question is if the Minister would tell the House precisely when he intends to bring legislation before the House without any further waffle.  I want the Minister to know that I intend to circulate this reply in the Dublin West <Col N="668" /> constituency.  Let us have the Minister's answer to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My first task on assuming duty as Minister was to restore the level of services which had been severely cut by my predecessor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The dental schemes throughout the country had been savaged by the former Government.  They were severely cut back.  If the Deputy wants to see the figures in relation to the schemes I will show them to him gladly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has only to call to one of the health boards and he will see that their estimates were severely cut.  My first task on assuming duty was to get some additional funds.  From the incoming Government I got funds which enabled me to restore the level of service. Having done so, I am now in a position to proceed and I have invited the Irish Dental Association to meet me to consider various arrangements necessary to implement the provisions of the extension of the dental schemes to the spouses of insured workers.  This will involve a number of aspects, particularly the supply of dentists.  At their annual general meeting the Irish Dental Association said they will be quite happy to discuss with me the broad development of the scheme.  Incidentally, I never said that at a stroke of a pen dentists could be manufactured throughout the country.  I am afraid the Deputy is not aware of the realities of the situation.  When I was Minister previously I undertook this development and now that I am back in office I have been given a further opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are people in Donegal who fall into the category mentioned in Question No. 8 who have been waiting for five or six years for dental treatment?  Is he seriously <Col N="669" /> suggesting that Deputy Eileen Desmond as Minister was responsible for the delay?  Is he aware that there are children who have moved from national schools to secondary schools, some of them have grown to adult life, who qualified under the scheme but who never got treatment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is mistaken in regard to the scheme.  I am asked about a scheme that would provide dental and optical benefits for wives of insured workers.  That is not provided under any scheme at present and therefore there could not be any question about it being currently applied in Donegal or anywhere else.  The Deputy is confusing the medical card scheme with the suggestion that this scheme be extended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason for the disparity in the treatment of unmarried mothers, in so far as their allowance is subject to means testing, if the child's father voluntarily gives financial support but is not means tested if such support is as a result of a court order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Any payment made to an unmarried mother by the child's father as a result of a court order, which specifically allocates the money to the child, is disregarded in the assessment of means for the purpose of entitlement to unmarried mother's allowance.</P>
      <P>Where a payment made by the father, otherwise than as a result of court proceedings, does not specifically allocate the money to the child, it has been the practice to assess portion of the payment as means of the mother.  Following representations from groups representing unmarried mothers I am having this practice reconsidered by my Department with a view to having the entire contribution in such cases disregarded as means for the purpose of unmarried mother's allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Is the Minister aware that, even when there is agreement that the father should contribute to the child, unmarried mothers are actually availing of free legal aid and going to court to get court orders to maintain the children so that the Minister's <Col N="671" /> Department will disregard this payment in the means tests?  Is the Minister aware of the full implications of the anomaly in this scheme whereby the Department takes account of payments made voluntarily by agreement by the father but do not take into account payments made on foot of a court order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that in virtually all cases the courts allocate maintenance solely to the child and consequently it is as the Deputy suggests.  It is because of this situation that it is proposed to amend the prevailing practice in relation to the assessment of means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick-East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick-East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> What is the exact nature of the commitment that the Minister is giving now?  Is he going to have a look at it or is he saying he is going to change the practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that I am having it reconsidered within the Department with a view to having the entire contribution in such cases disregarded for means purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Has the Minister issued a specific instruction to his Department to disallow payments such as this in means testing for the unmarried mothers' allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Currently I am having the practice reviewed in conjuction with the appeals officers with a view to making that arrangement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is still a bit vague.  Has the Minister actually taken the decision to disregard such payments in the future or is he thinking about it?  Has the Minister issued an instruction? Where do we stand on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fairly clear from what I have said that I am having the practice reconsidered in conjunction with the appeals officer with a view to having the entire contribution in such cases disregarded. That makes the position clear enough.</P>

        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> Has the Minister any information from the free legal aid centres as to the extent of the problem I am raising where there is agreement and mothers are still processing claims through the courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that in all cases the courts award the payment solely to the children.  I am not aware of the actual statistics in relation to the putting of appeals through courts for that reason. But I accept what the Deputy says.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have allowed five supplementaries.  We have arrived at a stage where I will gladly continue if the House agrees to give longer time for Questions.  We cannot continue as we are.  I would suggest that Deputies bring this to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges because a lot more time should be given to the answering of questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he intends examining the anomaly in the administration of social welfare payments where only the wives of those prisoners serving over six months are entitled to prisoners' wives allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation governing the prisoners' wives allowances scheme which was introduced in 1974, provides for payment of an allowance in respect of the wives and children of prisoners who are sentenced to terms of imprisonment of six months or more.  I have no proposals to alter this statutory provision.</P>
      <P>Wives of prisoners serving short-term sentences who are in need may be eligible for supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that I will be shortly setting up a review group to examine the operation of the Department schemes including the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  I am arranging to have the prisoners' wives allowance scheme reviewed in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say what proportion of prisoners' families are covered <Col N="673" /> by the social welfare payments as they stand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a statistical question for which I do not have the information on file.  If the Deputy puts down such a question I will get him the answer. In fact, I will communicate with the Deputy afterwards if he wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MyraBarry" hpid="Miss M. Barry Miss M. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's intention to give the allowance to all prisoners' wives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention to have the matter considered in the context of the review which has taken place now. There are practical administrative difficulties if the sentence is short because one is involved in issuing a book and there is a long-term arrangement.  So the practicalities would have to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>12.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he has any plans to change the present rules whereby social welfare benefits are calculated on the basis of a six-day week whereas the average working week usually covers only five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>An inter-departmental working group is examining the question of changing from a six-day to a five-day week for the purpose of the calculation of social welfare benefits.  When the recommendations of this group are available the desirability of changing to a five-day week will be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the present arrangement gives an artificial financial incentive to three-day week working in certain industries because it is possible for people to be paid on the basis of a six-day week if they are working a three-day week whereas they are only paid for five if they are working full time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is an anomaly in that respect.  There are also other considerations within the scheme in that there are still industries and sectors <Col N="674" /> where a six-day week is operated. There is also the application of this legislation as it applies at present to the general disability benefit and unemployment benefit and other aspects.  So, in that context, it would obviously not be desirable to apply a reduced week to the disability benefit because it would actually increase the cost to the State in that case.  It is for these various reasons that an inter-departmental working committee was set up and I would hope that they would have their report available fairly soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the inter-departmental working group be established and when does the Minister expect to receive their report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The working group was established on 2 March and has been examining the situation since then.  There were some complications particularly in relation to the proposed payment of £9.60 to housewives which created some difficulty.  They postponed further consideration until that position was clarified and they went back to work subsequently. I expect that they will be reporting in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there are still six working days in the week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In some instances there are six.  For TDs there appear to be seven working days in the week and they appear to be longer than the normal working hours, if that is what the Deputy is referring to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the terms of reference of the review group which he is establishing on the social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="675" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at present considering this matter but I can inform the Deputy that the review group will be examining the operation of the Department schemes as a whole.  This will involve assessing the relevance of the schemes to modern needs and the extent to which schemes such as the social welfare allowance schemes meet their original objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I had anticipated a better answer.  In reply to a number of questions the Minister said that there were to be reviews.  Could he be a little more specific, since the question deals with the nature of the review and he has used reference to a review group as a way out of answering a number of other questions? Is there a review group in existence and, if so, what are they doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply I pointed out what the terms of reference would include.  For example, it will consider the range and nature of existing services provided by the Department of Social Welfare, having regard to the particular objectives and needs to be served in the light of modern developments.  It will consider the need for the removal of anomalies and the rationalisation of services. It will consider the operation of social assistance services, including social assistance allowances provided for deserted wives, unmarried mothers, prisoners wives and single women.  It will consider the manner of delivery of the services, including the organisation of the Department and the operation of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. These are some of the areas it will cover. The Deputy referred to a number of reviews.  Some of these were started by my predecessors and are under way at present.  It is normal to tackle problems by setting up review groups or a working party which would provide the basis for future developments.  Such groups or working parties in the areas of health and social welfare have come up with conclusions very quickly.  The Deputy's comment in that respect was a little unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="676" /> indicate whether he is giving consideration to the operation of a single means test and whether a person on becoming entitled to one benefit through the single means test would automatically be entitled to a number of other benefits? Will the review group consider the possibility of an independent appeals system in the supplementary welfare area, which is necessary and desirable?  Would the Minister admit that the general impression given in the past few days of questioning is that of a Department reviewing everything and producing very little? These reviews are taking a good deal longer than the problems warrant.  The Minister is using the term &ldquo;review&rdquo; to avoid his responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  The question of the appeals will be considered in the context of the review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>My question also related to a single means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will see that that is considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he has initiated a review of the free fuel scheme in order to co-ordinate and improve it on a national scale and to eliminate the possibility of the type of dispute which occurred in the autumn of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in a number of urban areas superior schemes were in operation before the national schemes was introduced?  Certain categories of social welfare beneficiaries were excluded from the national scheme.  Would the Minister ensure that where a superior scheme is in operation it will get financial benefit from the Department and not be downgraded?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>When I introduced the national scheme there were a number of anomalies.  However, I brought it in to cover areas which had no scheme.  It was based on the trial pilot schemes which had been carried out in the Eastern Health Board area.  Urban schemes still have some benefits which are greater than those in the other scheme.  The only question in relation to the anomalies is the cost of removing them.  That is one of the areas that will have to be considered by the review group for next winter's fuel scheme.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister of State to be more specific.  As he is aware, concern has been expressed about this on quite a number of occasions. Would the Minister of State agree that it is a very serious allegation for a medical practitioner to publish in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> that 25 per cent of people in receipt of disability benefit are dossers, the word used by the doctor, the author of the article?  Firstly, would the Minister of State agree with the view expressed by the eminent medical doctor?  If he does agree, will be accept that something needs to be done?

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain that the reason I raise this is that the Minister of State has referred to having referee doctors. As he is well aware, I am not in any position to comment if he is not in the position to do so, but would he agree that one of the points made by Dr. Rynne in <Col N="683" /> his report &mdash; which I gather the Minister of State has read &mdash; is that there are only 15 medical referees in the Department dealing with these applications, notwithstanding the fact that 220,000 certificates are sent to the Department every month and that if that is the case plainly the staff of referee doctors there is inadequate? Also I urge the Minister to make some comment to the House and give some indication of his views on the report.  He is leaving the House in the dark as to whether he accepts the point made by Dr. Rynne.  If it is untrue it should be denied because the doctor has claimed that 25 per cent of claimants of disability benefit are dossers.  I ask the Minister of State to give some response as to whether he accepts that figure as being approximately the case.</P>

I ask the Minister of State either to deny what Dr. Rynne has claimed to be the case or else do something about it.

      <P>Arrangements have been made to supply copies of the statement to the leaders of the parties, in accordance with usual practice, and I will endeavour to get copies for other Members as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Thinking people throughout the world find it difficult to accept that there should be war over the ownership of these islands in the South Atlantic.  It is surely the duty of responsible statemen everywhere to seek to bring hostilities to an end at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it is said that such a war is an anachronism we may in fact be doing an injustice to previous generations who showed more practical sense and wisdom than is being displayed today.  It is both sobering and instructive to recall that slightly over two hundred years ago in 1770 in similar circumstances a dispute over the ownership of the Falkland or Malvinas islands almost caused a major <Col N="799" /> European war, which was only prevented by the exercise of firm and wise statesmanship.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government have from the outset regarded the armed intervention by Argentina in the Falkland Islands as contrary to the rule of law.  Disputes between nations, of which there are many around the world, cannot be solved by the recourse to force.  The principles of the rule of law, and the peaceful settlement of disputes must be upheld.  We are all anxiously aware of the fact that there are many places around the world where the use of force could quickly result in the holocaust of a world war.</P>
    <P>We have deliberately refrained in present circumstances from taking a position on the issues involved.  Territorial rights cannot be exercised, regardless of human rights, and before any people are transferred to the jurisdiction of another Government they are entitled to receive guarantees and assurances of their identity, their rights and of fair and equal treatment.  In any case, the outbreak of conflict is not the time to adjudge conflicting claims or to take sides.</P>
    <P>Following the recent armed intervention by Argentina, Ireland joined with other countries in the United Nations Security Council in laying down the principles that should govern the solution of the crisis.  The preamble to Resolution 502 specifically referred to the call by the President of the Council to both the British and Argentine Governments to refrain from the use or threat of force in the region of the Falkland Islands.  The body of the resolution demanded an immediate cessation of hostilities, an immediate withdrawal of Argentine forces, and a diplomatic solution to the differences between the two Governments.</P>
    <P>In his address to the Council on that occasion, Ireland's Permanent Representative stressed the responsibility of the international community to avert conflict and referred to the availability of the UN's peace-making and peace-keeping facilities.  In the following days, he and his colleagues were active in developing and discussing with person in key positions <Col N="800" /> in the UN specific ideas for UN efforts to bring about a peaceful settlement in accordance with Resolution 502.</P>
    <P>Far from their being anything in the resolution authorising either side to send troops or reinforcements to the area, both sides were asked to refrain from the use or threat of force and to cease hostilities immediately.</P>
    <P>This was also the purpose of the economic sanctions adopted by the EEC.  It was precisely because of the possibility that they could help to promote implementation of the Security Council Resolution that, despite some reservations about their effectiveness, Ireland agreed to the adoption of these measures in a spirit of Community solidarity.  The hope was that the sanctions would complement other pressures which my Government understood to be directed towards an outcome that would respect the Security Council Resolution and, in particular, would prevent major hostilities.  We had hoped that the efforts of Mr. Haig would achieve that result.  While these were in train efforts specifically within the UN framework were understandably suspended.</P>
    <P>The purpose of diplomatic pressure, certainly so far as Ireland was concerned, was to make it clear that a <i>fait accompli</i> would not be acceptable and that negotions were imperative.  It was hoped specifically to prevent and render unnecessary further military action.</P>
    <P>When it became apparent the weekend before last that the United States mediation effort had not been attended with success, the Irish Government expressed serious concern at the deteriorating situation. They urged that the possibilities offered by the United Nations should be fully exploited and that further military escalation which would only make negotiations all the more difficult should be avoided.</P>
    <P>By Tuesday of last week, however, there were indications that diplomatic and economic pressure was simply viewed as complementary to military action.  There were concurrent indications that neither party was particularly open to immediate involvement of the United Nations, through the Security <Col N="801" /> Council, the good offices of the Secretary General or otherwise.  Two major vessels, one on each side, had been lost, with considerable loss of life, and a number of planes shot down.  The world seemed to be standing by while young lives were being lost.  There was, and is, no assurance as to where the military action will end, how many more lives will be lost, how much damage caused.  The longer it continues the more likely the theatre of war is to extend, and the more countries are likely to become embroiled.  It is not possible to say how it might end or who might be engulfed.</P>
    <P>It was not only the Irish Government that was appalled by the sinking of the <i>General Belgrano</i> and <i>HMS Sheffield.</i> It is abundantly clear that most of the Governments of our European partners and the American Government are also deeply concerned at developments which threaten to wreck valuable links and friendships.</P>
    <P>This was the background to the Irish Government's statement of Tuesday, which indicated that Ireland would seek a meeting of the Security Council and also that the Government regarded the application of economic sanctions by the Community as no longer appropriate and would be seeking their suspension.  The Irish view was that the whole situation had changed in that, tragically, the steps hitherto taken had not succeeded in preventing conflict.  We saw a grave risk that military action on both sides would acquire its own momentum and would escalate, increasing the threat to world peace and making negotiations much more difficult.</P>
    <P>It seemed important to us that an initiative should be taken which would restore diplomacy and the search for a peaceful solution to the centre of the stage.  Ireland, for the duration of its period as one of the 15 members of the UN Security Council, shares a special responsibility for the prevention of armed conflict among the community of nations.  We do not regard that post purely as an honour.  We take our responsibilities seriously.  The Security Council has a vital role in halting the spread of war.  The non-implementation of Resolution <Col N="802" /> 502 seemed to us to render a new UN initiative necessary to secure the cessation of hostilities.</P>
    <P>While a formal meeting of the Security Council, as requested by Ireland, has been deferred for the time being so as not to hinder in any way the efforts of the UN Secretary General, there is no doubt, as he himself has acknowledged, that our call strengthened his hand and gave a significantly increased weight and impact from that time to diplomatic negotiations at the UN.  Our action has helped the Secretary General to establish a framework for the negotiations which are still continuing.  His task is a very difficult and delicate one.  I am sure that all in this House would wish him every success and would want the Security Council to do whatever they can to help the Secretary General to persevere and to encourage the parties to the dispute to give him their full co-operation.</P>
    <P>Should, however, these efforts break down and should there be any intensification of the conflict, we are ready to reactivate our call for a formal meeting of the Security Council should this appear to be necessary.  Our paramount concern will be to stop the fighting.</P>
    <P>We have also sought an end to economic sanctions against Argentina by the EEC.  As a neutral country, we are not prepared to back military action.  Nothing in our EEC obligations requires us to give such backing.  We consider that it would be inappropriate for these measures to remain in force if they were being applied or seen to be operating so as to reinforce a military solution to the crisis rather than to promote a diplomatic and negotiated settlement.  It is also the judgment of the Government that suspension of the sanctions would now be more helpful in creating an atmosphere in which UN efforts would obtain a receptive hearing on both sides.  The relevant Community regulation had itself made provision for a possible review within the one-month period of its operation, precisely to allow for a change in circumstances such as occurred last week.  Accordingly, our Minister for Foreign Affairs sought a lifting of the sanctions at the meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs last <Col N="803" /> week.  He also explained the Government's attitude.  While our other partners considered that the measures might remain in force for the moment, there was widespread agreement with the Irish view that these measures were intended to advance a diplomatic solution and not any military alternative, and no commitment was given with regard to the renewal of sanctions after 17 May.</P>
    <P>Although it is not the practice for formal decisions to emerge from what are informal meetings, nonetheless, given the urgency of the Falklands crisis, it was considered important that the consensus of the meeting should be clearly reflected in the customary press briefing given by the Presidency afterwards.  Consequently, the following press guidelines were agreed for use by President Tindemans. I think it would be helpful if I were to read them to the House.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Ten is to support efforts to secure a peaceful negotiated settlement between Argentina and Britain in accordance with Resolution 502 of the UN Security Council. The Ten fully support the efforts of the UN Secretary General, with the support of the Security Council to create a framework in which negotiations can be successfully pursued.</P>
    <P>The Ministers have agreed that the Community should continue to maintain the measures currently in force <i>vis-à-vis</i> Argentina with the aim of securing a peaceful negotiated settlement in accordance with Resolution 502.  Thus it should be clearly understood that these measures are intended to reinforce political and diplomatic efforts to this end and not a military solution to the conflict.</P>
    <P>With regard to the renewal of the measures after 17 May, the Ministers agreed to remain in touch on this issue with a view to taking a final decision closer to the 17 May and in the light of developments.</P>
    <P>We consider the outcome of the meeting to have been satisfactory from our point of view, and our decision to oppose the <Col N="804" /> renewal of sanctions has given many of our partners who have reservations about military action a chance to reflect on the situation.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Ten fully endorsed the efforts of the Secretary General of the United Nations to secure a negotiated settlement.  From the outset this has been the basic aim of Irish policy in regard to the crisis over the Falklands.</P>
    <P>While in the event we have received considerable support, Ireland is not afraid to stand alone on the issue of peace or to reassert our traditional policy of neutrality.  We have always been unique in the Community in not belonging to NATO.  That is something that has always been accepted.  In the past we have maintained our neutrality despite intense pressures on us.  The people of this country are deeply attached to our neutrality, and they are not prepared to see it eroded.  Both in principle and in practice we have now made it clear that we will not permit that to happen.</P>
    <P>We intend to support the preservation of European unity and solidarity to the greatest extent possible.  We have sought not to act unilaterally.  It would help unity and solidarity however, if the Community and all its institutions were more conscious of the limitations of Community action imposed by the true nature and the ideals of the Community.  The Community has no role in the military sphere, and it would be better for European unity and solidarity if it were not seen to take actions supportive of or complementary to military action, which would inevitably cause division.  The European Community should cherish its reputation as a peaceful intermediary.</P>
    <P>It is of importance that I make it clear that we have not acted in any spirit of animosity towards our closest neighbour but rather in a desire to help.  We believe that we can see the Falklands crisis objectively and separate it from other issues as a mature and responsible member of the community of nations.</P>
    <P>We have given every support to a diplomatic solution to the conflict based on Resolution 502.  In trying to halt the conflict and prevent further loss of life we <Col N="805" /> are acting in a way that seems to us the only sane and reasonable course to take.</P>
    <P>There are indeed important principles at stake.  But wars also have results in no way related to principles.  It is not clear to us what the long-term outcome of the present situation is likely to be and we must note the clear statement of US Secretary of State, Mr. Haig, that &ldquo;strictly military solutions cannot endure&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have taken up our position on this grave international crisis independent of other issues and on its own merits.  We have not allowed ourselves to be influenced by feelings which we may legitimately have on other issues and happenings both inside and outside the Community.</P>
    <P>We appeal to both Governments to draw back from conflict and to enter negotiations.  The object of the dispute does not merit the loss of life, and we believe that an accomodation and a peaceful negotiated settlement between both sides is possible, given patience, perseverance and wisdom.  Otherwise the ensuing conflict could bring about a wider war and even then the underlying issue would still remain to be resolved.  We appeal particularly to the friends and allies of Britain and Argentina to exercise a decisive influence to prevent further escalation of conflict and loss of life and to bring this dangerous crisis to an end. To fail to do so, to sit mute on the sidelines would be a failure of statesmanship and an abdication of political responsibility.</P>
    <P>To sum up, Ireland has acted consistently throughout this crisis.  From the outset, my Government felt that Ireland should take an active part and could be helpful in trying to avert conflict and have the crisis resolved in a manner that would be satisfactory to both parties involved. The record will show that Ireland has always taken very seriously her responsibilities as a member of the United Nations which, as a small neutral nation, we have always seen as the pre-eminent forum for the maintenance of world peace and of the rule of law in international affairs.  Our current position as a non-permanent member of the Security Council both imposes a duty and affords <Col N="806" /> an opportunity to be helpful to two countries with whom we have maintained friendly relations.</P>
    <P>The threat of war however still looms darkly over the South Atlantic, and the Irish Government remain ready to play a further active diplomatic role in the effort to prevent further heavy loss of life and to preserve the maintenance of world peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When I set out the aims of Irish foreign policy, as I saw them, shortly after my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs in March 1973, I gave precedence to the maintenance of world peace &mdash; not because I thought that our role in this matter would be likely to be important, given the small size of our country, but because in logic it was the necessary pre-condition for the attainment of all other objectives of foreign policy.  These other objectives included as a priority the attainment of peace in this island, a resolution of the political differences that divide us here and the strengthening of the European Community, whose survival and development is especially important to us as the country which is by far the greatest net beneficiary of membership.</P>
      <P>It is against the backdrop of these objectives of our foreign policy, which were not challenged at the time or since, that the Government's actions with respect to the Falkland Islands must be judged.  The record of their actions makes curious reading, and the Taoiseach's speech makes even more curious reading, riddled as it is with inconsistencies and contradictions.  First, the Government joined in voting for Resolution 502 and in supporting the application of sanctions against Argentina &mdash; after the despatch of the British Task Force to the South Atlantic had been announced.  It is difficult to reconcile that with the suggestion in the earlier part of the Taoiseach's speech that economic sanctions were adopted with a view to avoiding military activity, before military activity began or was envisaged.  That implication was clearly in his speech but it does not fit with the facts of the sequence of events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> Then a report appeared, which was subsequently positively identified in the press as having emanated from the Taoiseach's Department, that our action at the UN in voting for Resolution 502 had been taken by our representative there without instructions and on his own initiative. This report was not denied by the Taoiseach or by his Minister and the talsity of it was not exposed until the attention of the newspaper in question was drawn to it at another level, and the libellous character of the allegation demonstrated. The Government's failure at the time to accept responsibility for their own decision in this matter, and the attempt to evade it by allowing this report to stand for a week, was an inglorious political tactic, an abdication of responsibility, and an act of disloyalty to those who were carrying out their instructions &mdash; a failure that has no precedent of which I am aware in this State.</P>
    <P>There followed a broadcast interview by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in which he belatedly &mdash; but, I must say, unambiguously &mdash; enunciated the Government's position; their rejection of Argentine aggression and their support for the measures in which they had joined to bring this aggression to an end.  I congratulated him on that interview in which he expressed our position very cogently, even if it was something that should have been said much earlier.</P>
    <P>The second phase of this affair has evolved gradually, with the perception by political and public opinion in many countries that the two parties to this dispute were heading towards an armed confrontation, in an atmosphere of war-mongering and jingoism that was alarming to anyone concerned with the preservation of peace.</P>
    <P>At this point many countries began to indicate to the participants to the dispute to which each was closest their concern that a solution be arrived at without bloodshed.  Quiet diplomacy, the most effective type of pressure to exert at a time of high emotions in the countries concerned, began to play its part. Ireland, together with a number of other European countries, including Germany.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> Italy, Denmark and the Netherlands, used the procedures for political consultation between the members of the European Community to express our concern to Britain and to press for flexibility in the British approach to negotiations, the objective of which must be, in accordance with Resolution 502, the achievement of a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Argentine troops from the island.</P>
    <P>Into this carefully calculated diplomatic exercise our Government chose last Tuesday, quite evidently without taking account of the advice and information available from their diplomats, to throw a spanner.  Had they bothered to check what was happening at the United Nations, they would never have proposed at that delicate point, when the Secretary-General was putting forward &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; to both of the participants, to call an &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; meeting of the Security Council, at which the dispute could only have been exacerbated as Britain and Argentina faced each other across the table, each forced by the pressures of domestic nationalism to attack the other's position.</P>
    <P>At one stage in his speech the Taoiseach dismissed the good offices of the Secretary-General saying there were indications that neither party was particularly open to them.  At that time the Secretary-General was putting forward ideas which have proved to be a useful basis and one in respect of which both parties are prepared to have discussions. Later in his speech the Taoiseach used different words in regard to the Secretary-General's approach.  He said that we dropped our initiative for a meeting of the Security Council in order not to hinder the efforts of the Secretary-General, which he had dismissed as not being acceptable to the parties.</P>
    <P>I noticed that in the whole of his speech there is no reference to the wording used by the Government at that time &mdash; a proposal for an immediate meeting of the Security Council.  The word &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; has disappeared, in the same way as the word &ldquo;idly&rdquo; disappeared 12 years ago from the phrase &ldquo;standing idly by&rdquo;.  That was what the Government proposed and <Col N="809" /> it was from that proposal that they had to withdraw within hours of having put it forward with so little thought.  The proposal for an immediate meeting was modified to eliminate this requirement of immediacy.  That was done within hours and the request for the meeting itself was then indefinitely postponed, in deference to the views of all those concerned with the settlement of the dispute, those concerned with a settlement rather than making public noises.</P>
    <P>Ireland's stock at the UN has rarely been as low as at the moment for it has been a characteristic of our diplomacy in that forum, under all Governments, that it has always been carried on in a totally disinterested manner, and has been seen as such by all the other members.  The respect that has been won by successive Irish Foreign Ministers, from Liam Cosgrave and Frank Aiken's time down to the present day, was dissipated overnight by the Government's action because our Cabinet here chose to throw all this away in the pursuit of short-term gain in the form of a hoped-for domestic reaction that they were &ldquo;doing something&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This error was compounded by the fact that the Government did not even have a resolution ready to put forward.  The statement issued at the end of the Government meeting that decided upon this ham-fisted approach suggested a certain line of approach but one that had it been pursued would have undermined, indeed thrown away, the essential element of Resolution 502: namely, the withdrawal of Argentine troops.</P>
    <P>That this Government statement was issued without the benefit of expert advice is self-evident; that the Government did not know what they were doing is perhaps the most charitable interpretation that can be put upon its formulation. Certainly the Taoiseach was quick to climb down when challenged by us in this House two hours later.  He then conceded that the withdrawal of Argentine forces &mdash; no reference to which had been made in the Government statement &mdash; must be a prerequisite of any solution. But the absence of any thought-out approach on the part of the Government was exposed by his uncertainty as to <Col N="810" /> whether the wording proposed in the Government's statement of two hours earlier was to be regarded as supplementary to the existing Resolution 502, or whether it was envisaged that the Government's draft would have to be amended to add in the essential element which they had omitted.</P>
    <P>The confusion of the Government in this House was paralleled at the UN, where no one was clear as to whether in fact there was an Irish draft resolution, or, if so, what it contained.  Nothing more unlike the traditional professional and skilled approach of Ireland to problems at the UN could be imagined, and it has left many friends of Ireland there bemused and disappointed.</P>
    <P>The other barrel of this shot-gun diplomacy consisted of a public announcement that we would propose to our EEC partners the cessation of sanctions against the Argentine.  On this issue too, it became clear in the House that the Government did not know their own minds.  At first the Taoiseach sought to give the impression that it was intended to seek a cessation of sanctions on the following Saturday with effect from that day.  Only when it was pointed out that sanctions had been agreed to run till 17 May did he hastily modify this, agreeing that they would have to continue until that day.  But he remained, and still remains, clearly uncertain as to whether it is proposed that if our partners decided to continue sanctions after that date, the Irish Government would accept a majority EEC decision, or break ranks with our Community partners on the issue.  At the end of the Taoiseach's statement I am not any wiser in that respect.</P>
    <P>The effect of this announcement in Brussels was to upset those of our partners who had been pursuing with us the path of private diplomacy, seeking to influence the British to adopt a more flexible negotiating posture by hinting that if war were preferred to diplomacy, the question of sanctions would have to be reconsidered.  This delicate exercise, undertaken by inspired leaks and hints to the press, which was having some visible effects on British opinion, was scuttled by the blundering announcement from <Col N="811" /> Dublin.  The matter having thus been brought out into the open, where Britain wanted it, her diplomats were enabled immediately to put pressure on our partners to declare themselves against the Irish move.  The result was that last Saturday's meeting was much less effective in putting pressure on Britain than it might otherwise have been.  Indeed, here again we see the internal contradictions of the Taoiseach's statements.  He quoted from the statement issued after the meeting but the quotation from that is in direct contradiction to what has gone before. His quotation included the following:</P>
    <P>The Ministers have agreed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That includes the Irish Minister because there is no dissenting note here.</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the Community should continue to maintain the measures currently in force <i>vis-à-vis</i> Argentina with the aim of securing a peaceful negotiated settlement in accordance with Resolution 502.</P>
    <P>That contradicts what was said by the Taoiseach earlier in his script:</P>
    <P>We consider that it would be inappropriate for these measures to remain in force if they were being applied or seen to be operating so as to reinforce a military solution to the crisis....</P>
    <P>Yet, having said that, our position is that we publicly support their continuance in an agreed statement to which we have joined at a meeting to which we went with the objective of getting these sanctions removed.  How much of a fool does the Taoiseach want to make of this country?</P>
    <P>It is hard to conceive of a more blundering or counter-productive approach. It was inevitable that in joining with others to put pressure on Britain to open its mind to a negotiated settlement that might not satisfy jingoistic opinion in that country, we were risking some British hostility.  It was right that we should do so.  It would have been quite wrong for us to hang back from doing our duty with others in this matter because of fear of a <Col N="812" /> British reaction, even though our interests in respect of Northern Ireland require that we avoid unnecessary conflict with Britain in respect of issues that do not directly concern other Irish national interests.  But to take the lead in the matter, in such a blundering way as to help the British to get temporarily off the hook on the issue of avoidance of further violence and seeking a negotiated settlement, was to give us the worst of both worlds, to weaken the pressure for peace, while at the same time alienating British opinion to a quite unnecessary degree.</P>
    <P>This whole sequence of events is to be deplored &mdash; starting with the effort to allow the responsibility for the Government's policy decisions to be placed on the shoulders of a civil servant, and ending up doing damage to our standing in both New York and Brussels, weakening even if, hopefully, only temporarily the pressure for a peaceful solution, and damaging to a quite unnecessary extent the Anglo-Irish relationship which the Taoiseach himself had done so much to build up in 1979 and 1980.  Foreign policy is not to be made up on the spur of the moment in Edenderry or anywhere else, without careful consideration and the taking of expert advice.  Our external interests are much too vital to be prejudiced by this kind of hasty and ill-considered action, not to be explained by anything other than the kind of desire to pull a propaganda stroke to which we are accustomed at home, and can more safely be indulged in the domestic forum.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should add that all this, and specifically the changed approach of EEC sanctions, has nothing to do with neutrality and no one should be foolish enough to fall for the Government's use of this red herring.  The Taoiseach has made his position on neutrality in relation to the EEC clear and I quote:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are neither ideologically neutral nor politically indifferent....  As the head of the then Fianna Fáil Government in 1969 Jack Lynch said `Being members of the Community we would naturally be interested in the defence of the territories embraced by <Col N="813" /> the Communities.  There is no question of neutrality there.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made that statement in this House in March of last year.</P>
    <P>I should add that this formulation, as well as others from Fianna Fáil spokesmen about going to the aid of our partners if they are attacked, represent a specifically Fianna Fáil formulation of our position.  That of my own party has always been expressed in different terms, relating the question of involvement with defence within the EEC specifically to a future evolution of the Community, not on the horizon now nor likely to be so for a long time to come, into a genuine federation of confederation, with a common foreign policy, which is, I believe, a necessary prerequisite to a common defence policy.</P>
    <P>One thing is clear: the Fianna Fáil Party with their unequivocal rejection of neutrality in the EEC context in this House barely a year ago are in no position to seek to play the neutrality card in this present matter in an effort to cover up their blunders.  And no one should fall for this ploy.</P>
    <P>To conclude: Our duty in this matter is to join with other like-minded countries in the Community and at the UN, who fear an escalation of this conflict in the South Atlantic, and to use our influence jointly with them to persuade the protagonists to negotiate a settlement to a dispute which is based on issues of pride and fear of loss of face, issues which should never be allowed to be the occasion for loss of life.  Our credibility in this matter has unfortunately been severely damaged in the eyes of our European partners and our friends at the UN, but if we stop playing around with this desperately serious matter and concentrate on working with others towards a solution, we can yet do something useful.</P>
    <P>Whether and how time will heal the unnecessary breach with Britain brought about by an attempt to use this issue to play for votes at home is something we must leave to the future.  So also must we leave the final verdict on this episode, the verdict as to whether it reflects no more than bungling, or, at a deeper level, <Col N="814" /> indicates that the Taoiseach has decided under pressures within and from outside his party &mdash; the fruits of which are to be seen in the nomination of an Independent Fianna Fáil Senator &mdash; to abandon the policy he adopted in 1979, of seeking a solution to the Northern Ireland problem through a new and closer relationship with Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to deal with the State's basic policy on neutrality, since defence of our neutrality has been invoked by the Government to support certain of their foreign policy initiatives in the course of this Falklands crisis. No Deputy on any side of the House seriously disputes the value of this country's frequently stated neutrality position. In my time in this House I have not heard any Deputy advocate our membership of either NATO or the Warsaw Pact Alliance, still less of that.  Our neutrality has both an idealistic and a practical dimension.  A small State with our history of anti-colonialism should, to the greatest possible extent, by remaining outside military pacts, seek to exercise a beneficial influence on the side of peace in the United Nations and in the broader world community context outside Europe. Under its idealistic aspect, this influence of ours in the United Nations may best be exercised by our State remaining untrammelled by the political constraints which inevitably occur inside a military alliance.  Under the practical aspect, my own recent experience to take one example &mdash; working on the industry side of the Cabinet in the last Government confirms me in my view that neutrality as a policy position makes sound economic sense from the commercial and trade viewpoint. I know of one large US investment planned for this country in the arranging of which, in discussions with the principals, the matter of our neutrality was raised as being of positive assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see our commitment to neutrality as a foreign policy stance as primarily pragmatic. Too often our neutrality has been an occasion for rhetorical extravagance and emotional self-indulgence.  Our neutrality has all-party support in this House precisely because it has always accorded <Col N="815" /> with the national interest.  Alignment with NATO means a military alliance.  It commits us to the NATO nuclear deterrent policy with all the implications that has with regard to military intelligence facilities being placed on Irish soil.  That would not be in the best interests of our people.</P>
    <P>Our commitment to neutrality is based on the recognition that this policy has served our people well and continues to have the respect of both NATO and Warsaw Pact countries.  But most important, it has the respect of the non-aligned countries, many of whom share a similar historical background to ourselves.</P>
    <P>As I see it, our neutrality derives from our independence, and our independence is internationally sustained by our neutrality.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to the latest phase of the Falkland's crisis was to launch initiatives at both EEC and UN level and I should like to comment briefly on the elements comprising those two initiatives.  Our demand for a Security Council meeting was described as a request for an immediate meeting.  Some hours later the Taoiseach, was to say that Ireland was holding off on its request because the United Nations Secretary General was putting forward proposals. The Government statement did not make at all clear what we wished the Security Council to decide.  The Government statement was confined to saying that there should be a cessation of hostilities by both Britain and Argentina pending a negotiated settlement.  Only when the Dáil met later did the Taoiseach, under questioning, add the third element of Resolution 502 which included the demand for a withdrawal of Argentine forces from the Falklands.  Later, on RTE he was to add: a United Nations mediation force.  To say the least &mdash; in the one day &mdash; this kind of improvised <i>ad hoc</i> foreign policy creation is highly confusing and dangerous to our reputation as a responsible, neutral State.  It has never been satisfactorily explained &mdash; to my knowledge at any rate &mdash; why our approach could not have been summed up from the Government's point of view <Col N="816" /> in a more comprehensive, balanced manner, in their first statement earlier that day.</P>
    <P>There was little consistency in the Government's position between the Sunday statement of the Minister for Defence, the Monday disavowal of that statement by the Taoiseach and the extraordinary agglomeration of statements by the Taoiseach on Tuesday.  The statements issued by the Government on Tuesday in particular seemed to suggest a lack of serious preparation.</P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary that a public statement should be made in Dublin concerning a request for a meeting of the Security Council while, at the very same time apparently, the Secretary General was attempting to conduct a further peace initiative.  The question might well be asked: Were there any prior consultations with our representative on the United Nations Security Council on the advisability of the Government's request?  Did such prior consultation take place?  If so, how could we then in conscience make that request?  After all, we hold our place in the Security Council for the period we are members of the Security Council in large part because of the respect gained for our neutrality position under various Governments.  We hold that position in the Security Council because we have the serious respect of many countries in the United Nations. We endanger that serious respect for our position in the United Nations if we go on in this <i>ad hoc</i> fashion taking initiatives that have no practical grounds, no basis for success, when they conflict and in fact may damage other initiatives occuring at the one time.  At the very least the point could be made that iniatives that make good copy at home may, as in this instance, look singularly inept abroad.</P>
    <P>We are not alone amongst EEC States in holding reservations on the nature and extent of the British military response. France has expressed her consternation. The Federal Republic of Germany has said there should be a cease-fire.  However, the Irish response differed in that a formal statement was issued which committed us to two specific courses of action.  First, there was a calling of an <Col N="817" /> immediate meeting of the United Nations Security Council and then our announced opposition to the EEC trade sanctions against Argentina.  There appears to have been no consultation with other EEC States before these two courses of action were decided.  Apparently there was no prior exploration &mdash; at least not to my knowledge &mdash; of the possibility of concerted action with other EEC States or like-minded EEC States.  Certainly the lack of any discernible success for these initiatives of ours to date seems to indicate an absence of prior consultation.</P>
    <P>Alarm at the escalation of the crisis is clearly shared by other member states of the European Community, who agreed on Sunday to defer a renewal of trade sanctions pending the outcome of the talks being conducted by the United Nations Secretary General.  However, the Government's decision to press for the immediate cessation of the sanctions might well have proved counter-productive if accepted by the Ten at this juncture.</P>
    <P>Seeking a cessation of sanctions would in substance have reversed the earlier support given by our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, for the content of Resolution 502.  It would have lessened rather than enhanced the prospects of negotiations.  If it transpires that Britain is merely engaging in discussions with the Secretary General so as to allow the task force to be strengthened for a full-scale invasion of the Falklands, it will then be quite proper for the Government to press for the abandonment of trade sanctions. For then, clearly, military force would have replaced all diplomatic efforts at a negotiated settlement.</P>
    <P>Neutrality has been referred to frequently in the course of the Government's comments on the crisis.  I do not wish to rehash any of the general arguments raised in the debate on which neutrality was last referred to at length here in this House on 11 March 1981.  However, there is one point that is relevant to this question of neutrality so often invoked in these past few days, one point I would ask the Taoiseach to clarify.  In that debate the Taoiseach stated in Volume <Col N="818" /> 327 column 1394, of the official report:</P>
    <P>...we would of course have to review what would be the most appropriate defence arrangements for the island as a whole...</P>
    <P>in the event of a satisfactory solution to the situation in Northern Ireland.  This is a line of thought which effectively relates our neutrality to the continued political division of the island.  In that defence debate of 11 March 1981 the Taoiseach appeared to envisage a fundamental alteration of our neutral position in the event of a political settlement of the Northern question.  I would not subscribe to that version of our neutrality.  In my view neutrality is the core of our foreign policy and is independent of any settlement of the Northern question.  We must above all strive to avoid creating the impression abroad or at home that our neutrality is no more than the transference of the age-old &ldquo;England's difficulty is Ireland's opportunity&rdquo; stance into an international setting.  While that served us well in the period before we became an independent sovereign state, it would clearly be inappropriate now.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Taoiseach to give some consideration to making a formal statement or clarification as to his perception of our neutrality taking into account his most recent statement on that subject.  A question does arise in the aftermath of the Government's statements and initiatives during this crisis as to the effect of these on the &ldquo;special relationship&rdquo; between Britain and Ireland on which such a short time ago the present Taoiseach set such great store.  It was then the core of Anglo-Irish relations.  Where do we go from here in the matter both of that special relationship and Anglo-Irish relations?  Already we know that the next Anglo-Irish summit meeting has been postponed until July.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that the British Government can have no legitimate opposition to statements on the part of any Irish Government concerning the central importance of neutrality as the core of Irish foreign policy.  British Governments today as in the past must <Col N="819" /> live with the reality of our commitment to neutrality as a central part of our foreign policy.  There is no reason to disguise or evade the fact that sometimes a price has to be paid for that commitment of ours, for example, when British interests are felt to be affected by it.  We must always as a State be prepared to pay that price.  We are not, however, called on to pay an unnecessary price.  The outburst of the Minister for Defence may well entail the consequence of our paying an unnecessary price.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was right to re-state our country's traditional policy of neutrality in the light of the serious escalation in the Falkland dispute.  Phrases like &ldquo;technically at war&rdquo; do not disguise the reality that lives are being lost in the South Atlantic or the fact that Argentina and Britain are now at war.  That is beyond dispute.  It remains our serious task as a State to seek to the extent of our influence at the UN and elsewhere to aid the process of bringing the parties to the table for serious negotiations.  It is a sad commentary on human folly in this matter that lives should be lost in a dispute which seems eminently capable of resolution-through negotiated settlement.</P>
    <P>I support the Taoiseach's attempt to carry out an active foreign policy but I would caution him and his Ministers to remember that words are deeds in the world of diplomacy and once said words are impossible to retract.  Statements and initiatives must be carefully prepared. The evidence of the Government's reaction to the Falklands crisis suggests an excessive reliance on improvisation which we can ill afford at this stage.</P>

      <P>I understood when a Deputy rises to speak on a point of order and when the Chair clearly sees the Deputy rising to his feet on a point of order that the courtesy of the Chair is to listen to the point of order, not to ignore the Deputy by calling on the Minister to move in as you have just done.</P>

      <P>I am asking for your ruling on my first point of order.  When a Deputy rises to his feet on a point of order and when the Chair clearly sees and hears the Deputy on a point of order, is it not consistent with the rules of the House that the Chair should extend the courtesy to that Deputy to express his point of order and not ignore him, as you have just done, when I rose to my feet and when Deputy Manning rose to his feet.  You have disgracefully ignored Deputy Manning and me.</P>

I have indicated that, as far as the announcement of the Order of Business is concerned there is a specific Standing Order No. 25 which indicates what should happen in the House.  It is not a motion, it is an announcement by the Taoiseach of what is ordered for the day. A precedent, which is acceptable, has arisen, with former holders of this office that on matters relating to legislation promised by the Government, questions in relation to that have been accepted.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> On a point of order and before the House <Col N="829" /> passes from the Order of Business, I would like to raise a point of order to try to clarify the position.  The Chair has referred to Standing Order No. 25 which governs the Order of Business and if we follow from what the Chair says that if we were to be ruled entirely by Standing Order 25 we could only raise matters arising out of business as outlined by the Taoiseach, but the Chair went on to say that there is a precedent which overrides the Standing Order and enables Members to raise questions regarding promised legislation.  It follows, therefore, that a precedent overrules a Standing Order, but from my 16 years or more experience in this House I know that there is a long-standing principle that applied at the times in which the late Deputy Hogan, the late Deputy Brennan, the late Deputy Breslin and Deputy Faulkner, to mention some, occupied the Chair; and, in accordance with that principle, matters of public importance were allowed to be raised day after day.  Consequently, I submit that, in accordance with that precedent, Deputy Dukes was entitled to raise the important matter of farm prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a short, technical Bill with a single purpose, namely, to amend and clarify the provisions of the electoral law in relation to the offence of personation in the case of a person who votes or attempts to vote more than once in his own name at the same election.  The offence is defined in section 3 of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923.  The relevant part of the section reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>every person... who having voted once at an election applies at the same election for a ballot paper in his own name, shall be guilty of the offence of personation.</P>
      <P>It has emerged that there may be difficulty in proving that a person has actually voted and in a recent prosecution in the District Court, it was held that, to do so, it would be necessary to produce and identify a ballot paper marked by the person concerned.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach made clear to the House in his statement on 29 April last on the Dáil motion on the electoral law that this was a decision of an individual district justice which was not binding on any other district justice.  He also indicated that it was a matter entirely within the discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions as to whether to apply to have a case stated to the High Court for a direction on the point of law involved. Deputies will be aware that the Director of Public Prosecutions has since availed of this procedure whereby a ruling of the District Court can be reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach acknowledged, however, the misgivings about the adequacy of the existing electoral law which the ruling had given rise to and indicated <Col N="832" /> that, if there was agreement between the parties, the Government were prepared to introduce amending legislation at an early date.  In furtherance of the Taoiseach's undertaking, there has been consultation between the parties on the wording of the present measure.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to overcome the difficulty referred to by providing that the offence of personation shail exist if a person having obtained a ballot paper at an election applies at the same election for a ballot paper in his own name.  A saver is included in relation to the situation where a person who inadvertently spoils his ballot paper may return the paper to the presiding officer and obtain another ballot paper in place of the spoilt one.</P>
    <P>In deference to the wishes clearly expressed on all sides in the House, the measure is being brought forward as a matter of urgency to deal with a single specific question.  I know Deputies will wish to see the measure reach the Statute Book as early as possible.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know the reason for this Bill being before the House. Indeed, there has been a wave here today from the previous controversy about the issue concerned.  Some people may think that what happened here today and also a fortnight ago was unnecessary wrangling by the Opposition.  I heard the Taoiseach say that we were reducing the House to a farce.  But the rights of individual Deputies are extremely important and none more so than the rights of Opposition Deputies, who at all times must be protected by the Chair.  I wish to put on record that the Chair is not composed of a number of individuals acting in an arbitrary and individual manner.</P>

      <P>The Chair will not take lessons from the Deputy or from anyone else.  If the Deputy has any complaint regarding procedure and privilege there is opportunity available to him to raise any such problem.  In the meantime, if he can show to the Chair any weakness in respect of the interpretation of Standing Orders, he may do so; but <Col N="833" /> otherwise the Chair is not prepared to accept any reprimand.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach acknowledged, however, the misgivings about the adequacy of the existing electoral law which the ruling had given rise to and indicated that, if there was agreement between the parties, the Government were prepared to introduce amending legislation at an early date.

The Labour Party raised one point by way of clarification and I got an indication from the Chief Whip of Fine Gael eventually, that was on Tuesday last, that they were agreeing to the measure.</P>

      <P>We all agree that the fundamental bedrock of a democracy is the free vote.  Every individual is entitled to a vote, and one vote only.  That is the essence of democracy in any State.  The 1937 and the 1923 Constitution recognised that, and also recognised that it should be cast in secret.</P>
      <P>We had two general elections in the past 12 months.  Both were fought on the same register.  I was aware of the number of complaints made during the 1981 election. It was obvious to everyone that the register was deficient in many respects. The names of many people were left off it.  Whole areas were left out of it.  Some people voted in one polling station while their neighbours voted in different polling stations.  The names of some people appeared twice on the register.  The names of dead people were on the register. The names of people who were alive were not on the register.  That is the situation we are now dealing with here.</P>
      <P>When I was appointed Minister for the Environment I wrote to all local representatives asking them to assist in the drafting of the register which has been in operation since 14 April last.  One of the very constructive things a political party can do is to assist in the correction and drafting of registers.  Political parties have people on the ground in every parish and townland and in the cities, and they know who is living in certain areas.  We will not know exactly how successful the exercise of the compilation of the current register was until it is used in a general election, but we will get some indication in the Dublin West by-election, which will be fought on the new register.</P>
      <P>In the June election in 1981, the Fine Gael organisation in North County Dublin spotted that the name of Mr. Pat O'Connor, who is a solicitor and a crony of the Taoiseach's, who is his election agent and his legal adviser&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A different set of precedents unfortunately.  I was making the point that during the June 1981 election which was fought on the same electoral list as was the February 1982 one, the Fine Gael organisation in North County Dublin &mdash; which I think is the correct name for the constituency which the Minister represents at the moment &mdash; spotted that a Mr. Patrick O'Connor and his daughter Niamh, Mr. O'Connor being, as I said, a crony of the Taoiseach, his adviser on matters legal and also his election agent, were on the register at both the Malahide and Kinsealy polling stations. At the conclusion of the election, the names had been crossed out in both places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the February 1982 election came along, our organisation there were told of this double registration and asked to keep an eye out for the gentleman in question, which they did.  Mr. O'Connor and his daughter Niamh presented themselves at the Malahide voting station. They proffered cards, were issued with ballot papers, went behind a screen, came out again and put either their ballot papers, marked or unmarked, or other pieces of paper, into the voting box.  They <Col N="838" /> then proceeded, at some time later on the same day, to Kinsealy, proffered more cards in their own names and were issued with ballot papers and at that stage, I understand, they were charged and were prosecuted under section 3 of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923.  This Act states:</P>
    <P>Every person who at an election applies for a ballot paper in the name of some other person, whether that name be the name of a living person or of a dead person or of a fictitious person, or who having voted once at an election applies at the same election for a ballot paper in his own name, shall be guilty of the offence of personation.</P>
    <P>The case came before the court on 20 April last.  District Justice Kearney said, when dismissing the case &mdash; and I am quoting from <i>The Irish Times</i> of Wednesday, 21 April 1982&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I am ruling that the prosecution has not proved, and could not prove as the law stands, that these defendants or any defendants committed this offence of double-voting or whatever the word is.</P>
    <P>Earlier he was quoted as saying, again in <i>The Irish Times:</i></P>
    <P>...the advance press publicity had given him an opportunity to look into the law relating to the offences.  He had found that the offence carried a mandatory sentence of not less than two months imprisonment and not more than 12 months, plus a fine not exceeding £500.  &ldquo;That in anyone's language, is a very severe penalty,&rdquo; he commented.</P>
    <P>Because it was such a very serious matter, he had decided he would have to read it in even more detail.  After reviewing the law relating to the offence, the justice said that a High Court case &ldquo;brought by Miss Máirín de Burca, or another lady&rdquo; approximately five years ago, had changed the practice whereby ballot-paper counterfoil records were kept which indicated who had voted in an election.  That practice was discontinued as a result of the High <Col N="839" /> Court judgement handed down on that occasion.</P>
    <P>We contend that District Justice Kearney was wrong in that regard, because he is referring to the wrong case, in spite of the fact that he had earlier said that he had been given an opportunity of looking into the law relating to the offence. Having found that the offence carried so severe a penalty, he decided that he would have to read it in even more detail.  Yet, he quotes the wrong case in that regard. The case which he should have quoted was that brought by Mr. McMahon in 1970.  Mr. McMahon held that because there was a number on the counterfoil of the ballot paper issued to him which corresponded with the number on the ballot paper received, then the secrecy of the ballot as guaranteed by the Constitution was being infringed.  Mr. McMahon won that case.  It was appealed from the High Court to the Supreme Court and was upheld in the Supreme Court.  As a result of this, the law was changed in 1972 to remove those numbers from the ballot papers.  That is the case to which the judge should have referred.  The case to which he did refer was totally different, relating to the right of women to serve on juries.  It, at least, cast some doubt on how deeply the justice looked into the case.  It was a crazy judgment, in my opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had finished the sentence, the Chair would have realised what I was saying.  It was a crazy judgment, in my opinion, because of what another district justice found seven days later.  The other district justice was, by coincidence, District Justice de Burca in Limerick.  He said that the Act was there, with severe penalties and that people should know better.  The only way they would learn was by seeing others punished. He found someone guilty under <Col N="840" /> the same section of the same Act, committed him to prison and fined him.  One was a small farmer and the other was one of the leading solicitors in Dublin.  The first was found guilty, fined and sentenced to imprisonment and the second was acquitted.</P>
      <P>District Justice Kearney had said that because the fine was so severe, he had examined the case very critically.  The reason why the fines are so severe and why a prison sentence is imposed is because our predecessors, who enacted the 1923 Act and who changed it again later on, considered that in a democracy the crime of taking more than one's quota of votes to elect a Government was so serious that it demanded very serious penalties.  That is why the penalties, rightly, are a term of imprisonment and fines up to £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the judgment concerning the North County Dublin case, that legislation has been turned on its head.  It is deplorable conduct of somebody who is a practising solicitor, whose job it is to interpret and defend the laws of the country, who is the upholder of the entire legal system which is part of the foundation of our civilisation and democracy.  I do not agree with the judgment in this case.  It defies commonsense that a man would go to two polling booths, be given two ballot papers and then be considered to have voted only once because it could not be proved that he had already voted at the time he applied for the second ballot paper.  I believe that a <i>prima facie</i> case existed to transfer the onus of truth on to him to prove that having got two sets of ballot papers he had not voted twice.  Anyone reading the case in the papers in the last month could not be but contemptuous of the law as it stands in that regard, that a person cannot be convicted of a very serious crime, and of politicians who take three weeks to discuss the matter in the House and a further fortnight to introduce legislation, which we hold is something that will only tide us over until this by-election is held.  We do not accept there is a deficiency in the Act as it stands.  The fact of going to a polling station, getting a ballot paper, going behind a screen and doing the same <Col N="841" /> thing an hour or ten hours later in another polling station is proof enough that somebody voted and there is no deficiency in the law, as was found in the court case in Limerick.  I am sure the High Court will find so also, but there is obviously a problem that has to be dealt with now because of the by-election.  That is proved by what Mr. Justice Pringle said in his judgment on the McMahon case in the Supreme Court.  He said in his opinion as far as the prosecution of persons voting more than once is concerned, it is not necessary that it should be possible to identify the particular ballot papers involved.</P>
    <P>I want to issue a solemn warning to anybody who may consider voting more than once in the by-election taking place in Dublin West at the end of the month, that we have plans and we are prepared to ensure that such people will be caught on the spot and prosecuted, not just booted out of the polling station as Deputy Kemmy said he did in Limerick. I hope they will get the sentences laid down in the Electoral Abuses Act.  It might have been appropriate if the Minister had taken the opportunity, when bringing in this legislation, to clear up the doubt that has been cast on the mandatory sentence.  I understand there is a case coming up shortly in County Mayo whereby there is some doubt as to whether the justice has to send somebody to prison or whether the discretion he has only applies to the length of prison sentence to be applied.  However, I appreciate that may involve weighty legal arguments and he may have been advised that it needed more time for preparation than he had.  We accept the Bill as it is and will give all Stages to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party supports the principle of the Bill and recognises that we were consulted in relation to its wording.  However, the introductory speech by the Minister, while it was short and to the point, was somewhat worrying in that he did not indicate, as he could very well have taken the opportunity to so do, what kind of overall measures his Government are prepared to implement to eliminate the kind of abuse that goes on.  Lest anybody have any doubt about <Col N="842" /> the importance of this, a Cheann Comhairle, you may recall that I had the distinction of being the most successful defeated candidate in 1973 when I missed a Dáil seat by 38 votes.  It has been quite clear over the last three or four general elections when Governments have changed places on every occasion and when majorities are of a minus one or minus two nature, that as little as 1,000 votes out of an electorate of nearly two million people determines not just the fate of who occupies various ministerial posts and positions in this House, but also the degree of indebtedness in which the country finds itself or whether we are supporting one kind of international action or another.  In other words, the stakes are enormously high and they rest on the edifice of a democratic system which, from the very outset, must have a degree of enforced honesty.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what the precise tradition is in the House about criticising the courts and I have been guided, to use a neutral phrase, in the past by the Chair but the House must recognize that we are moving here, with the co-operation of all the parties, a small technical Bill because of the outcome of a particular court decision. Deputy Barry and the Fine Gael Party have clearly put on record, both today and on previous occasions, the precise nature and origin of that and I do not see the need for repetition.  It is precisely because of that court decision that this is necessary and that we are enacting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister to clarify or indicate at the end of the Second Stage or perhaps on Committee Stage what additional action he proposes to take, because the impression conveyed to the public arising out of the decision of that court case, the way in which it was publicised and documented, both in the Official Report and in the media, was that if you knew people in high places, if you had pull and influence, the normal constraints of law and the normal obligations of the Legislature could be waived to your advantage.  We cannot argue here about the sanctity of the ballot box, the importance of the democratic system which is a minority system, <Col N="843" /> regrettably, throughout the world and, at the same time, allow growing cynicism which I encounter among young people to be fuelled to an enormous extent as a consequence of that outrageous court decision.  Regrettably, while the point of law can be clarified, the act that took place and the people who did it are now immune to any subsequent action by the court.  That appears to be the consequence of the decision.  That gives rise to increasing cynicism in the democratic process and leaving aside the political allegiance of all Members of the House and the composition of the present Government, everybody would honestly concede that, if they were in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>In addition to the House passing this Bill, I should like the Minister to respond, at the appropriate stage, whether he would be in a position to revise totally the manner in which polling cards are currently issued.  It is my party's experience and my direct political experience that the issuing of polling cards is the greatest single temptation to personation that exists at present.  In the constituency which I represent there is probably a greater percentage of flat dwellers than in any other area, with the possible exception of Dublin Central. The degree of personation in the 1981 election was very high and we made a concerted effort to reduce it, with considerable success.  The valid poll on one table in Rathmines was reduced from 61 per cent to 38 per cent simply by diligence on our part.  You have the farcical situation of people coming in with polling cards, putting them on the table and when challenged by one of our people as to their names and where they lived they had to pick up the cards to find out what their names were at that hour of the day, or what their addresses were.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could clarify the point for me because I understand the power to issue polling cards, which are a purely advisory device without any legal standing, is by ministerial order under the Electoral Acts.  I wonder if the Minister could amend it or withdraw the facility altogether and avail of public <Col N="844" /> notices by way of newspaper advertisements or on television or radio.  This Bill is designed to prevent electoral abuses. Ability to be on two registers at the same time is confined to people who have the luxury of owning two houses or who are in the process of moving house &mdash; it is not a regular occurrence &mdash; but getting hands on a polling card is very easy and it happens in every election.  Therefore, in conjunction with this Bill I suggest that the Minister should give some indication when he is replying of whether he is in a position to consider seriously looking at all of this and later coming back to the House with a series of new instruments involving new procedure for the operation of elections.  It is in all parties' interests that every opportunity for abuse of the electoral system will be eliminated, and seen by ourselves to have been eliminated.</P>
    <P>This is a short technical Bill which proposes to amend section 3 of the 1923 Act. When we were consulted in relation to the Bill we made some comments and I wonder whether the points then made will tidy up the anomaly we are referring to.  Today we are trying to respond to an obvious loophole in the law as defined by a district justice.  I have not encountered anyone of legal standing who agrees with the reading of that district justice: even Justice de Búrca in Limerick did not share his view.  However, if the High Court upholds that view for some reason, what validity will this legislation have? Will it still be a case of a person who obtains a ballot paper for the second time being able to go in to vote and claim in his defence, on being challenged by a party worker, that it cannot be proved he had voted because of the McMahon case in 1972, because of the removal of the number from the back of the ballot paper?  It is a legal point and perhaps the Minister's advisers would let him know what the position is and he could respond at the end of the Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give us the reasoning behind the use of the word &ldquo;obtained&rdquo; in the proposed section 3 (b). &ldquo;Obtained&rdquo; can have a vague legal meaning in the hands of some lawyers.  Somebody who has already voted in Kinsealy <Col N="845" /> or Malahide might be challenged by one of the party workers and he might back off at the point of challenge.  Let us suppose a party worker is a bit enthusiastic and does not wait for the fly to come right into the spider's web and scares off the fly too soon.  The defence could be, if the wording of this section is as I interpret it, that because the person had not obtained the ballot paper from the polling clerk the offence did not occur.  Would the Minister clarify the thinking in the Department on the use of the word &ldquo;obtained&rdquo; instead of a word such as &ldquo;applied&rdquo;.  Paragraph (b) might read: &ldquo;Having applied for a ballot paper...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are talking about part of a process, and the co-operation of all parties has been given on the undertaking that loopholes in the system of election, like multiple voting, personation and so on, will be tidied up by the Minister with responsibility. Perhaps the Minister, if he is in a position to do so, will tell us what action he proposes to take, whether he will have further consultations with the different parties with a view to tidying up the procedures particularly in the matter of polling cards and postal voting.  The Labour Party support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party welcome the Bill with the reservation expressed by other speakers that there is a need to introduce legislation to tighten up the whole electoral system.  Neither Fine Gael nor Fianna Fáil can be exonerated in this respect.  A couple of years ago I had occasion to visit two adjacent polling stations, with two presiding officers. I saw people from a nearby institution being brought into the station and going to the polling booths accompanied by people who had received them at the door.  I mentioned this to an Opposition worker and said to him: &ldquo;You are a personating agent, why did you not do something about that?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;We have got our queue down there.  We have very few to get from the other one&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My point is that presiding officers who allow people to enter polling booths with voters who have asked for ballot papers, in any circumstances other than those specified in the Act &mdash; for instance, blind <Col N="846" /> persons &mdash; are guilty of an offence because they have the responsibility to see the provisions of the Electoral Acts are carried out properly.  I am not satisfied that has been done in the past and that is why we say legislation should be introduced to tighten up the procedure.</P>
    <P>We also advocate procedures by which people will be made conscious of the fact that this is a serious matter and that therefore they will not engage in offences of the kind we have been discussing.  We want to see further legislation introduced to tighten up the whole electoral procedure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The stated object of this Bill is to amend section 3 of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923 because in a recent case a district justice held that it was impossible to prove that a person had voted.  The district justice said he so held because it is not now possible to identify a voter by reference to his ballot paper as the voter's number does not appear on the counterfoil since a Supreme Court judgment held that that violated the secrecy of the ballot.  Now, in my opinion, it was virtually impossible at any time to identify a voter by reference to the ballot paper.  First of all, in the constituency concerned, about 70,000 ballot papers or something like that are involved.  One would have to have access to the counterfoils. Then one would have to go through every counterfoil until one came to the counterfoil with the voter's number. Having got that, one would have to start out on a search of all the ballot papers to get the counterfoil with the number which corresponded with the voter's counterfoil.  It was possible, but only just, and I am sure that that method of producing evidence was never resorted to in any prosecution since the foundation of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It follows, therefore that, strictly speaking, an amendment of the law is not necessary.  Section 3 of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923 is a short section.  It provides that every person who at an election applies for a ballot paper in the name of some other person. whether that name be the name of the <Col N="847" /> living person or of a dead person or of a fictitious person, or who having voted once at an election applies at the same election for a ballot paper in his own name shall be guilty of the offence of personation.  In order to establish an offence under the latter part of that section it is necessary to prove that a person voted once and that he applied for a second ballot paper.  In the case in question evidence was produced in court that a gentleman came into a polling booth, to wit, Malahide, applied for a ballot paper, got a ballot paper, went into the voting compartment, spent some time there, came out of the voting compartment, went over to the ballot box and put what appeared to be a ballot paper into the ballot box.  In my opinion that was sufficient evidence to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case that the gentleman in question had voted.  The case could have proceeded to a full hearing on that evidence and on that evidence there was an onus placed on the gentleman in question to establish that he did not vote.  It was held that there was no evidence that he did vote and accordingly the case was dismissed.</P>
    <P>We are now here to amend the law and to ensure that that will not happen again. What we are now providing for is that a person who applies for a ballot paper and gets one and then applies for a second ballot paper is guilty of an offence.  Section 3 (b) provides that a person who having obtained a ballot paper once at an election and applies at the same election for a ballot paper in his own name is guilty of an offence.  It might be no harm to insert there the word &ldquo;second&rdquo; and provide that a person who applies for a second ballot paper is guilty of an offence. It may not be necessary, but seeing that the first prosecution was dismissed under what at best was a very flimsy argument it might be no harm to insert that word.  I am of the opinion that the law as it stood was sufficient to enable a conviction to be made on the evidence available.  Having said that, I do not think it is any harm to amend the law to put it right beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Barry who suggested <Col N="848" /> that it would be a good thing to clarify the position regarding the penalty for the offence with which we are dealing. Section 6 (1) of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923 provides that a person who commits any corrupt practice under that other than personation or aiding, abetting or counselling or procuring the commission of the offence of personation shall, on summary conviction, be liable to imprisonment with or without hard labour for a term not exceeding one year.  It is as clear as the day that a person who is convicted of what is known as a corrupt practice, such as standing drink to motorists and so on shall be liable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i>&mdash;&mdash; to a sentence of up to 12 months.  It is also clear from subsection (1) of the section that it differentiates between the general offence of corrupt practice and the offence of personation. Subsection (2) says that a person who commits the offence of personation or of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of that offence shall in the case of the first offence be liable on a summary conviction to be imprisoned with or without hard labour for a term of not less than two months nor more than 12 months and to be fined a sum not exceeding £100.  It is clear from that, that that subsection creates a mandatory sentence and that the district justice has no discretion and once he convicts, a mandatory sentence of at least two months follows and it may be as high as 12 months.  Whatever else we say about District Justice Kearney or about his reasoning or the decision which he reached, it was clear from what he said that he understood that section to mean that if he convicted Mr. O'Connor he had to impose a sentence of two months at least on him because he said, if my recollection is correct, that because of the serious consequences and the serious penalties involved that he had gone very closely and carefully into the law regarding it.  At the moment, as I understand it, some district justices take the view that I take &mdash; and I think it is the correct view &mdash;<Col N="849" /> that whether or not we agree with it, section 6 (2) of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923 creates a mandatory sentence and takes away all discretion from the district justice.  Some district justices are interpreting that section accordingly; other district justices take the view that they can apply the Probation of Offenders Act and not impose any prison sentence.  That is unsatisfactory.  It should be clarified either by reference to the High Court or by amending the section so that it is beyond doubt.  The Minister should tell us why he did not avail of this opportunity to clarify the position in regard to penalties. A short section is all that would have been necessary.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Quinn when he said that polling cards seem to facilitate personation.  According to rumour, people collect polling cards in flats and regard them as a licence to vote.  I am not sure whether it is an offence to have polling cards in one's possession and not be able to give a reasonable account for having them or satisfy a garda that one is entitled to them.  If this is not an offence it should be one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to go into detail on the O'Connor case.  I take the view that it is <i>sub judice.</i> The creation of the position of Director of Public Prosecutions has been more than justified by the action which he has taken in this case.  He has done a great service in referring the case to the High Court.  If this had not been done all the water in the sea would not have cleansed the officers responsible for the administration of justice in view of cution of offences from the political sphere.  I also compliment &mdash; it is only right to do so &mdash; the man who more than any other was responsible for putting the Act which established the office of DPP on the Statute Book, Mr. Justice Declan <Col N="850" /> Costello.  At that time he was Attorney General.  He should be given credit for doing that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry said that there was some doubt as to whether the High Court, if it thinks proper, could send back the O'Connor case to the district justice with a direction that he was wrong in law and with a further direction that he should proceed to hear the case in accordance with law.  My respectful if somewhat stale opinion is that the High Court has power to send that case to the District Court, if it thinks fit, with a direction that the district justice should proceed to hear the case in accordance with law as outlined by the High Court.  I hope that is the law because if it is not people will come to erroneous conclusions which will not be in the interests of the administration of justice or the integrity of the courts.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Bill but I do not think it is necessary.  If I am wrong I shall be glad to know that the position is clarified and that the law is put beyond doubt.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Fitzpatrick I also take the view that the O'Connor case is <i>sub judice</i> and that any comments which might be made here might be less than helpful in ensuring there is an objective and proper determination of the issues before the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A distinction ought to be drawn in the law dealing with electoral abuses, dealing with two categories of people, between casual members of the public who might take it upon themselves to indulge in electoral abuses and another more important category who ought to have a much higher degree of responsibility in this regard.  I refer to those who are involved in the actual election one way or another.  That category would include the candidates, election agents, various subagents, personation agents, and all other members and associates of parties who have a specific role to play in the election system.  Many of those people are, by law, given special additional rights to play special roles in the election.  Many subagents are entitled at any time to go into various polling booths and attend to certain matters.  Personation agents have special functions under the law.  Consequently, <Col N="851" /> having special rights, they should carry also special responsibility and if it should transpire that any person who falls within one of those categories has committed an electoral abuse, a special penalty and special situation should apply to such a person.  That was the law for very many years in this country and such a provision so far as an election agent was concerned was made in section 7 of the 1923 Act.</P>
    <P>For some reason &mdash; I cannot imagine why &mdash; that section was repealed by an amending electoral Act in the sixties.  It is high time we had a look at that situation again and it would be advisable that the House should consider not only reintroducing that section as it was, but widening the scope of it to include not only the election agents themselves but also their sub-agents, personation agents and all those officials and sub-officials of political parties who play such a key role in ensuring that the democratic process would function in a proper manner.  It is on those people that the democratic system relies and section 7, if I remember rightly, places the responsibility on the candidate going forward to ensure that those persons will carry out their functions in a lawful manner and that section would have held the candidate responsible in addition to the agent or sub-agent who would be involved.  That is a very valid idea and concept, because the candidate ought to have a responsibility to ensure that those people who carry out important electoral functions in his name or as his agent or sub-agent would be persons of the highest character who would in no way be associated with or lend themselves to the practice of electoral abuse.  I ask the Minister to consider possibly amending this Bill, or otherwise when a detailed review of the electoral system would take place to consider the re-implementation of section 7 of the 1923 Act in a widened form.</P>
    <P>Reference was made here to the question of polling cards.  This is a problem that must be tackled because the present system clearly leaves the process wide open to abuse.  These cards are distributed freely and in many cases they accumulate <Col N="852" /> in large numbers in houses that are occupied as multiple dwellings.  I do not know whether it would be feasible or practicable to arrange for those cards to be sent out by registered post perhaps instead of by ordinary post.  That would have the advantage of ensuring that the cards would be signed for at least by a recipient and it would be possible to make a check on what person had signed for those cards.  I appreciate, however, that that would involve and perhaps create many problems in the distribution of those cards, but certainly the system cannot be allowed to continue in its present form.  I ask the Minister to have a look at that aspect of the matter also.</P>
    <P>Subject to those comments, certainly it is essential that this Bill be passed at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">

      <P>The Bill before the House this evening is of fundamental importance.  The balance of political power is so close here at present and on such a knife-edge that every vote cast in an election really counts.  Every vote is of fundamental importance and any abuse of or interference with this system is a matter of serious public concern.  The long-established principle of one man one vote is called into question if any person casts two votes in the one election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to go on record &mdash; Deputy Fitzpatrick has already said something about this &mdash; regarding the Director of Public Prosecutions.  His post is responsible and his duties onerous and the person who fills that position must be completely and totally above suspicion. Following the decision of District Justice Kearney a great outcry arose from the media, the Members of this House and people of all political opinions throughout the length and breadth of Ireland and the DPP was faced with a choice and had a decision to make.  To his credit, he has carried out his duties without fear or favour and in a most responsible manner. He has taken the correct decision in referring this case to the High Court for judgment. This House should place on record their congratulations to the DPP, Mr. Eamon Barnes, for discharging his duties <Col N="853" /> in a highly competent, efficient and public-spirited fashion.  His decision is made in the best interests of the public.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to dwell on the likely outcome of the decision of the High Court, but it is my view that if the important by-election had not been pending and if the High Court were left to make their decision, then this Bill would not be necessary because it is likely that the High Court's decision will not agree with that of the district justice.  However, this Bill is necessary because of the by-election and I welcome it in so far as it goes. The only thing I am sorry about is that we have the opportunity in this House of discussing electoral laws but not of discussing them in a calmer fashion and at greater length.  One matter that has come across from the Labour benches and our benches here this afternoon has been the common complaint in regard to polling cards.  I believe that it is necessary that the Minister and his Department would have a rethink about the whole situation in regard to the issuing of polling cards. Section 23 of the 1963 Electoral Act deals with the issue of polling cards.  They were issued to give guidance to people as to where they were entitled to vote, the voting number and so on, and it was believed generally that this would help to speed up the process.  However, the good intentions of the people who framed that legislation in regard to polling cards have been lost sight of, sad to say.  Polling cards nowadays are regarded generally as an admission ticket to vote.  This applies particularly in large towns and cities and in districts where there are many flats.  It has led to serious and widespread abuse. I am sure the Minister will give this matter his attention.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider if the issue of polling cards has attracted a greater percentage of people to vote than had been the case prior to the issue of polling cards.  I am sure the Department will be able to come up with an accurate assessment regarding the percentage of people who voted in elections prior to the issue of polling cards and of the percentage who have voted since then.  In my opinion it has not varied <Col N="854" /> more than one or two percentage points one way or the other.  During the last European and local elections polling cards were not issued in many areas because of the postal dispute operating at that time.  Many advertisements were carried in the local and national newspapers setting out the location of polling stations.  There was a satisfactory turnout at those elections.  I am not in favour just at this time of doing away with polling cards but the matter must be considered seriously.  The amount of personation that is taking place is a cause of serious concern.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal also with the matter of the double registration of voters, the reason this Bill is before the House.  Up to 1963 the preparation of the register of electors was carried out by county registrars or returning officers but since then it has been the responsibility of the local authorities.  I should have thought it would be the responsibility of the county manager or the county secretary to take responsibility for the preparation of the register of electors but I am not sure who has that responsibility.  It appears to me it is the responsibility of a staff officer, or someone of that status, in the rates office.</P>
    <P>I know of many cases where people are included on the register with two different addresses and I have known of people who have never changed their address but whose names have been removed from the register.  This is a serious infringement of their rights.  The stock answer given in such circumstances is that it is the person's responsibility to ensure that his name is on the register but I do not think that is good enough.  It is the responsibility of the local authorities to ensure that people who have the right to vote are able to vote.  The register should be compiled in a proper, efficient and thorough manner.  The taxation system and the right to vote are matters that are tied together.  The State is well aware of a person's whereabouts when it wants to collect taxes.  He should not be deprived of his right to vote on the day when he has the power to decide who will represent him in Government.  This is a very serious matter and it is something about which I am greatly concerned.  During <Col N="855" /> the last election I met people who were very upset when they found they could not vote.  The matter should be given top priority because it is a serious breach of democracy to deprive a person of the right to vote.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the matter should be given back to the county registrars because having regard to the increased workload they have to undertake I do not think they have sufficient staff to deal with this matter also.  However, the local authorities have the necessary staff.  The Minister should make it clear that the county secretary or the county manager &mdash; I leave him to make a decision about which one &mdash; has a responsibility to him to ensure that the register of electors is prepared in a competent and efficient way.  If the person given this responsibility fails to discharge his duty the Minister should take up the matter with him.  Perhaps the Minister is considering the possibility of setting up a working party to deal with this problem.  This Bill might not have been necessary if it were not for carelessness in preparing the register of electors.  However, I am concerned about elections in the future.  The present system is too haphazard.  A person does not know if his name is included in the register. Nowadays rate collectors call only occasionally to check on who is entitled to vote.  Local authorities will have to deal with the matter promptly to ensure that the register of electors is compiled in a much more accurate way.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to people who are physically handicapped and the problems they encounter when they wish to cast their votes.  People in wheelchairs find it very difficult to gain access to premises where polling stations are located and on some occasions they are unable to cast their votes.  On one occasion I saw an elderly, heavily-built man in a wheelchair requesting that the presiding officer would bring him his ballot paper but that request was turned down.  I am sure the presiding officer was quite within his rights in doing so.  I felt very sad when I saw that person being deprived of his right to vote.  I am worried about elderly people who are unable to <Col N="856" /> go up or down steps or who are ill at home and unable to vote.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied at the way the postal vote system worked on a previous occasion. I ask the Minister to consider voting by proxy.  It could be very strictly defined, one vote per proxy.  If a person was incapacitated or ill he could write to the county registrar giving his name and address and the paper, stamped by the county registrar, would be sent to the voter.  When the voter signed his ballot paper, he would return it to be stamped by the returning officier and another person would attend at the polling station to vote on his behalf.</P>
    <P>We have been far too casual in ignoring the rights of the elderly and those who are seriously ill or incapacitated.  We must also consider commercial travellers. A traveller might be in Donegal and unable to return home to vote because of financial reasons.  These people are entitled to vote.  Something should be done to help them, because the right to vote is a safeguard of democracy.  If a person is not in a position to cast his own vote he should be able to vote by proxy.  I believe this has worked in other countries and should be made a matter of public importance here.  I am surprised the media have allowed this situation to continue without mounting a campaign against it.  Recently a voice from these benches mentioned this matter, as did the wheelchair association, but there has not been a concerted movement to do anything about it.  I would congratulate the Minister if during his period in office he broke new ground.</P>
    <P>Regrettably election times are rough and tough.  People have a job to do but in many cases they cannot do it with kid gloves.  During one election &mdash; I will not say in which constituency this happened I saw voters from a mental institution casting votes.  These people were mentally ill &mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Those people had been canvassed a number of times but there <Col N="857" /> were no staff members with them when they came to vote.  We should introduce further safeguards for these people because the present system is very unsatisfactory. Many of these people are confused and the bustle and hustle at election time can cause them a great deal of stress which they might still feel some time after the election.  If I was asked to suggest a remedy I would say they should cast their votes from their home addresses.  We should try to improve the situation because it causes many problems.  There are only a limited number of staff in these hospitals but even with the best will in the world they cannot watch all the patients all the time, especially at election time.</P>
      <P>As the Bill stands, I welcome it but were it not for the pending by-election I do not think it would be necessary.</P>

      <P>This Bill must be the greatest joke to come before the House since the last general election and it is doubtful if between now and the next general election there will be another like it.  Are we serious when we deal with a Bill of this kind, less than half a foolscap page?</P>
      <P>Every Member knows there has been personation since the foundation of the State.  It existed many years ago when we were electing Members of Parliament to the British House of Commons.  Many years ago the late Alfie Byrne described the way Members of Parliament to represent this city were elected to Westminister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view there are in Ireland and in every other country what are known as electoral maniacs.  There are many different types of maniacs.  For example, there is the maniac who wants to see his name on the ballot paper, and whether he gets 5,000, 500, 50 or 5 votes does not matter so long as his name is on the ballot paper.  Then there is the other type, the man who cannot resist voting several times.  It is very difficult to stop a pickpocket carrying out what can only be described as his evilly disposed profession. It is a great strain on an alcoholic to pass a licensed premises.  We have Alcoholics Anonymous to deal with him.  We <Col N="858" /> will have to establish a new movement known as Voters Anonymous to deal with the man who cannot pass a polling booth on polling day without presenting himself in two or three different polling stations.</P>
    <P>Members on all sides of the House should sit down in an all-party committee and pool their experiences on elections, and present a proper Electoral Bill to the House to give us modern and efficient electoral laws through which a coach and four cannot be driven.  Our electoral laws are outdated.  They do not serve any useful purpose.  The addition being made will not strengthen them to any great degree.  This Bill has been introduced as a result of an incident which took place during the last general election.  That incident is still <i>sub judice</i> and it is not right or proper to refer to it.</P>
    <P>I would be failing in my duty as a public representative if I did not say that we have a Judiciary of a very high standard in the Supreme Court, the High Court and the District Court.  The district justice who dealt with the case which prompted this Bill is a man of outstanding integrity.  A district justice gives his decision on the evidence before him.  If a district justice has sufficient evidence to call for a conviction, he will convict the person.  A justice does not sit on the bench to convict people.  He sits there to administer justice in accordance with the law.  Many district justices, High Court Judges and Supreme Court Judges were Members of this House or associates of Members of this House, particularly those connected with the legal profession. They are all men of integrity.  We must give them proper laws to administer. They do not make the law.  They administer the law as they find it.  Members of this House make the law.  Anybody who suggests that our electoral laws are satisfactory shows a lack of experience of how they work.</P>
    <P>I remember that on one occasion in a general election there were 96 voters on the register for a particular polling booth. Ten were dead.  Four were ill in hospital on polling day.  Fourteen had emigrated or left the area to seek employment elsewhere. This meant 68 people were eligible <Col N="859" /> to cast their votes.  When the votes arrived to be counted, it was found that 93 people had voted.  That is a serious reflection on our election laws&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Some political speakers in the area said at the time that it was fair enough because there was not a 100 per cent vote.  Steps were taken by the local authority and that polling station no longer exists.</P>

      <P>Why was not some serious effort made before now to tighten up our electoral laws, despite the fact that there has been personation in every shape and form?  There have been convictions over the years but not to any great extent.  Those who were caught were brought before the courts, but what about the numerous cases of personation which were never highlighted?  I remember another election in the late forties or early fifties in which by devious means the electoral stamp was borrowed by a group of election enthusiasts.  If it was not borrowed it was stolen, and if it was not stolen it was obtained by some other means.  A book of ballot papers was taken as well.  We had one person marking the ballot papers with a pencil, another stamping them, and another going around to the various presiding officers who were known to these three persons. During a rush in the polling booth or at tea-time break the papers were dropped into the ballot box.  Many Members of the House may say that is too fantastic to believe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also the presiding officers who are dedicated to a particular party. Such a presiding officer will be anxious only to facilitate the political party in which he believes.  He too may be an election maniac.  Many people &mdash; and <Col N="860" /> perhaps the Minister would be the first to say it &mdash; may contend that if Deputy O. J. Flanagan saw a ballot paper being marked illegally on polling day he should go to the police and inform them.  That is not my job and was not my job any more than it was to have an inquiry conducted into how 93 out of 96 people voted, with 68 possible votes only recorded.</P>
    <P>The whole of our electoral laws at present are open to abuse.  The key man in any election is the presiding officer and there are presiding officers dedicated entirely to various political parties.  It is my opinion that, if such people can be found, a completely independent person should act in that capacity.  It is wrong to have people of strong political convictions acting in that capacity.  All they need do is to close their eyes to what is happening with regard to their party and open their eyes to what may be happening in a political party in which they do not believe or whom they want to see beaten.  Everybody knows that in this city and outside it there is what is known as the professional peresonator who first presents himself at a polling booth wearing spectacles and then later with, first, an overcoat and later without.  As has happened, the same person could be led in, assisted by his political colleague, wearing dark glasses and carrying a stick appearing semi-blind being presented with a ballot paper and voting accordingly. Nobody knows better than the Minister for the Environment that those of us who have been on the political scene for a long time, or whose parents were on the political scene over a long period, have listened to these polling day stories and stories of by-election incidents, such as the one I have just related.  When I conveyed that information to a former Minister, since dead, he threw up his hands in despair and said: &ldquo;Let us get out of this place right away or we will all be arrested.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The abuses of the electoral system that take place on every polling day are astonishing. There may not be sufficient votes in it to elect or defeat a candidate.  Nevertheless the present electoral laws are such as lend themselves to every type of abuse and the present system with regard to <Col N="861" /> polling cards is disastrous.  Something must be done about it.  Just as there is the fanatic who describes himself as a stamp collector or an erstwhile collector of cigarette cards, there is also the fanatic going around awaiting the delivery of ballot cards so that he can go to schools, colleges and flats and have these collected in preparation for his scheme of personation. Many presiding officers the moment a voter appears with a voting card and says: No. 86, No. 140, or whatever the number, without any further questioning looks at that voting card and hands out the ballot paper.  In my view voting cards have led to considerable electoral abuse.  Under electoral laws it should be a serious offence for any presiding officer to give an unstamped ballot paper because that is cheating a person of their vote, stealing their vote, denying them their vote.  The law should be such that it is deemed to be a serious offence on the part of any presiding officer who fails to stamp a ballot paper.  It has been established after elections that certain people who went into polling booths seeking their ballot paper, people who were not fully equipped with all the knowledge they should possess within a polling booth, just stretched out their hand for a ballot paper and received one unstamped, marked their paper and placed it in the ballot box.  On the following day during the count that paper would be disqualified because it did not carry the presiding officer's stamp.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a tightening up of the electoral laws such should be directed towards the administration of the polling booths and towards the authority vested in presiding officers.  At 9 o'clock in the evening presiding officers can wash their hands completely of every irregularity that may have taken place in the course of that polling day.  If a presiding officer has done a good job for the political party in which he believes, he will go home in the full confidence of a successful result the following day or, as the case may be, if there are good election agents of the opposition party, he may go home extremely disappointed contending that he had hard luck that day and did not achieve the results he thought he might <Col N="862" /> have within his polling booth.  I put it to the Minister that, if all voters are not angels, neither are all presiding officers. For that reason whenever there is to be a tightening up of our electoral laws I hope it will incorporate a code of conduct with serious penalties for any presiding officer who gives out two ballot papers, who knowingly gives a ballot paper to a person not on his list, who knowingly gives a ballot paper to John Browne, junior, when it should be John Browne, senior, or who gives a ballot paper to Kate Browne of a certain address when it should be Kate Browne of some other street.  In my opinion these are irregularities which should be suitably covered by electoral laws, meriting jail sentences, severe fines, or complete disqualification from participation in all future elections.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment should be represented at every counting of votes because numerous irregularities can take place at counts, even with the greatest alertness by the political agents present.  Votes are usually put into bundles of 50 and a label marked &ldquo;50&rdquo; put around them and a rubber band also.  It can happen that all these votes are then placed in tea chests and there is nothing to stop, by an alleged mistake &mdash; after hard work all day and this is late at night &mdash; some political opportunist at the count putting the bundle of 50 designed for Barry into Kelly's box or throwing two bundles of 50 which belong to Flanagan into Burke's box, or putting a number of bundles of 50 which belong to some other candidate into Desmond's box.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how, many years ago when I was first elected, due to the intervention of the late Dr. O'Higgins a particular tea chest of votes was thrown out and when it was emptied on the table it was found to contain three bundles of 50 of my votes.  As it happened, whether accidentally or deliberately, these three bundles were thrown into another tea chest.  The excuse given was that the counters were tired, that it was late at night and that they had been counting a whole day and a whole night; it was something that should not have happened.  If I had been depending on those 150 votes where would my seat be in this House? <Col N="863" /> What would be the situation of anybody who was the victim of a mistake of that kind?  There should be no room for mistakes when it comes to bringing to perfection the democratic right of people to vote, the proper destination of the votes, the proper and accurate calculation of the votes and the announcement of a proper count.  We have all these serious abuses of the electoral laws which must be put right.  Electoral law in my opinion is not designed to produce 100 per cent accuracy.</P>
    <P>If a person is to be charged with asking for a ballot paper twice, why is some charge not brought against the person who appears on two registers?  It is not enough to say that a person must be charged for asking for a ballot paper twice if his name appears on two or three registers &mdash; particularly on two registers. I think the voter must be involved in whatever changes are made in electoral law.  The voter should have the responsibility of inspecting the register to see that he is on it and that his name does not appear twice and, if it does, of directing the attention of the local council or rate collector to this fact &mdash; he will have a number of months to do this &mdash; to ensure that his name will not appear twice.  If his name appears twice on the register, after full investigation he should be liable for prosecution and fine.  If we are going to tighten electoral law let us tighten it in every way, leaving no loopholes so that you will not have a fancy nancy saying: &ldquo;I am registered as a voter here in this polling booth: I stayed for a short while in another area and I am off the register there.&rdquo;  The fancy nancy to her own full knowledge is registered with the sole intention of casting two votes when the elction takes place.</P>
    <P>The voter must accept responsibility for his own vote, his own registration and the obtaining of his own ballot paper, for seeing that it is stamped and for marking his ballot paper in secrecy and placing it himself in the box.  A person registered in two or three areas should be charged with an offence.  The Minister must know that the composition of the register of electors from the time it appears on the <Col N="864" /> election table is full of serious defects in every constituency.  Something will have to be done to ensure that the register is more accurate so as to avoid personation on polling day.  Accurate compilation of the registers of electors will leave no room for personation if everybody, or the majority of those available present themselves at the polling booth and ask for a ballot paper on election day.</P>
    <P>Not so long ago in my constituency we had the extraordinary spectacle of a polling booth having run out of ballot papers at 7 p.m.  This should not happen.  During the last election the mother of a little girl in my constituency presented herself to vote and when she was coming out the political agent outside said: &ldquo;Your daughter voted early this morning&rdquo;.  She said, &ldquo;My daughter did not vote because she is in Dublin and is not coming down.&rdquo; I told that lady she should have called the police there and then but she did not do so.  This woman in the area of Mountbolus in County Offaly said she was amazed that a register was produced and that her daughter had been marked off as having voted at 9.30 on election day.  The girl did not vote as she was working in Dublin and did not leave the city.</P>
    <P>This sort of thing is widespread.  It may not amount to more than 500 or 1,000 cases in the whole country in one day out of some 2 million voters, but it is enough if there is one case because it is an irregularity and should not happen.  Greater precautions will have to be taken in compiling the registers.  We should have an independent officer appointed by the Minister for the Environment present to supervise every count in the country.  I hope serious consideration will be given to this at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The electoral laws should clearly define the method of the appointment of presiding officers.  A garda used always be on duty in polling stations but it is a long time since I saw one in any of the polling stations in my constituency.  If a garda is walking up and down inside a polling station it will help to stop the electoral maniac who may be waiting outside to exercise his franchise for the second or third time.  It was a great mistake to dispense with gardaí in polling stations <Col N="865" /> on polling day.  It is not sufficient to have them driving around in patrol cars from one polling station to another.  There are enough gardaí driving in patrol cars around our cities and towns at night while crime is taking place.  We all see groups of gardaí on duty when the count takes place, directing traffic, shifting cars and regulating parking but they are not in polling stations on the day of the election.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is drafting comprehensive electoral laws I hope steps will be taken to ensure that gardaí are present at every polling station on the day the election takes place.  I also hope the people who are employed to count the votes will not have any known political affiliations. The new regulations will have to cover matters like this.  I am sure the Minister is aware that in many instances a person who is given a ballot paper can take it away from the polling booth and that this is how impersonation takes place.  A voter will go into a polling station and ask for his ballot paper.  When he gets it he goes to a polling booth and puts the ballot paper he got into his pocket and he puts a mock ballot paper into the ballot box.  A number of people can do that at various times during the day.  In the case of people about whose votes they are doubtful they will give them the ballot papers they have brought out of the polling stations after they have marked them and tell them to bring out their own after they get them without letting anybody see them doing this and put the marked ballot papers into the ballot boxes.</P>

      <P>I feel a little more qualified to give advice on the electoral laws than a lot of others because I have seen the electoral laws working at their best and also most disastrously.  If there is any breach of legislation which needs overhauling more than any other it is the electoral laws.  The Bill before the House has been welcomed by everybody because at least it is seen to define an offence.  Is it right that there should be a clear definition of one offence and there is not a clear definition of other offences which have taken place and are likely to take place in the future?  I suggest that the Minister, because of the concern of all political parties about tightening up the electoral laws, to ensure a high degree of integrity and to ensure a sincere expression of the voters' wishes to prevent abuses and to prevent the electoral laws being broken, should seriously consider a committee of this House to make recommendations to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can look back with amazement on those things happening in the early days of the State but we must wonder at them happening in 1982.  We now have young Fianna Fáil and we also have young Fine Gael and young Labour watching the polling stations.  Most of those are aspiring Members of this House.  How can they allow abuses of the electoral laws to take place?  Until we have new legislation to deal with this matter and to plug the holes in the electoral laws, abuses are likely to take place.  No matter how smart people are there are always others a little smarter.  We believe, as Members of this House who have contested elections on many occasions, that we know it all but we only realise when we meet others how <Col N="867" /> little we know.  I join with other Deputies who have welcomed the Bill.  I believe the time has come when comprehensive legislation must be introduced to prevent abuses in the exercise of people's right to vote.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Not so very long ago &mdash; in fact almost two years to the day &mdash; the House had an opportunity of debating for a similar length of time a Bill exactly like this one. Therefore, there is a certain sense of <i>déjá vu</i> about this debate.  The subject matter has been argued many times.  I have argued it <i>ad nauseam,</i> sometimes even in my sleep, but if there should be any sense of weariness in the phraseology which tends sometimes to sound like well-worn cliches, or if it should in any way dull the palate of the legislators in this House, I would wish to remove very clearly any such sense of tiredness.</P>
      <P>By virtue of being an open economy, a small people in a large Economic Community within which, as recent events have shown, we have very little influence, we suffer from many factors which make economic survival, let alone well-being, extremely difficult for us.  Many of those forces are totally outside the control and the decisions of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price of land within our society is not determined in Brussels, is not subject to the whims of the gnomes of Zurich or the vagaries of the oil market in Libya or in Saudi Arabia.  It is difficult enough for us to battle against the forces of international powers and of factors outside our control without having to wrap around our necks the absurdity of constraints which do not do anything for the well-being of the vast majority of our people.  We are talking uniquely about a totally self-imposed constraint.  The area we are talking of is one of the few remaining to us in the sovereignty of the Republic in respect of which the House does not have to have regard to the UN Charter, to the Treaty of Rome or to the prevailing price of oil on the open market.  It is therefore for that reason alone that the failure of successive Governments to deal <Col N="869" /> with this problem is perhaps the biggest scandal that our generation of politicians are bequeathing to anybody who has been trying to buy a home in the past decade and a half.</P>
    <P>As a result of political pressure in the mid-sixties, of which as a young student in the school of architecture I was part, being a member of the Dublin Housing Action Committee and very much in the vanguard of it, the Government of the day, headed by the then Deputy Lynch, brought out what was known as the Kenny Report.  Perhaps it is appropriate at this stage to give recognition to the fact that Justice Kenny retired prematurely recently from the Supreme Court.  A member of that report team who was then a little-known economist working in the backroom of the Taoiseach's Department has since been elevated.  I refer to Deputy O'Donoghue whose input into the document which became known as the Kenny Report was a major one.</P>
    <P>Since being elected to this House in 1977, apart from my temporary elevation to the Seanad from 1981 to 1982, I, perhaps more than any other Deputy &mdash; and I am not taking any personal credit for this &mdash; asked every six months to the day as to what the Government were doing in regard to the Kenny Report.  As the Minister's files will show the stock answer was dusted down and wheeled out on each occasion with monotonous precision, that was, that the Government were reviewing legislation with a view to implementing the Kenny Report.  When any of us asked how soon that would be we were told that it would be &ldquo;in the near future&rdquo; or in the &ldquo;foreseeable future&rdquo;. During all of that time the price of building land was soaring in real terms relative to the cost of house prices.  This is not just pub talk or everyday experience on the part of ordinary individuals.  It has been fairly accurately documented with substantial case studies both by An Foras Forbartha and by private students doing theses and studies of one kind or another in the various third level institutions.</P>
    <P>By way of summary of my introduction it is fair to say that at a time when this country is organising faster than any other in Europe and at a time when <Col N="870" /> Dublin is growing at a rate faster than that of any other capital city within the Community, the failure of successive Governments to deal realistically and adequately with the problem of house prices, of the provision of housing and of housing lands, is a national scandal.  It is, I suggest, a scandal for two reasons.  First, because it is a self-imposed constraint. We were not prevented by any outside factor from dealing with the problem. Secondly, our failure in this regard enabled a tiny proportion of people within our society to become obscenely rich at the expense of the community. There are couples tonight who are paying off mortgages, who will continue to pay them for the next ten or 15 years, and a large portion of the monthly payments which they have difficulty in meeting will be purely for the benefit of land developers, speculators and fortuitously-placed pirates who were enabled by the failure of this legislation to capture the community-created value of that land and retain it for their own personal benefit without any form of taxation which would recycle back into our economy the benefit of the community value so created.</P>
    <P>What does the Bill seek to do?  It seeks to redress what the Labour Party has long and consistently argued and identified as an unacceptable and unjustifiable social evil that is unquestionably sustained by forces which I cannot fully understand within the House for the benefit of a tiny minority of people who would not even provide a quota of votes in a by-election and who, I suspect, would not purchase them either notwithstanding the debate we have had in the last three hours.  This has gone on since 1967 and at every twist and turn it has been able to hide itself behind the phrase which now surfaces yet again in the Minister's carefully worded amendment:</P>
    <P>(i)  in view of the probability that its provisions are repugnant to the Constitution;</P>
    <P>Since 1967 we have had the possibility of finding out whether it was constitutional by going through the simple mechanism of legislating the Kenny Report signalling, <Col N="871" /> as the Minister for the Environment did in relation to the Bill dealing with private rented accommodation, that the provisions may raise some constitutional difficulties. Within the proper operation of our Constitution the President is enabled to refer a Bill to the Supreme Court and obtain from that court within 60 days a decision on its constitutionality.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is a valid legal view surrounding the question of constitutionality on the whole question of designation. I have always accepted that it was a valid view and I do not share the views of the negative participants who say that it is unconstitutional but I recognise that they have a case.  Where, in the name of all that is reasonable in our society, is the justice in not doing anything since 1973 when the report was published, when we could have had a formal decision within 60 days after a Bill had gone through all Stages of both Houses?  The first argument that is trotted out is the one put forward by the Government in their amendment.  The Labour Party are arguing today and I suspect they will have to argue again, that our Bill meets the objects of the Constitution, and reasonable interpretations by reasonable members of the Judiciary &mdash; that is a presumption that is not necessarily based on fact but let us run with it for the moment &mdash; will be that it meets in balance all Articles of the Constitution.  I am not referring to the flannel Articles that come in after Article 45, which are there for window-dressing and for which no judge has to have legal regard.</P>
    <P>In the Bill we are arguing that if a person selling a piece of ground in an area designated by a local authority through an open and clearly democratic process under which a person affected may lodge an objection and, in the end of the day, appeal to the Minister, ends up holding land of a certain type in that area, he will be paid what the land is worth, no more and no less.  In addition we propose that the lands tribunal be given the power to provide adequate compensation to take into account dislocation and restarting costs if such a person wished to restart his business in <Col N="872" /> another location.  It is argued by some that because we are giving somebody what the land is worth it may be equated to an arbitrary confiscation of property rights and that, somehow or other, a person is entitled to more.  I should like to put on record what the situation is at present.  Under the present open market system the value of land is not based on what it is worth but on what it can achieve, subject to certain factors being taken into account.  For example, when Dublin Corporation acquired from a coal merchant land across from the Minister's office on the side of the Liffey, what was a coalyard, it was not compulsorily purchased on the basis of the going rate for a coalyard on the edge of the quay with a good view of the Custom House but on the basis that it was theoretically an office block with all the profit that accrues to an office block.  And so in 1973-74 it sold at a price equivalent to £100,000 per acre.  Ordinary residential development land in Tallaght at the same time was trading for £10,000 per acre.</P>
    <P>The argument that sustains that kind of pricing and mechanism is similar to saying that if somebody goes to sell a secondhand car that has 50,000 miles on the clock and is a bit battered, it really is not a five-year-old volkswagon if one looks at it through glazed eyes and thinks of the real potential development value of it but is, in fact, a new car, without any dints on the body or miles on the clock. One is saying that one should pay the price of a totally new car rather than the of any other way I can try to explain the difference between hope value and existing value.  But how anybody could argue that the very general clause in the Constitution about property rights which guarantees to any property owner the full value in existing use terms of what they hold as being unconstitutional or contrary to the provisions of the property clause in the Constitution is inexplicable.</P>
    <P>There is another factor in this.  A landowner who happens fortuitously to have his land rezoned &mdash; recent events in the area of County Dublin suggest that it is perhaps not a fortuitous rezoning but subject to a certain degree of lobbying <Col N="873" />&mdash; suddenly finds, as <i>The Irish Times</i> indicated recently, that land which trades in North County Dublin at agricultural use price value of approximately £2,500 to £3,000 per acre, as a consequence of such a decision trades at a minimum price of £25,000.  This is for land for which there was no possibility in the foreseeable future of services of any kind and, consequently, of planning permission being granted by the local authority.  That additional £20,000 odd of value per acre was in no way created by the owner.  The owner could not magically add to the quality or quantity of the value of the land.  Yet, until the Bruton budget in January last, if that landowner had held that land for a long period of time, the additional value which was effectively added to the property by virtue of the legal decision of the local authority was captured by the individual and retained for his or her exclusive benefit.</P>
    <P>One could argue at great length on what has been known in this on-going debate as the equity argument in relation to land prices.  For anybody with a sense of justice and fairness, other than somebody who believes in the innate inequalities of our society and in good luck or whatever, there is no utilitarian or moral argument in favour of windfall profits of the nature which we are discussing, particularly in the case of people who do nothing to make those profits come about, or who take no risks whatever in bringing about such added value.</P>
    <P>I propose to move from the equity argument and to make perhaps, as far as the Labour Party and I are concerned, an equally pressing argument of a much more utilitarian nature.  I said at the outset that the city of Dublin in particular, but the country in general, is becoming rapidly urbanised.  We are the most rapidly urbanising State within the Community, Greece nothwithstanding. Even allowing for the accession of Portugal we will still be the second fastest, if not the fastest, urbanising society within the Community.  There are many reasons for this, with the net effect that the demand for urban space, whether for homes, factories, schools, community centres, or infrastructural services, is <Col N="874" /> absolutely enormous.  The cost of such urban space and of providing services to ground, of providing motorways, electrified trains, playing fields, schools, churches and community centres is increasingly expensive.  Having regard to the present state of public finances it is obviously beyond the capabilities of the Government and the present capacity of the economy to provide these.</P>
    <P>If we do not now move to seriously regulate and plan the growth of urban Ireland we will be building into the urban fabric of our society structural injustices from which it will be impossible to extricate ourselves for at least one to two generations.  Some of us like to pride ourselves on not having a class-based society with real class distinctions.  If there are people in this House who support that view &mdash; and I want to put on record that I do not support it, because I believe there are class distinctions, both social and economic, in our society &mdash; who, for whatever reasons, think that we are still, by contrast with France, Germany, or Britain, a society within which formal class divisions and distinctions do not effectively exist, then I would earnestly tell them that if they allow the present development of our urban areas, whether in Limerick, Cork, Dublin or, indeed, smaller towns like Galway and Waterford, to continue within the present landownership structure, serious structural class ghettos will be built into the nature of our urban areas between now and the end of this century.  We simply are not in a position &mdash; and every Deputy who is a member of a local authority will concede this, irrespective of what side of the House he belongs to &mdash; to service all the land currently zoned as residential, or for development purposes in general.  There is not the slightest hope that any administration would be in a position to do so over the next ten to 15 years.  That is not a great admission for anybody in this House to make.  At present, the local authorities cannot organise the phased investment of scarce development capital into areas for urban development because of the way in which the present system operates.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies are having some <Col N="875" /> experience at present in Dublin West and are probably familiar with just what that actually means on the ground, but the reality for any couple trying to get a house on the outskirts of Dublin is, firstly, they have to attempt to unravel the labyrinthine operations of the Finance Housing Act. Then if the hard-pressed and decent officials of Dublin Corporation have the patience to explain how long it might take to get a loan under the excellent legislation called the Housing Finance Act and can actually interpret the Minister's mind, and the couple can afford to stay on bridging loans for the length of time it requires, and manage to buy a house in west County Dublin, it is quite likely that they will buy one in an area in which the provision of schools, the extension of CIE's erratic public transport system and the delivery of such things as safe play areas for children will all come in a totally haphazard and unplanned way.</P>
    <P>It has perhaps become unfashionable to talk about the difficulties of suburban areas and in some cases to over-exaggerate them.  It is, however, not for nothing that general practitioners have described certain areas of suburban Dublin as Librium Valley or the Valley of Valium, and so forth.  It was not for nothing that quite recently a major practitioner at the IMA conference talked about the disintegration of aspects in our society brought about by pressures of unco-ordinated and unplanned suburban growth. Despite the repeated attempts on paper of the local authorities to plan for the co-ordinated development of our urban areas, the fact that they cannot effectively manage our land resources &mdash; which is the stage upon which all this development will take place &mdash; virtually negatives all their efforts from Day One.  Those sound like very sweeping phrases and there is, undoubtedly, a degree of deliberate exaggeration in some of the adjectives, purely to bring home to the Minister and the House the desperate need for action in the area.</P>
    <P>We can actually do something about it. There is nothing in the Treaty of Rome which prevents that.  We are not going to earn for ourselves the wrath of Prime <Col N="876" /> Minister Thatcher, or put the unity of the country at stake and certainly we are not going to endanger a peaceful solution to the Falkland Islands crisis if we handle this problem.  What we may very well do, however, is upset a number of very substantial supporters of the two major parties. That may be a problem to which this House should get a response.  In all the arguments put forward against the implementation of such a measure I have yet to hear a coherent, rational and well argued one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do so and hopefully it will be slightly better argued than that argued by the Minister's predecessor in June 1980.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the Minister's amendment. I appreciate I am speaking to people who are more than familiar with the provisions of this measure and with the issue itself.  However, lest the record should be deficient in that regard, I will simply refer any readers of this debate to the substantial contribution I made on Second Stage on 3 June 1980, because the arguments I made then still stand.  I want to take account of the fact that time has moved on and that there have been some discussion and fiscal developments since that time.  I also have had time, in conjunction with a number of experts, to look at aspects of the Bill suggested by me on behalf of the Labour Party.  As I said on another occasion to the Minister, we deliberately did not change the text so as not to undo any of the briefing material which had been prepared in advance for him.  The same arguments which were used in 1980 no doubt will still be used now.  Leaving that touch of levity to one side, it could be argued in this House that the most effective way to intervene in this on the grounds of equity is to do it through the capital taxation system, and section 2 of the Minister's amendment makes that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of equity, it is my considered view &mdash; although I am open to be persuaded otherwise &mdash; that <Col N="877" /> recourse to budgetary action alone or fiscal action alone will not reduce the end cost of the building product, whether it is a house, a factory or a building centre, to the user.  The end cost of the product will remain the same.  It is arguable that the introduction of taxation of capital gains will have the initial effect of putting up the price on the grounds that the vendor of land will need to have more net cash into his or her fist in order to release the profit.  It becomes rather boring for a socialist in this House to explain the workings of capitalism to Members who profess to defend the free enterprise system but, nevertheless, I shall try to do so. Initially, if the amendment was to be implemented it would probably have an inflationary impact on land prices in areas adjoining urban centres.  Therefore, the end cost would not be cheaper and it would possibly be dearer in the short term before the market readjusted itself. There is much precedent in taxation circles to sustain that point of view and that argument.  Unless the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister for Finance were prepared to concede by right and by law that all the taxation raised by way of some form of CGT went automatically to the local authority within which the transaction took place and that the proceeds from such a transfer were to be considered in isolation from any capital grant that the Department of the Environment would grant, then the benefits of betterment on which this whole argument rests would not accrue to the local authority and, consequently, to the community. Perhaps the Minister would clarify that point.  In so doing he might also clarify a point that is currently agitating a large number of people in the property development area, and to whom reference has been made, that in the collapse recently of a major company the operation by the Revenue Commissioners of the 30 per cent deposit scheme is a contributing factor to extreme liquidity problems with consequent depression in the market. Can the Minister explain the use of fiscal measures to achieve equity in this market. as well as maintaining efficiency?</P>
    <P>The press should take note of the last point of the Minister's amendment <Col N="878" /> because it marks a very significant departure by successive Fianna Fáil Governments on this question.  It is not insignificant that it occurs under the leadership of Deputy Haughey, the Taoiseach, whose connection with benefits from land purchase and sales is clearly a matter of public record.  I say this with a certain degree of caution because I do not wish to be personal; but my reading of part 3 of this amendment is that, for the first time, Fianna Fáil are now clearly moving away from any commitment to introduce effective legislation based in whole or in part on the Kenny Report.  If I am misreading it, I would be happy to be corrected. Fianna Fáil set up the Kenny Committee.  From 1977 to 1981, in official replies to questions in the House they stated they were in the process of preparing legislation, legislation which Deputy Barry in his regrettably all too short occupancy of the Custom House found was in a very infantile state.  Fianna Fáil are now signalling in this House and to everyone whose door is being knocked on in Dublin West tonight that, after all the years of promises, there is no commitment from the party of reality to introduce legislation based on the Kenny Report.</P>
    <P>There is something even more ominous contained in the amendment, and I shall welcome clarification from the Minister on it.  While I have been critical of decisions by local authority members in relation to the question of re-zoning, the right of local authority members to make mistakes is something that should be safeguarded at all times in view of the added intrusion by the Custom House into one of the few remaining areas of autonomy that local authorities have.  I may perhaps have been harsh in reading into part 3 of the amendment the abandonment of a commitment to introduce legislation but my reading of additional measures tends to show that.  It would be a significant political departure if the Minister were to confirm what I suspect is behind this.  It would also be confirmed by the repeated refusal of the Taoiseach to consider any form of constitutional amendment other than that in relation to the pro-life lobby and to indicate that legislation based on <Col N="879" /> the Kenny Report is probably repugnant to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>We have reached a serious stage when, after all these years, the consensus which is shared on all sides of the House in relation to the recognised and perceived need for legislation has now been apparently abandoned.  The Minister has a duty to clarify that point.  There is a certain amount of <i>déjà vu</i> in this debate.  The Labour Party are convinced that legislation based on the document before the House is essential for the well-being of our community.  We have no guarantee that it will work magically or super-efficiently, but we have every reason to believe that, brought in on a phased basis &mdash; and there is provision in the Act for that &mdash; it can regulate the present haphazard operations of the market to the benefit of everybody.</P>
    <P>We are more than prepared when we get to Committee Stage to discuss changes or amendments in relation to the operation of the Bill.  We do not propose to have some kind of a monopoly of technical wisdom in this area or of commitment to achieve an equitable solution. The Workers' Party have put down an amendment to the objectives of the Bill. We honestly say that it is time for a serious response to this problem because if such is not forthcoming growing numbers of our young people will not thank us for the way this Legislature have abandoned it.  I thank the House for agreeing to hear the debate.  In the spirit of co-operation within the House I am asking the Minister to respond to the points made and to the political arguments we made elsewhere.  A reasoned debate here would demonstrate that the House has the political will to enact legislation covering this area.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dail Éireann declines to give a second reading to the Bill:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> (i) in view of the probability that its provisions are repugnant to the Constitution;</P>
    <P>(ii)  because of the actions which the Government have taken in the Budget to ensure that a major part of the increased value of development land will accrue to the public through the substantially increased capital gains taxes on disposals of such land; and</P>
    <P>(iii)  because the Government intend to take whatever additional measures may be necessary to ensure that land is made available to local authorities for development free of any element of speculative gains, in line with the aims of the Kenny report, and to review the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 and 1976 in regard to the zoning of land by local authorities and the operation of Section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955 in relation to planning decisions.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This Bill is similar in all respects to a Bill which was presented by Deputy Quinn to this House on 12 May 1980. The present Bill even contains the same minor printing errors as the 1980 Bill and the only differences that I can see between the two Bills are that the date and price are different.</P>
    <P>The 1980 Bill was debated in this House on four days during June, 1980. On that occasion, only Labour Deputies spoke and voted in favour of the Bill. Fine Gael abstained from voting but spoke against the Bill while Fianna Fáil speakers adopted the only sensible and realistic approach in relation to it: they suggested that while action was necessary in relation to building land and the profits which could be made by individual landowners or speculators, the Bill represented an entirely inappropriate and unworkable response to what is undoubtedly a very serious and complex problem.</P>
    <P>In winding up the 1980 debate, Deputy Quinn indicated that he was prepared to accept that there were many ways in <Col N="881" /> which the Bill could be improved.  However, the Deputy has now chosen to reintroduce exactly the same Bill.  One can only regard this as a cynical and dishonest exercise &mdash; a cheap playing to the gallery in the hope of gaining electoral benefit. I suggest people are not going to be fooled that easily.</P>
    <P>If the Labour Party and Deputy Quinn were serious about this Bill, surely they would have arranged to have it re-introduced here during the period when they and their Coalition colleagues had an effective majority in the House and formed the Government of the country. During that period, official resources could have been made available by the Government in order to improve the Bill in whatever way Deputy Quinn had in mind when he spoke here in 1980.  But no such action was taken.</P>
    <P>It is true that the infamous Gaiety Theatre document contained high sounding pledges to take action basically similar to that proposed in Deputy Quinn's Bill.  But no such legislation was presented to this House by the Coalition Government during their period of office and, so far as I am aware, no such legislation was being prepared by them. Against this background, I think I can justifiably claim that Deputy Quinn's decision to trot out his 1980 Bill for a further four-day debate is nothing more than an exercise in political opportunism. I have little doubt that it will be seen in this light by the Members of this House and by the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to examine the Bill presented by Deputy Quinn, section by section, because this would only be a waste of the limited time available to me. Instead, I propose to concentrate on the major matters of principle involved and to show conclusively that, while the Bill may appear to be a simple and easy solution for unthinking people, it is not the kind of solution that any responsible administration could adopt or, indeed, can it be described as a solution at all.</P>
    <P>We cannot, in this House, be selective in our approach to the personal rights enshrined in the Constitution and we cannot adopt an interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Constitution which <Col N="882" /> would conflict with that of the Supreme Court.  The Oireachtas is precluded by the Constitution from enacting any law which is in any respect repugnant to the Constitution or any provision of it.  I believe that this Bill is not, in fact, consistent with the Constitution and I shall elaborate on this for the benefit of those Deputies who do not have closed minds on the subject.  Such Deputies, I believe, form the vast majority in the House.</P>
    <P>The Kenny Majority Report dealt in some detail with the question of whether various schemes to deal with the price of building land would be repugnant to the Constitution.  The report advised &mdash; and I quote now from paragraph 101:</P>
    <P>that the jurisdiction to designate an area must be conferred on a Court established under the Constitution if it is to be valid.</P>
    <P>However, Deputy Quinn's Bill completely ignores this basic principle of the Kenny scheme and, instead, proposes to give local authorities a discretionary power to designate the land to which the scheme would apply.  Personally, I feel that any scheme based on designation by a court would be cumbersome, costly, time-consuming and generally unsuited to the task involved.  But, if we are talking about implementing the Kenny Majority Report, we cannot get away from the fact that the authors of the report felt that the scheme would be consititutional only if the whole process were handled by the courts.  Under Deputy Quinn's scheme, the elected members of local authorities would have an almost unfettered discretion to designate the land which would be acquired on the basis of current use value, subject only to confirmation by the Minister for the Environment.  They would be responsible for dividing up their functional areas into areas where a normal free market in land would apply and areas where the market would be restricted and would operate on a current use value basis.</P>
    <P>I very much doubt whether our local councils would ever be prepared to operate such draconian legislation but if they were to do so, could their actions be described as anything other than a discriminatory <Col N="883" /> and, therefore, unjust attack on property rights?  There is no doubt, therefore, that the Supreme Court would be obliged to view Deputy Quinn's scheme as an unconstitutional one.</P>
    <P>Indeed I venture to suggest that one would not need to be a judge of the Supreme Court to reach this conclusion. On the contrary, any fair-minded man-in-the-street would surely consider it to be inequitable that parcels of land being acquired for development should be valued on two entirely different bases, even within the same county, with one landowner getting, perhaps, ten per cent of what another is able to obtain.</P>
    <P>That is exactly what Deputy Quinn's Bill would achieve and that alone is enough to make it unconstitutional.  I might mention in passing that it is hard to reconcile Deputy Quinn's readiness to confer such wide new powers on local councils with the constant barrage of criticism levelled by his colleagues at the use of the existing powers of planning authorities to rezone land for various forms of development.  Any benefits or disadvantages conferred by such zoning decisions would pale into insignificance when compared to the effects which the provisions of the Bill would have on land values.</P>
    <P>Even if the Bill now before the House retained the High Court as the designating authority, as well as all of the other fundamental provisions of the Kenny Majority Report, the constitutional question would still be a very serious one.  The majority report stated in paragraph 110 that the meaning of the articles in the Constitution dealing with property rights is uncertain.  But that was written in 1973 and, since then, major judgments on the relevant articles have been delivered in the High Court and in the Supreme Court.  The time available does not permit me to go into these in detail but I wish to draw attention to just two points arising from the judgments.</P>
    <P>First, in analysing the constitutional position, the majority report assumed that the Rent Restrictions Acts were not unconstitutional, nothing that &ldquo;nobody has ever suggested this in the thousands of cases under those Acts which have <Col N="884" /> come before the Courts&rdquo; (paragraph 88). Yet, in 1981 the full Supreme Court &mdash; of which Mr. Justice Kenny was than a member &mdash; held that substantial parts of those Acts constituted an unjust attack on property rights and were therefore contrary to Article 40, Section 3, (2) of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the majority report took the view in paragraph 88 that the property rights referred to in Article 40, Section 3 of the Constitution, are those specified in Article 43.  It was reasonable for the authors of the report to adopt this view since it had been expressed in a 1960 Supreme Court judgment.  However, in its 1981 judgment in relation to the Rent Restrictions Acts, the Supreme Court expressly stated that &ldquo;the Court is unable to accept this view&rdquo; and went on to explain that there is a double protection in the Constitution for the property rights of the citizen.</P>
    <P>My reason for making the foregoing points is to demonstrate that there are weaknesses in the argument for the constitutionality of the scheme put forward in the Kenny Majority Report.  Developments in constitutional law in the last ten years have rocked the structure of the Kenny scheme to its very foundations and this Bill, by eliminating the High Court from the entire process, seems to remove the foundations entirely.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Attorney General to examine the general legal and constitutional issues which arise from the Kenny Majority Report, so that an authoritative up-to-date opinion, taking account of the judgments to which I referred earlier, will be available to the Government in assessing the options available.  I might mention that my predecessor made a similar request to the former Attorney General last year but the latter had not concluded his examination when the last Dáil was dissolved.  The review by the Attorney General will be a vital input to the Government's further consideration of the land prices issue.  Pending completion of the review, I can only say that the advice available at present is that there are serious doubts about the constitutionality of the Kenny scheme.  There is, however, no doubt but that the modified <Col N="885" /> scheme proposed in the Bill now before the House is unconstitutional and I must, therefore, ask the House not to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the constitutional issues, the Bill presented by Deputy Quinn raises a number of other serious issues.  It would have major staffing implications for local authorities and could generate demands for heavy capital investment.  It could seriously disrupt the land market, adversely affect the building industry and reduce the numbers it employs.  There would be a serious risk that every stage of the procedure would be resisted in the courts and that the delays in making land available for development in designated areas would frustrate rather than facilitate the development of those areas.  There would be a strong possibility that development would shift to non-designated areas, with adverse consequences for orderly planning and for the provision of services. Local authorities and their officials would be placed in a very difficult position and the Minister for the Environment would be left open once more to accusations and allegations of the kind formerly levelled against Ministers for local government who had to deal with planning appeals.  These and other factors lead inevitably to the conclusion that the scheme proposed in Deputy Quinn's Bill is unsatisfactory and inappropriate and that it would create far more problems, hardship and disruption than any problems and hardship it is designed to meet.</P>
    <P>The availability and price of building land are critically important issues and the Government are determined to deal with them.  A start has already been made on the taxation side.  One of the last acts of the Fianna Fáil Government before the June 1981 General Election was to introduce, by way of the Finance Act, 1981, major new provisions designed to counter complex tax avoidance schemes which had been devised to reduce liability to income tax and corporation tax on profits or gains from dealing in or developing land.  On our return to office last March, we reviewed the changes in capital gains tax proposed in the January budget.  In order to crack down on exorbitant <Col N="886" /> profits from dealing in building land, and to ensure that a significant proportion of windfall gains resulting from the provision of local services are returned to the community, significant changes were decided on and announced in the budget statement of 25 March.  A capital gains tax rate of 50 per cent on gains from disposals of development land was announced, 5 per cent higher than the rate proposed in the Coalition's budget.  A new rate of 60 per cent is being introduced for gains within one year of acquisition and a 40 per cent rate will normally apply where land is compulsorily acquired.  In addition, there are new restrictions on certain reliefs hitherto available; these restrictions affect the indexation relief, roll-over relief, and the right to set-off losses.  These are substantial changes and, in addition to generating much needed revenue, they should help to allay public concern about the tax-free fortunes which are sometimes alleged to be made from land speculation. I should also mention the budget proposal for a special new charge on derelict sites.  This should discourage the hoarding of such property for capital gain as well as the resulting urban blight.</P>
    <P>An approach based on taxation is one way of dealing with the land prices question. But it is not, in itself, a complete answer and for that reason, other options are being considered by the Government. Time does not permit me to deal with all of these but I wish to mention some of the major ones.</P>
    <P>Under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, the Minister for the Environment has power to control house prices generally and a specific power to control house site prices through the CRV system.  In particular, a CRV can be refused if the Minister is not satisfied that the amount of the cost or value of a site included in the overall house price is reasonable.  The Minister may apply a maximum site value and refuse a CRV in any case where the cost of a site included in a CRV application exceeds that value.  There is provision also for giving rulings in advance on site cost-values.</P>
    <P>The operation of these provisions of <Col N="887" /> the 1979 Act would present considerable practical difficulties and the powers have not been used to date.  A single maximum site value could not, for example, be prescribed for County Dublin as a whole or for the peripheral areas of any other large urban area; instead, one would obviously have to take account of factors which would justify disparities in site values as between one location and another.  The implications of this in terms of expert staffing and information needs are formidable. Notwithstanding these and other difficulties, I am having a fresh look at the possibility of activating the now dormant provisions of the 1979 Act in order to introduce a specific measure of control over house site prices.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Governments have always taken the view that the supply of serviced land is a vital element in any consideration of the problem of urban land prices.  It has been our objective to bring about a significant increase in the supply of land for housing, industrial and other development by making additional funds available to local authorities in the major growth areas for new water supply, sewerage and drainage schemes.  Our recent record in this regard speaks for itself. Between 1977 and 1980 the overall public capital programme provision for public water and sewerage schemes was almost doubled &mdash; from just under £25 million in 1977 to almost £47 million in 1980.  In 1981 &mdash; my own first year as Minister &mdash; £66 million was provided for these services.  However, the sum of £76 million originally provided by the Coalition Government for public water and sewerage schemes in 1982 represented a reduction in real terms on the 1981 provision, when allowance is made for increased construction costs.  Their proposed capital provision was not adequate to allow a substantial volume of major new schemes to start this year.  Furthermore their original provision of £4 million for public schemes eligible for FEOGA aid was substantially less than the projected grant liability in 1982.  On returning to office, one of my first priorities was to review the sanitary services programme. <Col N="888" /> I have been able to allocate an extra £7.4 million for public water and sewerage schemes over and above what was proposed in the Coalition's budget. This brings the total allocation for 1982 to £87.4 million &mdash; an increase of over 30 per cent on last year's figure.</P>
    <P>The provision of adequate water and sewerage services is a necessary pre-condition for the whole process of economic development.  In particular, this programme is essential if there is to be an adequate supply of building land.  The price of such land, in common with that of most other commodities, is affected by the laws of supply and demand and if we can maintain and increase the supply, there is every reason to expect that this will be reflected in the price.</P>
    <P>The acquisition of land by local authorities well in advance of development would be a significant step towards ensuring that development value accrues to the community and that speculative gains are not made on foot of the provision of public services.  The long-term benefits of such an approach are clear, but we have to balance against this the shorter-term job creation opportunities that may have to be foregone if capital is diverted to land acquisition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are in favour of forward land acquisition on as wide a scale as possible and we are considering what measures could be devised to ensure that major local authorities can have available sufficient capital to enable them to acquire land at reasonable prices to meet future housing and other needs in their areas.  In addition, we intend to explore the possibility of inducing financial institutions to acquire and hold land for release to local authorities to meet their future requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The acquisition of land by local authorities for various forms of development can be retarded and sometimes frustrated by the state of the law in regard to compulsory land acquisition.  My Department has been reviewing this complex body of law with a view to formulating proposals for changes designed to streamline and <Col N="889" /> speed up the process.  Tentative proposals have been produced, taking account of the legal and constitutional constraints and I am awaiting the advice of the Attorney General on these before deciding how best we might proceed.  This is not the occasion for a detailed discussion of these proposals but I wish to mention one particular suggestion which is being seriously considered.  What I have in mind is the possible introduction of a system under which local authorities would have a right of pre-emption in respect of any land offered for sale in defined areas, whether new development areas or obsolete or other areas in our cities and towns. This system could possibly be grafted on to the existing CPO system and it could be a very useful weapon in the armoury of a local authority.  It would not only enable the authority to acquire title to land quickly but would also considerably strengthen their hand in securing orderly development.</P>
    <P>In my contribution to the budget debate on 30 March last, I already informed the House of my intention to carry out a general review of planning legislation.  As part of that review, I intend to look at the use by local councillors of section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, in relation to planning decisions.  I know that section 4 is an important part of the balance between the reserved and the executive powers of local authorities and I would be reluctant to see planning decisions removed from the scope of this provision.  However, there appear to be genuine grounds for concern about the way in which the section is being used in a limited number of areas as a means of discarding reasonable and necessary planning considerations in particular cases.  I will have to see what can be done to meet that situation.  I also intend to examine the provisions of the legislation under which land zoning and re-zoning decisions are made by planning authorities. I have no wish to undermine the basic responsibility of elected councils for making and reviewing development plans.  However, I am concerned that the manner in which these powers are being used is causing a great deal of public <Col N="890" /> concern.  There is the impression in the public mind that fortunes are being made overnight as a result of decisions made without proper consideration of all relevant planning issues.  The figures of estimated gains which are bandied about in the media and indeed by some politicians are often exaggerated, to say the least, but if the operation of the system is such that allegations of this kind can be made, there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for taking action to allay public fears and suspicion in this regard.</P>
    <P>I hope that my remarks this evening will be seen as an indication of the bona fides of the Government in relation to the building land question.  This is one of the most intractable problems faced by Governments throughout the western world and I am not aware of any easy solution to it.  What seems to be required is a package of interlocking measures rather than an attempt to bring about radical change overnight and I have referred to various possibilities which I will be considering.  There is also a real need for a more informed public debate on the whole issue.  Something will have been achieved if the discussion on this unfortunate Bill helps in that direction.</P>
    <P>Building land is an essential raw material for an industry employing almost 100,000 people.  The wellbeing of this industry is my direct responsibility as Minister for the Environment.  So too is the achievement of the Government's ambitious housing targets.  The Government cannot risk the jobs of thousands of men in the building industry and the momentum of the housing drive simply to implement the policies proposed in this Bill.  Even if the proposals were consistent with the Constitution &mdash; and they are not &mdash; they could put many jobs in jeopardy, at least in the short term.  I have no wish to be a party to such a move and I, therefore, ask the House to refuse a Second Reading to the Bill and accept the amendment put down in my name.</P>
    <P>It is significant that Deputy Quinn, on behalf of the Labour Party, introduced this Bill.  He spoke about the fact that the Kenny Report came out in 1973 and the fact that since he came to the House in 1977 he has consistently asked if any <Col N="891" /> action has been taken on this.  I remind him that his party formed part of the Government from 1973 to 1977 when the Kenny Report was available and long before the subsequent Supreme Court decisions which have cast such doubts on its constitutionality.  His party were part of the Government from June of last year up to the beginning of March and we did not see hide or hair of the Bill.  I suggest, as I have already said, that it is to obtain a cheap political advantage at the time of a by-election in west County Dublin.  If it was bona fides as the Deputy claims, they would have taken action long ago.</P>
    <P>Compare their lack of action with the package we have in our amendment, the action we have taken on the capital gains side and the action we intend to take.  I spell it out:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... whatever additional measures may be necessary to ensure that land is made available to local authorities for development free of any element of speculative gains, in line with the aims of the Kenny Report, and to review the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts 1963 and 1976 in regard to the zoning of land by local authorities and the operation of section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955 in relation to planning decisions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is constructive action, not the reintroduction of a Bill, with minor drafting amendments, which Deputy Quinn did not bother to change from the time when he introduced it originally.  I ask the House to reject the Bill and accept the Fianna Fáil Government amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am intrigued by the last part of what the Minister said and indeed by his speech in general, and his avoidance, when he was concluding, of any explanation of the point raised by Deputy Quinn.  I suppose it is understandable that the Minister would not have had it for reply in his script because Deputy Quinn had not raised the point then, but when the Minister spoke off script for the last four or five minutes of his speech he did not answer &mdash; this is <Col N="892" /> significant &mdash; the point made by Deputy Quinn in regard to the Kenny Report. He spoke of measures of reaction and the re-introduction of an inadequate Bill and he asked the House to accept the Government amendment which states:</P>
      <P>(iii)  because the Government intend to take whatever additional measures may be necessary to ensure that land is made available to local authorities for development free of any element of speculative gains, in line with the aims of the Kenny Report,...</P>
      <P>What does that mean or how is it proposed to achieve that if there is no control on the price that local authorities pay for land?  Does it mean that the Government will subsidise the local authorities to pass that land back to individual builders minus the price assessed as being speculative between the time the purchaser from whom the local authority buys, acquired the land and the time the local authority purchased from him?  It would be very difficult for anybody in this House to vote for an amendment as woolly and imprecise as that.  It is really buying a pig in a poke as far as this House is concerned. The Minister said that the introduction of the Bill in the House could be relevant provided the debate opened up a new discussion on this very contentious and important aspect of legislation, and he introduces quite a linking amendment by the standard of amendments coming in here in Private Members' Time.  The third part of it appears to promise much and indeed obviously took some thinking out and putting together, but the Minister did not enlarge on it in his speech.  That makes me, like Deputy Quinn, very suspicious of what the Government have in mind.  The only indications I can get from the Minister's speech as to what they have in mind if the House accepts that amendment are, and I quote from the Minister's speech:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have in mind is the possible introduction of a system under which local authorities would have a right of pre-emption in respect of any land offered for sale in defined areas, whether new development areas or <Col N="893" /> obsolete or other areas in our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware &mdash; I am open to correction &mdash; this is a totally new conception which has not been put forward by any Government in this House previously. I do not know what it means:</P>
    <P>...would have a right of pre-emption in respect of any land offered for sale in defined areas,...</P>
    <P>Does that mean that if some of this famous rezoned land in County Dublin was offered for sale the local authority would have the first right of refusal on that?  If that is so, what price would they pay for the land?  Would it be market price?  The amendment mentions: &ldquo;development free of any element of speculative gains&rdquo; that may have been made by the owner of the land.  Has that any precise meaning in law of which I am unaware?  It may well be that &ldquo;the right of pre-emption&rdquo; has a precise meaning that would define this to anybody reading the Minister's speech, which I think all Members of local authorities should do&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because a lot of other dynamite is hidden under the straw in that speech.  Of course, the Minister will not be replying but I hope that whatever Minister or Minister of State comes in to contribute to this debate next week will spell out for the House precisely what is meant by that, because it is not at all clear to me what the Minister has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The amendment refers to</P>
      <P>...any element of speculative gains, in line with the aims of the Kenny Report...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That indicates to me that in seeking a basis to control the price of land the Government are moving backwards.  The Minister concluding his speech said that he could not find tittle or tattle &mdash; or some such term &mdash; of concern in the <Col N="894" /> Department regarding the Kenny Report.  This shows either that he is not telling the full truth to the House or that he made no inquiries.  If he had inquired he would know that from virtually the first month we were in office &mdash; I give credit to Deputy Quinn for this &mdash; at the insistence of Deputy Quinn we set out to try to formulate some legislation that would deal with the situation given all the pitfalls that my party see in this legislation and in the previous Bill introduced by Deputy Quinn and in the Kenny Report. The last Government established a committee composed of the Attorney General, the special adviser to the Taoiseach, an officer from my Department, and I think an officer from the Department of the Taoiseach but I am not certain of that.  Deputy Quinn attended at least two of those meetings.  Therefore it is not true to say that nothing was done during those seven months.</P>
    <P>It is true, as the Minister says, that this was under the chairmanship of the Attorney General and the committee had not reported back by the time we left office. I presume that whatever papers and documents were available to that Attorney General have been passed on to the present Attorney General and that whatever that committee achieved in that regard and whatever progress they made, that achievement and progress will be available to the present Attorney General and that we will see some light at the end of this tunnel.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that he intended to review the provisions of the local planning and development Acts, 1963 and 1976 in regard to the zoning of land by local authorities and the operation of section 4 of the City and County Management Act, 1955 in relation to planning decisions.  He said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>As part of that review, I intend to look at the use by local councillors of section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, in relation to planning decisions.  I know that section 4 is an important part of the balance between the reserved and the executive powers of local authorities and I would be reluctant to see <Col N="895" /> planning decisions removed from the scope of this provision.  But there appear to be genuine grounds for concern about the way in which the section is being used in a limited number of areas as a means of discarding reasonable and necessary planning considerations in particulars cases.</P>
    <P>I have considerable reservations about many of the uses to which section 4 is put in a limited number of areas &mdash; I agree with the Minister here &mdash; and I do not think that I am using too strong a word when I say &ldquo;threat&rdquo; but I will resist any threat to the basic rights of elected members because of a limited amount of abuse under the Planning Acts.  I hope all members of local authorities will read the Minister's speech and will resist this threat. There are abuses of section 4 in a limited number of areas, but I would estimate that less than 10 per cent of the authorities abuse that power.  Some abuse disgracefully and no party can claim to be blameless in this regard.  In some areas there is evidence of collusion between parties in regard to section 4.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated:</P>
      <P>But there appear to be genuine grounds for concern about the way in which the section is being used in a limited number of areas as a means of discarding reasonable and necessary planning considerations in particular cases.  I will have to see what can be done to meet that situation.</P>
      <P>I do not think any reasonable person could take any other meaning from that statement than the one I have indicated, that is, that the Minister intends to amend the 1955 Act to remove from councillors their rights under section 4.  I warn the Minister that he should not travel along that road.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn is quite right in criticising both our parties but his own party are not guiltless in some areas.  At least 80 per cent of elected local representatives are very jealous of their rights under the Act and very conscious of their responsibilities and we should not do anything to upset that.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to state:</P>
      <P>I also intend to examine the provisions of the legislation under which land zoning and re-zoning decisions are made by planning authorities.  I have no wish to undermine the basic responsibility of elected councils for making and reviewing development plans. However, I am concerned that the manner in which these powers are being used is causing a great deal of public concern.</P>
      <P>That is a fair comment but I would be very loth to see any more powers taken away from elected representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A development plan by a local authority is not written on tablets of stone and the Act insists on a review of such a plan every five years.  A review will certainly mean changes affecting various areas and this amounts to rezoning.  The elected members for any area are the people best <Col N="897" /> qualified to deal with this matter, but I also recognise the dangers.</P>
    <P>In a spectacular case in Dublin the whole county council constituted themselves as a committee for discussing the development plan.  What happens in effect is that when a particular area is being discussed the only people who turn up are the elected members in whose electoral ward the area is.  The best way around this problem would be internal to the members of Dublin County Council, and I refer to this body only as an example. I am sure it is true of any local authority or of this House that 90 per cent or 95 per cent of the Members are honest and politicians get a bad name because of the other 5 per cent or 10 per cent.  I am sure these proportions reflect the population as a whole and in that sense we represent the people.</P>
    <P>When I held office as Minister for the Environment I wanted to push power back to elected representatives, not to take it away from them.  We were discussing earlier another aspect of democracy but there is no substitution for a community being responsible for organising and managing their own affairs.  I am now saying publicly what I have often said privately on this topic.  I should like to see the day when the Custom House would be depopulated and all power would be transferred to the local authorities, in spite of all the faults, warts, temptations and pressures to which people are subject at local level.  I still think this is the right place to have the authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech also stated:</P>
    <P>In addition, we intend to explore the possibility of inducing financial institutions to acquire and hold land for release to local authorities to meet their future requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that financial institutions such as building societies, banks, and others will naturally release the money without any interest charges in ten years' time because they exist for the good of the community and will not want any reward for holding land until <Col N="898" /> the local authorities require it.  This is the kind of fiction and the lack of reality frequently found when dealing with financial matters.  Financial institutions, whether they are banks or pension funds, gather from a post of small savers money that is surplus to their needs.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Kiltimagh (Mayo) TV Equipment Seizure.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment to point out that I intend to apportion the time available to me with my colleagues.  The issue concerns the transmission of signals in the Kiltimagh area carrying programmes originating from outside the country.  No doubt the Minister will point the finger at me and say I am condoning a breach of the Act.  I am not doing that and, as I develop my argument, I hope the Minister will accept that.</P>
      <P>The Act was framed substantially in 1926 and it belongs to its own time, long before any of the mind-boggling developments of modern technology were heard of.  The confiscation of equipment in this case took place under section 8 of the Act.  The Act and that section must be looked at in the light of Articles 34 and 37 of our Constitution.  Indeed, there is also a large question mark hanging over the action of the Minister in seizing the equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know if the Minister is prepared to accept that all citizens of this country should be treated equally.  He knows that for many years people along the east coast, because of an accident of geography, have had available to them programmes originating form outside the State.  He knows that RTE are the official licensee and that no other agency within the State enjoys that status.  Many years ago I was told that State monopolies could be justified in cases where essential services could not be provided, or be expected to be provided, by the private sector or where the State in the national <Col N="899" /> interest had to take over.  There are many examples of this.  Hence, it was decided that RTE would be the soie agency through which licences could be granted.</P>
    <P>In the case of TV signals, the requirement of private sector inability is not fulfilled in this case.  In fact, the reverse is the case.  We have a situation where in the case of Mayo only two towns, Castlebar and Ballina, could hope to be given a service that included programmes originating from outside the country through the present RTE licensing set-up. Smaller towns and the whole rural region cannot expect this service to be provided by RTE simply because it would not be economically viable.  Does the Minister think we have not reached the stage of mental and emotional development where our innocent minds can be safely exposed to the so-called dangerous influence of the BBC or UTV?  If he does, let him say so; but he will find we are not as innocent as he thinks we are.  Here is a case where the private sector can provide the service much more efficiently and at a lesser cost than would be provided by the official agency, RTE.</P>
    <P>In the case I referred to in Kiltimagh a man, using his imagination and technical skill, provided a service for the community. This man did not set out to make large sums of money on the provision of the service.  In all cases the consumers were queueing up to pay what they regarded as a reasonable sum for this facility.  Here was a classic case of self-help. The Minister is aware that in the west we have been accused in the past of the béal bocht, of looking for hand-outs from the corridors of power.  In this case a community was prepared to pay for the facility, using the imagination and the technical skill of a member of their own community.  Yet, the Minister comes along and pulls the plug and deprives people of what they had provided for themselves, without one cent cost to the Department or the Government.</P>
    <P>Why this area, why this man?  Is the Minister aware that at the moment there are at least 30 such operations, both in the west of Ireland and in other parts of the country?  One can take Donegal, <Col N="900" /> Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Clare, Kerry, Roscommon, and, would the Minister believe, a large conurbation west of this city that happens to fall within the confines of the constituency of Dublin West. There are many cases of this particular operation and the Minsiter so far has failed to take action.  He has singled out a man living in an area that has been deprived of the facility through the official agency.  As has been said by the Minister of State, he has applied the law in this case.  I am not condoning breaches of the law but if the law is to be applied let it be applied with equality and let natural justice be seen to be done.</P>
    <P>Why was the directive given by the Minister in this case when at the same time very many areas in the country have similar operations?  The Minister cannot deny that.  His officials know that is so. Within the jurisdiction of his own Department there is a range of activities that can be deemed to be illegal.  For example, illegal telephones are being installed.  People can purchase these telephones off the shelf and provide for themselves extensions in their homes and businesses without permission from the Minister.  Is the Minister aware that radio telephones in this city are being operated illegally?  Does he know that throughout the country a whole series of pirate radio stations are operating?  Indeed, many of his colleagues have availed of the opportunity to go on air on these stations to propagate their message at election time. There is a whole range of illegal activities taking place under his nose.  What about videos?  Are they not in breach of this Act?  I assume the Minister will say that is a matter for the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to apply the law with equality.  I am not seeking vengence in respect of other stations operating illegally under the Minister's terms of reference. What I am asking is that the equipment seized be returned, that the Act be amended to ensure that a service equal to that available along the east coast will be provided to every man, woman and child who needs it, and that knowing the difficulties and delays in having Acts amended, in the interim a temporary licensing system should be applied <Col N="901" /> and licences issued to these people so that they would be brought within the law, and that the whole matter would be looked at and tightened up.  Then nobody would find himself in breach of the unamended Acts.</P>
    <P>These are resonable proposals and, as has been said elsewhere, I cannot see any social, economic or political justification for what the Minister has done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me a few minutes to endorse what has been said by Deputy O'Toole.  Since 1948 the Minister's name has been enshrined in the hearts of the Mayo people because he was one of a small band of 15 who inflicted a defeat on us on a different field.  His decision to have this equipment confiscated, and the way in which this was done, has inflicted his name on our minds again, and not to our liking &mdash; and I do not mean that in a personal sense.</P>
      <P>This equipment was confiscated under section 37.  Whether the statute is constitutional is something I am not in a position to decide.  If the Minister attended a meeting in any part of the region which was served with that facility, he would find he was in a most unpopular position. At a meeting last night, attended by 700 people, some of his party members and Dáil colleagues named him as being the person with responsibility for this matter and the only person who could rectify the situation and grant the terms of the resolution which had been sent to the Department as a result of several meetings in the area.  The Minister's action was taken to protect RTE who, because of their inefficiency, were unable to provide a system and a range of facilities that are available by geographical location and history to the people on the east coast.  Because of the inventiveness, motivation and self-help attitude of several people in the west, they were able to bring this facility into the homes of many thousands of people at a very reasonable rate, and at no profit.  As a result of the Minister's irresponsible and dastardly action they are now deprived of this facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not stand here as a nationally elected representative and condone <Col N="902" /> something that is illegal.  I do not think the method of retransmission has interfered in any way with the signals or with the material in those signals.  In fact, it is helping the wavelengths on their way while providing a facility which has not endangered the culture of our western people.</P>
    <P>The survey carried out to decide whether we should have RTE 2 or the rebroadcasting of BBC to the west was conducted almost in its entirety on the east coast and the people there with their five channels, decided what channels should be given to people in the west.  As I said, due to the inventiveness and motivation of certain people in the west this facility was made available but it has now been denied us by the Minister's action.  If the Minister carries on like this, he must also take to task the pirate radio stations which are springing up every day and which cannot be taken off the airways and he must take similar action in every other county where a similar facility exists.  This decision was not taken in justice.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to tell us that he is looking at this as a matter of extreme urgency, that he is prepared to have the equipment returned to the mast in Kiltimagh which will allow the signals to be sent over the airways into the homes of those who want it and that, as soon as possible, he will make an amending order to the relevant Act to make this matter legal.  This will not interfere with the vested interests which were given to contractors in many towns for piped television. The Department's decision to allow piped television contracts in towns like Castlebar is a blind for RTE's inefficiency because by the time that happens, with rights of way, cost of cable at £1 a foot, satellite television will be available for every town and community. Piped television in rural Ireland is not on; it is only for urban areas because any house a short distance into the country cannot avail of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's action is deplorable because he has deprived ordinary progressive people of a facility of which they availed for some time.  There are more important things for this Government to <Col N="903" /> do than take away a service which provides television reception for many people.  PRSI used to mean pay-related social insurance; it now means Please Return Signals Immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No one on this side of the House condones or approves of pirate stations.  I strongly disapprove of them, although I have very often been invited to speak on pirate stations and have always refused.  Having said that, I disapprove of them because I do not believe in people taking the law into their own hands and I believe in statutes being obeyed even where the statute itself is questionable.</P>
      <P>I put down a question to the Minister which will soon be on the Order Paper. I will give him a preview of my views on this subject.  While everyone disapproves of people breaking the law, the Minister should be willing to defend that law if it is restrictive of people's rights, and must be willing to defend it by criteria which the law and the Constitution recognise as adequate for supporting a restrictive code.  This legislation restricts two ordinary rights.  It restricts property rights in as much as it purports to cut down the right of the Deputies' neighbours to conduct the business of retransmitting signals. This legislation, on which the Minister relies, even if it is ostensibly adequate for that purpose, cuts down the right to do business.  It also cuts down the right of free expression which must imply the right to transmit and retransmit and pass from one person to the next opinions and expressions which do not amount to an opinion &mdash; a joke is a form of human expression and a song, let it be ever so banal and base, is an expression as well &mdash; covered by the constitutional guarantee.  If restrictive legislation in these areas is to be justified in a country like this &mdash; Britain is another matter &mdash; with a Constitution which has a Bill of Rights built into it, it must be able to point to social or economic values of a kind which the Constitution recognises as adequate to support a restriction of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that those grounds or <Col N="904" /> values exist.  I will be waiting with interest when the question is reached on the Order Paper to hear the Minister tell the House what these values are.  My suspicion is that the value, when all the verbiage and flummery are stripped away, is nothing more than preserving the financial position of RTE.  Whatever little authority I have in this area of expertise, I am willing to stake on this assertion. Preserving the monopoly of RTE so as to maintain their revenues is not a value capable of supporting or justifying a restriction either of property rights or of the rights of expression of the citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions. I listened with interest to what they said about the seizure by my Department of free broadcasting equipment in Kiltimagh.  I know Deputy Kelly has impugned the statute and I look forward with some interest to hearing what he has to say about it later on.  He said the statutes will have to be defended until they have been struck down.  The statutory position is that it is an offence to be in possession of wireless telegraphy apparatus without a licence issued by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  In this case my Department had reason to believe that unlicensed wireless telegraphy apparatus was being used for retransmission of television programmes in contravention of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926.  Deputy O'Toole mentioned that it was section 8 of that Act we were relying upon.  He was right in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope to meet a delegation from Kiltimagh shortly.  I have been in touch with Deputy Morley and Deputy Calleary and I told Deputy O'Toole today when I was talking to him that I will be meeting people from Kiltimagh shortly to explain the position generally to them and to hear whatever representations they may wish to make in the matter.  The equipment was seized on 5 May 1982 on foot of a search warrant issued under that section of the Act which was mentioned and which was impugned by Deputy Kelly.  I want to put it on the record of the House that in press reports the value of the equipment confiscated was variously <Col N="905" /> given as something between £7,000 and £10,000.  My officials assure me that the list price of the equipment as of this morning is £965 approximately, plus VAT.</P>
    <P>I cannot refer to the details of this case for obvious reasons, but I should like to put on record the fact that my Department published notices in provincial newspapers recently warning operators and potential subscribers to these systems that the Department would seize such equipment and that the operators would be liable to prosecution.  Unlike what Deputy O'Toole said, the Department have done this before and have done it successfully.  It was not taken any further than the court in the first instance, so Deputy Kelly's contribution does not come into consideration her.  In Waterford and in Leighlinbridge we prosecuted successfully before this, so it is not a question of picking out one place for selective treatment.</P>
    <P>Apart from these systems being in breach of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, my Department are also advised that a breach of the copyright protection afforded to the BBC and IBA against the re-broadcasting of their signals under the Copyright Act, 1963, and the Copyright (Foreign Countries)  Order No. 2, 1978, also arises.  I wonder whether Deputy Kelly will have any comment to make on that aspect of it.</P>

      <P>My antennae are too sensitive. As I said, this is reflected particularly in the proliferation of illegal radio stations throughout the country, the attempts which have been made to establish illegal television stations and this phenomenon of re-broadcasting stations. The operators of all these systems appropriate any frequencies and operate at any powers that suit themselves, in total disregard for national and international law and of other users of the frequency spectrum.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the radio frequency spectrum is a scarce natural resource which is used by a multitude of services in every country in the world at sea, in the air, and in space.  In order that these various services may co-exist without harmful interference with one another, there must be international agreement and regulation regarding the use of the frequency spectrum.  Ireland is bound by the International Telecommunication Convention which lays down that all stations must be established and operated in such a manner as not to cause harmful interference to the radio services of other countries which are members of the International Telecommunication Union.</P>

      <P>The radio regulations under the convention provided that no transmitting station may be established or operated by a private person or by any enterprise without a licence issued by the Administration of the country to which the station is subject.  Against this background of international agreements, the operators of illegal broadcasting stations in particular have placed this country in an embarrassing position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other members of the International Telecommunication Union.  Within the State &mdash; I am not saying this happened particularly in Kiltimagh &mdash; there have been numerous complaints of interference <Col N="908" /> caused to various authorised radio services by the many categories of illegal users of wireless telegraphy apparatus. Re-broadcasting stations have been offenders in this respect.</P>

      <P>In this regard it is my intention shortly to introduce the Independent Local Radio Authority Bill which will provide an orderly framework for the development of local radio services here.  It is also my intention to introduce concurrently with the Independent Local Radio Authority Bill the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill which will strengthen the powers of my Department to deal effectively with unlicensed broadcasting stations and other categories of unlicensed wireless telegraphy apparatus.  This Bill was on the Order Paper of the Dáil at its dissolution in May 1981 but was not re-introduced during the term of the Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>I regret any inconvenience caused to the people of Kiltimagh.  I look forward to having a frank discussion with them when they send their delegation as soon as a meeting is arranged.  There is one possibility I feel I must mention.  There is a statutory order which exempts from the licensing requirement Cable TV systems with fewer than 100 subscribers.  I understand there are fewer then 100 subscribers in the Kiltimagh area.  It is worth considering.  Kiltimagh was first brought to my attention at school in the poem which says: &ldquo;Go Coillte Mághach rachad, go ndéanfad cuairt miosa ann, agus beidh fáilte romham, Tá cairde agam ann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 12 May 1982.</P>

      <P>The person concerned, who has been in receipt of disability benefit continuously since 1977, is qualified for the receipt of an invalidity pension.  A form on which to claim the pension has been issued to him and on its return he will be transferred to invalidity pension.  The authorisation for free travel will also be issued to him at the same time.</P>
      <P>The claimant was not entitled to a double week's payment in December 1981 as the extra week's benefit was not payable to disability benefit recipients.  No additional payment was made to any social welfare recipient in September 1981.</P>
      <P>As he has been in receipt of disability benefit under the Social Welfare Acts he is not entitled to any cash payment under the Health Acts.  As the recipient of an invalidity pension, however, he will automatically qualify for a medical card which entitles him to free treatment under the Health Acts.</P>

      <P>An applicant in the Disadvantaged Areas in both the Cattle Headage and Sheep Headage Schemes in 1981 could be paid on a total of 30 livestock units (equivalent to 200 ewes) between both schemes.</P>
      <P>An applicant with 200 ewes could be paid the maximum payable of £1,750 (not £1,820) &mdash; i.e. payment at a rate of £9.50 on 150 ewes and at a rate of £6.50 on the remaining 50 ewes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An applicant with less than 200 ewes but with enough cattle to bring the total livestock units up to 30 could not be paid the maximum of £1,750 because the rate <Col N="701" /> of payment on cattle was not as favourable as on sheep.  For example, an applicant with 160 ewes (24 livestock units) and six livestock units on the cattle side could be paid £1,490 for sheep (150×£9.50+10×£6.50) and £192 on the cattle side (6×£32, the rate payable per cattle livestock unit), i.e. £1,682 in all.</P>

      <P>It was not possible to provide service at the same time as for other applicants in the area because of a fault in the cable.  As a result of the diversion of the staff to repairs of flood damage etc., the cable in question has not been attended to.  It is expected however that service will be provided in about a month. <Col N="716" /> It is normal practice to offer a refund when the installation of the telephone cannot be completed within three months of date of payment.  This will not delay further the provision of service.</P>

      <P>Details of the number of breakdowns involving more than one line are not readily available and would take a disproportionate amount of time to obtain.  I regret that there has been delay in repairing underground cable faults which require attention by specially trained staff, in the Dublin area generally, but there have been no special problems in the Blanchardstown area in the past 12 months.  A special programme of preventive maintenance is in hands for the entire 01 area and this will improve the service gradually for all subscribers. <Col N="717" /> If the Deputy will let me have details of specific complaints I will have them investigated.</P>

The medical referee on that occasion expressed the opinion that he was incapable of work.  Arising out of the report of the second examination the claim was reviewed and payment was restored with effect from 8 February 1982.  All disability benefit due from that date to 15 May 1982 has now been issued.</P>

    <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 28 July 1981 and was paid from 31 July 1981, fourth day of incapacity, at the maximum appropriate rate. The payments issue regularly on receipt of medical evidence of incapacity in my Department and all disability benefit and pay-related benefit due to 10 May have been paid.  All the cheques issued to the address quoted by the claimant on the original claim form and on the medical certificates.  The claimant reported the non-receipt of cheques on three separate occasions.  Replacement action has already been taken in respect of the two cheques which issued 10 December 1981 <Col N="756" /> and 5 February 1982.  A form of indemnity had been issued to him in respect of a cheque which issued on 23 April 1982 and on return of this form replacement action will be taken in respect of this cheque.</P>

He has appealed against the disqualification of his claim and his case has been referred to an appeals officer for determination. His entitlement to unemployment benefit will be reviewed in the light of the appeals officers' decision in respect of the period in question.  Payment of unemployment benefit was allowed from 23 March 1982. However, payment for a two week period was inadvertently delayed due to misfiling of papers but the arrears were included with current weekly payment of unemployment benefit which was paid to him on 7 May 1982.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 26 February 1982 but, as he failed to submit continuing medical evidence in support of his claim, no payment was made on the claim.  It has been confirmed from his employer that he is still absent from work through illness.  Payment of disability benefit for the period 26 February to 6 May 1982 has now been authorised.  A cheque in respect of arrears of benefit due, less the amount of supplementary welfare allowance advanced has been issued to him. He is not entitled to pay-related benefit as his weekly flat-rate disability benefit exceeds his average weekly reckonable earnings in the income-tax year 1980-81.</P>

I have asked the Garda authorities to inquire into the matters raised in <Col N="798" /> the letter and to let me have a report as soon as they can.  However, it is likely to take them some time to carry out the inquiries and I will communicate the outcome to the Deputy in due course.</P>
