      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 3, 10 (resumed) and 11.  Private Members' Business from 7 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. will be No. 22 (resumed).  It is proposed to interrupt business at 3.30 p.m. and to suspend Standing Orders under Standing Order 139 (1) to enable the Taoiseach and the leaders of the parties in Opposition to make statements not exceeding 20 minutes in each case on the situation in Lebanon and the role of UNIFIL, to enable statements not exceeding ten minutes each to be made by another member of each party and by each of the Independents and to enable the leader of each party or his nominee to make a reply not exceeding 15 minutes in each case.  The Order of Business will be resumed thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope so, yes. As the Deputy knows, we endeavoured to involve the Opposition parties in the major function in which the Government was involved, namely the reception the other evening.  I was delighted to see the Deputy there in very good from and his gracious wife.  It was very pleasant to have their company on that occasion.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Taoiseach to investigate a very serious admission made by the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism yesterday that he was aware that serious dumping was going on of foreign steel in this country &mdash; 11,000 tons in the first quarter.  That is a serious admission and I would ask the Taoiseach to investigate why importation of this steel was not prevented.  Surely a formal request had to be made to import the steel and surely at that stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Some days ago I suggested to the Taoiseach that there should be a debate on the common fishery policy.  I know negotiations did not take place but the debate did not materialise.  There are rather alarming headlines in the papers these days suggesting that the common fishery policy is at a very advanced stage and that some very important things for the Irish fishing industry, such as right of access to our fishing waters, have in fact been settled in a way that I think would be disastrous for the fishing industry. Would the responsible Minister or somebody make a statement on the matter and inform the House of what has happened or is happening?  If what is suggested is happening is really going on it would certainly spell disaster for the Irish fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must be aware that the Estimate for the Department of Fisheries is scheduled for Firday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I understand there was a meeting of the Fishery Ministers yesterday and perhaps <Col N="236" /> very serious decisions are being taken without any reference to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it that no decision will be taken reducing to six miles the 50-mile exclusive limit which Fianna Fáil insisted was our right and could be achieved, as has been reported in the papers, without prior discussion in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is in order for me to enter into the merits of this matter.  I suggest to Deputies opposite that they will have an opportunity to discuss the matter fully on the Estimates for the Department of Forestry and Fisheries on Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Two things arise out of that: first, the Fishery Ministers' meeting is going on today and, secondly, I understand that the Fisheries Estimate will take its place some time after the Estimate for the Department of the Gaeltacht.  The Gaeltacht Estimate seems to be a very controversial one which will probably take up the entire day.  Will the Government not agree to give Government time for a meaningful debate on this very important issue, the common fisheries policy and the negotiations being conducted in that respect?  Such a debate would be helpful to our Minister out there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition should try to sort out their priorities.  First, we have the Finance Bill and, secondly, we have arranged for an extra day's sitting to discuss Estimates but if the Opposition consider one Estimate to be more important than another, to take priority over another, the Government Whip will be glad to discuss that matter with them for the purpose of coming to some arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> It is not good enough to brush aside the Irish fishing industry by saying simply that the Opposition should sort out their priorities.  Time should be allowed specifically for a debate on the fishing industry. <Col N="237" /> Such a debate would be in the interest of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the House that during the period of office of the previous Government there was not a single item of this sort debated in Government time.  We asked on a number of occasions that time be given for debates of the type the Deputy is seeking but our requests were not acceded to on any occasion.  This week, for instance, I am affording Government time for discussion of the situation in Lebanon and there will be an extra day's sitting to enable the Opposition to discuss Estimates. I consider the Government to be doing very well and fairly in this regard so far as the Opposition are concerned, that we are much more on-coming and fairer than were the previous Government in relation to us when we were in Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding fisheries, the point we are making is that we are seeking an assurance from the Government that no decision will be taken to reduce our exclusive fishing limit without prior discussion in the House.  It is a question of getting an assurance from the Government that they will not throw away our rights in this matter without prior discussion in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated already that I do not intend to discuss the issues at this stage.  It would not be in order for me to do so on the Order of Business but I should like to point out that what Deputy FitzGerald is seeking is in complete contradiction to the way in which Government business was conducted <Col N="238" /> when he was Taoiseach.  During his period of office there was never any suggestion that Government decisions in any area be delayed until such time as the House had an opportunity to discuss them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Is it the position that the fishing rights of Irish fishermen into six miles have been abandoned permanently in favour of French fishermen?  If this is the case, it is disastrous for the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Taoiseach's statement as to what happened in 1976-77.  All I can say is that the pressure from the Opposition at the time, though it involved some embarrassment from time to time domestically, was extremely helpful to the Government of the day in Brussels.  This Government should have the wit to realise that a <Col N="239" /> debate on the fisheries question would be very helpful to them in the critical situation they face in the final stages of the negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach any intention of informing the House as to what the wording of the proposed amendment to the Constitution is likely to be? There is a great deal of public concern about this issue but I should like to know whether the amendment to be proposed will be published prior to the drafting of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give the Deputy any guarantee that the amendment will be published in advance of the Bill but there will be ample time in accordance with normal procedure for a full public national debate of the issue well in advance of the referendum.  The Bill itself will be debated here in the first instance and following that, there will be, presumably, a public campaign on the referendum issue itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to what the Minister for the Environment has said regarding the time table, does he intend to ensure that the rents tribunals legislation is brought in in view of the fact that <Col N="240" /> the rent controls legislation expires on 25 July and that this House will not be in session again until the middle of October so that thousands of tenants will be at risk during that time?  During the truncated debate on this legislation the Labour Party will facilitate the passage of the legislation but we are concerned about the thousands of people who will be at risk during the summer months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I do not accept that thousands of tenants will be at risk.  The legislation we have will be coming into operation on 25 July and it involves the procedures going through the District Court.  Therefore, there is cover in that sense.  I agree that the rents tribunal system is the better one but it is a question of timing, of putting them into operation.  The work in this regard was delayed considerably by reason of the fact that those officers in the Department dealing with the legislation had to deal also with the delays that were caused by reason of amendments made in the Seanad and which necessitated the Bill being returned to the Dáil.  Regulations, then, had to be brought into force prior to bringing the legislation into operation on 25 July.  These were regulations on foot of amendments from the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister has referred to the protection tenants would have in the District Court but is he aware of the condition in the District Court arising out of the enormous increase in jurisdiction conferred on that court without any arrangement having been made either in terms of district justices or of staff?  Would the Minister ensure that the chaos that is imminent there will be avoided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be correct for me at this stage to engage in a general debate on the District Court but at the time of the introduction of the Bill I gave an assurance to the House that temporary justices would be appointed and that in addition places for the hearing of cases would be provided through the Department of Justice.  I can assure the <Col N="241" /> House that it is my desire to have the legislation on the tribunals introduced as soon as possible.  If it can be done before the end of this session I give the House a guarantee that it will be.  That is my aim because I accept that a tribunal is the way to handle this situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When we last discussed this Bill I put on record the reservations of the Labour Party about the implications of this kind of legislation for urban renewal and development here.  I am anxious to make one final substantive point before I conclude my contribution.  The <Col N="242" /> principled objection that the Labour Party have to the canonisation of this political deal between Deputy Gregory and Deputy Haughey &mdash; that is precisely what it is &mdash; is that in the process in the canonisation, in the making of a Taoiseach, we have been dragged down the path of introducing a piece of legislation that will reverse the process of local democratic control and independent nonpolitical control of planning permissions. We are all wise and mature enough at this stage to recognise how detrimental and retrograde that step is.  I offer to the Minister of State the olive branch of reconsideration, that perhaps in the haste to meet the constraints of the political wheeling and dealing that went on the Bill was drafted too quickly.  It was certainly drafted a lot faster than most of the legislation that comes from the Custom House.  I am prepared to accept in return for the speed that the legislation was produced that there are deficiencies in it.  In the spirit in which I am making that comment the Minister on Committee Stage should consider looking at that fundamental process.</P>
      <P>I am specifically referring to the two options.  One gives the Minister, by right, the power to designate any part of any urban area a redevelopment area and therefore take it out totally of the planning process.  The second element enables the Minister to be the final voice of appeal in determining that planning conditions should be attached to proposed development.  They are the two principle points that I should like the Minister, and his adviser, to deal with in their reply.  I should like to give them advance notice of the fact that the Labour Party will be tabling amendments along those lines in the event of the Government not sharing my view on the points I have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The substantive point of my contribution today is the way in which an efficient publicly owned and well represented section of the public economy, that sector of the economy that comes in for great abuse and is subjected to great attack from those who believe in the private enterprise system, will be asset stripped. It is now proposed to asset strip a profit-making efficient public enterprise by virtue <Col N="243" /> of section 8.  Leaving aside the morality involved in that, I want, on behalf of the public sector to defend the efficient sections of the public sector, and we have many of them.</P>
    <P>Journalists and financial commentators seem to think that by virtue of the fact that an enterprise is publicly owned it is therefore congenitally inefficient and that there is some automatic link between public ownership and inefficiency on the one hand and some divine link between private ownership and efficiency on the other hand.</P>
    <P>Section 8 will enable the Minister for the Environment, and the Minister for Transport, to effectively hijack from the Dublin Port and Docks Board a massive asset which they have had for many years. That in itself is reprehensible, but what is far more reprehensible is the fact that the Dublin Port and Docks Board have embarked upon a capital expansion programme essential to the economic function of Dublin port and with the consent of a Minister for Transport, Deputy Reynolds, to the value of approximately £10.5 million.  They are borrowing capital, with the consent of the Minister, as they must do legally, on the collateral of the value of their site which is the subject of section 8.</P>
    <P>That is a complete reversal of the consultations that took place between the Department of Transport and representatives of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  I must stress that the Dublin Port and Docks Board is an efficient publicly owned and managed enterprise upon which the entire region of Dublin depends.  It is the largest single deep sea port on the east coast and is the major port through which manufacturing industry in the Dublin region, which constitutes the bulk of industry in the country, depends.</P>
    <P>The gravity of this political deal is such that if section 8 goes through in the way that it is capable of going through we are putting at risk in order to save the job of one person, the Taoiseach, the jobs of 1,400 people who work directly with the Dublin Port and Docks Board and the <Col N="244" /> many other people who derive a livelihood from the activities of the port.  I want clarification from the Minister of State on this.  I want to know what consultations prior to or during the drafting of this legislation took place between the Departments of Transport and the Environment in regard to section 8.  I should like to know the official opinion of the Minister for Transport in relation to his assessment of the potential value of the site.  In the event of the Minister for Transport conceding totally the site to the Department of the Environment, and the commission, I should like to know what replacement moneys will be made available to the Dublin Port and Docks Board, on what terms and how that money will be raised.  This is the bottom line of this kind of political dealing.  Various estimates and values have been put on the site of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  The critical thing is that the board has a capital programme of £10.5 million set against an annual turnover of £15 million.  That kind of ratio of development to their current income is extremely high and leaves the board very exposed. Any shortfall in the type of moneys they have reasonably anticipated, with the consent of a Fianna Fáil Minister for Transport, will seriously jeopardise the economic, effective and efficient functioning of this enterprise which employs many Dublin people generally and many people in the constituency which I represent. The Minister of State for Urban Affairs represents the same constituency.</P>
    <P>I should like to read into the record a statement issued by the Dublin Port and Docks Board, dated 11 June last.  The following is the statement:</P>
    <P>A special meeting of the Dublin Port and Docks Board to-day decided to seek an emergency meeting with the Minister for Transport to state their position with regard to Sec. 8 of the Urban Development Areas Bill 1982, which is scheduled to have its second reading in the Dáil next week.  The Bill proposes to take possession of 27 acres of the Board's property at Custom House Docks.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill gives considerable <Col N="245" /> reason to believe that the compensation in respect of the land may fall well short of reasonable market value and, consequently, the Board wishes to state its position.</P>
    <P>(1)  The Board is a statutory authority providing a vital service to the country and to the Dublin region in particular, without which the economic activity which eventually depends upon imports and exports would be seriously damaged.</P>
    <P>(2)  In the event of reasonable market value not being obtained by the Board for the area in question the Board will be subsidising the Government in financing the necessary urban re-development proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>(3)  It does not appear that in drafting the Bill, any thought was given to the consequences, not only for the Board and the port but for the community at large, of what is in effect a legalised hi-jacking of the Board's assets, an action which is but one step removed from impounding the Board's cash resources.</P>
    <P>(4)  The money required to finance the Board's current capital development programme has been borrowed from the Commercial Banks with the consent of the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Finance, obtained some three years ago.</P>
    <P>(5)  When these funds were being borrowed it was made clear to the Government Departments and the Banks involved that the repayment of the major portion of these loans would be effected in due course when the Custom House Docks site was disposed of.  The Government Departments involved clearly understood, approved of and encouraged the development programmes and the financial arrangements proposed at that time.  The development programmes are now well advanced and have not required new reclamation.  These programmes <Col N="246" /> have been adopted and approved by Government and enshrined in many statements by Government Ministers.  Speaking at a public function on February 12th, 1981, the then Minister for Transport described the Port Board's investment of £5.25 million in development works in that year as a necessary part of the £8.4 million being invested by Port Authorities in harbour facilities.</P>
    <P>(6)  An Taoiseach in Dáil Éireann on 25th March 1982 recognised that Dr. FitzGerald's Government has proposed to acquire the Custom House Docks by agreement, but that Government went out of office before effect could be given to this decision.</P>
    <P>(7)  Since the cost of providing, maintaining and developing port facilities (including warehouses) is borne by port users, the question arises as to whether port assets thus provided under statutory provisions can to all intents and purposes be confiscated without at least a full reimbursement for the benefit of such port users of the value of such assets.</P>
    <P>(8)  If the Custom House Docks does not realise its full market value the Board would have to obtain substantial additional revenue to meet its capital programme.  Failure to obtain this revenue would jeopardize the viability of the Board's activities and endanger employment in the port.  Port charges on the other hand cannot be increased to the level required to provide this revenue, without reducing the competitiveness of the port with resultant loss of trade and employment.</P>
    <P>(9)  It is essential that the port facilities at Dublin be developed in accordance with programmes of economic expansion and in anticipation of the growth of activity expected as the current recession comes to an end.  As a result the Port of Dublin is in the midst of a capital development programme designed to ensure <Col N="247" /> that the facilities offered will be appropriate to service the import and export trade anticipated up to the end of the present decade.</P>
    <P>(10)  The Board is charged with paying its own way for both day-to-day operations and for its capital development and as a result it trades without subsidy.  It charges its customers, and importers and exporters, for services provided in relation to their goods and makes charges also on the ships which enter the port.</P>
    <P>(11)  Dublin port provides these services in competition with other ports in Ireland, many of which have obtained substantial grants from the Government.  The port is also in competition with the ports of Northern Ireland where capital development projects have access to substantial EEC Regional Development Fund grants not available in Dublin.  However, Dublin Port and Docks Board has always been mindful of the less welcome consequences of dependence on such sources for financing its capital programmes and has accordingly managed its undertaking, its estate and its assets with the objective of retaining its financial independence; this independence has hitherto been welcomed by successive governments not only as fulfilling the Board's obligations to pay its way but as reducing also the burden on central funds created by other public bodies and semi-state organisations which cannot survive without substantial State assistance.</P>
    <P>In the parlance of official statements from semi-State bodies or public agencies, that is a strongly worded statement which can in its content refer to a description of section 8 as legalised hi-jacking of the board's assets.  A board representing the various sections such as are represented on that board, including the CII and the other major trading interests, do not use that kind of language loosely and certainly cannot have attached to themselves <Col N="248" /> the description of being either revolutionary or radical.  Therefore, their concern is very real and it is the responsibility of the Government to answer it in this House.  I would add to the comments that I have made in relation to the Dublin Port and Docks Board that they got very little joy and much intimidation when they met the Minister for Transport to voice their concern regarding this proposal.</P>
    <P>I conclude the points I want to make in relation to this by saying that the way in which this can be dealt with is that section 8 could simply be removed and that the process of compensation for Dublin Port and Docks Board should be similar to that which would be effected in relation to Viking Dublin or medieval Dublin &mdash; in other words that it come in under the normal process of compulsory acquisition and that the process of arbitration be the avenue down which both sides will travel in order to arrive at an agreed price.  The simplest legislative way that we can do that is to delete section 8 and allow the acquisition of the Port and Docks Board site of 27 acres to proceed in the normal fashion.  Lest anybody try to argue that that would delay unnecessarily the provision of housing and development in the site, the Minister will be well aware that there is no impediment to the acquisition of the site going ahead and the process of arbitration carrying on separately and parallel with it.  Both things can happen simultaneously. Therefore, the proposal to delete secton 8 would not impede or hold up the essential development of the 27 acres.</P>
    <P>Let the House be under no illusion, the Port and Docks Board do not themselves require this land for essential port activities. They initiated the process of redevelopment which brought about its emergence as a political carrot or stick, depending on your point of view, in the last election.  Therefore, its development is essential to the inner city of Dublin on the north side of the River Liffey and a realisation of a substantial portion of its value is a key component in the financing of the board's capital programme.</P>
    <P>As far as the Labour Party are concerned, and we confirmed this after a <Col N="249" /> meeting we had with a deputation from the Port and Docks Board people yesterday, we are fully in favour of the provision of houses and overall development on the north side of the Liffey in a way that the Port and Docks Board themselves were not in favour of it when they produced a document to which I referred on the last occasion we were speaking in this House on this matter.  However, we are not in favour of robbing Peter to pay Paul or to provide houses for people who are now about to be made jobless as a result of this kind of crazy intervention or planning.  Therefore, we must have a balanced approach between the two.</P>
    <P>In legal and legislative terms I suggest to the Minister that the most effective way of doing this is to delete section 8 of this Bill to allow the board to take their chances, which is all they want, in the normal process of arbitration and compensation, and that the rest of the provisions of the Bill in relation to the redevelopment of the 27-acre site would proceed.  I ask the Minister &mdash; because I know he wants to get this legislation through before this House and the other House rise this summer &mdash; to consider this proposal seriously.  One way or another having regard to the way in which this Government operate, if you do not give the money in this way to the Port and Docks Board people you must give it the other way because we are in the business of buying off or keeping quiet &mdash; or whatever form of massage or stroking is appropriate to the political survival of the Cabinet of the day &mdash; people who exercise clout, votes and essential economic muscle.  As someone who represents a constituency with a large number of people directly employed in the port or alternatively deriving their secure jobs from the extension of port activities, I can say that the port is an essential component not just in my constituency or Deputy Gregory-Independent's constituency but to the entire region of Dublin city and it has embarked upon a capital programme which is an essential part of modernisation in order to maintain its efficiency.</P>
    <P>Finally, I consider it to be an unfair and intellectually dishonest attempt to <Col N="250" /> undermine the economic viability of a publicly-owned enterprise and therefore give yet further false witness to the often-repeated lie that somehow our other public enterprise is inefficient and that the State cannot manage its own resources.  This is an excellent example, along with other companies like Irish Shipping, of sound, effective, efficient management of a public enterprise.  The Labour Party will not stand by and allow it to be raided or hijacked, to use the phraseology that they themselves use.</P>
    <P>I have made all the comments I wish to make and have, perhaps, repeated myself to the boredom or annoyance of some Members.  For that I apologise but I feel strongly about this legislation.  The Minister should seriously consider the points made, in particular the reversal of the process of decentralised control of areas of our country and the re-emergence of that beast we thought we had killed &mdash; the ministerial appeal, the worst monument to which is Tully's tower on the bridge in Donnybrook.  There is an ominous ring in the section which allows the Minister to decide by order to declare the centre of Waterford, a portion of Clonmel or back alleys in Limerick as urban development areas, over the heads of the people directly concerned.  This is the remnant of colonial centralism bedded in the vault of the Custom House coming to the surface again and the Labour Party will continue to combat it.</P>
    <P>I recognise that Dublin inner city must be revitalised and the Labour Party are fully in favour of that revitalisation.  This Bill will not give to the Government any more powers essential to that revitalisation than they already have and will not give them the powers that will make that revitalisation effective and instant.  If we had on the Statute Book the Labour Party Bill dealing with the control of urban building land prices the Government's dilemma over section 7 and section 8 would not arise with regard to the Dublin Port and Docks Board site because the land would be valued on the existing use and not the potential value for office blocks and residential sites. There is no suggestion that the Government will move down that avenue without <Col N="251" /> the pushing and shoving of the Labour Party and other Members.</P>
    <P>The other instrument which the Government have to hand but are refusing to use is our most successful state enterprise in terms of economic performance and efficiency.  I refer to the 97 per cent State-owned Irish Life Assurance Company who have the necessary expertise, track record and resources from the pension funds, which are the monument to labour movement victories over the past 50 years, to redevelop Dublin City. The power is there but what is painfully absent is the political will.  The only political will which is evident in this Bill is the desire to stay in the Cabinet of this Government at the expensive cost of buying the vote of one Member.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCorr" hpid="Mr. Corr Mr. Corr">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corr</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with other speakers in this debate, I am pleased to see the appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for urban affairs and I hope we will now set about evolving a national urban policy designed to cater for the problems of existing urban centres and provide guidelines for the development of new growth centres throughout the county.</P>
      <P>Since the sixties not only has our population increased but the balance of the population has shifted from rural to urban.  The process of urbanisation has a long way to go as the proportion of the rural-based population &mdash; in particular, the ratio engaged in agriculture &mdash; is relatively high compared with other EEC countries.  Our social composition is closer to that of Spain, Portugal and Greece than to that of our more developed EEC partners.  This pattern is changing and we should be engaged in considering the suitability of our local government structures to the changing social pattern.  A White Paper on local government published over a decade ago stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All institutions must change with changing circumstances.  Local government cannot be an exception to this if it is to continue to serve the purpose <Col N="252" /> for which it exists and if it is to be able to cope with future demands.</P>
    <P>It went on to state:</P>
    <P>The basic structure, however, is still influenced by the 19th century legislation and some of the main local government units have survived in more or less their present shape for centuries. Moreover, since the foundation of the State there has never been a review of the local government system as a whole.</P>
    <P>This Bill does nothing to promote local government; rather it is a move towards increased control from the centre.</P>
    <P>I dislike unnecessary centralism and believe we should be constantly endeavouring to promote more local government and not just local administration.  I sometimes conclude that successive Governments have shown less faith in the concept of local democracy than the Tory Government in 1898.</P>
    <P>We need a radical restructuring of our local government units to enable them to deal with the problems of physical growth, housing, education, transportation and a host of other activities that affect the daily lives of our people.</P>
    <P>This Bill is to be welcomed in so far as it contains laudable proposals for the overall regeneration of severely blighted inner city areas.  I have strong reservations about the Bill in so far as it includes the concept of bureaucratic commissions, answerable for their activities not to the local authority but to the Minister only and having wide powers to acquire, hold and dispose of land, to build without obtaining planning permission from the local authority and to provide for the remission, in whole or in part, of the rates leviable in respect of premises within their functional areas.</P>
    <P>Buchanan, in his regional studies published in 1968, suggested the establishment of development corporations as being the appropriate method for the development of growing urban areas. That recommendation was rightly rejected by the Government of the day. Development corporations have been used in Britain for the new towns and <Col N="253" /> they have been reasonably effective in getting things done, not least in the short term.  However, the main criticism of development corporations or commissions as contained in this Bill is that they are undemocratic and that can mean that in the course of their work they are insufficiently responsive to community needs and consequently mistakes can be perpetuated.</P>
    <P>The work of securing the overall regeneration of inner city areas properly belongs to the democratically elected authorities and to impose a bureaucratic commission seems to me to be ill judged unless there is proof that the local authorities have failed to fulfil their obligations. Such commissions will be resented by the elected representatives and above all they will add to the cost of government in so far as it will be necessary to create another administrative structure which will further increase the overall cost of government.  This is being proposed at a time when public funds for administration should be strictly controlled and such funds as are available used for the production of goods and services that we can sell at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>The corporations of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford have all the professional and administrative expertise necessary to engage in a vigorous programme of inner city renewal and all they need are the funds to proceed with the job.  This Bill is a reaction to the failure of Dublin Corporation to date to tackle on an ongoing basis the problem of dereliction and this failure resulted in an accumulation of blight and decay which is now so evident that it is regarded as a crisis situation.  Dublin Corporation, on the other hand, would point out that they did not have funds or powers to engage in the kind of worthwhile activities which the Bill before us proposes for the development commission.</P>
    <P>I readily admit that dereliction may be encouraged by failure on the part of a local authority to make firm decisions with regard to the location and width of new roads but the Department of the Environment must also take some of the blame for the present accumulation of dereliction in our cities in so far as they <Col N="254" /> did not allocate funds in accordance with the needs of an area but rather in accordance with some administratively convenient national formula.  At this stage, it might be simplistic to lay the blame for extensive urban blight at the feet of any one agency.  Powerful economic forces have been at work in promoting urban sprawl and the dispersal of inner city activities over the last 20 years.</P>
    <P>The problem of the inner city is not an Irish problem as the Minister said.  Cities throughout the world are experiencing the same problem and are pursuing similar strategies to combat dereliction. Urban trends since the sixties have been such that the central business districts have a steadily decreasing importance with suburban shopping centres taking an increasingly large share of retail distribution. Similarly an increasing share of manufacturing units have been located in suburban industrial estates and many office functions have been dispersed from the city centre.  Perhaps this trend will continue until we take a positive decision to restrict the expansion of our major urban centres and perhaps in this way the inner city will recover some of the attractions it has lost.</P>
    <P>Dereliction has become so widespread that action rather than words is required. In this context, the Bill is welcomed.  In section 6 the Bill states that an urban development commission may be required to prepare a planning scheme for its functional area.  I suggest that such schemes are or should be already in existence since each local authority are required by law to work in accordance with an approved development plan, a plan which must be thoroughly examined, amended and revised if necessary every five years.  In Cork city not only have we a development plan for the entire area under the jurisdiction of the corporation but also a series of detailed local plans, including one for the inner city area.  I understand that when the Minister of State was in Cork he saw some of these plans and showed special interest in the one for the Shandon area, one of the oldest parts of the inner city.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to think again about the feasibility of introducing bureaucratic <Col N="255" /> commissions and, if necessary, to direct the corporations of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford to engage in vigorous programmes of inner city renewal and give to these democratically elected bodies all the powers proposed in the Bill for the revitalisation of inner city areas.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is worth noting.  It exempts developments in inner city areas from planning permission.  This is important because appeals, sometimes of a vexatious nature, against planning permissions granted and long delays on the part of An Bord Pleanála in hearing such appeals have caused some developers to abandon projects which would have contributed to inner city renewal.  Also the proposal to introduce a system of taxation on derelict sites to discourage the hoarding of property for profit is to be welcomed.  We can all point to eyesores in our cities arising from the greed of speculators.  The Bill contains many good proposals but I would prefer if it was operated by the local authority rather than by a bureaucratic body which would not be answerable to the local population. I ask the Minister not to impose a commission when the Bill is passed until such time as there is positive proof that the local authorities fail to fulfil their duty in the area of inner city renewal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>The plan for the redevelopment of Dublin has caught the attention of many people not only in Dublin but throughout the country.  It is laudable to develop the inner city of Dublin but one could say equally that it would be laudable to have schemes to redevelop the inner cities of Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway and indeed most towns. We all agree that Dublin is crying out for development in the inner city.  There is good need for a comprehensive urban renewal plan but the same can be said for other cities.  Nobody begrudges Dublin its right to inner city development but we should not put all our eggs in one basket. It should not proceed to the exclusion of Limerick or Cork redevelopment.  This seems to be what is happening.  At a time when resources and finance are limited and the economy is on the rocks, it is <Col N="256" /> wrong that long-term development should take place in Dublin and that other parts of the country should be denuded of similar type work.  There are other schemes which are equally laudable and vital which should be carried out in cities besides Dublin.</P>
      <P>If one travels through the country one will see slums, ruins and derelict buildings which disfigure cities and towns.  This is not just confined to Dublin.  One's first impression of a city or town is often a lasting one and it can often be formed by a visit to the central area.  If one goes to the centre city areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway or Waterford one will find the whole area pockmarked with ruins.  Sometimes they are turned into car parks but that is not very satisfactory. There is need for a national comprehensive scheme which will embrace all cities and not just one at any one time.</P>
      <P>There are great difficulties for local authorities in tackling urban blight and decay and I agree with the previous speaker that they are the best people to engage in this work.  I am against setting up commissions.  They cannot do anything but increase bureaucracy.  Local authorities are geared to this kind of work.  I have been alarmed by some recent decisions of An Bord Pleanála in relation to development in certain areas, especially historical ones.  The best people to plan the development of a city or town are the local people who know the environment, the historical nature of the area and character of the buildings. Some decisions made by An Bord Pleanála have been insensitive to say the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the essential character of a city or town be preserved. Otherwise one could imagine oneself living in a concrete new town in Great Britain or America unless the buildings forming the main character of a city are preserved and cherished.  Certainly some decisions taken have not been in the best interests of proper urban renewal.  Some development has been garish, incongrous, has not been in line, in character or in harmony with the essential nature of some of the historic parts of our cities. Anybody with any aesthetic appreciation <Col N="257" /> of buildings would be appalled at some of the honky-tonk developments that have taken place in our towns and cities. I wonder what kind of criteria are adopted by our planners or from what kinds of colleges they graduate.  Their work appears at times to be totally out of line with An Bord Pleanála decisions and those of local authorities.  One would imagine that there could be a similar criterion or yardstick adopted for good sensible development in our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that at times a faceless body like An Bord Pleanála can overrule decisions of a local authority, certainly in relation to historical areas and the essential character of our cities.  It is important that such development be sensibly carried out, that the buildings be properly designed and that the materials used harmonise with those of existing buildings in the area.  Otherwise we shall be leaving our people a legacy of bad buildings.</P>
    <P>It has been said that as a people we lack visual appreciation.  That is true in relation to our buildings.  Many of our architects merely copy the design of buildings in Britain or on the European mainland, showing very little individual flair or initiative in developing an Irish architectural tradition in building.  I have been appalled at some of the hand-me-down designs that have disfigured our cities and towns.  In this area there is need for greater co-operation between local authorities and An Bord Pleanála to ensure that future building here is of the highest possible standard.  I am in favour of giving maximum power to local authorities to acquire building land in centre city areas.  Private property is respected in our Constitution and our laws.  But, in the past, it has been almost canonised; we have tended to be in awe of it.  Indeed even in our courts private property has been held to be superior to the common good, to the rights of the community, to those of our people to housing.  Private property should not be sacrosanct.</P>
    <P>Where private property has been lying derelict and neglected, local authorities should have the power to intervene.  They should have the power to take such property <Col N="258" /> from landlords, be they absentee landlords or others living here so that they can be developed or sold for proper development.  It is wrong to throw our hands in the air and say: we cannot do anything about these derelict buildings or sites, they are owned by people and it is their right to hold these sites for years. Sometimes they appreciate enormously in value and people make millions of pounds by merely holding on to them or when they are rezoned.  That is no longer good enough.  We have at present urgent need of jobs and housing for our people. Therefore it is totally wrong that somebody can acquire a site, hold on to it, allow it to appreciate in value and then develop it for some purpose not in line with or in harmony with the needs of our society.</P>
    <P>Compulsory purchase orders are much too convoluted and unwieldy.  There is no need for this long drawn-out process. Local authorities should have power to step in, take over property and use it in the interests of the community rather than leaving it in the hands of private developers.  I marvel at the speed and efficiency of some continental countries in tackling such matters whereas we just drift along, hoping that somebody will come along and develop these sites.</P>
    <P>I have had meetings in private and in public with the Minister of State, Mr. Brady, in regard to these questions.  I was a member of a Limerick Corporation deputation to him.  Indeed sometimes I felt it was like going to the goat's house for wool in terms of seeking capital allocations for development in Limerick. While the Minister showed a very keen appreciation of our needs, went down as an individual himself and sent down one of his officials, Mr. Hehir, to see us, and while I was impressed by the courteous way in which he dealt with us, at the same time I had the feeling that perhaps sometimes Ministers of State are given the dirty jobs to perform.  Certainly the most glamorous and effective tasks are undertaken by the Minister of State, Mr. Brady, has been given the worst end of the stick in this respect, being sent around the country to places like Limerick to see slums, <Col N="259" /> derelict sites and so on, meeting local corporation and city councillors, talk to them and hear of their needs with regard to planning and development.  Yet, at the end of the day, when one asks about money to do something about such plans, all he can do is send his report back to his boss or to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>That is not good enough.  It reminds me of social workers sent out front by health boards to areas where there is dire poverty and difficulty being experienced without having the wherewithal to solve such problems but rather dishing out palliatives like pieces of sticking plaster to people dying of cancer.  It is the same thing with regard to our cities; they are dying also.  It is not sufficient just to send down a Minister of State without his being given the power and back-up to resolve the problems he encounters or carry out his ideas.  It is an abuse of a junior Minister's time, merely using him to take the flak.  The Minister proper should at least hand down authority to his junior Minister to have necessary remedial schemes carried out.</P>
    <P>The Minister has seen the need for development in Limerick.  Some work has been done in an historic part called Thomond Gate, a model-type development not quite finished.  The two most important parts of the city are the old walled parts, the Irishtown and Englishtown, which are crying out for urban renewal.  Nothing much, apart from one small scheme, has been done at King's Island, the Englishtown part of the city. There has been some development there but, because of some difficulties encountered about an inner ring road, nothing has happened for some time.  There is now no money available for that development. Similarly the John's Gate part of the Irishtown area has been neglected for decades and has now become a large encampment for itinerants.  That is what happens when areas are left neglected for decades.  I hope the Minister will address himself to these problems when he meets Limerick Corporation in the near future.</P>
    <P>During European Architectural Heritage Year we made a spurt, at least there was great paper interest shown in the <Col N="260" /> need to plan our cities and town properly, when various deputations went to different capitals of Europe to see what had been done there.  But alas it was a typical Irish effort, a short spurt for a while, paying lip service to the whole idea of our architectural heritage, the preservation of the character of our main cities and towns but afterwards lapsing back.</P>
    <P>Even in the midst of an economic recession, if we are to survive as a people, it is important that the highest architectural standards be preserved in terms of our usage of quality materials, design and buildings.  In this connection I might say that I am very disappointed at the quality of brickwork.  It appears that sometimes bricks have been imported here, which is just not good enough at a time of economic difficulty within that industry.  The fact that some bricks are being imported here from Great Britain is an indictment of our brick manufacturers, an inference that they cannot now manufacture bricks which will compete with their foreign counterparts.  There is no reason also that bricks cannot be more widely used in buildings in our main cities.  There is great need for more co-operation between the Minister, his Department and Irish brick manufacturers to ensure the manufacture and usage of good quality bricks.  In this connection perhaps the Minister might ensure the liaison activities of the Industrial Development Authority and those of his Department.  Some of the factories at present being built by the IDA are very nondescript in design.  There is no reason why we cannot have functional buildings of good design or that brickwork cannot be incorporated in them. When I see this lopsided development on the part of State agencies I cannot but wonder how serious we are about good design and the use of Irish products.</P>
    <P>One cannot push urban renewal on to one narrowly drawing board activity. There is need to influence a variety of Departments, especially those of the Environment, Health and Social Welfare and also to ensure co-ordination between the various Government Departments and local authorities.  I am not in favour of the establishment of commissions.  We already have the lines of communication <Col N="261" /> between the Department and local authorities.  We need to give more power and influence to local authorities, above all to short-circuit the whole routine of acquiring sites and purchase orders and to streamline that legislation to enable local authorities to acquire land and carry out development as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The last two speakers outlined very well the problems which urban areas face.  I do not want to go into the details too much at this stage.  Deputy Corr said that because of economic pressures there is a continuous drift from rural areas to urban areas.  I can only speak from my Cork experience.  The problem of urban renewal in Cork city is a major one.</P>
      <P>My first reaction to the Bill is that it is really a vehicle to implement part of the infamous deal of last March.  That has been said already by other speakers so I will not dwell too much on that.  This Bill has been drafted for political expediency. I back up that statement from some of my experiences in Cork.  I have been a member of Cork Corporation since 1979. Before that time Cork Corporation drafted the land use and transportation study.  Part of that plan was to revitalise some of the older parts of Cork city. During the first one and a half years of the tenure of the present Cork Corporation we drafted a number of local plans. We dealt first of all with the Shandon area.  We hope by this plan to revitalise areas which have become derelict; we hope to attract new industries suitable for the area and we hope money will be made available to implement this and other plans.</P>
      <P>During the past year Cork Corporation have attempted to obtain money to implement part of this plan but to date we have had very little success.  I know the Minister is very familiar with the approaches made to his office by Cork Corporation in the last few months for further finance.  Some of this money is required for the implementation of some of the matters in the local plans.  We have had very little response from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is on record as saying in <Col N="262" /> the House last week that one project, which is a major influence on the implementation of the Shandon and Blackpool plans, cannot expect finance from his Department.  This is the implementation of part of the northern ring road, the Valley Drive Road, which is adjacent to the Shandon and Blackpool areas.  Unless this development gets the finance that is required, the attempt to implement the Shandon and Blackpool plans will be seriously affected.  The credibility of Cork Corporation will be seriously impaired in the eyes of the public if we cannot proceed with this project.</P>
    <P>The Minister came to Cork at the end of April and he spent two days visiting the areas which are badly affected by derelict sites.  He said he did not come to bring finance to the city but to survey the problems and that he would then consider what steps were required.  I do not see any hope in the Bill for immediate aid to the areas of Cork city I am interested in.  I see that any money which may be available for urban renewal will be ploughed into the Dublin areas.  I have to protest at that.  I would like to take this opportunity to invite the Minister to tell the House his first impressions of his visit to Cork and what he intends to do this year for Cork city in relation to urban renewal.  I said in the House some weeks ago that Cork were greatly insulted by the treatement they are getting from the Department of the Environment.  I repeat that now.  Cork are insulted at the treatment they have got.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> On a point of order, the Deputy said I insulted Cork city.  The city manager subsequently disagreed with the Deputy.  There is no point in the Deputy trying to change what he has said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. B. Allen Mr. B. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The city manager may have telephoned the Minister' office but I am saying again that the people of Cork <Col N="263" /> are insulted at the treatment they are getting from the present administration. The people of Cork will ultimately have their say.  Much lip service has been given in the Bill to the powers of local government and the way those powers have been diminished over the past few years. I look on the Bill as a further diminution of the powers of local government.  Some of the functions and activities of the commission, which is to be set up, will overlap the functions of local authorities.  This cannot be welcomed at a time when local authorities are crying out for finance. Local authorities who have plans for urban areas do not require another layer of bureaucracy.  They require finance to implement those plans.  Instead of going through time-wasting, money-wasting exercises, I submit that local authorities should be given the powers they do not have at present to implement the plans and also the finance.  The plans cannot be implemented without finance.  I disagree with the Bill.  I feel it is unnecessary.  As I said at the outset it is only a vehicle to implement a deal that was made in March for political reasons.</P>
      <P>We came, representing Cork Corporation, to the Minister's Department some time ago and we were given the impression that his Department would make a realistic response to our submissions. To date, some allocations have been made in the area of housing and roads, but, while the allocation for roads is welcome, it gives another indication of how the powers and rights of local government have been eroded.  Even though an allocation was made, the money was specified for a purpose and Cork Corporation had no choice in how to spend it.  In future, if moneys are made available to local authorities they should be given the power to spend the money as they think fit.  I should like the Minister to answer some of the questions I have asked.  I shall repeat one &mdash; when is he going to make moneys available to Cork city to implement local schemes for urban renewal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady (Dublin North-Central) Mr. Brady (Dublin North-Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-Central):</i> I wish to congratulate the Government and <Col N="264" /> compliment the Minister on introducing legislation, which was very badly needed, in the area of developing the inner city of Dublin.  It has been clear to all concerned that the inner city of Dublin has had many problems over a long number of years.  The Minister referred to crime and bad housing and this Bill will go some way towards relieving these problems. The problems are common in many cities, not just in Dublin, and many speakers have made this point, especially in relation to Cork city.</P>
      <P>As far as urban development is concerned, the Government are showing their concern in a very constructive and concrete way for the inner city problems. In 1978 the Fianna Fáil Government established an inter-departmental committee to report and make recommendations to deal with the very bad problems in the inner city.  That report was discussed in many areas, community groups, tenants' associations, the IDA and many other Government bodies in an effort to bring about a solution and an improvement in the general standard of living for citizens in very deprived parts of Dublin city.  From 1977 to 1981 I represented that part of Dublin &mdash; the old North-Central constituency &mdash; and I am <i>au fait</i> with the problems and the difficulties that exist in the inner city.  It is recognised and accepted that the unemployment rate in Dublin city is extremely high, probably the highest in the country. There are some areas in the inner city in which unemployment is as high as 60 per cent.  Housing is bad and there are consequential results of those difficulties such as vandalism, juvenile crime and so on.  There is no doubt that the standard of life is deplorably poor in certain areas and any proposals which will help to bring about an improvement are to be encouraged. I should be very pleased to see them brought in through legislation or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that certain parts of this Bill may be controversial.  I refer specifically to the section dealing with the Dublin Port and Docks area.  Deputy Quinn spoke about the point of view of the board and, as a member of the board, I know they are concerned.  One would be <Col N="265" /> surprised if they were not because the board have been pursuing a policy which was based on present day value of the property concerned.  However, it is generally accepted &mdash; even by members of the board &mdash; that they must contribute in some way towards the development of life, community and otherwise, in the northern part of the city.  The board will be adequately compensated in so far as covering the total cost of transferring their warehouses and other activities to another part of the city is concerned.  This Bill also establishes that the board will not lose out financially in any realistic way.  On the other hand, the board are looking at potential and we must, therefore, distinguish between investment potential and actual and realistic financial involvement at present.  This Bill will ensure that the board will not suffer losses in any way.</P>
    <P>I am also aware of the fact that executive members of the board, the chairman and vice-chairman, will be meeting the Minister shortly to discuss this whole area.  I hope an amicable solution will be reached and that agreement which is so necessary between such an important body and the Government can be reached in this area.  We have in this House on many occasions discussed the whole question of urban renewal.  It is a cliché nowadays which is used in many cities of the world and most capital cities in Europe have deteriorated to a very large extent.  Perhaps Dublin is more affected than most because it escaped the ravages of the last war and, consequently, did not require the type of re-building that many other cities needed following the period from 1939 to 1945.</P>
    <P>Dublin leaves much to be desired in its appearance.  There are very few public representatives, and I include representatives outside the Dublin area, who would not agree that major measures are needed to make our capital city a place of which we can be proud.  Some 85 per cent of tourists pass through Dublin and through the area that is concerned in this legislation.  We should make some effort to make that part of the city as attractive as possible not only for tourists but also <Col N="266" /> for the citizens who live and work there and for the children who go to schools in the area.  I do not think any representative here would argue with the point made by the Minister in his contribution that Dublin city badly needs renewal. This Bill is a major step in this direction.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the powers of an urban development commission as opposed to the powers of the local authority has been raised.  The Minister said that it may be considered that the powers being given to an urban development commission are not very different from those already available to local authorities.  Basically that is correct. Nevertheless, we must look on this in a completely different light in that a development commission is being set up specifically to deal with a given area.  In the context of the legislation now before us we are dealing with two specific areas, one on the north side and one on the south side.  The commission would be more effective in dealing with problems and in ensuring that the development required in the areas is carried out more speedily and more effectively than would be the case with the local authority.  We must face the fact that a local authority deal with a much wider area.  In the example of Dublin, Dublin Corporation have under their control one of the largest areas.  One has only to look at their expenditure for the year to realise that the total cost of running Dublin city is many times greater than that of any other county.  It is realistic to assume that a commission would be much more effective in dealing with the problems that are considered in this legislation.</P>
    <P>For many years housing on the north side of Dublin has been a contentious and controversial subject.  In their original planning application the Dublin Port and Docks Board met with fierce opposition from many areas because they had not made sufficient provision for additional housing in that area.  The port area concerned would represent a huge investment commitment and would give the area a completely new commercial image.  It is an area that is overburdened with social problems and those problems are greatest in the North Wall-Sheriff <Col N="267" /> Street district which is adjacent to the proposed development by the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  The Government's plan to bring less commercial development into that area and to have more housing and space for community amenities is much more feasible and acceptable in what is an overcrowded area.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of this Bill that could be considered controversial.  There is the question of a compulsory take-over of any specific area by a future Government. In this case we are dealing with an extraordinary emergency.  The problems have been increasing during the years but very little has been done about them and drastic measures are required.  I am not for a moment suggesting that this Bill is drastic but the development that is necessary requires drastic and major measures to ensure that we will have better housing and facilities, more employment and the conditions to create employment and better standards of education and educational facilities.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success in his new job.  This is probably his first major assignment.  It is a difficult one but I know he will do everything possible to ensure that all areas of interest will be met in some way.  We are dealing with a problem that needs a rapid solution.  This Bill will go a long way towards commencing the first stage of that solution and I endorse what the Minister has proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to spell out clearly the intentions of my party on Second Reading.  We understand the motivation behind the Bill and we recognise the problems that necessitated the introduction of legislation somewhat along these lines.  However, we have major reservations about many sections of the Bill, and on Committee Stage we will have amendments to almost every section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are two objections that we see as being absolutely fundamental, and depending on what the Minister says on this we will decide whether to vote against and oppose the Second Reading of this Bill.  Specifically, we are fundamentally <Col N="268" /> opposed to the transfer of the planning functions back to the Minister for the Environment and the exclusion from the planning procedures in the Bill of An Bord Pleanála.  Unless the Minister is prepared to say when replying to this debate that on Committee Stage he will either himself introduce or accept an amendment from us to reinstate An Bord Pleanála and to exclude the Minister for the Environment from all planning functions, then Fine Gael will oppose this Bill's Second Reading.</P>
    <P>Second &mdash; and I will say more about both of these in a moment, but I want to make them clear at the outset &mdash; we are deeply unhappy with the manner in which it is proposed to acquire the Port and Docks Board site and in the longer term the same provision applies to the acquisition of other publicly owned sites.  I will spell out why in greater detail.  But at this stage we would request from the Minister a recognition that there is a problem here and a willingness to meet with the Port and Docks Board as the people most immediately affected and discuss with them their difficulties with a view to being able to tell the House at later stages that the problems that they fear will arise in relation to their capital expansion programme will not arise and we will want a guarantee that those discussions will begin soon and that the Minister will approach them in an open-minded and positive way.  If those two demands are met, if it is agreed that An Bord Pleanála will be reintroduced into the Bill and that the Minister will divest himself of his planning functions and if he will agree to look again at the manner of acquisition proposed then we will not oppose the Bill's Second Reading but we will have a very large number of amendments on Committee Stage.  It is right at the outset that I set out our position.</P>
    <P>When we opened the debate on this Bill the Minister of State reviewed the problems that he saw around him in his native city.  Those of us who have served alongside him in Dublin Corporation will have recognised the insight and personal knowledge that he brought to that and in particular will respect his judgment because of his courageous stand against <Col N="269" /> the rape of Wood Quay.  So there is a willingness to look well on anything that might emerge from the Minister.  Certainly we set out by saying that this is a problem that needs to be solved.  It is not without some significance that this debate should take place on the very occasion in the House this morning when we talked of how we might commermorate James Joyce.  It is certainly a sad thought that in a time when we are moved to think about what he was to write about this city that if we were to follow some of the routes suggested in his writings a very sorry sight indeed would meet our eyes.  I do not know if the Minister of State took advantage of the photographic exhibition which was organised by the Living City Group yesterday in Buswell's Hotel which did just that in part.  Certainly it was a deeply distressing and hurtful experience to see what has become of our capital city. Indeed the Minister and other speakers in these benches have made the point that the problem of urban blight and the need for regeneration is not confined to this capital city, that major problems exist in Limerick, Cork and other major urban centres.  Not only that, but only on Monday I was speaking at a meeting in Kildare and the point was made that many very much smaller towns are experiencing precisely this problem.  They referred there specifically with great eloquence to the problems of Athy the centre of which has been ravaged and left derelict.  So undoubtedly there is a problem to be solved and on that the House is united.  Undoubtedly the Minister's commitment and his sincerity is not in question.</P>
    <P>So we look towards the Bill anxious to be impressed, and I am afraid we are disappointed.  In the first instance we see the Bill as being fundamentally anti-local authority.  It is not unremarkable that at a time when much talk is taking place about the need for reform of local democracy, when much talk centres on the question of transferring power away from the centre and back to communities, that a Fianna Fáil Government should bring before the House legislation which will strip power from local authorities, take it from the elected representatives of the <Col N="270" /> people and give it back to the Minister for the Environment and give it to the appointees of the Minister for the Environment. We take absolute and fundamental objection to that and would stand on that objection.  Local government is at this stage little more than a joke, and the locally elected representatives of the people are little more than poppinjays. For all sorts of reasons local government is ceasing to function.  The functions of the local authorities bear little or no relation to the needs of the community.  They have no say in the provision of primary or secondary schools.  They have no say in things as central to a local community as where there is going to be a Garda station and, bringing it a stage further, they are not involved in deciding what communities need telephone kiosks or where they are going to be sited.  So the powers that the local authorities have fail to meet the needs of the community.</P>
    <P>The structure of the local authorities themselves is completely outdated.  The basic structure is, with the exception of the Shannon Town Commissioners, unchanged for many decades.  One could count on the fingers of one hand the changes that have taken place in the structure of local government since the foundation of the State, the establishment of the borough councils of Dún Laoghaire and Galway back in the twenties and the thirties, the town commissioners in Tramore some time in the mid-forties and the very recent Shannon Town Commissioners.  But there has been no serious attempt to get to grips with the fact that there is no local government in this city.</P>
    <P>Many Members of this House enjoy the dual mandate in that they serve on Dublin Corporation or Dublin County Council and are Members of this House. Indeed until very recently the Minister had that experience.  But they have the absurd situation that the areas that, as councillors, they seek to represent are in many cases all but as big as their Dáil constituencies.  In at least one area in Dublin County Council the area is actually larger than the Dáil constituency that the Deputy is expected to represent. How can anybody seriously talk about <Col N="271" /> Government being local and a community being represented at local level? Therefore one looks forward with hope rather than with confidence to the emergence of new structures that will provide the opportunity for people to be involved in the government of their own community.</P>
    <P>On the outskirts of the city new towns have grown up, such as Leixlip and Kildare. Instead of bringing in proposals to extend the power of local authorities and giving decision-making back to the people, this legislation proposes to strip from the local authorities some of the few powers they now enjoy.  We find that fundamentally objectionable.</P>
    <P>The structure of the Bill is, to say the least, a little curious.  It mentions two areas, the Customs House site and the walled city, and gives the Minister power to wander gaily through the land designating other areas at will.  It is a negation of democracy and of everything local government should stand for when such fundamental decisions are to be taken in the Custom House by the Minister for the Environment of the day without reference to the views of the locally elected representatives who can and do claim a mandate from the people.  That might make some sense if the structures established by this Bill presented something new and radically different, but the Minister of State made the point that it can be fairly said very few additional powers are being provided for these commissions that are not already enjoyed by local authorities.</P>
    <P>At this stage it has to be said that the case for the commission has not been proved.  To date we have not been told what they will be able to do that is different from what some local authorities have already been doing successfully.  The Minister made the point that local authorities are multi-purposed and he hoped these commissions would zero in on the problems of urban regeneration. That attitude appears to be borne out of optimism rather than reality.</P>
    <P>We come now to the establishment of these commissions which will exercise very considerable powers within their <Col N="272" /> designated areas.  The first thing we notice is that the Bill is curiously silent on who might qualify to be a commissioner and what criteria will be applied in making appointments, but there are some negative stipulations.  We are told members of the commission cannot be Members of either House of the Oireachtas, but there is no indication what talents they might be expected to have or what background they might have enjoyed which would fit them for appointment to these positions.  The Minister suggested they might have experience of local government and administration, but I do not know what he meant by that.  If he meant he will produce some retired war horses from the Custom House or elsewhere and appoint them to this commission, that will be completely unacceptable. If the commission are to be of value they should draw on expertise from a number of disciplines.  In the case of the walled city designated area, the advice of an architect and archeologist would be invaluable to the commission in their deliberations.</P>
    <P>In his reply I would like the Minister to expand on how he sees the commission being appointed and what factors he will take into account when deciding those appointments.  Unless these commissioners, through their personal experiences skills and talents, can bring a decisiveness to this problem which is lacking at present, then all we are doing is inserting another layer of bureaucracy and further cluttering up the system.  That has little to recommend it.  When these commissioners are appointed, regrettably they will have very little independence.  In almost every sphere of their activity they are subject to ministerial direction.  It seems they may not even appoint staff without the Minister saying who the staff should be and stipulating their terms of remuneration.</P>
    <P>One gets the impression that this Bill, if it becomes law, will establish a commission which may consist of ministerial stooges, and the public and those who will have dealings with the commission may be faced with a situation where, if they do not like what the stooges are doing they will have to get in touch with <Col N="273" /> the person who appointed the stooges and seek redress from him.  That is more than a little unsatisfactory.  What guarantee of independence will be given to the commissioners?  I do not think that question is entirely academic because we have seen the track record of Ministers for the Environment and how they respond to groups exercising power in a local community when it is not to the Minister's liking.  Previous Ministers for the Environment have, at a stroke, dismissed the local authorities in this city, Bray and other areas.  If they can do that to bodies who can claim some authority, because they were directly elected, how seriously can the deliberations of this commission be taken if at some stage their decisions are not to the liking of the people of the Custom House?</P>
    <P>We see little point in allowing a situation to develop where the Minister for the Environment will make all the decisions in relation to the centre of this and other cities, even if he does it by remote control through his tame appointees.  But perhaps the curious structures in this Bill can be explained by its history and from whence it came.  One has to suspect that if it had not been necessary for the then Deputy Haughey to purchase a vote from Deputy Gregory-Independent &mdash; by agreeing to the acquisition by the State of the 27-acre site from the Dublin Port and Docks Board &mdash; this Bill would never have seen the light of day.  In truth this Bill was introduced simply to give an air of decency to the Custom House site deal.  If that is the case I invite the Minister to come clean, to withdraw the Bill, to go away, think about it in more detail and come back with modified proposals.</P>
    <P>The Bill appears to have been put together in more than a little hurry, that is if one gives the benefit of the doubt to the Minister and if, in fact, a retransfer of planning function to the Minister for the Environment and the future greatly enhanced role of that Minister is not a good deal more sinister.  It is worth saying that there is broad agreement from all sides of the House that the 27-acre site adjoining the Custom House is of unique significance and presents unique challenges. There is widespread agreement <Col N="274" /> across the House that the State could and should acquire this property so that it can be developed for the benefit and enrichment of the entire city.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment will recall the history surrounding the proposal by the Port and Docks Board to develop and that the Port and Docks Board accepted that any development of so uniquely significant a site must be balanced and involve industrial, commercial and residential use.  He will be aware that very detailed discussions took place between officials of the planning authority, Dublin Corporation, and representatives of the Port and Docks Board, where the mix was considered in great detail.  The final offer, as it were, which emerged from the Dublin Port and Docks Board was deemed unacceptable to the corporation, in that provision for residential and industrial use was regarded as inadequate and, as a logical corollary, that there was excessive provision for office development.  The Minister will recall that a direct decision of the councillors of Dublin Corporation &mdash; rather than, as more normally, an executive function by the officials of the corporation &mdash; asserted that that was how they saw that site being developed.  We all know it went on from there to a public hearing.</P>
    <P>As was graciously conceded by the now Taoiseach on 25 March in this House, the Coalition Government, when in office, embarked on a proposal to acquire this site, so there is agreement on that.  There is certainly no agreement on the manner in which it is now proposed that the site be acquired.  I would like some information on just what has been happening in the Custom House to give effect to this deal.  Specifically, will the Minister confirm that absolutely no negotiations, consultations or discussions took place with the people most immediately affected, the Port and Docks Board, before this Bill was published?  Will the Minister confirm that the first that the general manager of the Port and Docks Board knew of 27 acres of the board's property being acquired in such a manner was when the Minister's senior colleague, Deputy Ray Burke, told the people on television what <Col N="275" /> was happening.  That is wholly unacceptable. It is most extraordinary that a Government proposing to acquire land from anybody &mdash; and certainly in the unusual circumstances which now prevail &mdash; would not even have the commonsense, never mind the courtesy &mdash; as I can understand that they might decide to ignore the courtesy &mdash; to find out first what the Port and Docks Board thought of the situation and whether they could do a deal.  Perhaps if the Minister had spoken to Mr. Hayes they might have agreed on a price and the present Bill might never have seen the light of day. However, it has seen the light of day and contains within it a very peculiar provision on how the property of the Port and Docks Board is to be acquired.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill is worth considering, because it is absolutely central to our objections.  Subsection (1) provides that:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, after consultation with the Minister for Transport, by order transfer from the Board to the Custom House Docks Development Commission (in this section subsequently referred to as &ldquo;the Commission&rdquo;) land situated in the Custom House Docks Development Area and which is vested in, belongs to or is held in trust or subject to conditions for the Board together with all rights, powers and privileges relating to or connected with such land.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, after consultation with the Minister for Transport, by order transfer...&rdquo;, that is curious, one might have thought.  Even more curious are the provisions of subsection (2):</P>
    <P>Where an order is made under this section, there shall be payable to the Board by the Commission consideration in respect of the transfer of the land to which the order relates and such consideration shall be such as may be agreed between the Board and the Commission or, in default of such agreement, such amount as shall be determined by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Transport.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> People owning property are now to be approached by these newly ennobled commissioners.  They will consult and negotiate with them and, in the event of agreement not being reached, in comes the commissioners' boss and tells them what price is to be paid.  In the history of this State, no Government have introduced legislation so palpably repugnant to the Constitution as that now before the House.  Can any Member of the House in his or her wildest dreams conceive of a more radical departure from all normally accepted principles of fair play and natural justice?  How are the Port and Docks Board expected to believe that they will get justice, when their only opportunities are to consult with the Minister's appointees and, if they do not get satisfaction, the Minister for the Environment will step in and tell them what they are going to get anyway?</P>
    <P>Having regard to the somewhat limited independence of the commissioners in other areas, one cannot help but think that it is not dissimilar to a situation where people having problems with the Mafia are told that they have a right of appeal to the Mafia Godfather.  This is truly the most extraordinary proposal to come before this House in a very long time.</P>
    <P>Whatever justification the Minister might make on the basis that this was a question of extreme urgency and whatever political justification might be made on the basis that the Government rely on the vote of Deputy Gregory and must be seen to be doing something fast, whatever imperative there might be to get ahead with this peculiar provision, one might have thought that, at worst, it would be confined to the Port and Docks Board, but not a bit of it.  Later in the Bill we are informed that, in effect, this very strange procedure is to apply to every public body, which includes every local authority, health board, vocational education committee and any board, company, or other body which, for the time being, stands designated under this section. Who might they be, one might wonder? The Minister may, with the consent of the appropriate Minister, by order designate <Col N="277" /> for the purpose of this section a board or other body established by or under statute &mdash; which I suspect probably includes both the universities of the State.  I imagine both these bodies would get a shock if informed that they had suddenly lost their normal entitlement to fair procedure and that henceforth their property will be protected only by the fact that some nice commissioners will come along, chat with them and if they do not get on with the commissioners, they can always chat with the Minister himself.</P>
    <P>I have to suggest that that position is palpable nonsense and if Fine Gael are not to oppose this Bill we must have recognition of that fact.  We do not mind what excuse is given; if the Minister says for instance that he is trying urgently to get ahead, we will not inquire too deeply into the excuses but we are not going to permit legislation so obviously hostile to the spirit and letter of the Constitution to pass through the House.  The only conceivable argument in favour of this very curious provision would be that the normal arbitration provisions which apply to everybody else under section 76 of the Housing Act are slow and cumbersome and that the Minister wants to get ahead with his plan for the redevelopment of this very important site.  I can think of no other argument that could be advanced and I assume that it is on that basis that the Minister will hang his coat.</P>
    <P>Any such argument is totally lacking in substance for the reason that the delays that exist in the compulsory purchase procedure at present arise from the fact that a person whose property is being acquired has two bites at the cherry. First, he has the right to object to the principle of the acquisition and the right to a hearing on that and when the acquisition is confirmed he can arbitrate on the question of price.  The delays arise at the first stage while the principle of acquisition is being considered and ruled on. The question of fixing a price can be decided almost overnight.  In this instance the Port and Docks Board have no objection to being acquired: they do not want this land.  As a port facility it is redundant. They have already indicated willingness <Col N="278" /> to be dispossessed of it by entering into negotiations with the previous Government who were going to acquire it.  They were going to acquire it honestly and in accordance with normal procedure. So, there is no hassle, no objection to the principle of acquisition and their reservations centre solely on the question of their right to have some influence on the price to be paid.</P>
    <P>The Minister need have no fear that acquisition of the site would be delayed if he were to delete section 8 and allow the normal section 76 of the Housing Act procedure to be followed, because all that we would be concerned with would be the quesiton of fixing a price which could be decided very promptly.  If the Minister does not believe that, if he goes to the Port and Docks Board and says: &ldquo;Will you agree to arbitration?&rdquo; and if they put forward anybody who is halfway sensible no matter who he is, the Port and Docks Board have indicated that they are prepared to accept arbitration on the single issue of price.  But there is no indication that the Minister has any such intention at this stage.</P>
    <P>The section is outrageous and unacceptable in principle because of the procedures it provides for but it is particularly outrageous and unacceptable because of the knowledge about the Port and Docks Board circumstances that was available to the Government.  Members of the House will have been provided with a statement on this point by the Port and Docks Board and I propose with the permission of the Chair to quote from it. It went out under the hand of Bill Taylor, public relations officer, and it states:</P>
    <P>A special meeting of the Dublin Port and Docks Board today decided to seek an emergency meeting with the Minister for Transport to state their position with regard to section 8 of the Urban Development Areas Bill 1982, which is scheduled to have its Second Reading in the Dáil next week.  The Bill proposes to take possession of 27 acres of the Board's property at Custom House Docks.</P>
    <P>It goes on to set out the history of the site.  Paragraph 3 contains language <Col N="279" /> which is certainly unusual coming from a body of the status of the Port and Docks Board.  It asserts:</P>
    <P>It does not appear that in drafting the Bill, any thought was given to the consequences, not only for the Board and the port but for the community at large, of what is in effect a legalised hi-jacking of the Board's assets, an action which is but one step removed from impounding the Board's cash resources.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any previous occasion on which a semi-State body were obliged to call halt to a Government intent on hijacking its resources.</P>
    <P>But the specific problems for the Port and Docks Board are set out in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the statement.  Paragraph 4 says:</P>
    <P>The money required to finance the Board's current capital development programme has been borrowed from the Commercial Banks with the consent of the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Finance, obtained some three years ago.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that not only was the borrowing entered into with the consent of the Minister for Transport but with his active personal encouragement, that he took the view that this was a go-ahead, progressive body capable of expanding employment and that they had his blessing and encouragement.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5 makes clear the basis on which those funds were borrowed:</P>
    <P>When these funds were being borrowed it was made clear to the Government Departments and the Banks involved that the repayment of the major portion of these loans would be effected in due course when the Custom House Docks site was disposed of. The Government Departments involved clearly understood, approved of and encouraged the development programme and the financial programmes proposed at that time.  The development programmes are now well advanced and have not required <Col N="280" /> new reclamation.  These programmes have been adopted and approved by Government and enshrined in many statements by Government Ministers. Speaking at a public function on February 12th, 1981 the then Minister for Transport described the Port Board's investment of £5.25 million in development works in that year as a necessary part of the £8.4 million being invested by Port Authorities in harbour facilities.</P>
    <P>Quite simply, the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues encouraged the Port and Docks Board to go ahead and borrow to create further employment when the only collateral available for that borrowing was the site at the Custom House.  They did that with full knowledge and it is outrageous to contemplate that a Government of which Deputy Reynolds is a member, the same Deputy who encouraged the board to go ahead with this borrowing, should now asset-strip the board and deny them the assets they require to meet their borrowing commitment.</P>
    <P>We have a public sector which is stuffed with white elephants but we also have sectors of that public sector that are making a go of it, paying their way very well.  If this legislation goes through in its present form it is a sure guarantee that the Port and Docks Board who to date have carried the flag proudly will be maimed and wounded and will join the ranks of the lame ducks because they will be faced with the situation of massive borrowing completely out of proportion to their annual revenue which they could have entered into only on the basis that assets were available to back the borrowing.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not worry very much and some of his colleagues may not worry very much about adding to the number of white elephants but this is going to have real impact and real implications for real people in the Minister's constituency and in every other constituency in Dublin.  If this legislation goes through, the viability of the Port and Docks Board is called into question and the employment prospects of everyone working <Col N="281" /> there are by that act imperilled.  It is wholly irresponsible that this flight of financial fancy with whatever justification can be allowed to put at risk one of the very few sections of the public sector that is actually paying its way at present. All this is so unnecessary.  If everybody else in the State whose property is to be acquired is to be entitled to have recourse to the procedures provided under section 76 of the Housing Act, why can the same rights not be made available to the Port and Docks Board?  Unless we get a clear commitment that this crazy notion will be abandoned, the Bill will receive no support on these benches.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the Bill to which we object fundamentally is the re-emergence of the Minister for the Environment as a planning authority.  It is difficult to believe that this is happening.  One would have thought that if there was any issue on which there was a consensus in this House it was that this was a ghost which was long buried but apparently it is a ghost that stalks the Custom House since it re-emerges in full glory in this legislation. We are absolutely and implacably opposed to any suggestion that the power and influence of An Bord Pheanála in planning matters be inhibited or limited or in any way superseded by the actions of the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister and also the Minister of State will have had occasion earlier in this Dáil when we were dealing with the Pat O'Connor case and the legislation that followed that, of reading the views of the late Chief Justice, Mr. Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh, in the decision in the McMahon case on the question of secrecy of the ballot when the then Chief Justice pointed out what the responsibilities of the Legislature should be in this area.  He said that they were not to assume good faith, that they were not to operate on the basis that the powers would not be abused but rather that they were to ensure that powers should not be made available which were capable of being abused.  In that instance he said that while it was unlikely that anybody would be capable of checking up on who had voted and in what way anyone had voted, the fact that this was possible was sufficient <Col N="282" /> to render the legislation unconstitutional. If we adopt the criteria in this instance that was recommended by the then Chief Justice, one sees the Minister for the Environment in a very substantial and pivotal role.  There are major sites in a derelict condition in this city.  There are several reasons for this situation, one is that the taxation system encouraged people in the past to leave sites vacant but the excuse that will be offered by the developers is that the planning conditions are unduly onerous.</P>
    <P>If this legislation goes through in its present format there is nothing to prevent the Minister for the Environment from designating as a development area any area in which one of those sites is to be found.  In that situation there exists the possibility that a nice chummy conversation would result in the developers getting approval to speed ahead notwithstanding that the development might be wholly contrary to the wishes of the local authority and to the views that An Bord Pleanála would take.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are proud of the fact that the 1976 Planning and Development Act had the effect of taking politics out of planning applications and we are not willing to have that achievement whittled away by a backdoor method.  The suggestion that this legislation, brought in apparently to make urgent provision in regard to the Custom House site, can by a side effect unchain the Minister for the Environment as it were and leave him loose again, is repugnant to us.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect in regard to planning that we find objectionable.  The right of members of the public to be involved in the planning process is one that until now has been regarded always as being a fundamental right, a right central to the planning process but the public will have no such right in respect of any planning decision to be taken by this commission. We see no reason for the public being excluded from involvement in these matters or for their not being given the opportunity to be heard and to object if they so wish.  I suppose the Minister will argue that the public have an indirect right to be heard in so far as the local <Col N="283" /> authority will be consulted at all stages. But that is inadequate and even if it were adequate we have the situation that in the event of the Minister's appointees not seeing eye to eye with the local authority, the Minister will make the decision anyway. Consequently, we are back to the catch-22 type situation.</P>
    <P>We should like the Minister to tell us from where these planning proposals came.  So far as I am aware there was no public debate urging that the involvement of the public in the planning process be curtailed and neither am I aware of any public agitation to give back to the Minister the power to decide in respect of planning.  Despite this, these provisions are included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We want to know why these provisions are proposed but in addition we are seeking changes, changes that should be made now.  Specifically, we want the Minister for the Environment to assure us that if we permit the Bill to go beyond Second Reading, he will introduce amendments divesting himself of the power he would have if the Bill went through and restoring the planning board to their central place in the planning process.  It is worth making the point that these peculiar planning situations, while in the first instance to apply only to the walled-city site and to the Custom House site, are capable of being extended by ministerial order to any urban area.  We could have the situation where the normal planning procedures would cease to have effect in the centre of the city and instead we would be back to the pre-1976 situation with the Minister for the Environment effectively being the planning authority. Some of the wounds of what happened then are still all too visible.  Surely we have learned enough not to fall into that trap again.  I would have thought that the Minister might be secretly relieved not to have powers under the planning Acts any more.  I would have thought that the Minister of State might feel that the existence of such powers, and the political pressures that would be applied, might be embarrassing to him.  There are some very colourful examples in his own constituency that indicate what happens <Col N="284" /> when a Minister has power of this nature. In the clearest and strongest possible terms I appeal to the Minister to scrap wholly and entirely the planning provisions in so far as they purport to re-introduce as a planning authority the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other aspects in the Bill which I find strange such as the financial provisions, and in particular, the obligation to break even taking one year with another.  Given the probable strategy to be adopted by any commission it is hard to see how that could happen. One would have thought that the first phase of any commission's life would involve considerable acquisition.  I wonder how that will work.  We come back in the financial provisions to this conflict that can and may exist between the commissions and local authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 11 states:</P>
    <P>(1)  An urban development commission may make a scheme providing for the remission, in whole or in part, of rates leviable in respect of premises which are both situate within its functional area and certified by the commission to have been erected, enlarged or improved after the establishment of the commission.</P>
    <P>(2)  A scheme under this section shall specify&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the classes of descriptions of premises to which the scheme applies,</P>
    <P>(b)  the local financial years in relation to which the remission of rates is to have effect,</P>
    <P>(c)  the terms or conditions (if any) subject to which the remission of rates is to have effect in any local financial year, and</P>
    <P>(d)  the period during which the scheme is to operate.</P>
    <P>It goes on to state that a scheme under this section may be amended in certain circumstances.  I should like to know just what function will be left to local authorities if this legislation is passed.  We also <Col N="285" /> know that the decision-making processes are such that local authorities are curtailed in many instances, but we now have the situation where the Minister for the Environment by drawing lines on a map can declare certain areas within the jurisdiction of local authorities to be areas for certain types of development and that the commission can without even consulting a local authority give effect to any remission of rates.  I find it curious that a body which was not entitled to the money in the first place is to be entitled to grant a remission which will obviously affect the ability of a local authority to do its day to day work.  That section is indicative of the lack of respect and regard there is for local authorities.  That emerges clearly in the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State may be aware that there is widespread concern among councillors in the areas most immediately effected &mdash; in the first instance, Dublin, and later, perhaps, Cork and Limerick &mdash; about what they see as a diminution of their powers.  I am a memeber of a Dublin local authority and it would not keep me awake at night if that local authority lost all their powers in this area altogether if I was satisfied that the job would be done in a better way and that the city would be rejuvenated and renewed, but I have grave doubts that that will happen.  I have grave doubts whether in fact those appointed by the Minister are likely to emerge better equipped and more knowledgeable about the needs of this city than those elected by the people of the city.</P>
    <P>This morning I received a letter from the Dublin city manager which refers to the fact that arising from the alarm expressed by members from all parties &mdash; I stand corrected on that, maybe &mdash; about the provisions of the Bill and pointing out that a special meeting of the city council will be held to discuss the Bill on Thursday next at 8 o'clock.  Being aware of this fact, the Minister of State has written a letter to the city manager, Mr. Frank Feely, in which he seeks to put his mind at rest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Brady, Dublin South-East) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Brady, Dublin South-East)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Brady,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dublin South-East):</i>
        <Col N="286" /> On a point of information, I should like to state that I met the city manager long before that letter was written and the Deputy knows that.  I gave him the assurance that I gave to the House and I have now given that assurance in writing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt that the Minister of State did meet the city manager and I did not suggest otherwise, but I assume that the letter to the city manager from the Minister of State represents the Minister's present thinking on the matter.  I assume that this is as far as he can go on re-assuring local councillors who may be worried about this matter.  It is worth putting the contents of that letter on the record of the House to see how inadequate those reassurances are.  The letter is dated 14 June 1982 and is addressed to Mr. F. Feely, City Manager, City Hall, Dublin.  The letter states:</P>
      <P>Dear Manager,</P>
      <P>I have seen a press report about Councillors being worried that their position may be undermined by the development commissions which are to be set up under the Urban Development Areas Bill, 1982, which is at present before the Dáil.  I understand that you will be reporting to the City Council in the matter.</P>
      <P>I would like to explain the context in which the Government have decided to set up these bodies, and in which they will operate.  Above all, I would like to stress that the development commissions are not intended to displace the Corporation from having a primary responsibility in regard to urban renewal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Corporation, and other planning authorities, are required to include in their development plans objectives for development and renewal of obsolete areas, and to take steps for the achievement of these objectives.  That system will remain basically unchanged.  The Corporation have some considerable achievements to their credit in this area and are dealing with a number of important projects at present, including the proposals <Col N="287" /> for redevelopment in the Designated Area.  But the Government, and I am sure the Corporation and planning authorities generally, would like to see more rapid progress being made to generate renewal in central urban areas which have lost their economic and social vitality and have become run down.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;And so say all of us.  The letter continues:</P>
    <P>The Development Commissions which are set up under the Bill to undertake and promote regeneration on the Port and Docks Board Site and in the Walled City Area, and commissions of the kind which may be set up in other areas, are a central element in the Government's design to deal with this need, but they are not the only element.  I am undertaking a close examination of the working of the existing physical planning and development provisions as they relate to urban renewal throughout the country &mdash; the achievements and the problems. In the light of this examination I will consider what statutory or other changes might be made in order to help planning authorities to deal with the problem more effectively and on a scale which the conditions require.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the Government is anxious that an immediate momentum should be developed in the selected pilot areas and that this task should be assigned to the proposed Development Commissions.  In this way early experience will be gained of the effectiveness of this approach and how it might be fitted into the overall planning and development system in which the planning authority will retain the primary functions and responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill a Development Commission would be empowered to prepare a planning scheme for their area but this would be done on consultation with the Planning Authority.  Likewise, a Commission could not carry out or approve development without consultation with the planning authority, as prescribed, and if there is disagreement <Col N="288" /> the Minister must be consulted. In effect, a Commission will be in much the same position as regards development control as a State authority except that there is more stringent provision in that the Minister may prohibit the carrying out of development if he considers that to be justified.  These provisions are designed to strike a reasonable balance between the need for the Commissions to proceed urgently and the need to maintain the planning system in all essentials.  Subject to the provisions referred to, the development plan will continue to hold sway in the area of a development commission and there is specific provision in the Bill for the possibility of a special development plan being made by the Planning Authority for such an area.</P>
    <P>I would certainly hope therefore that the Corporation, far from resenting the Commissions, would look on them as their allies.  The Commissions will supplement the Corporation's efforts and share the burden by launching the pilot regeneration schemes in the two areas, while the general review of urban renewal operations to which I have referred proceeds.  The Bill provides that development commissions will be dissolved when their task is completed.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that renewal in the two areas cannot be planned or carried out in isolation from the surrounding areas and that the success of the Commissions will depend to a considerable extent on the co-operation of the Planning Authority as well as of other interests involved.</P>
    <P>I would like then to reassure the Corporation that their central role and responsibility in urban renewal will remain and to solicit their co-operation in advance with the new Commissions in the interest &mdash; which they will know that I share with them &mdash; of making the best of possible progress in dealing with the pressing need to promote restoration and revival in large parts of the inner city.</P>
    <P>I would like you to bring the contents of this letter to the attention of the City Council when you are reporting to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all very well and I have no doubt whatever &mdash; because I know and accept fully the Minister of State's interest in this area and his record is there for all of us to see so that anyone who would have doubts would be more than a little fanciful &mdash; that he envisages the commission and the corporation acting in harmony.  However, the structures being created do not necessarily achieve that.  Surely the Minister of State must be aware that local authority members will resent a situation where parts of their city or town would be defined and designated in a particular way by the Minister for the Environment, particularly when the effect and consequence of that designation is that they will cease to exercise some of their powers, and some of their powers within that designated area will be operated by a non-elected commission.  I cannot but believe that the Bill is redolent of a dismissive approach to local authorities and to their right to plan, govern and control their city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If much of my speech has been concentrated on what we see as objectionable in this Bill, that should not tend to obscure the essential agreement that there is between us.  Quite clearly every Member of this House is aware of the extent of the <Col N="290" /> problem.  Every Member of this House cannot but be ashamed of the condition in which this capital city is today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. Brady (Dublin South-East) Mr. Brady (Dublin South-East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> Let us try to do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>On that we are in agreement and I would not wish criticisms of mine on the details of the Bill to obscure the central agreement that exists on that.  Georgian Dublin has been destroyed building by building and developers are now turning their attention to Victorian Dublin.  At times one feels that the listing of buildings as of significance is simply to highlight them as targets for would-be developers.  The principal street of this city, once one of the great streets of Europe, now alternates between slot machines and fast food restaurants. We are all aware that this city has lost much of its vitality and charm. Examples abound elsewhere to show us what can be done with proper care, thought and planning.  I am not suggesting that we ever will match the imperial splendour of London or Paris or some of the great cities of Europe, but this was once a city of charm and grace which have been systematically suffocated. That is a cause of concern and we all want something done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Minister's view that the first major opportunity available to us is centred on the Port and Docks Board site because that site is of unique significance. If we muff this one certainly we will not have a comparable chance again.  The northern inner city is an area which, even before the election of Deputy Gregory-Independent who sought to put it on the map, was recognised as one of extreme deprivation.  We had a debate on the Adjournment in this House not so long ago about the educational problems in that area.  We are aware of the housing needs there, and the case is that, if progress is to be made, then the first and most encouraging option available is to get hold of the Port and Docks Board site and to do the right thing with it whether prompted by Deputy Gregory-Independent or not.  In recognising that fact the <Col N="291" /> Minister is doing a very good job and we are absolutely <i>ad idem</i> on that.</P>
    <P>Whether because it was felt that it would be a bit raw to let the area defined by Deputy Gregory stand alone or otherwise, the inclusion of the second area, the walled city, is a fine choice on which the Minister of State deserves to be congratulated. Many of us admired the fact that even when it was not popular within his own party to stand against the sacrilege occurring in Wood Quay, the Minister stood alone and won our respect. We are absolutely in agreement in selecting this as an area in urgent need of redevelopment.  What concerns me is that the goodwill and the basic consensus that exists about the urgency of tackling this problem is being needlessly sacrificed by, at best, clumsiness and, at worst, a degree of deviousness which is represented elsewhere in the Bill.  This could have been a simple Bill which would have been heralded as a major step towards making Dublin great again but it has become the subject of political controversy because of the inclusion of provisions which are fundamentally objectionable.  I appeal to the Minister to look again at those provisions so that the Bill can be welcomed by all.</P>
    <P>This Bill alone, even without the objectionable provisions, will not achieve the redevelopment of our city and the Minister would probably accept that.  There will still be derelict sites and the legislation governing such sites is antiquated and represents an impossible challenge to a local authority who want to acquire these sites.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify the extent to which the commissions will be better able to deal with these sites than the local authorities.  Surely they will meet the same stumbling blocks as the local authorities regarding the ownership of the sites, the proper serving of notices and all the other complexities.</P>
    <P>No thought has been given to producing any sort of mixed living inner city. Year after year the heart has been eaten out of this city and only during the period of the 1973-77 Coalition Government was there a programme initiated for local <Col N="292" /> authority housing in the inner city.  This is beginning to make a major change in the lifestyle of the inner city but it stands alone.  The provision of both local authority and private housing in the inner city is essential.  This bring me once again to the peculiarities of the Bill.  The Dublin Port and Docks Board site is to be acquired and we presume that the development will contain a large element of housing but we must ask who the people are who will be housed there.  They are the very people whose jobs are being imperilled by the manner of acquisition of the site.  There is a short-sightedness here which is hard to understand.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to look again at the objectionable features of this Bill and to amend the Bill on Committee Stage in a number of respects.  Let him tell us that he will change the procedure for designating an area as a development area so that the local authority will be fully involved in the initial decision-making process.  I would suggest that the appropriate formula would be that he should make a designating order only on the recommendation of a local authority or alternatively that he would make such an order only if a local authority failed to deal with a problem brought to their attention by him.  Such a gesture of goodwill would be widely welcomed by local authority members.  Let him say that he has had second thoughts about the planning aspects and that he accepts that, while it may have been unintentional and certainly not malicious, the Bill as drafted is capable of achieving a transfer of power and influence from the local authority and An Bord Pleanála to the commission and the Minister.  He should state that such is not his desire and that he will be pleased to amend the legislation to restore the <i>status quo</i> and the primacy of the local authority as the planning authority and also restore An Bord Pleanála as central to the planning process. Let him have another look at the provision for acquiring the Dublin Port and Docks Board land and also the land of the various public bodies specified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will describe the part played by himself personally in negotiations on the future of the Talbot motor assembly plant last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The closure of the Talbot motor assembly plant last year gave rise to the most serious and controversial industrial relations issue of recent years.</P>
      <P>This culminated in a commital order being issued by the High Court against the district secretary of the main trade union concerned.  The reaction of the trade union movement to what they saw as a serious restriction on trade union activity indicated that unless the dispute were resolved there was the risk of grave disruption to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general acceptance of the seriousness of this issue is evident from the fact that the last Government's programme contained an undertaking to amend the <Col N="294" /> law to give protection to ICTU arrangements for all-out pickets.</P>
    <P>Because of the seriousness of the matter, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions made proposals to resolve the dispute roughly on the lines of the agreement ultimately reached.  My part in the negotiations was to urge the various parties to seek to arrive at a peaceful settlement of the dispute on the lines suggested by Congress in the interests of the economy and to safeguard a £17½ million tyre contract for Dunlops, Cork, and over 500 jobs in the Talbot company and its agents, all of which were dependent on an agreement being reached.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach tell the House whether before the terms, which were finally agreed, were put to the workers, they were placed before and fully discussed and agreed by the Government as a collective authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have on a number of occasions made it clear that how the Government do their business in these matters is a matter for the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I could draw an inference from that which the Taoiseach would be able to refrain from rebutting.  Is the Taoiseach's answer to be taken to mean that from now on any Taoiseach could ride out ahead of the Government, not consult them or listen to anything any members might have to say and make whatever dispositions he wished in any area or any Department he chose and subsequently shelter behind the excuse that the Government and the way they do their business do not bear investigation in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy keeps persisting in this line of attack on me personally. I, as Taoiseach, this Government and the previous Government conduct our affairs in accordance with well-established procedures and traditions of an Irish Government and Cabinet.  Perhaps I can contrast that with the rather extraordinary situation which prevailed in the time of the last Coalition Government when a complete outsider, under <Col N="295" /> the guise of a special adviser, participated in Government meetings.  It ill behoves Deputy Kelly as a member of Fine Gael and that Government to criticise me for my behaviour as Taoiseach in charge of Government affairs when he participated in that other arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>During those nine months the present Taoiseach on frequent occasions asked questions and made reference to the situation he is now complaining about.  He had his innings when in Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am having mine now. Apart from the question which the Taoiseach refused to answer and which leaves me entitled to draw my own conclusions, which was whether the Government was consulted about, considered and agreed to the terms arrived at, I should like to ask him if there are any precedents in the industrial history of the country or any arrangements remotely approaching this one in its openendedness and incalculable burden on public revenue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there are countless precedents.  I could go back to the Government under W.T. Cosgrave which made an agreement of a similar kind, but the most recent example is when the Coalition, of which Deputy Kelly was a distinguished member, carried on the agreement which my Government made with ICTU.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a number of points.  Was any legal advice taken with the Attorney General before entering into this agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No. but the Government of which Deputy FitzGerald was Taoiseach took legal advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the legal advice they received they proceeded to implement the agreement and carry it on after its terms had expired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the legal advice we got was that the agreement was entered into improperly without due care and consideration but in such a way that it bound the Government, without their having been consulted, to pay indefinitely to these workers their full pay and that we have no alternative but to carry that through because of the manner in which the Taoiseach mismanaged it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald as Taoiseach received advice from the Attorney General to the effect that the Attorney General was not certain whether the agreement was binding, but despite that advice and clearly compelled by the same considerations which compelled our Government, they decided of their own volition and free will to extend the agreement which expired last December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The advice we got was that the way the Taoiseach entered into the agreement was such that it would be difficult for us to be sure that a court would uphold our testing of it.  The issue involved was a complex legal one and because of the way in which the Taoiseach acted it would be unwise for us to repudiate the agreement.  Would the Taoiseach accept that he took no legal advice and that the agreement entered into involved the assumption that an industry would be available when there was no adequate indication that such an alternative industry was available and that there was an exchange of so-called letters which were written by civil servants to the firm which had the effect of leaving the State with liability to pay these workers indefinitely unless an industry was found and installed in the factory?  Would the Taoiseach accept the correctness of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I want to reiterate that my Government's wish was to co-operate with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in endeavouring to resolve what could have been a catastrophic industrial relations situation.  We succeeded in doing that and I am reinforced in my view that what we did was right by the fact that the Government over which Deputy FitzGerald presided &mdash; of its own free will and volition and after the agreement which we had entered into expired &mdash; renewed that agreement.  It ill behoves Deputy FitzGerald to attempt to criticise the arrangement I entered into in the interests of industrial relations and industrial peace in this country, when his Government and he extended that agreement themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already pointed out that the advice given to us did not leave us much alternative in the matter in view of the manner in which this affair had been mishandled by the Taoiseach when in office.  May I ask the Taoiseach whether he stands over the sending of a letter, as Leader of the Opposition, purporting to interpret the agreement as involving not merely an obligation to pay to the workers their full pay indefinitely &mdash; whether or not they ever worked again &mdash; but also the payment of supplementary benefit during the period of dispute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can take it that I stand over any letters I issued in my name.  I hope the same applies for himself particularly in relation to certain constitutional issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach therefore accepts that in opposition he intervened in this matter with a view to giving as his view that supplementary benefit was payable as well, even though no such obligation in fact had been contemplated at the time the agreement was entered into, and thereby sought to add to the burden on the State over and above the contractual obligations of the agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

My motivation in all of this was to <Col N="299" /> avoid a catastrophic industrial relations situation, to keep trade union leaders and workers out of jail.  I succeeded in doing that.  I make no apologies to anybody for that agreement and I believe it was in the best interests of everybody concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach is it not a fact that the civil servants begged the Taoiseach and the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, to consider the implications of his proposal, that the civil servants disagreed so strongly that they required written instructions from the Minister for Finance before they would sign?  Could the Taoiseach give us any indication of the cost to date and the cost implications for the future?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy says is not correct.  In fact the negotiations in regard to the agreement were not conducted by me personally at all but rather at civil service level.</P>

      <P>I feel I am entitled to make my statement in this House without these sorts of savage interruptions.  I am saying that the negotiations were conducted at civil service level.  I am quite satisfied that the civil servants concerned acted properly and correctly.  I am particularly reinforced in that opinion &mdash; and I must come back to this &mdash; because, when the Government over which Deputy FitzGerald presided came to look at this situation they took exactly the same action as I had and continued the agreement even though they could have taken other action in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the unprecedented directions issued by him to the civil servants concerned in relation to the negotiations and the signing of this agreement would warrant a committee of inquiry?  Would the Taoiseach be prepared to set up a committee of inquiry, more particularly since the contents of the agreement bound future Governments in this country, with no expiry date, to an extent which was unique in the history of industrial relations in Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a complete misconstruction of the situation.  First of all, the only committee of inquiry with which we are concerned is this House.  I am here today prepared to answer fully for entering into that agreement, to explain that the reason we entered into that agreement was in response to an approach by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, who put proposals to me and to the Government to avoid what looked like being a totally catastrophic industrial relations confrontation.  I succeeded &mdash; and that is probably what is bothering the Opposition parties &mdash; by patient, arduous and difficult negotiation, in avoiding that appallingly possible situation, keeping trade union leaders and decent ordinary Irish workers out of jail.  The very fact that we succeeded in doing that is justification in itself for the agreement entered into, and there was nothing particularly unprecedented about that agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  One meeting <Col N="302" /> between myself, the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time and representatives of the international company concerned was held in my house in Kinsealy for the convenience of those international representatives, because they were flying in and out again at very short notice.  From that point of view it was much more convenient to meet them and discuss the situation in my house in Kinsealy, but that was the only meeting in this connection which was held there.  I do not for one moment apologise to the House for holding meetings in Kinsealy. It is a very pleasant place to hold a meeting. I will continue to hold meetings in Kinsealy, any meeting I feel like and as often as I feel like.  As for this nit picking type of questioning, I do not think the Opposition are doing themselves any good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I asked this question was that the Taoiseach made the allegation against civil servants that they negotiated the agreement.  I wish to establish that the agreement was in fact negotiated at Kinsealy by the Taoiseach and that the slur on civil servants that they negotiated it should be withdrawn. When I came into office and discussed it with the civil servants concerned they made it clear that only under pressure from the Taoiseach had they signed such an agreement.  Would the Taoiseach withdraw the suggestion that civil servants were responsible for negotiating an agreement of such gross incompetence?</P>

I have already stated I make no apology for the agreement and I am glad we made the agreement.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I always endeavour to be courteous and I would like to have some courtesy by way of reply.  I am saying that the actual negotiations and drafting of the agreement were done by civil servants on my instructions and under my general aegis with their appropriate opposite numbers in the trade union movement.  I want to repeat again that the Opposition can keep at this as long as they wish; but I, the Minister at the time and everybody concerned in the trade union movement and elsewhere were motivated by avoiding what might have been a catastrophic industrial relations confrontation with people in jail. We succeeded in doing that.  I went to enormous personal painstaking trouble and I spent a great deal of my time in using my influence to ensure that this difficult matter would be settled.  It was settled and I am glad Deputy FitzGerald's Government had the common sense to continue on of their own free volition with the agreement I entered into.</P>

Would the Minister of State not agree it is about time that his Government examined the whole system of motor insurance with a view to seeing that each individual is insured as distinct from the motor vehicle?  If that happened there would not be any need for the Motor Insurance Bureau.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I met a deputation from Buncrana Urban District Council on 29 April 1982, to discuss the general financial position of the council.  In regard to the housing needs of the urban district council, I promised to consider an application which the council would submit for sanction to a loan for the development of 38 private housing sites and also to consider, in conjunction with the examination of claims from other local authorities, making a further capital allocation available to the council in respect of its local authority housing programme in 1982.  An additional allocation of £90,000 is now being made available to the council to meet commitments on their programme.  In regard to the maintenance and upkeep of existing rented houses, I pointed out that the council's revenue account would benefit to the tune of about £14,500 from the Government's decision to allow local authorities to retain 40 per cent of house sales receipts for current purposes and also indicated that he would consider any submission from the council regarding the use of housing capital receipts for the carrying out of improvement works to their rented dwellings under the scheme of improvement works for local authority dwellings.  These works may qualify for grants under the recently revised house improvement grants scheme.</P>
      <P>Regarding water and sewerage needs in the area, I indicated that the preparation of contract documents for phase II of the Buncrana sewerage scheme had been approved on 4 February 1982. These documents have since been received and are now under consideration in the Department.  I also pointed out that contract documents for the mechanical plant for the enlargement of filter works for the Buncrana water supply scheme had been approved on 28 April 1982 and that plant tenders could now be sought to enable completion of contract documents for the civil works.</P>

      <P>I am so aware.  A report on the housing situation in member countries is contained in the Report on Social Developments which is published annually by the Commission of the European Communities.  Financial assistance from the Commission in respect of housing is very limited because of the pressure of demands on funds such as the Common Agricultural Fund, the Regional Fund and the Social Fund.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, an extensive range of comparative housing statistics relating to EEC countries and to other countries is already available in the Annual Bulletin of Housing and Building Statistics for Europe and in the United Nations Yearbook of Construction Statistics.  The bulletin is published by the Economic Commission for Europe, which is a subsidiary body of the United Nations.  At present the nature and extent of the statistics available is being reviewed by the Economic Commission and by the Conference of European Statisticians.  In this connection the points made by the Deputy will be borne in mind, but I should add at this stage that it may be impractical for most countries to supply some of the statistics referred to by him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never been awkward, so I agree to that suggestion, too. I will now read the reply to Questions Nos. 19 to 27, inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 2 May, 1982, the Minister announced that local authorities may approve loans under the Housing Finance Agency Act, 1981, on the basis of the scheme already announced.  He stated that, because of serious reservations regarding some aspects of the <Col N="322" /> scheme, particularly the long term obligations of borrowers, the Government intend to review the scheme in the context of the publication of a comprehensive White Paper on Housing around the end of this year.  A circular letter in the matter was issued by the agency to local authorities on 3 May.</P>
    <P>During the course of the rushed debate in Dáil Éireann last December on the Housing Finance Agency Bill, I outlined my reservations on this loan scheme. These reservations are still valid</P>
    <P>My main concern is the mortgage rate based on inflation plus 3.25 per cent.  It is difficult to predict the relationship between incomes and inflation in the next 25 years.  In any event, the borrower will usually find it more difficult to resell his house than under the conventional loan scheme, particularly if he lives in some rural areas.  In a sense, he is locked into his house.  There is a distinct possibility that the mortgage rate charged will be greater in many years than the market mortgage rate.</P>
    <P>I regret that the previous administration saw fit to reject various amendments tabled by me and my colleagues at the Committee Stage of the Bill, which were designed to meet the reservations we had in mind.</P>
    <P>Where a potential borrower under the scheme seeks my advice, I invariably suggest that he should try to finance the house purchase by way of a conventional loan.  It is only in circumstances where this is not feasible that I advise him to consider a loan under the agency scheme. In these cases, I advise him to consider carefully the long-term implications of the loan repayments under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Up to the middle of last month, some 1,600 completed applications for loans under the scheme were received by local authorities.  Further statistical data in the form sought by Deputies are not available at present.  There will be no undue delay in advancing individual loans under the scheme when legal and other formalities have been complied with.  The agency will make the necessary funds available to housing authorities for this purpose in due course.</P>
    <P>The agency propose to issue a circular <Col N="323" /> letter to local authorities around the end of this month, clarifying most of the outstanding points.  The agency are consulting with the authorities with a view to ensuring that the scheme is operated and monitored satisfactorily.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Immediately before I left for New York to address the Second Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly on Disarmament on 11 June, I said that I would favour a debate in this House as soon as possible after my return on developments in Lebanon, where more than 700 Irish troops are serving with the United Nations Interim Force.</P>
      <P>In the United States I was accompanied by Deputy Gerard Collins, Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I have deposited in the Library of the House a copy of my address to the General Assembly.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, 6 June, the Israeli Army invaded Lebanon and moved, in strength, through areas occupied by UNIFIL in conformity with the mandate given to that Force by the United Nations.</P>
      <P>This mandate is based on resolutions passed by the Security Council in March and May 1978, which called for strict respect for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon, within its internationally recognised boundaries, and asked that Israel should immediately cease its military action and withdraw its forces from all Lebanese territory.  The Security Council also decided, in the light of the request of the Government of Lebanon, to establish immediately under its authority a United Nations Interim Force for Southern Lebanon:</P>
      <P>for the purpose of confirming the withdrawal of Israeli Forces, restoring international peace and security and assisting the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area.</P>
      <P>The May Resolution approved an increase in the strength of UNIFIL from 4,000 to approximately 6,000 troops and called upon Israel to complete its withdrawal from all Lebanese territory without further delay.  The Resolution also deplored the attacks on the United Nations Force that had occurred and demanded full respect for the Force from all parties in the Lebanon.  The Force was further recently increased to its present strength of 7,000, including an Irish contingent of 720.</P>

    <P>These Resolutions make clear that the basic purpose of UNIFIL is peace-keeping and not peace enforcement.  In any <Col N="357" /> event, the size of the Force and their equipment are such as to make it patently impossible for them to withstand the attack of a vastly greater and better equipped modern army.  In a statement issued immediately following the Israeli invasion, the Government made clear our view that UNIFIL are properly discharging their designated function in the face of a very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>I should say here, for the information of the House, that our contingent are faced with no immediate danger and that in response to representations made by us to the Israeli authorities, the Israelis have officially responded that they do not foresee any danger to Irish troops.  The Irish contingent have throughout these hostilities carried out as far as possible their normal activities in the area of operations.  They continue to man their posts, protect the civilian population, make humanitarian efforts in co-operation with the Government of Lebanon and relevant agencies and maintain contact with all parties with a view to maintaining order at local level.  Our latest information is that the small number of Irish residents in the Lebanon are also safe.</P>
    <P>As members of the European Community, we joined on 9 June in vigorously condemning the Israeli invasion which, like the bombardment which preceded it, has caused very great loss of human life and constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and of the most basic humanitarian principles.  In that statement, copies of which I have communicated to the leaders of the other parties in this House, the Community reaffirmed the importance they attach to the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and national unity of Lebanon, which are indispensable for peace in the region. We called, in particular, on Israel to withdraw all its forces immediately and unconditionally from the Lebanon and place UNIFIL in a position to accomplish their mission without hindrance.  The statement indicated that should Israel continue to refuse compliance, the Ten would examine the possibilities for future action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> The statement further indicated that the objective of the Ten is to work for a Lebanon free from violence.  This cannot be dissociated from the establishment of a global, just and lasting peace in the region.  The Ten indicated their readiness to assist in bringing the parties concerned to accept measures intended to lower the level of tension, re-establish confidence and facilitate a negotiated solution.  Prior to this, the United Nations Security Council adopted, by a vote of 15 to zero, a resolution sponsored by Ireland calling for the complete and unconditional withdrawal of the Israeli Forces back to the internationally recognised boundaries.</P>
    <P>Consultations have continued among the Ten and in the course of diplomatic contacts between the Belgian Presidency and Israel, the Ten have made it known that they expect Israel to withdraw immediately and unconditionally from Lebanese territory in accordance with UN Security Council Resolutions 508 and 509.  In the immediate situation the Ten have asked Israel to facilitate the work of humanitarian relief organisations in occupied Lebanese territory, to facilitate the media in their task of reporting on the situation, to apply the Geneva Conventions as regards the treatment of prisoners and to co-operate fully with the UN Secretary General.  They have asked Israel to respect Lebanese sovereignty and independence, to affirm that it does not intend offensive action against other neighbouring countries and that it has no hostile intentions towards the Palestinian people.  They have also asked Israel to observe the cease-fire as long as other combatants in the region do likewise.</P>
    <P>This, briefly, is the legal or institutional background to what has happened.  There are, of course, other considerations. First, the events of the past few weeks are but the latest manifestation of the long-standing dispute between the Arab States and the Palestinian people, on the one hand, and Israel on the other.  The Government intend to adhere firmly to the policy, which has been elaborated over the years, and is enunciated clearly in the Venice declaration of June 1980. The central elements of that declaration are, as Deputies will recall, recognition <Col N="359" /> of the right of all States in the area, including Israel, to a secure and peaceful existence and recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to full self-determination. Ireland recognises the role of the PLO in representing the Palestinian people in negotiations for a comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>Next, on a wider plane, the strategic and economic importance of the area makes continued conflict and instability there a matter of concern for the whole world.  These wider implications must be taken into account.  They affect regions and considerations infinitely greater than the area devastated by the present conflict. Indeed, there is virtually no limit to the consequences for the world of an extension of the conflict.</P>
    <P>Further, and by no means least, there are the purely humanitarian issues of those afflicted by the present invasion &mdash; the wounded and the refugees.  This problem is assuming really tragic proportions. The numbers affected are measured in their hundreds of thousands. There are shortages of food, water, medical supplies, shelter and clothing.  A whole society is in a state of total disarray, if not disintegration.  The Ten are already examining, within their institutions, the means of giving aid to the victims. In so far as Ireland is concerned, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has announced that we will contribute a sum of £100,000 from the Disaster Relief Fund to the Irish Red Cross in response to its appeal, on behalf of the International Committee of the Red Cross, for the provision of medical care, food and temporary shelter for persons injured or displaced following the Israeli invasion.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the question of the future of UNIFIL and indeed of UN peace-keeping efforts generally.  On the present occasion, UNIFIL were simply brushed aside by vastly superior armed contingents.  A peace-keeping force can exist and perform its functions only in so far as it is accepted by the community of nations.  It acts through consensus and moral authority.  The neglect or refusal of even one member to accept the basic principles on which the United Nations <Col N="360" /> acts can, as in the present instance, render its efforts futile.  Apart from raising the question of what then follows &mdash; and in the ultimate only overwhelming and irrational force can supplant the rule of law and international order &mdash; these developments raise, in the most serious way, questions as to the role and future of UNIFIL, which I discussed at length, and in detail, with the United Nations Secretary General, Senor Perez de Cuellar, in New York on 11 June.</P>
    <P>During these discussions, which also covered the implications of the present conflict for the Iran and Iraq confrontation, I emphasised our concern for the preservation and enhancement of the function of the United Nations in lowering international tension and preventing or limiting war.  As I said, in my address on disarmament, man has always had to live with the prospect of his death as an individual, but today, mankind has to live with the prospect of its extinction.  That is the nature of the threat we face.  The United Nations is the one institution, with world-wide membership, devoted to the resolution of conflict before it becomes conflagration.  I assured the Secretary General that, while keeping the present situation under continuous review, we would maintain our contingent in UNIFIL in place, pending clarification of the Mandate &mdash; unless something at present entirely unforeseen happens, which makes the maintenance of the Force impossible.</P>
    <P>Ireland remains committed to peace-keeping and to UNIFIL in particular.  But as things stand, UNIFIL cannot fulfill their mandate.  They occupy a territory where order and the basic infrastructure for living have been virtually destroyed. In the immediate future and until the situation is clarified, UNIFIL should not, of course, be withdrawn precipitately. But in the long term, it would be hard to see much point in leaving them if they have no authority to act.  There would also be little point in returning to the previous situation where UNIFIL were never allowed to deploy fully in the area for which they had been given responsibility but were instead subjected to harassment as they carried out their functions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> On the other hand, I was very conscious during my discussions in the United States of the widespread feeling on all sides that even after what has happened UNIFIL represent an important potential for order in a fundamentally disturbed region.  As a core of stability, they provide some basis for hope.  But as an authoritative UN source put it, the usefulness and effectiveness of the Force is proportionate to the degree to which it is accepted by the participants in the conflict and the extent to which the countries with influence in the area, and the members of the UN in general, give it support.</P>
    <P>If these basic propositions are accepted, the question arises of the best course to follow now.  What is essential in the region is that some force for stability should exist while the causes of the present conflict are examined, and in time, and with patience, eliminated. This, of course, involves not only the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Lebanon but relations between other states in the region, as well, which are embittered and destabilised by the persistence of uncertainty and the continuing potential for full-scale war.  Fear and tension thrive on insecurity; and violence is a disease which cannot be limited by more violence.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, clear that UNIFIL must not be put in a position of ensuring or safeguarding on behalf of any state, territory acquired by force and in flagrant breach of international law.  That could not be part of any UN mandate even by implication.  Accordingly, it is vital that Israel withdraw its forces completely from Lebanon as it is required to do under the Security Council Resolution which Ireland proposed and which the Council adopted unanimously.  It is vital too that the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon be preserved.</P>
    <P>A question now arises as to how best the UN can help in achieving these aims. One course which the Security Council might consider &mdash; if the Government of Lebanon so desire&mdash;could perhaps be to establish a larger force with a mandate covering in addition to the present UNIFIL territory the wider area through <Col N="362" /> which the recent battles have raged. What is certainly essential in the region is that some kind of stability should be re-established and the basic causes of the conflict addressed so that progress can be made towards their resolution.</P>
    <P>These are the questions to which the community of nations must now look. The role of UNIFIL will be the subject of debate in the Security Council on or before 19 June when the renewal of the mandate is due to come up for consideration; and Ireland as a member of the Council will, of course, maintain close contact with other members and with the Secretary General on this matter and will play its full part in that consideration.</P>
    <P>I am glad of the opportunity afforded me by this occasion to hear the views of Deputies in this House on this important issue and on the larger issues on which I have touched.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I wish to join with the Government and the Security Council of the United Nations in the condemnation of Israeli aggression in the Lebanon.  In no way can the attempted assassination of Ambassador Argov be seen as a justification for this monstrous invasion, which appears to have little regard for the lives of innocent men, women and children.  The estimated figures of 10,000 dead, 30,000 wounded and 600,000 homeless are horrific taken in the context of a ten-day war. To date the Israelis' reaction increasingly has the appearance of attempted wholesale genocide of the Palestinian people in Lebanon in the pursuit of what can be only a limited peace and it is totally unacceptable to all mankind.  Their efforts to exterminate the PLO cannot succeed, given the mobility and character of such an organisation, and their efforts to do so at enormous cost to the civilian population are criminal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manner in which Israel has completely ignored resolutions of the Security Council for a ceasefire and immediate withdrawal has illustrated utter contempt for world opinion.  We are thankful that the UNIFIL Forces in Southern Lebanon, and the Irish contingent in particular, have not suffered any serious casualties <Col N="363" /> over the past ten days.  However, the manner in which they have been brushed aside by the Israeli armoured columns is an indication of that country's total disregard for the authority of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Since the UN mandate is up for renewal on June 19 &mdash; this week &mdash; serious consideration must be given to the redeployment of the 7,000 strong force involved.  We feel that the force should be retained, but that they might be better located elsewhere in the Lebanon &mdash; for example &mdash; in Beirut and, in particular, West Beirut.</P>
    <P>It would appear that Israel is in control of the 25-mile strip south of the Litani River formerly occupied by UNIFIL and PLO and Right Wing irregulars and it is unlikely that further artillery attacks on Israeli settlements can be launched from the area on a systematic basis, as has been the case for the past four years. While talking about this area, reference must be made to the gross interference in the UN operation by the Christian Right Wing Forces led by Major Haddad and financed and armed by the Israelis.  Their presence has undermined the role of the UNIFIL force, preventing them from carrying out their mandate, and has been directly responsible for a number of deaths in that force, including, it is to be regretted, a number of Irish soldiers. Despite repeated requests from the UN, Israel has never made any attempt to curtail the activities of Haddad's forces, which are obviously under their direct control.  Proof of this, if proof were needed, is the manner in which the Israelis handed over the captured PLO stronghold, Beaufort Castle, to Major Haddad in the early stages of the offensive.</P>
    <P>The redeployment of the UNIFIL forces cannot be exactly determined until we have a more clear-cut picture of Israel's intentions, the eventual extent of PLO and Palestinian presence in Lebanon, the future role, if any, of the Syrian Army in Lebanon, and the possibility of a stable Lebanese state without interference from Israel, PLO or Syria.  The latter &mdash; that is the foundation of a stable <Col N="364" /> Lebanese state &mdash; would certainly be the most desirable outcome and it is just possible that it can be achieved once again on a coalition basis, despite the memories of the horrors of the 1975-76 civil war. There must be a real hope that, with the exclusion of the Israelis, PLO and Syrians, the Right Wing Lebanese will agree to live together in peace and harmony.</P>
    <P>Resolution No. 425 of March 1978 laid down three conditions for sending the UNIFIL force to Southern Lebanon: (1) to confirm the withdrawal of Israeli forces (2) to ensure international peace and security, (3) to assist the Government of Lebanon in ensuring their effective authority in the area.  At that time the Israeli force withdrew but international peace and security were not restored and the Government of Lebanon has hardly functioned in the interim period.  There has been really no effective authority in large parts of Lebanon, particularly Southern Lebanon, since that Israeli incursion and we must face up to the fact that instability has been the result of the actions of the PLO and their continuous bombardments.  Parts of Lebanon, particularly the Beka'a Valley, have been occupied by 30,000 Syrian troops and until they are withdrawn the objective of the Resolution cannot be fulfilled.  They constitute a threat to the sovereignty of Lebanon, just as do the PLO and more recently the Israelis.  There are three primary factors involved, not just one.  We must bear this in mind and make every effort to see that there is a sovereign state in Lebanon governed by the Lebanese.</P>
    <P>I must voice my party's considerable concern about the future of the Palestinians remaining in Lebanon.  There are indications that the Israelis may attempt to exterminate any of these who they suspect are members or supporters of the PLO.  This cannot be tolerated and we are requesting the Irish Government to have UN observers located without delay in west Beirut and other areas of conflict to ensure that such a policy of extermination cannot be pursued.  In addition, we are extremely worried that Red Cross workers and supplies are not reaching the homeless and the wounded in anything like sufficient quantities and we are <Col N="365" /> requesting that the Government urgently examine this matter.</P>
    <P>We appreciate that the Government have made £100,000 available to the Red Cross but we are very perturbed that the only route for medical supplies and relief to the affected areas is through Israel. We know that there are large supplies available in Cyprus and that the Red Cross are very anxious that they be shipped immediately to these areas. Because of the insecurity in the Beirut area this has not been done so far.  We are very perturbed about this and should like to see the matter rectified immediately. We urge the Government to play a strong role in this regard because obviously there is immense suffering in this general area.  We have read about starvation, lack of water supplies and the destruction of housing.</P>
    <P>We all know there is no easy answer to the Palestinian problem but surely the time has come to press for a lasting solution. The Taoiseach referred in his speech to the Venice Declaration of June 1980 and stated:</P>
    <P>The central elements of that declatation are, as Deputies will recall, recognition of the right of all States in the area, including Israel, to a secure and peaceful existence and recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to full self-determination.</P>
    <P>Those sentiments are very fine but I have yet to see any definite plan outlined which will provide that type of self-determination. It has not been defined in any form and we must have a definition of what is to happen to the Palestinian people and how they are to achieve self-determination. It is very important that this be spelled out.</P>
    <P>This lasting solution can only come about with the formation of an autonomous Palestinian State.  The Palestinians over the years have been driven out of Israel; they are not wanted in Egypt; they have been driven out of Jordan.  The Jordanians set about eradicating the PLO and in the subsequent purge hundreds of PLO members and Palestinians were killed.  Apparently the Palestinians were not wanted even by Syria, supposedly their closest ally.  Recently Syria's assistance <Col N="366" /> to the PLO in their struggle with the Israelis has been rather muted and it is suspected that they are not too anxious to aid them.  It all results in the Palestinians having no place to go if they are hunted out of Lebanon and some effort must be made to find them a homeland, a state of their own, and to give them the right to self-determination.</P>
    <P>Driving the Palestinians from Lebanon is not solving a problem for Israel; it is merely transferring it to another theatre of war.  We, together with our fellow members of the UN, must press much more strongly for the foundation of an autonomous State for the Palestinians. We must do this in the interests of justice and in a renewed effort to stop repeated carnage on a massive scale such as we have witnessed during the past 10 days. Unless there is a lasting solution the same thing will happen every couple of years, whether the Palestinians are in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan or other parts of the Arab world.  The West Bank and the Gaza Strip are two areas which, combined, could fulfil this ambition.  Of course, there will be opposition from Israel but life, whether it be for individals or races, is very much a thing of compromise.  We as a nation should be to the forefront in getting all other countries, including the United States, who exert such influence over Israel and who have such a major role to play, to press for such a solution and to have Palestinians and Israelites living as neighbours in peace.</P>
    <P>It is in the interests of peace in the Middle East and stability in the world that such tough straight talking be carried out immediately.  The combined effects of the Gulf War and the Israeli invasion of Lebanon have created a powder keg in the Middle East, with the fanatical Iranians fresh from their victory over Iraq strongly contemplating a policy of hot pursuit in their bid to overthrow President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and offering to provide military support, including troops, to the PLO in their battle against the Israelis.  When we consider the panic that has stricken Jordan and the Gulf States, including Saudi Arabia, at the emergence of Iran as unexpected victors in the Gulf War, we can visualise the <Col N="367" /> enormous dangers in that area.  The insatiable desire of the mullahs to create an Islamic empire is frightening but realistic when one considers the wealth, spoils and territorial gains involved.  We all assumed at the commencement of that war that the Iraqis who initiated it would emerge as victors and they received material support from the Gulf States and Jordan.  Now that they have been unexpectedly defeated the Iranians are quite likely to look for their pound of flesh.  States in that area who were previously opposed to the Iranians are now living in dread of a further advance by Iran, not just into Iraq but into the Gulf States and Jordan.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note how the Soviet Union switched their allegience during the course of the Gulf War to back Iran rather than Iraq.  They have moved from a position in which they were supplying the Iraqis with weapons &mdash; almost their total armament was supplied by the Societ Union &mdash; to a situation where they are indirectly supplying the Iranians with arms.  Such an unholy alliance bodes no good for the free world and the United States would do well to take stark notice of this fact.  It behoves the US to use its influence with Israel to adopt a more reasonable and humane attitude to the Palestinian problem.  If this involves compromise and a return of lands conquered then so be it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to indicate support for the Security Council Resolutions 508 and 509 which called for a cessation of hostilities and the unconditional withdrawal by Israel of all its forces to the internationally recognised boundaries of the Lebanon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UNIFIL peace-keeping force established in March 1978 by Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426 was set up on the promise of a withdrawal by Israeli forces for the purpose of confirming the withdrawal, restoring international peace and security and assisting the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of their effective authority in <Col N="368" /> the area.  Resolution 425 also called for strict respect for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognised boundaries.</P>
    <P>The role of the UNIFIL force was to police the buffer zone in southern Lebanon. It was never intended to deal with a full-scale invasion.  Despite numerous violations by both Israel and the PLO the force managed to maintain a fragile peace in Lebanon.</P>
    <P>The Israeli defence of their massive assault on Lebanon is that it was an act of self defence in face of continued shelling of towns in Northern Galilee by the PLO and various other acts of terrorism culminating in the attack on their ambassador in London.  It must be recognised that the PLO also carried out terrorist attacks against the civilian population in Israel over the past few years.</P>
    <P>The PLO have maintained that Israel has never seriously maintained the cease-fire and has actively encouraged the Christian Falangist forces to increase the territory under their control in southern Lebanon.  The conclusion we come to is that Lebanon is a tragic casualty of a failure by Israel and her Arab neighbours to come to any working settlement of the Palestinian question.  They are a stateless people who were forced to move from Jordan to Lebanon because of the tensions their presence created between Israel and Jordan.  There can be no doubt that the presence of the PLO in Lebanon since 1968 has contributed to the destabilisation process in that country.</P>
    <P>The latest attempts by Israel to secure its territory from attack is totally unjustifiable in that it will undoubtedly set back any hopes of a peaceful settlement of the Palestinian question for a long time to come and will be a major obstacle to achieving that settlement.  It will not contribute in the long run to the security of the Israel state.</P>
    <P>This invasion is no mere punitive expedition to check the PLO or contain them. The intent of the Israeli invasion seems to be the realisation of the objective of turning all of Lebanon into a vassal State cleared of Palestinians and owing allegiance only to Tel Aviv.  The political <Col N="369" /> map of the new vassal state of Lebanon is becoming apparent.  It will be bisected by the line running from the centre of Beirut through the Lebanese mountains along the Damascus highway.  Everything south of the line would belong to Israel or to whatever surrogate authority in the region might be designated.  North of Beirut would be the area controlled by the Falange.  To the north west would lie a smaller enclave presumably reserved for the Syrians.</P>
    <P>This new political division of Lebanon is obviously directed towards the total elimination of the PLO.  The question I should like to ask is whether the destruction of the PLO will remove the Palestinian threat to the Israeli state.  Will the grievances of the Palestinian people be settled by the destruction of the PLO?  I am not convinced that the answer to either of these questions can be given in the affirmative.  Peace in the region depends on justice for the Palestinians and security for the Israeli state.  Neither objectives can be met by the physical destruction of the PLO.  If the present PLO leadership is removed and their political base destroyed, a regrouping is to be anticipated in the future, possibly in the new region under the control of Syria.</P>
    <P>The achievement of a comprehensive peace settlement covering the entire Middle East region requires the inclusion of the PLO view in any negotiations.  The absence of an authentic political expression of the Palestinian case in any peace process leading to settlement would leave the future of Israeli security without an effective guarantee of a lasting peace.</P>
    <P>The Israeli invasion has increased the danger of escalation of the situation in the Middle East to the scale of a world-wide conflict, as other states in the region may retaliate against the Israeli action. Any such retaliation could involve the consequence that the two super powers who have vital interests in the region might become involved.  While there is no doubt that Israel has achieved its short-term objective of securing its northern towns against attack from the PLO, the invasion has done nothing to solve the basic problem confronting <Col N="370" /> Israel.  That problem still is, how does Israel live in peace with its neighbours? The Israeli state will never enjoy long-term security as long as the present military direction in policy is pursued.</P>
    <P>The neutralisation of the PLO as a military force will be counterbalanced by the increased hostility of the Arab world and other Middle East states towards Israel.  Already Iran has pledged to support the PLO.  They may be militarily defeated but the political problem of the Palestinian people will remain.  In the long-term interest of its own security, will Israel not have to eventually negotiate a political settlement which must concern itself with statehood for the Palestinian people?</P>
    <P>The Israeli action has seriously alarmed both the United States and the Soviet Union who fear the possible escalation of the conflict.  The joint statement on behalf of the EEC issued on 9 June vigorously condemned the latest invasion of Lebanon, pointing out that it constituted a flagrant violation of international law and the most basic humanitarian principles.  It also called for the immediate unconditional withdrawal of all Israeli forces and that UNIFIL forces be put in a position to accomplish their mission without hindrance.</P>
    <P>European Community member states, through the Council of Ministers, have sought to promote new basic principles for peace in the Middle East, firstly, the right to existence of all the states in the region, including Israel, and, secondly, justice for all peoples, including recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.  On these principles the Ten believe a peaceful settlement can be construed.</P>
    <P>The PLO will have to be associated with negotiations in any peace settlement. That is the view of the EEC and it is also my view.  However, in line with the two basic principles the PLO and the Palestinian people must recognise in the course of any negotiations the basic right of the State of Israel to exist.  Recognition by Israel of the PLO's right to be included in negotiations is fundamental to persuading the Palestinian people that they can peacefully co-exist with Israel in <Col N="371" /> future.  The mandate of the UNIFIL forces expires on Saturday.  It must now be open to doubt if this mandate can be renewed.  Israel has not indicated its support for a renewal of the mandate and has given no indication that it will abide by Resolutions 508 or 509.</P>
    <P>It must be admitted that the present situation has serious consequences for the future of the UN's peace-keeping role in areas of conflict.  The Israelis appear to be prepared to discard the United Nations in favour of a multinational force.  However, the future of the UN itself would be undermined if a country can flout the resolutions of the Security Council which have unanimous support and dictate the composition of peace-keeping forces in the territory which it has just invaded.</P>
    <P>Israel will have to accept the authority of the UN force, even if it does not respect it.  If necessary the force could be increased and its terms of reference expanded to include the right to take initiatives to prevent violations of a ceasefire.  I would urge our Ambassador at the UN to explore the extent of any support for such an initiative.</P>
    <P>The peace which has been established between Israel and Egypt was, among other reasons, secured because the then Prime Minister of Egypt, President Sadat, was willing to take political risks in the interests of peace.  The Israeli Government have enforced the terms of the peace settlement and have thereby spared their people from future military conflicts with Egypt.</P>
    <P>Now is the time for the Israeli Government after what is undoubtedly a military victory &mdash; though the political consequences of that victory are not as unambiguously clear as some would suggest at present &mdash; but now is their opportunity, in the wake of this victory to open negotiations for a political as opposed to a military solution to the problem of the Palestinian people.</P>
    <P>I would strongly urge the Israeli Government to take the initiative in the diplomatic and political spheres to set this process in motion.  They can best initiate this process by calling a lasting <Col N="372" /> ceasefire, stating their willingness to withdraw their troops and to accept the right of the UNIFIL force to maintain peace in Lebanon.  A timetable for talks should be drawn up, under the auspices of the United Nations, to attempt a final political settlement which will give security to Israel and acknowledge the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the scale of this war and the extent of the slaughter in a country with a population of a mere three million.  As verified by the Red Cross, there have been upwards of 14,000 casualties dead and injured and 600,000 people rendered homeless, in a war lasting in all something over ten days.  Our Ambassador at the United Nations, Mr. Noel Dorr, was right to point out the gross disproportion between the number of lives lost in attacks on Israel from the PLO in recent years and any terrorist groups there &mdash; attacks on Israeli citizens within Israel itself or Israeli citizens abroad &mdash; and the number of lives lost in this invasion.  Remember that the ostensible reason for the invasion was to prevent such terrorist attacks.  But there is &mdash; and our Ambassador, Mr. Noel Dorr, was right to point it out &mdash; the gross disproportion in lives lost under both headings.  He was right also to warn against the continued spiral of violence in the Middle East.  He was right to say that each new effort by either side to exact revenge and retribution for a previous attack gives the spiral of violence another upward twist and takes us further and further from any hope of any comprehensive peace settlement in the region.  The continued upward twist of the spiral of violence in the Middle East, it must be accepted, offers no hope to Israeli or Arab.  The potential for escalation into larger conflict inheres in any local war in the nuclear age but descent into the nuclear abyss can be particularly swift in any Middle East conflict.</P>
    <P>It is not our purpose here to suggest tentative global peace solutions for a conflict that has been proceeding for some years now and has defied all previous settlement proposals.  That is beyond the scope of this short discussion here.  However, <Col N="373" /> it must be our aim in these exchanges to point a way forward.  I maintain that the path forward lies through the United Nations taking steps along the lines I have suggested here.</P>
    <P>Our country's voice is a small one in international affairs.  However, my hope would be that that voice will continue to be heard and will be recognised as one of sanity pointing in the direction of the achievement of a durable peace in this area.  Though our country's voice may be a small one, though this conflict may be taking place a long distance from our shores, the fact that this war is taking place in that region, with the super powers in near attendance, has very grave implications for all countries, for the peace of the world, for countries large or small.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Three decades ago Palestine as a country was removed from the political map when her people were driven into exile by a terrorist campaign. One year later Israel was admitted to the United Nations on condition that the right of the Palestinian people to return to their home would be respected and adequate compensation paid for the loss of their land and property seized by the Zionists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 30 years later none of these conditions has been met or none of those rights conceded by the Israeli Government. Instead, Israel has relentlessly pursued the Palestinian people, hounding them from refugee camps in Jordan attacking them in refugee camps in the Lebanon in 1978 and 1980.  The latest invasion of Lebanon must be seen for what it is: a merciless and systematic attempt by the Israeli Government to wipe out the Palestinian people.  The Israeli Government have attempted to justify the present holocaust by claiming that it is a purification process aimed at mopping up Palestinian military resistance. However, the figures speak for themselves.  There are various estimates of civilian casulaties in the last week, ranging from 14,000 to 25,000 killed and wounded.  Another 600,000 people have been rendered homeless, while UNIFIL personnel have been denied the right to <Col N="374" /> offer emergency aid to the wounded and dispossessed.  According to Israeli sources their own casualty figures consist of 107 killed, 840 wounded and 18 missing or captured.  These figures reveal the Israeli operations in Lebanon for what they are: a genocidal attack on the Palestinian and Lebanese people.  Contary to the image projected by some elements in the media, the Palestine Liberation Organisation is not a terrorist organisation but the internationally recognised Government of the Palestinian people. They carry out all the functions of a government, including the running of schools and the provision of health and social welfare facilities.  It is these institutions which are now under attack.  How many children did the Israelis kill in the past week?  On the other hand, the Israelis have repeatedly violated and treated with contempt the efforts of the international community to achieve a just and honourable settlement in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>The record of the United Nations with regard to Israel renders eloquent testimony to the contempt of Israel for the United Nations and world standards of civilization.  In 1948 the Security Council of the United Nations called on Israel to allow Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and provide compensation to them.  In 1949 Israel was admitted to the United Nations on condition that it did so, but the Security Council Resolution was ignored.  In 1967, following the occupation of additional territories during the Six Day War by Israel, the Security Council again called on Israel to withdraw to their own boundaries and recognise the territorial integrity of their neighbours.  Again the Security Council was ignored by Israel.  In 1973 a further Resolution, No. 338, was passed by the Security Council, with joint sponsorship by the United States and the Soviet Union, only to receive similar treatment from the Israeli Government.  In 1974 the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution No. 3236 recognising the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, national independence and sovereignity.  In 1975 the United Nations General Assembly again <Col N="375" /> expressed its support for the rights of the Palestinian people when it denounced Zionism as a form of racism under Resolution No. 3379.  In March 1980 the United Nations Security Council again had to condemn the failure of the Israeli Government for not only ignoring United Nations mandates but for refusing co-operation with a Security Council Commission set up to implement United Nations policy.  In May 1980 the United Nations General Assembly actually had to pass a resolution condemning Israel as a non-peace-loving State.  That is a judgment amply and tragically vindicated in the past few days.</P>
    <P>Let no one talk of Israel's right to wage war in the Middle East or justify its shameful international record.  The time has come for our Government to unequivocally state our opposition to Israel's war aims.  Indeed, some of the objectives are as yet secret and can only be guessed at.  The Government must immediately take steps to exercise influence in both the United Nations Security Council and the EEC to isolate Israel diplomatically and economically.  The Government must also urge the United States to cease its massive support for Israel's military machine, currently estimated at 6½ million dollars a day.  It is clear that the current invasion of Lebanon can only take place under sufferance from the White House.</P>
    <P>A further measure the Government must consider actively, if Israel continues with her policy in the Lebanon, is the imposition of unilateral sanctions.  I call on the Government to make a declaration committing themselves to such a policy now.  Finally, the Government should commit themselves to supporting the expulsion of Israel from the United Nations if she does not abide by the Security Council resolutions calling for a withdrawal and agree to behave as a civilised member of the international community.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay a tribute to the work of UNIFIL, and the Irish contingent in particular, in the present situation. The UNIFIL troops need more than moral support.  The Irish Government <Col N="376" /> must actively pursue a policy at the UN of seeking stronger powers and more resources for the UNIFIL command. This can best be done by upgrading of the UNIFIL role in Lebanon from that of a peace-keeping force to a peace enforcement role.  Such a decision would prevent a repetition of the barbaric violation of Article 4 of the Geneva Covention by the Israeli military forces early this week when they refused to allow UNIFIL personnel to give medical treatment to civilian casualties.  The time for moral sanctions is over.  Israel today poses too great a threat to peace not only in the Middle East but throughout the world to be handled with kid gloves.</P>

      <P>Many people have been unhappy at the conduct of our country's foreign affairs in recent times.  We have seen in recent weeks our country attempting to take up the white man's burden, if we are to judge from some of the extravagant posturing that has been going on at the United Nations and in the EEC, something far out of proportion to our size and to our influence.  Certainly we have a voice in world affairs and we have a moral background to speak from, but some of the extravagant posturing that has been going on in the United Nations and in Brussels has no place at all in reality in the modern world.  There has been a tinkering with very sensitive, very vital areas of life.  We have seen the undermining of our Diplomatic Corps and our Foreign Affairs Department &mdash; people who are trained diplomats, who know well what they are saying and how to advise Governments what to do. Instead we have a cavalier, extravagant attitude taking place which is no help at all to us.  We have had an example of this in relation to the Falkland Islands.  We have considerable egg on our face as a result of our mistaken policy there.  It did not achieve anything whatsoever but built up a great deal of hostility to us in Great Britain and in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You must judge the reality of your policy in relation to the benefits you can derive from it for your people.  That is not the sole criterion but it is one of the criteria.  The Government's attitude in recent times has been lopsided.  We have <Col N="377" /> gone totally overboard and we have not interpreted our neutral and independent role in the way it should be.  We are talking about a very difficult situation in the Middle East.  It is a difficult, sensitive question.  We should remember when talking about it that there are three foreign armies there &mdash; the Israeli Army, the Syrian Army and the PLO.  As a result of this invasion the whole of Lebanon has been turned into a big battleground at the present time.  This has completely undermined the independence of the Lebanon as an independent state.</P>
    <P>Of course Lebanon has a right to exist and nobody denies that.  We must say, loudly and clearly, that Lebanon has the right to exist as an independent state. The UN and the EEC must support our drive as far as possible.  We must support the right of all states in every part of the world, including the state of Israel.  Some attacks have been made today by the Workers' Party spokesman.  I believe he is showing an imbalance in his attitude to it.</P>
    <P>The Palestinian people have been chucked around like shuttlecocks.  They are not shuttlecocks; they are people and they have the same rights as anybody else.  We must say that loudly and clearly as well.  Their treatment has been cruel. They have a right to survive and we must support that as well.  I am no Zionist and I am no supporter of Mr. Begin.  He is a right-wing conservative, even hawkish, politician.  I do not support him or his party and certain sections of that country. You cannot rewrite the history of that country &mdash; those people have been there for 400 years &mdash; nor can you rewrite the history of the last 35 years.  The Israeli people have survived in their state for the past 35 years and we must support their right to exist.  We must be fundamental in our attitude to the whole question and the right of the Israeli people to exist.  All parties must support that right and must say, loudly and clearly, that we support that right.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the Israeli policies because I am a socialist.  They have not been socialist in their attitudes, nor democratic in some ways.  But that does not in any way take from their right to exist <Col N="378" /> as a people, the same as we have a right to exist as Irish people.  You cannot gloss over that fact, which should come across loud and clear.  There are two different things here, the conduct of their internal policy and the conduct of their international policy.  I totally disagree with the latter.  However, the fundamental right of the Israeli people to exist as a people should be accented in this Parliament today.</P>
    <P>A number of Irish soldiers have been lost.  Mr. Haddad has been referred to as the big bad wolf.  There has been some killing done in that area, and I do not support him either.  He has nothing to offer, but he certainly has been used as a front man.  I read a report from a journalist in one of our newspapers that two of our soldiers were tortured, kidnapped and taken away.  I do not know what has happened to Private Joyce from the Aran Islands, or his whereabouts.  We hope he has not been killed; but, if he has, the people responsible should have the decency to return his body to this country and to his family in the Aran Islands.  It is a very savage thing to kidnap and abduct a soldier, a member of a peace-keeping army, doing his best to preserve peace and democracy in that part of the world.  I make an appeal from this Parliament to the people responsible to take heed of our words and send back his body if he has been killed.  It has caused great distress and misery to his people and to the country.</P>
    <P>I want our neutrality and independence interpreted as it should be, not having our Government on one side, as we have seen recently.  Let us return to taking advice and recommendations from people who are trained diplomats, our Diplomatic Corps and our Department of Foreign Affairs.  We have people there who have long experience in diplomacy and the conduct of international affairs. We can learn from them.  We must all be advised, I am against any attempt to undermine them.  This buccaneer, cavalier attitude we have seen recently has no place at all in Irish society.  It has done us a lot of harm and can do us a lot of harm in the future.  Let us attempt at all times to adopt a neutral, diplomatic and evenhanded <Col N="379" /> attitude to Lebanon and to the whole question of the Middle East.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to join with the previous speakers in condemning Israeli aggression in Lebanon and in calling on Israel to withdraw its forces completely from Lebanon, so that, as the Taoiseach said in his statement, the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon can be preserved.  Reference has already been made to the casualty figures in the last ten days.  They have shown the full horror of what has taken place.  Many thousands of civilians have been killed and many more seriously injured.  Nothing can justify such a terrible toll in the short space of time involved.  It cannot and should not be classed as a military victory or act.  It is nothing more than an act of genocide.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the right of the state of Israel to exist and the implication could be that, in order for them to do so, such genocidal acts as have taken place over the last two weeks are justified.  I hope and trust that that was not the implication which the speaker intended.  When was the Israeli state under threat?  Israel has had for many years overwhelming military superiority in that part of the Middle East and their existence is not in question.  The Israeli Government have condemned again and again what they call international terrorism, yet can the Israeli action of aggression against a sovereign state be described as anything other than terrorism on a mass scale?  Surely its only result will be to generate counter-terrorism and a further spiral of violence on an international level?  It is ironic that the Israelis, who themselves have suffered a genocidal war, should now be spearheading what is a genocidal war against the Palestinian people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that UNIFIL faced an impossible task with the overwhelming superior force of the Israelis.  However, it would be wrong to suggest that UNIFIL no longer has a role to play in the Lebanon. I believe it has a very important place there and now, more than ever before, <Col N="380" /> the role of UNIFIL should be importantly directed to that of observer, particularly in Beirut.  It should ensure that the further extermination, which is clearly the intention of the Israeli Government, does not continue.  I also reiterate previous statements that the only long-term solution to the problems in the Middle East is the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with the PLO playing a full part representing the Palestinian people in the negotiations which must take place to create that state.  Any part that the Irish Government can play in bringing about those negotiations must be welcomed and supported by all sections of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in his opening statement in this debate, has dealt with the immediate situation arising from the invasion of Lebanon by Israeli forces, particularly as regards the position of UNIFIL.  In my remarks, I propose to deal with some of the more general issues arising from the Israeli action.  The invasion of Lebanon by Israel is but the latest in a series of wars that have taken place in the Middle East since the state of Israel was established.  One might have hoped that after the bloody conflicts of November 1956, June 1967, October 1973 and again in Lebanon in 1978, lessons had been learned.  But no.  It seems that that area of the world is destined to be plagued by an unending war with only occasional intervals of peace &mdash; if the no peace, no war situation that exists in these intervals can be described as peace.</P>
      <P>It is no secret to say that this present conflict has been imminent for some time.  It has been clear for several months that Israel has been planning the present invasion and was dissuaded from launching it up to last week only by pressure from the United States and also from the European Community.  With our partners in the Ten we have urged Israel not to inflame the situation in the Middle East even further by attacking Lebanon and thus making a peaceful settlement of the problem even less likely.  We very much regret that Israel has not accepted this view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Israel has justified its invasion by <Col N="381" /> reference to the terrorist attacks which have been made on Israeli citizens, most recently the murderous attack on the Israeli Ambassador to the UK and Ireland, Mr. Shlomo Argov.  We condemn without any reservation such attacks.  And, in particular, I condemn the attack on Ambassador Argov, whom I had met for the first time since I took up this office just a week before he was shot.  I have expressed my sympathy and that of the Government to the Foreign Minister of Israel and to Mrs. Argov.</P>
    <P>But, having said this, I would emphasise that we see no justification for the massive retaliation which Israel has inflicted on Lebanon.  Israeli reaction has been out of all proportion to the injuries which have been inflicted on her.  We are reading of estimates of up to 10,000 people killed in the last week as a result of the Israeli military action, not to speak of the many other injured and perhaps as many as a quarter of a million people left homeless, the vast majority of these people innocent civilians.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that until the Israeli invasion began a cease-fire was in operation which had been agreed between Israel and the Palestinians as a result of US and UN mediation efforts in July 1981 and in which the commander of UNIFIL, General Callaghan, played an important part.  This cease-fire had been effective.  No significant incidents occurred across the Israel-Lebanon border in that period.  No Israeli civilians had been killed on the northern front since July.  Admittedly, there has been some dispute about the interpretation of the agreement, with Israel claiming that it extended to all activities against her, while the Palestinians considered that it applied only in relation to the Israel/Lebanon border.</P>
    <P>However, even taking this into account, the number of incidents that have occurred, which include some acts of terrorism in the occupied West Bank of Jordan over which the Palestinians in Lebanon may have had little control, cannot be regarded as justification for the Israeli action.  In addition, there is good reason to believe that the acts of terrorism against Israeli citizens which have <Col N="382" /> occurred outside Israel were committed by extremists who have no connection with, and indeed are hostile to, the policy of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. In the case of the attempted assassination of the Israeli Ambassador, it should be noted that the PLO disclaimed responsibility for this attack and there are indications now that it was the work of a splinter group.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has already referred to the meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Community on 9 June and to the statement which was issued following that meeting condemning the Israeli invasion and calling for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Lebanon, and to the demarche which has been made to Israel by the Belgian Presidency on behalf of the Community.  But condemnation is not sufficient.  These latest actions simply reinforce the point that Irish Governments have been making consistently over the last number of years.  This is that there can never be any solution to the Middle East conflict by military means.  Israel, through its highly trained and immensely powerful armed forces, may have achieved another military victory in Lebanon.  But, surely it is the lesson of all its past military victories that these do not secure the peace which it so desires.  The odds &mdash; numerical, demographic and others &mdash; are stacked highly against the success of reliance on military might in the longer run.  Perhaps, as the Israeli Government say, the PLO has been smashed.  But who can doubt but that the resentment, the hatred and the suffering resulting from the present conflict will within a matter of a year or two result in a revitalised PLO &mdash; and perhaps a PLO more committed to military force than its present leaders.</P>
    <P>Military force will not provide a solution to the Middle East conflict.  The latest tragedy must provide the impetus for a renewal of efforts to bring about a comprehensive peaceful settlement of the Middle East problem by negotiations involving all the parties.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government believe that such a settlement must be based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, applied in all their parts, and also on the <Col N="383" /> principles set out in the Venice Declaration of the European Community of June 1980, which have already been referred to by the Taoiseach.  It is worth recording again these principles They are:</P>
    <P>(1)  the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force;</P>
    <P>(2)  the need for Israel to end the territorial occupation which it has maintained since the conflict of 1967;</P>
    <P>(3)  respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of every state in the area, including Israel, and their right to live in peace within secure and recognised boundaries;</P>
    <P>(4)  recognition that in the establishment of a just and lasting peace account must be taken of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government's policy is firmly based on these principles.  While having our doubts about the prospects of success for the autonomy talks under the Camp David Accords which were negotiated between Israel, Egypt and the United States, we have welcomed the fact that a peace treaty has been signed between Israel and Egypt and that Israel has withdrawn from all Egyptian territory.</P>
    <P>But it is evident from the most recent conflict that any solution which does not give full weight to the position of the Palestinian people has little prospect of success.  A solution to the problem of the Palestinian people must be at the heart of any comprehensive settlement.  Many of these people, who were displaced from their homes during the period when the state of Israel was being established and in conflicts since then, have now lived for more than 30 years in refugee camps with all that entails.  The legacy is one of bitterness and hatred towards those whom they see as responsible for their condition. A comprehensive settlement must, therefore, include the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people.  In the Irish Government's view this right includes that to an independent state, if the Palestinian people wish it, and all the evidence is that they do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> In negotiations for such a comprehensive settlement all parties must participate, and this includes the Palestinians. While there is no way at present of accurately ascertaining from the Palestinian people who should represent them in such negotiations, it is clear from all the evidence in the area that the Palestine Liberation Organisation has substantial support both in the Palestinian diaspora and among Palestinians in the occupied territory of the West Bank and the Gaza strip.  In elections held for important administrative positions in 1976 those elected expressed support for the PLO. The PLO is also accepted by the Arab states as the sole legitimate spokesman of the Palestinians.</P>
    <P>We cannot yet say that the PLO is the sole representative of the Palestinian people as we have frequently been pressed to do.  But we can say, and we do accept, that the PLO is representative of the views of a large proportion of the Palestinian people.  Accordingly, we recognise the role of the PLO in representing the Palestinian people, and we consider that the PLO must participate in the negotiations for an overall settlement of the Middle East conflict.</P>
    <P>The situation in the Middle East is critical.  Urgent action is required to lower tension in the area.  We welcome the fact that a cease-fire has been agreed between Syria and Israel and we urgently hope that this will be extended to a cease fire between Israel and the PLO.  Such a cease-fire must be complete and apply equally to areas in the Lebanon now under Israeli control.  But the present cease-fire cannot endure as long as Israel remains in occupation of part of Lebanon. Pressure must be brought to bear on Israel to withdraw its forces immediately from Lebanese territory and we urge those with most influence on Israel, and particularly the Government of the United States, to exercise its influence to bring about a withdrawal.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has already dealt with the situation of UNIFIL.  I would, however, take this opportunity to say that Ireland has consistently supported the development of UN peacekeeping as a means by which the international community can help maintain peace and security.  Participation by Ireland in UNIFIL has been a concrete expression of this support.</P>
      <P>The question whether in view of the recent invasion of Lebanon by Israel there is any longer a role for a peace-keeping force whose authority has been so flouted is one which is under continuous discussion between Ireland and the other troop contributing countries and the Secretary General of the United Nations.  The Security Council, of which Ireland is a member, has to decide before 19 June whether to renew the mandate of UNIFIL and on what terms.  Ireland supports the view that UNIFIL should remain in Lebanon as long as it has a peacekeeping role to play.  In the present very difficult and uncertain climate in Lebanon it is not yet possible to state whether and for how long the mandate of UNIFIL will be renewed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be clear at this stage that, if the views that have been expressed so far in this House are held outside the borders of this country, Israel has now gone too far and has finally forfeited all the goodwill which the western world has had towards that country &mdash; inspired, I think, by feelings of guilt for the centuries of persecution which the Jewish people have had to endure in the western world and culminating in the Nazi atrocities from 1939 to 1945.  That goodwill, however inspired, whether out of a sense of recognition of injustice or out of a feeling of guilt, was real.  It was so strong that it tolerated the dispossession by the Israelis of the Palestinians from their homeland, a dispossession that was carried out ruthlessly and mercilessly and well nigh totally.  It also was carried out with atrocities.  We have only to think of the awful atrocity committed in Deir Yassin by the Irgun.  Perhaps it is no harm, in order to give us a proper perspective on the present actions of Israel, to recall that one of the leaders of that <Col N="386" /> ruthless terrorist organisation was the present Prime Minister of Israel.  Many authorities would blame him with responsibility for that awful massacre.  The fund of goodwill, whether inspired by guilt or otherwise, was such that the world tolerated the removal of the Palestinians from their homeland.  It is no harm to recall why these people are now dispossessed, why we now have refugees, why they were removed from their homeland and kicked out.</P>
      <P>The world tolerated that at the time and has tended to look the other way ever since at the actions of Israel.  That sympathy which existed carried with it this tolerance for a number of decades past.  But, as I say, Israel has now gone too far.  The international community, no more than a national community, can only continue to exist if it lives by the rule of law.  Clearly, Israel is not prepared to abide by the rules of law.  Deputy De Rossa recited here the countless UN resolutions that have been passed in the past two or three decades all of which have been contemptuously ignored by Israel.</P>
      <P>If it suited Israel to break the international rule of law to achieve its ends, it did so without compunction.  Its territorial aggression against its neighbours, without warning, ruthlessly and totally, is well documented as fact in the world's history.  We have seen Israel's ignoring of the international rule of law, as represented by the presence of troops in Lebanon on behalf of the UN, and we have seen that the attitude to those troops has not been merely one of contempt but of covert aggression through Major Haddad. We in this country especially have reason to regret that attitude because compatriots of ours have been murdered as a consequence.</P>
      <P>Might I refer to a report in one of this morning's newspapers in which an &ldquo;investigative&rdquo; reporter from the US alleges that the two Irish troops were mutilated prior to being killed.  I understand from our Defence Forces that the bodies of the two men were not mutilated and I wish to put that on the record in the hope that it will ease the distress of the relatives concerned on seeing that fallacious reporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> It is clear that moral sanctions and appeals to observe international law have fallen on deaf ears so far as Israel is concerned.  There is nothing to suggest that such appeals will be listened to in the future.  I think they will be treated with the cynicism with which they have been treated in the past, the type of cynicism that Israel in its propaganda has shown in a release from its embassy in London and in the course of which it says that Israel's airforce was instructed to carry out air raids against Palestinian military targets in Lebanon.  It goes on to say &mdash; and the cynical dishonesty of this is horrifying &mdash; that in those air raids civilians were apparently killed.</P>
    <P>That is the type of thinking that informs Israel's attitude to the rest of the world and to the UN.  It is clear that the only principle which is honoured or observed or heeded by Israel is the principle that might is right.  Israel has flouted international law time and again and all protests at its behaviour have been ignored.  Might is right when the right involved is Israel.  What we must do is to consider how Israel can be taught that might is not right and, with a national body just as with an individual criminal within society, sanctions may have to be considered.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions during this debate that there should be further UN approaches towards the problem, but I consider that suggestion to be futile having regard to the lack of success in the past through the UN forum.  Israel is and always has been a client state of the US. It appears that the US, which largely holds Israel's purse strings, can exert the type of pressure that the whole world wants put on Israel, that is, that Israel live according to the rules of international law.</P>
    <P>So far as we can, we should use our influence with the US so that that country in turn can exert pressure on Israel to live in peace with its neighbours and to recognise that the Palestinians, who have been dispossessed of their homeland, must be given a home once again.  Again, we must use our voice within the EEC to ensure that that powerful voice will be used in the same direction.  It is only when Israel <Col N="388" /> is shown by its master, the US, and by its trading partners in the EEC that no longer is the world prepared to tolerate the type of aggression in which Israel has indulged in the last ten days, that peace can come to the Middle East.</P>

      <P>There is a particularly dangerous overtone running through the contributions of two speakers in this debate so far.  This is an overtone of a type that I have not heard before here since becoming a Member of the House in 1969, an overtone which has never been pronounced in this House except perhaps by the odd abberation in the forties on the part of some individual members, abberations which the people concerned have since retracted and regretted.  I refer to the overtone that has been articulated particularly by Deputy De Rossa, that is, the denial of the right of the people of Israel to self-determination, to have a State and a homeland which they can call their own and in which they can live in peace with their neighbours. I am appalled that Deputy De Rossa should come here and give us what must be The Workers' Party's foreign policy. This seems to be their foreign policy, too, in relation to Poland, their identical view of the Soviet Union in relation to the invasion of Poland.</P>

      <P>The analogy is entirely appropriate.  I do not accept that kind of foreign policy, whether it be in relation to Poland or to Israel or to the anti-Jewish feeling to which expression has been given today.  As Irish people, we must be very clear in regard to our reaction to events in that tragic part of the world.  That is why I am disgusted and appalled that such overtones should emanate within this House, within the Parliament of the Republic of Ireland.  I have something to say, too, in this regard to Deputy Cooney.  I do not believe, that, to quote his words, Israel has finally forfeited whatever it is the Deputy considers <Col N="389" /> it to have forfeited.  What have they forfeited?</P>
      <P>I reject the foreign policy of the Prime Minister of Israel, a man whom I have met in my capacity as an Irish delegate to the Council of Europe.  I have told the Israeli Foreign Minister that I reject his foreign policy and I have let my views be known also to my Labour Party counterparts in Israel whom I have met.  I have told the leader of that party that I have been very unhappy with the foreign policy as well as with the internal policy they have pursued.  However, I never reached the stage of saying: &ldquo;You have finally forfeited,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I will deny you the right of existence&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I would have thought that the Deputy would not have had any association with the sentiments of Deputy De Rossa when he spoke particularly when the word &ldquo;sanction&rdquo; was used on an almost parallel basis.  Let us get to the nub of the problem.  It is appropriate that the spokespersons from the political parties, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Deputy Kemmy &mdash; I support his balanced contribution &mdash; should condemn the invasion of Lebanon by Israeli forces.  It is appropriate also that we should utterly condemn the violations of international laws which have occurred, and that we should support the UN resolutions and the resolutions adopted by the Ministers of the Community.  It is also necessary that we should condemn the murder committed by Israeli troops who moved in and indiscriminately slaughtered civilians in Lebanon.  I oppose that and yet we must maintain a sense of perspective.  I am as opposed to that as I was opposed to the terrorism of the PLO and the grievous mistakes made on the part of the Israeli Government and the Prime Minister of that country.  I am equally appalled, as were successive leaders of the Labour Party&mdash;Deputies Cluskey and O'Leary&mdash;<Col N="390" /> at the terrorism being practised by the PLO in pursuit of their political aims, their legitimate right to self-determination and the establishment of their own homeland and State within the confines of that area.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach made a balanced and effective contribution and our stance at the UN by our Ambassador, Noel Dorr, has been appropriate, balanced and effective in that regard.  I support the statement of the Taoiseach and that of the Fine Gael spokesman, Deputy Deasy whose statement was strong, well-briefed and relatively balanced.  I may not go the whole distance with his views.  I support the views expressed by my party colleague and leader, Deputy O'Leary. That has been the stance of the Labour Party for a long time.  Our party has an affinity with a political party in Israel through the international socialist movement, a party which understands our position. In saying that I will not accept incipient racialism which came from one section of the House in terms of the statement.  That should be pondered on by one Deputy and I do not include Deputy Cooney in that context.  I include Deputy De Rossa. I regretted some of the overtones in Deputy Cooney's comments but that has been put right by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Israeli Government and the political parties in that country to draw back from the holocaust which could occur, an interaction of holocausts between the people of that area involving not merely Irish troops.  I admire and support the actions of those troops in trying to maintain peace there, more as a peace-keeping force than a military unit.  It is appropriate that Members should make that appeal to the Government of Israel, the Defence Minister of that country who has a clear responsibility in this regard, to the Foreign Minister and our colleagues in opposition in that country.  They should draw back, have a ceasefire, withdraw their troops and negotiate a settlement as must be done. That can be done with great goodwill and the assistance of the Irish Government whose standing in that area is high.  The Government's role and objectivity as enunciated by the Taoiseach with considerable <Col N="391" /> force today can be a help in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In concluding for the Labour Party I should like to deal with the point of issue that has brought us all into the House this afternoon, the real prospect that arising out of this horrendous conflict in the Middle East there could be, as the world has too readily experienced since 1946, an overspill effect of the war which will directly affect the interests of the people we all represent. There is no disagreement about that.  That is the common point of concern and that is why the Government rightly responded to the request for a debate so that international opinion could be made aware of our concern as public representatives about the potential outcome of the conflict on the one hand and our condemnation of the human slaughter and destruction that is going on also.  As a country we have always held a consistent view that the only safeguard the world can have &mdash; it is a view that small nations by definition have always espoused &mdash; is that if we replace the rule of international agencies no matter how deficient, bureaucratic or weak it is from time to time we are reversing back to the principle of might is right and large powerful groups.  The history of the world, and that of small nations, is a lesson of peril to all.  What any Government that has the honour of holding office here must at all times secure and support is the process of international law and respect for international law.  To that extent there is unanimity in the various parties starting with some of the fine speeches that were made when we first entered the UN followed by the distinguished career of the Minister for External Affairs, Frank Aiken, during his time.  There is a tradition and we are all <Col N="394" /> agreed on it.  Our concern must be to strengthen the international process.</P>
      <P>Since the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands, and the consequent reinvasion of those islands by the United Kingdom, we have seen an extraordinary decline in respect for international law on one side of the world and, simultaneously, within a portion of the Middle East, we saw an invasion by Israel of a country that had already been invaded and occupied by Syrian forces and the PLO some ten days ago.  Perhaps we have ignored, somewhat at our peril, a war that has been going on for approximately two years between Iran and Iraq.  As a people we stand to lose in every sense of the word if we do not use our sovereign independence in the halls of the United Nations and the Ten with the professional diplomats to whom Deputy Kemmy referred.  We stand to lose if we do not use all that influence and expertise and all of that standing to try to reduce the tensions that have been generated by this conflict.  We are not going to try to solve the Middle East and Arab-Israeli conflicts in a three-hour debate in this Chamber a long way from the conflicts.  None of us has any pretensions to try to do so.  However, different parties have different views on it.  Let me state from the Labour Party's policy document the basic principles which we think should govern any settlement.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party believe that the following are the basic principles which must be respected if there is to be a peaceful solution in the Middle East: (1) Israel must have the right to exist freely and in peace within secure and internationally accepted borders; (2) the Palestinian people must be accorded the right of self-determination including the right to establish an independent and secure state and the right of the refugees to return there; (3) Israel must desist from the provocative and illegal policy of placing settlements in occupied areas; (4) the peace process should be placed within the ambit of the UN which can provide the most appropriate forum for dialogue and negotiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me turn in a dispassionate and no way bitter response to the point <Col N="395" /> expressed very clearly and well researched by Deputy De Rossa. Depending on the point in history from which you choose to start you can arrive at a totally different conclusion.  If you start just over 30 years ago with the dispossession of the Palestinian people, which is a fact of history, and proceed to construct a point of view from there which, with all due respect to The Workers Party, is the line that has been taken consistently by every Euro-Communist party and by the more moderate section of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union, naturally you arrive at the conclusion that the Soviet Union arrived at, which is the expulsion of the embassy from Moscow, the breaking off of diplomatic relations and the logical extension of that.  I hope that the House will not consider that a bitter disagreement.  It is an intellectual difference of opinion.  In this country, which frequently calls itself Christian and often regards itself as Catholic, we have, as Christians in the intellectual sense, an extraordinary responsibility for the holocausts not just of the Second World War but of the intellectual framework which Christianity consciously and logically established over a period of 400 to 500 years which not only allowed such a horrible action of genocide to happen but gave it intellectual and emotional justification.  We have benefited in this country from opening the doors to refugees who were driven out of Czarist Russia, refugees because they were &mdash; as our people once were &mdash; of a particular race and religion.  I regret to inform the House that that kind of prejudice and harassment still continues today in a country for which I have great admiration in many of its achievements, the Soviet Union.  However, it is to be regretted that, perhaps with the same blind eye to history that, unfortunately, Deputy De Rossa's party have indicated, they in the Soviet Union continue the same degree of harassment and persecution of the Jewish people with even more thoroughness than their Czarist predecessors.  In particular western Europe can never absolve itself of the responsibility for what happened over the <Col N="396" /> last 40 to 50 years and we can never get to the stage of saying &mdash; perhaps inadvertently and I will give Deputy Cooney the benefit of the doubt &mdash; that somehow or other the State of Israel has forfeited our tolerance.  What kind of importance are we giving to ourselves to say to anybody that you as a human being or a race have now forfeited your right to exist?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that the Deputy has clarified it because I sat here and listened and said to myself that that could be the interpretation.  I was surprised, and I am delighted that it has been changed.</P>
      <P>There are major obstacles to a solution in the Middle East, let there be no doubt about that.  If we do not positively and constructively try to resolve them they will cause great human hardship in that unfortunate part of the world and will also &mdash; because we should in any foreign policy recognise our own self-interest &mdash; cause us severe damage of every kind. The aftermath of the 1973 economic war is something that we are still living with and nobody in this House should be unaware of just how important this conflict is to the economic survival of all of the people on this island.  Therefore, we are not talking about a far off place.  We are talking about something which is integral to the survival and prosperity of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We turn to the Palestinians.  The Irish Government, and Fianna Fáil in particular, have played footsie with the Arab world, footsie which became a bit of a tango after the price of oil and the newfound wealth of the Arab world became a great attraction to businessmen in this <Col N="397" /> country.  The PLO in their covenant have an article which has as its declared objective the elimination of the State of Israel and they have consistently refused to modify it.  Yasser Arafat in private consultations, now that the PLO are trying to take on a respectable face, has said that when they get to the bargaining table they will somehow withdraw that article, but not before that time.  We cannot in any way support that and the Irish Government should certainly press for the removal of such a section in the PLO covenant.  To that extent I welcome the carefully balanced position adopted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the formula the Government have accepted whereby they choose to recognise the role of the PLO without giving them the kind of status they want.</P>
    <P>I have no love for the administration which runs this country at present but that does not mean I do not recognise the right of Ireland to exist or do not support fully the aspirations of Ireland.  Certainly I have no great love for the similarly conservative régime in Israel, but let us not confuse the occupancy of the office of Government with the nature of the State itself.</P>
    <P>There has been some suggestion that Israel is an imperialist genocidal country which wants to create an enormous Israeli empire based on the charter received in the Old Testament.  I would draw the attention of the House to an event which was shown on television screens not very long ago when Israeli troops forcibly removed fundamentalist Zionist settlers who refused to get out of that part of the Sinai Peninsula which Israel had agreed to cede back to Egypt, together with their oil fields.  As a result of the Camp David agreement Israel has ceded more territory than many of her own people would consider militarily wise.  Deputy Cooney referred to the financial dependency of Israel and the oil fields would certainly have been a major component of economic independence.</P>
    <P>If we want evidence to refute the claim that Israel is somehow or other an imperialist power with ambitions of territorial expansion, let us look at what has happened in relation to the accord between <Col N="398" /> Cairo and Tel Aviv.  Israel achieved such an accord with a country with whom it had on several occasions gone to war. Whatever about the rhetoric and propaganda of the PLO, the people who did the real fighting were the Egyptians, who nearly won the last war.  The major fighting was not done by the Syrians and certainly not by the PLO.  In spite of the military threat from Egypt, Israel has moved back and ceded much territory in the belief that it had now achieved a working accord with the people and the rulers of Egypt.  The ability of former enemies to live and work together is nowhere more evident than in the now Egyptian-owned Sinai Peninsula.</P>
    <P>I thank the Government for making time available for this debate and I urge them to continue to support fully respect for international law and to pursue a balanced approach to the Middle East.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right that we should recall the persecution of the Jews over the centuries, culminating in the events of the last war, a persecution and an act of genocide which has no parallel in Arab countries, where anti-Semitism in the form in which it existed in Europe did not exist.  The terrible irony is that a country founded to provide a home for refugees from this genocide should itself be so insensitive to the claim by right to exist on the part of the Palestinians and should themselves have been willing to engage, as has been mentioned in this House, in massacres of Palestinians in the past and be willing now to engage in aggression and in activities which are beginning to appear themselves to verge on genocide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must recognise the reasons for the Israeli attitude, the siege mentality of a people who have established a Jewish state in the midst of Arab lands.  They have the right to protect themselves against attack, although the point has been made that no attack involving fatalities has occurred on them from PLO forces in the Lebanon since last July.  The right of self-defence, the right to protect one's own existence, the right to security do not permit disproportionate actions and the present Israeli actions are grossly <Col N="399" /> out of balance with any action they are designed to redress.  What is now going on is sickening and intolerable.  It is not a limited action to protect Israeli territory from occasional Palestinian attacks from Palestinian bases.  It has gone far beyond the stated objectives of the Israeli leaders. Perhaps I should say &ldquo;mis-stated&rdquo; objectives because one must wonder whether the statement of objectives originally made was not deliberately designed to deceive.</P>
    <P>It is increasingly clear that the Israelis are seeking not just the destruction of the PLO in the Lebanon but the subduing of the Palestinians in Lebanon and the killing of thousands of Palestinians.  What is happening is increasingly being described by observers on the spot as genocide and it is increasingly difficult to resist this description.  Genocide by a people who themselves have been the object of the most brutal and total act of genocide in history is an appalling irony.</P>
    <P>In one of the English Sunday newspapers, <i>The Observer</i>, there was an article by John le Carré which struck me very much because it echoed thoughts which had come into my mind in the preceding days.  He stated:</P>
    <P>The attack was a monstrosity, launched on speciously assembled grounds, against a people who on the Israelis' own admission constitute no serious military threat.  It is as if we British had lost our temper with the IRA and decided to punish the entire Irish people once and for all &mdash; convincing ourselves at the same time that when we had done so, we would hear no more of their troubles.</P>
    <P>Too many Israelis, in their claustrophobia, have persuaded themselves that every Palestinian man and woman and child is by definition a military target, and that Israel will not be safe until the pack of them are swept away. It is the most savage irony that Begin and his generals cannot see how close they are to inflicting upon another people the disgraceful criteria once inflicted upon themselves.  It is worse still that they have so far taken the Americans with them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> Responsibility for these events is indeed widely dispersed.  Going back in history, one can see the seeds of it in European anti-Semitism which persisted so long that within our own Church &mdash; the Church to which most of us here belong &mdash; the words &ldquo;perfidious Jews&rdquo; were used every Easter until about 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>Coming forward in history, after 1967 the efforts made to persuade Israel through the United States, which has great influence with it, to negotiate a solution from strength were quite inadequate. The countries of Europe, including ourselves, failed to put on the pressure then when it might have had some effect.  The US in their policies have been influenced by domestic considerations into failing to persuade Israel where its best interests lie.  The United States may also have been influenced, as other western countries were until the mid-seventies but not since, that western interests were linked to Israel and, what is different again, linked to supporting Israeli intransigence against Israel's long-term interest.</P>
    <P>It is particularly disturbing that there was such connivance by silence at Israeli acquisition of a nuclear capacity.  This appears to have been done &mdash; I have made such inquiries as I could on this directly with statesmen in some of the countries concerned &mdash; on the basis that Israel was part of the west.  There was a total failure to appreciate that such connivance would lead to a proliferation of nuclear weapons, as is being attempted in Iraq and Pakistan, and that that proliferation would put world peace at risk.</P>
    <P>It is now clear that the failure of western diplomacy has created a danger to world peace that cannot easily be controlled. It may be that at this moment peace outside the Middle East is not immediately threatened.  Other Arab countries, perhaps fearful of the Iranian threat, are slow to take any action.  Syria seems to be disengaging and the USSR appear to be holding back, all for their own reasons.  In so far as this means that world peace may be maintained despite these appalling events, we must be selfishly grateful.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="401" /> However, any relief on our own account must be matched by a commitment to all possible action to help those who are suffering, hundreds of thousands of innocent suffers by any standards. This action must include insistence, backed by all the powers including the US, on immediate access to the refugees in Tyre and Sidon and other parts of Southern Lebanon with facilities to succour them, and access to Beirut or anywhere else where fighting is continuing to ensure the application of the Geneva Convention, which cannot be ensured at present because there is no means of supervising it.  Action required must also include insistence by countries who supply arms to Israel that arms are used for defence purposes only and that failure to adhere to these conditions must entail cessation of arms supply to that country unless and until it evacuates conquered territory and provides adequate assurances that it will never again launch on a war of aggression or react to attacks on its territory by measures so disproportionate as to represent any kind of aggression.</P>
    <P>In this situation, as in others where aggression is concerned, neutrality cannot, as Deputy De Rossa said &mdash; somewhat selectively in this case in view of what was said in another case of aggression recently &mdash; inhibit us from initiating or joining in sanctions should they be likely to be effective in advancing peace. I have grave doubts about the efficacy of sanctions.  They had in some cases a demonstration effect.  In certain circumstances they could have more than that. Where they can control aggression and advance peace it is the duty of a neutral country concerned with peace to join in them.  If that is the case in this instance &mdash; it is not clear that it is &mdash; neutrality would be as irrelevant as it should be in any other case.  I hope Deputy De Rossa's remarks will make it clear how hollow was the talk of neutrality in another instance in this House a few weeks ago.</P>
    <P>The message should go from this House that Israel's right to exist and be secure is not challenged and will not be challenged by this or any other people who recall the genocide of the forties. <Col N="402" /> This right does not give Israel the right to bully, attack or destroy its neighbours or to react, other than with due proportion, to attack upon it.  We must join with others in using all available pressures to secure an end to the appalling bloodshed in Lebanon.</P>
    <P>As to the UNIFIL force, when it was established I expressed some doubts about the wisdom of establishing and maintaining a force without a clear mandate. I sought to have that mandate clarified but I never succeeded in doing so. In the present circumstances, with the mandate due to be renewed on 19 June and uncertainty as to whether there may be a useful role for the force to fulfil, it cannot now be clear what that role will be in the weeks and months ahead.  I would be disposed to agree to a renewal of that mandate subject to the matter of how the force is to be used in a new situation being brought before the House the moment when a decision on that matter comes to be taken.</P>

      <P>I am gratified at the manner in which Deputies participating have availed of the opportunity of this debate to give full expression to their views on the tragic situation obtaining in Lebanon.  The debate has been very worthwhile.  The Government are very glad to have this wide spectrum of views. The views expressed ranged very comprehensively over the situation and they covered practically every aspect of it.  It is useful, helpful and beneficial for the Government to have the benefit of these different views.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly there has been difference of emphasis during the debate, but it is true that there has been general unanimity on the central question, which is condemnation of the Israeli invasion, condemnation of the disproportionate character of the Israeli response to the situation and condemnation of the enormous loss of life and suffering.  The view is widely held in the House that there should be an Israeli withdrawal up to the internationally recognised boundaries of Lebanon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not necessary for me by way of reply to deal with the arguments of substance put forward and the various positions <Col N="403" /> and attitudes elaborated on by different Deputies.  I shall avail of my time to deal with some facts which have arisen about which some questions were asked during the debate.  I will take them as they come because they were mentioned by different Deputies.  Deputy Quinn referred to a very important matter and that is the Palestinian Covenant and the fact that that covenant contains the determination to eliminate the State of Israel. Everyone recognises that that is a real problem and is recognised as such in the counsels of the Ten.  We avail of every opportunity that presents itself to draw attention to the need to deal with that stumbling block.  A number of Deputies spoke about the irony of the present situation, and it is ironic that at present it is the destruction of the Palestinian people and not the State of Israel that is in question.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that in a recent interview I had with the American Ambassador on the situation in the Lebanon, I pressed among other things, that the United States should use its very considerable influence to endeavour to secure an immediate withdrawal of the Israeli forces.  Deputy FitzGerald mentioned the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Apart from any other chilling and agonising aspect of this whole matter, we must always keep it in the back of our minds that local outbreaks of hostilities of this sort underline the urgent need there is for something very specific to be done to prevent a further proliferation of nuclear weapons and the need there is now for the original Non-Proliferation Treaty to be updated and made a great deal more specific.</P>
    <P>Apart from his general expressed attitude about the Israeli invasion, Deputy Deasy raised three specific points of some significance.  By the way, I should like to congratulate him on what I believe was his first contribution here in his capacity as Opposition spokesman on Foreign Affairs.  The first point was the question of the flow of aid and food supplies.  The second was the question of self-determination for the Palestinian people.  Then he also asked about the stationing of <Col N="404" /> United Nations observers in Lebanon. On the question of food supplies I think what is possible is being done there.  The Secretary-General did report on the situation and there is a fairly major effort being undertaken to channel food supplies, aid and medical supplies into Lebanon. I want to assure the House that anything we can do by way of assistance in that regard we shall be very pleased to do.  Standard medical kits are being supplied, as is food.  I think UNIFIL can and are performing some useful function in regard to that situation.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Cooney mentioned the report about the two Irish soldiers who were killed and that he referred to the statement by our Department of Defence today denying that report.  I want to confirm that that is the position, that that report is entirely without foundation. The two soldiers concerned, unfortunately, were shot and killed but there was nothing more involved than that.  With regard to Private Joyce who is still missing, unfortunately there is no information about him despite exhaustive inquiries which our Embassy in Beirut and the United Nations Commander have made about his whereabouts.  I want to tell the House that, as of now, he is not presumed dead. We can only hope that he will eventually turn up safe and sound.</P>
    <P>On the question of self-determination for the Palestinians, that was dealt with fairly cogently in the Venice declaration, that was the summit in Venice which issued a fairly important declaration about the Middle East situation.  That declaration set out the basic principles of the kind of settlement which the Ten believed should be aimed at in the Middle East.  Of course the first principle is the security of all the States in the region. That principle of security of course includes the security of the State of Israel. The second important principle enunciated in that declaration was justice for all the peoples and, of course, that includes the self-determination of the Palestinian people.  Since that Venice declaration a great deal of preparatory work has been done as a follow-up on the manner in which these principles might be implemented. <Col N="405" /> Of course any work of that nature must ultimately reach a stalemate as long as the central political issue is not settled.  On the one hand that is, of course, recognition by the PLO and others of the right of existence of Israel and its right to secure borders and, on the other hand, the recognition by Israel of the rights of the Palestinians to self-determination and to their homeland.</P>
    <P>There was another general point raised by Deputy De Rossa and others, that was that we should be using our efforts in the counsels of the Ten and in the United Nations to achieve certain objectives with regard to Israeli policy.  I do not think much more can be done in that regard either by the Security Council or by the Ten.  Very positive, strong statements have been issued by the Ten which go as far as can be gone and as is necessary at this stage.  As I mentioned in my opening remarks, those statements cover the withdrawal of Israeli forces, the need to adhere to the Geneva Convention, the humanitarian aspects of the situation. Anything else that should be covered has been dealt with by the Ten in their two statements.  Again, I do not think the Security Council Resolution which was passed unanimously could go any further or be any more specific that it has been. Therefore, in that regard, we have &mdash; in co-operation with our partners in the Ten and in the role we discharge at the United Nations &mdash; done everything that can be done at this stage.</P>
    <P>The question uppermost in all our minds at present is the role of UNIFIL and what should happen next.  I think there is also fairly general agreement in the House &mdash; and I know that this view is held widely in the United Nations &mdash; that whereas UNIFIL are not in a position to exercise their peace-keeping mission fully at present nevertheless they should remain in position because they do represent some element of stability in that situation.  I think we would all agree that, for the time being at any rate, UNIFIL should remain in position.  Of course we must think a bit ahead and I know this was in the minds of many Deputies from opinions expressed about the future.  There is the future of UNIFIL, as <Col N="406" /> it stands at present, and there is also the future of the area now being invaded.  I myself would be inclined to believe that one solution which may emerge ultimately is that there will be a greatly expanded United Nations force to occupy the larger area now involved as a peace-keeping mission.  I know also that in the United Nations itself the view is very strongly held that such a United Nations peace-keeping force, if it is to be established, would have to be much larger than UNIFIL and would also have to have the complete and total acceptance by all of the parties involved of their role and insertion into the situation.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any point any more in asking a United Nations peace-keeping force to undertake a peace-keeping mission in that area unless there is total and complete acceptance of the force, its role and mission by everybody concerned.  But I think &mdash; and I feel sure the House would agree with me in this regard &mdash; that if that solution does emerge and appears to be an acceptable one, receiving the unanimous acceptance to which I referred, then I have no doubt but that the House would agree that we should play our full part in any such force. Deputies are probably very much concerned with the central issue of UNIFIL, its future and the possibility of a larger force being created.  I am sure that perhaps at another level the thing that is possibly uppermost in all our minds is the tragedy that has overtaken the people of Lebanon, all the people of that area, Palestinians and Lebanese.</P>
    <P>I had the opportunity of being in New York when the situation was unfolding. The American television was particularly comprehensive in its coverage of the events.  Perhaps everybody in the country might not realise the enormity of what has happened in Lebanon, the absolute tragedy and the tragic devastation that has occurred which was very graphically illustrated on American television.  When we think that there are 600,000 refugees we must all be appalled and must be determined that, if there is anything we can possibly do to help to alleviate that situation, we will do it.  The number killed is one aspect of the situation but the fact <Col N="407" /> that there is such an enormous number of people who are now homeless and destitute is something which must command the attention of the whole world. The Ten are certainly concerned about it and the institutions of the Ten are examining what can be done.  It is almost beyond our comprehension when we think in terms of 1,000 refugees or 10,000 refugees but the mind is quite incapable of grasping the concept of 500,000 or 600,000 people homeless, destitute and starving.  This is a great human tragedy about which we are talking and I know the House would wish the Government and all agencies who can be of any assistance to do everything possible to alleviate that situation.</P>
    <P>I again express my gratitude to the House and to the Deputies for the manner in which they have approached this debate and for the contributions that have been made.  The Government have found this debate very informative and very helpful.  I undertake, if there are any developments of any importance in the situation there, to keep the House and Deputies fully informed of them.  I again emphasise that the Government will endeavour to play any part they can in the peacekeeping side in the future, as they have done in the past, and, in particular, to do everything they can in any area of responsibility available to them to alleviate the great suffering and deprivation that is taking place in Lebanon today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned for lunch I had almost concluded my remarks.  At this stage I simply want to clarify what is the bottom line for Fine Gael on this Bill.  There is a consensus stretching around the House that the problems of decay and dereliction in this city and elsewhere are rampant.  There is a recognition of the social ills that stem from that, poor housing, urban crime and unemployment.  There is an equal consensus <Col N="408" /> that the existing methods of dealing with that problem have to date proved inadequate and we must look elsewhere for solutions.  I repeat that we are predisposed to be impressed by the Minister but at this point in time we find the Bill is full of flaws.  We will listen intently to the Minister's reply and, depending on what he has to say, we will decide if we should vote against the Second Reading.</P>
      <P>Unless the Minister gives the House an assurance that at the Committee Stage he will remove from the Bill the section which we find profoundly offensive, which excludes An Bord Pleanála from the planning functions and retains it within the Department of the Environment, we will be voting against the Second Reading.  Unless the Minister indicates to the House that he recognises that there is force in our objections to what has been described by the Port and Docks Board as the legalised hijacking sections, unless he indicates he will look with favour on rewriting that section in Committee we will oppose the Second Reading. Our attitude will be determined precisely by what we hear from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to the Minister for the manner in which he spoke this morning.  His speech clarifies the position to the satisfaction of the House.  He has been a member of Dublin Corporation for many years and he knows the importance of the subject he is dealing with.  I know, more than most Members of the House, as a member of Dublin Corporation, that the Minister of State made enormous efforts to bring about many of the improvements which are embodied in the Bill.  I know that Deputy George Birmingham and others in Dublin Corporation were concerned that some action would be taken to expedite the necessary improvements in Dublin city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that members of Dublin Corporation, like Dublin citizens, have been satisfied with the progress that has been made and that there was a demand from these citizens, Dublin Corporation, the Dáil and the Seanad that something should be done to improve the environment in which Dubliners are living.  As <Col N="409" /> the Bill clearly states, urban decay is not confined to Dublin.  There is urban decay in Cork, Limerick and the larger towns throughout Ireland.  It is clear from this Bill that it is the intention of the Government and of the House that there should be more speedy methods of dealing with derelict sites, litter and the decay which is overtaking our towns and cities.  I believe that is the wish not only of the House but of all the people.  As I have said before in this House, when we drive from Dublin Airport to the city with visitors we have to devise ways and means of avoiding Dorset Street, Gardiner Street and all the other areas that bring horror to people who love Dublin and who are proud of the traditions of this city.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his opening address that the problems of redevelopment and urban renewal in inner urban areas have not achieved the necessary results in areas of special need.  This Bill is a very welcome approach to the problem and is a radical departure from the former approval to urban renewal.  It is beyond my comprehension how any Member of this House can talk about the constitutionality of the Bill or even consider opposing it on spurious grounds. Deputy George Birmingham is displaying political expediency and opportunism. Fine Gael and the Labour Party requested amendments to legislation dealing with compulsory purchase orders.  There were calls for amendments to the legislation that set up An Bord Pleanála and more speedy resolution of the bureaucratic process.</P>
    <P>Deputy Birmingham spoke in cliches about the Bill being outrageous, unacceptable and being a radical departure. He spoke about James Joyce.  We celebrate Joyce today in Dublin and in the rest of the country.  I think if James Joyce were in this House today he would weep if he had heard Deputy Birmingham's speech.  Deputy Birmingham had a completely negative and unhelpful approach to the problem.  However, I am certain that the Minister, in relation to any amendments to this Bill, will be flexible in his attitude.  He will try to ensure that there will be a speedy redevelopment <Col N="410" /> of the inner city of Dublin, not only in housing, factories and employment but also in the environment.</P>
    <P>I have heard many Deputies complain that at every opportunity we take power from ourselves and invest it in other institutions. We set up organisations like An Bord Pleanála and, while I appreciate that the members of that board have a very difficult task and have many hard decisions to make, I am not satisfied with the long delays that continue to impede development and progress.  I am not sure the board is fulfilling the function for which it was intended.  I regret that we seem to have a tendency in this House to shirk our own responsibilities in this area and on matters such as planning and development.  This Bill goes a long way to at least restore some of the powers we have given away, so to speak, as elected public representatives.</P>
    <P>The last speaker mentioned powers being returned to the Minister for the Environment.  I see nothing wrong with that.  I am quite satisfied with the integrity and motives of the Minister involved.  It ill becomes a Deputy to cast aspersions on a Minister of State.  If he has any indication that a decision has been made which is wrong and unworthy, he should bring it before the House.  I am quite satisfied that politicians will, given the opportunity, fulfil their role honestly. They have done so.  Successive Ministers have also done so, despite the fact that there may have been some controversy over some decisions they have made.  I am pleased to see that this Bill seeks to bring back to the Minister and to the politicians the decision making process in regard to developments of the kind we are talking about.</P>
    <P>We have shown deep concern over the years for inner city development and have found great difficulty in coming to grips with it because of the difficulties, delays and the length of time it takes to get compulsory purchase orders finally confirmed and which, when confirmed, may or may not be sent to the High Court or the Supreme Court.  That process can take eight or nine years and is very unsatisfactory. We have seen the decay in the inner city, a city of which I am a native <Col N="411" /> and which I love.  We have seen the city centre falling apart, despite many noble efforts made by Dublin Corporation in areas like Meath Street where they have developed very beautiful town houses. One notices as one drives through The Liberties that there are no windows open for the simple reason that if they open windows they will be poisoned because of fumes from cars, lead poisoning and the dreadful pollution that exists.  If people want to develop the inner city they must pay the price.  It is reasonable and right that we should pay, but it is not reasonable that the people of Dublin city who are housed there should be subjected to the poisonous fumes of trucks and cars that pass their front doors.  If we build these houses &mdash; and I think we should &mdash; we should also build by-roads and motorways to take the traffic away from these areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Birmingham referred to the difficulties politicians have in making decisions and so on.  I want to refer him to his own colleagues in County Dublin who have rezoned many thousands of acres of land to the benefit of the people in the county, to the financial benefit of many people speculating in that area and at the moment there is no law against that.</P>
    <P>Does he deny the rights of councillors in Dublin County Council to make decisions as the law stands?  I think it is fair and reasonable that politicians should return to themselves the power to make decisions on development and decisions would be made far more quickly than by An Bord Pleanála.  Much the same applies to all the other areas where we have for some reason thrown away the powers the people legitimately expect that we have vested in us.  From attending to constituency problems at clinics we know that people have incredible notions about the powers of politicians but those powers are being diminished and taken from us by ourselves.</P>
    <P>That is what this Bill is beginning to reverse and I welcome the proposals.  We have seen the difficulties created for people living, for instance, in Glencullen or Kilternan on the outskirts of Dublin <Col N="412" /> whose families have been living there for 500 or 600 years and who cannot get planning permission there because An Bord Pleanála think in terms of high amenity zones and, as far as I can see, have different standards for different areas and people.  Yet we have the Treacy house which was built in Kilcullen totally out of character with the area, planning permission given by Dun Laoghaire Corporation and confirmed by An Bord Pleanála.  The man who got that planning permission is a total stranger to the area. How can one justify that?  If that was a political decision the person responsible for it would be open to question, investigation and examination but An Bord Pleanála is not open to investigation.  This Bill seeks to remedy that situation and the Minister will be answerable to this House for the decisions he will make in this area and I support that.  I am surprised that Deputy Birmingham does not.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to achieve more community involvement in the area of inner city planning.  I welcome this concept.  All Members of the House have recently been urging that there should be community involvement and self-help in neighbourhoods.  If the Bill provides for that it must be welcomed.  We have a very serious problem that we have already dealt with in this session, the question of litter.  Environmentally the urban Irish people are as blind as bats when it comes to litter.  We have the urban scene with the plastic signs, the honky tonks, bingo halls and amusement arcades on the main street, in O'Connell Street.  There are no by-laws, no legislation to deal with the standard of signposting or signs on shops and shop fronts.  We have no standards and no regulations in this area particularly for places such as the main thoroughfare, O'Connell Street.  It is quite embarrassing to go through O'Connell Street.  I wonder if Dublin Corporation have ever made a count of the litter bins placed around O'Connell Street, not that I think it makes the slightest difference because Irish people have not become aware of their responsibility regarding litter and dumping of paper from fish and <Col N="413" /> chip shops and whatever disposable paper they may have from whatever package they are carrying.  The easiest thing is to drop it rather than place it in the bin if it happens to be on the other side of the street.  In 1960 we got in a Danish design team to advise Irish designers on design in Ireland.  It is time we looked at the whole business of serious urban development and renewal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Birmingham devoted about half his contribution to the question of Dublin Port and Docks Board.  It has a very serious responsibility in this area.  It has land there and it is answerable to people as a semi-State organisation, answerable to Dublin people in particular and to the Irish people in general.  This is a very serious responsibility.  I have no idea why Deputy Birmingham expects the Government to move in to provide funds for Dublin Port and Docks Board for land that was legitimately owned anyway by the people of Dublin.  If, over the years Dublin Port and Docks Board have not developed that site, so be it; the Government must do it.  I welcome the fact that the Government plan to do this.</P>
    <P>Another factor is the ludicrous signposting we have in Dublin.  A stranger or even a native would have difficulty in trying to locate one area or another.  For a stranger to get out of town whether he be from Cork or Donegal, from Liverpool or London, he would need a guide. What has Dublin Corporation or the Department of the Environment done about signposting?  Next to the Spanish we must have the world's worst signposting. It is quite incredible as you discover when you go through Dublin city and find yourself driving down a one-way street because the signpost was pointing in the wrong direction &mdash; perhaps due to vandalism; I do not blame the Corporation or anybody else for that.  Even if it is turned in the right direction it may be illegible or may not have been cleaned for years.  The whole business of road works in Dublin city demands examination. They are now working on the quays, picking a bit here and there. Apparently they work from 8 o'clock to 4 o'clock and then go home and to hell with the commuters.  Anybody who has <Col N="414" /> to get through Dublin city in the rush hours &mdash; that is their problem.</P>
    <P>I do not see why an agreement cannot be brought about involving trade unions, the corporation and the contractors involved in these areas to have shift workers working around the clock to ensure the minimum disruption by road works or development particularly in Dublin city and county.  With all the unemployment we have and all the other difficulties it is a mystery that we should add to them by the inefficiency of our signposting, roadworks and so on.  It is regrettable that more is not done in that area.</P>
    <P>We have the old problem whereby the ESB dig up a road and where some days later perhaps Post Office workers move in to do whatever they have to do.  Efforts have been made on many occasions to improve this situation.  As far back as the sixties I recall Dublin County Council bringing together a committee composed of people from the Department of Local Government as it then was, people from Dublin Corporation and people from the Post Office, from the ESB and from the Gas Company in an effort to get some co-ordination in this area.  But the situation has not changed and so we continue with the pollution of the environment and with the disastrous situation so far as Dublin city is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Birmingham has expressed major reservations about the Bill, but I would remind him that his leader, when Taoiseach, negotiated with Deputy Gregory and endeavoured to bring about precisely the same sort of legislation with the exception of a few minor differences. This massive U-turn on the part of Deputy FitzGerald was ignored almost totally by the media.  My information is that Deputy FitzGerald, as leader of the socialist wing of Fine Gael, had no difficulties of the type mentioned by Deputy Birmingham in relation to the Bill.  My information is that Deputy FitzGerald welcomed the proposals to which he is now objecting.  Have Fine Gael seen the light or are they just playing the political expediency game in an effort to try to embarrass the Government? If that is what they are at, it is fine; <Col N="415" /> but let them not pretend now that they are totally opposed to this Bill.  Whom are we to believe?  Have Fine Gael a new policy for each day?</P>
    <P>Whatever may be our thoughts about British influence here down through the years, one of the legacies they left us and of which we can be proud is the parks around this city.  It is fitting to take this opportunity of paying tribute to Dublin Corporation for the fine job they do in caring for those parks.  The British had the Wide Street Act which gave us O'Connell Street but in our environmental blindness we destroyed O'Connell Street by the erection of neon and plastic signs, by the provision of honky tonk joints &mdash; places in which there are slot machines and so on &mdash; and of ice cream parlours.  We did all this simply to destroy something that we inherited from the British.  I am sure that the many thousands of Dubliners who stroll through St. Stephen's Green will join with me in my appreciation of such a beautiful park. There is great credit due to the parks department for the way in which they maintain the parks.  But when one leaves the park in Mountjoy Square, for instance, one walks out into an area that might well have been hit by an atomic bomb.  It is a disaster area.</P>
    <P>I regret very much the decision, apparently irreversible, made by Dublin Corporation regarding the site for the new City Hall.  From the point of view of the environment this was a disaster and I do not think that any re-jigging of that site will succeed in so far as saving that part of the city is concerned.  Environmentally and aesthetically that area was of much value to this capital city.  I appreciate that the corporation needed a new city hall and new offices.  They had been spread all over the place, but the damage is done now in regard to where they decided to build.</P>
    <P>The basic provision in section 4 is the imposition on the commission of a duty to secure the overall regeneration of its area and we are told that in this context the commission will have power to acquire, hold and manage land for development either by themselves or by others. <Col N="416" /> Surely that provision cannot be objected to by anyone here.  The type of spurious excuses we have had from speakers on the other side ill becomes politicians.  I find unacceptable the suggestions that were made by the last speaker.  I hope that he will realise that such suggestions are unbecoming of a politician.  Perhaps Deputy Birmingham's mind is on other matters.  In passing, I wish him well for his future married life, but I regret that he has seen fit to be so patronising here today.  He made what was a sad speech because he tried to take personal political advantage at the expense of other honourable Members of the House on all sides.  That is most regrettable.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated also that it may well happen that part of Cork County Borough and an area in Limerick city will be designated as urban development areas.  I welcome that statement and I hope that this legislation will herald the end of urban decay and the beginning of a new era in urban renewal and development.</P>
    <P>Perhaps on close examination those who have indicated opposition to the Bill will reconsider their position.  The Bill may not be everything we would wish it to be; but it is a dynamic and positive start and the people of this city, together with the people of the country generally, should be very happy with the sincere and genuine effort that has been made to bring some resolution to the appalling decay of Dublin city.  Many Deputies from rural areas complain about the condition of our roads, the air in Dublin city and the environment.  They tell me that they look forward to returning to the rural areas so that they can breathe fresh air.  Such things are part of the quality of life which Deputies from rural areas enjoy but which Deputies from urban areas, and their constituents, will never enjoy unless action of the type dealt with in the Bill is taken.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us an assurance that he will be looking at other cities such as Cork, Limerick and Galway in the light of experience gained in the operation of the terms of this legislation and <Col N="417" /> for that reason there should not be any opposition to the Bill.  I accept that the Minister will be practical in his approach. I hope the House will not have any hesitation in voting for this legislation.  If faults are found with it in the coming year I expect that the Minister will return to the House seeking amendments to it.  It should be given a chance so that we can make a start on the issue of the environment in urban Ireland and give people in our cities the break they need.  It should be remembered that more people live in our cities than in rural areas.  They have a right to a proper environment and fresh air.  The towns and cities throughout Europe are kept spotlessly clean.  In Spain, where roads are not developed in some areas, there is an environmental operation in all towns and villages.  It is a pleasure to go through that country and see the condition of some villages that can only be approached by dirt-tracks. Those people take great pride in the appearance of their towns and villages.</P>
    <P>If Dublin people are given the encouragement, leadership, and the incentive, they will respond.  If they are given to understand that Members of this House, and public representatives on Dublin Corporation, care for them and are anxious to ensure that the city is improved, they will respond positively.  Ultimately, we will have a city that we can all be proud of.  We will then have people walking up and down Dorset Street for recreation purposes and not simply to get from one point to another and hope to get there in safety.  People would then be able to walk up and down Sheriff Street, admire the houses and enjoy that part of their city once again.  We could have small coffee shops, restaurants and bars. Dublin city could be brought back to life again.  We should welcome this move by the Minister and I believe the people of the inner city will respond to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be congratulated on bringing this Bill forward so quickly. I hope Members from Dublin city and county will not vote against it.  I hope Members from other urban areas will not jeopardise its passage through the House or put their own political self interest before the intentions in the Bill.  If they <Col N="418" /> do they will never be forgiven by those who must live in this city.</P>

      <P>At the outset I would remind the last speaker and the speaker before him, to whom I have listened, that this country extends a little bit beyond Dublin.  What has been talked about is Dublin.  It is a little bit more than that.  I come from an urban area and I know all about urban problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a member of the local UDC at Mallow and it was there I <Col N="419" /> started.  Nobody can deny that there is a problem in our urban areas, not alone in Dublin inner city but throughout the country.  Bad housing, insanitary conditions, overcrowding, lack of facilities and frighteningly high levels of unemployment are just some of the more pressing issues that need to be tackled.  My party have been highlighting these problems for years at both local and national level. This Bill is not the answer to the problems. It undermines local democracy and discriminates between areas of deprivation. It confers powers on the new development authorities in the planning area which if abused could turn it into a speculators' charter in the centres of our cities and urban towns.  On the question of democracy, section 3 of the Bill states clearly that local TDs, Senators and MEPs are excluded from membership of the new commissions proposed in the Bill.  Councillors are not referred to, but as they are not included in the commissions as of right, presumably they can be members only as appointees of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister himself, in moving the Second Reading of the Bill, paid a special tribute to the work of the inner city subcommittee of Dublin City Council for their pioneering work in identifying and tackling problems in areas of special need and deprivation.  Why then have the Government decided to stop this development and introduce this unrepresentative body to deal with problems which are essentially local government problems? We might find the answer in section 12 of the Bill.  This section exempts the new commissions from local planning control and An Bord Pleanála's restraints.  In other words, it goes back to the bad old days when the Minister decided the fate of controversial planning decisions.  We had great examples of this, one in my UDC area.  A former Minister granted permission for a development there which the general body of the people there called the rape of the spa. That was granted by a Minister of the second last Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given past experience of both Fianna Fáil and Coalition Ministers and given <Col N="420" /> the Government's strong association with the property lobbies, is this new Bill not designed to provide a property speculators' charter?  If so, there will be a tragic irony in the present situation, because it is the property speculators who have inflicted the worst excesses of urban blight on our cities and urban towns.  The declared purpose of the Bill is to rejuvenate the most deprived urban areas in the State, but who is to decide where these areas are?  The present appalling state of our official social statistics suggests that we lack the means to make any realistic and objective assessment at national level.</P>
    <P>Therefore, who decides?  According to this Bill, the answer is the Minister.  I state with all the force at my command that only local people and their democratically elected representatives can even begin to answer this extremely difficult and sensitive question.  If this Bill becomes law we are agreed that badly-needed local authority funds will be channelled into certain areas of urban deprivation and other equally badly off areas will suffer as a result.  Not only is this discriminatory, but it is wasteful.  The commission will in effect be setting up bureaucracies parallel to the local authorities and creating a whole new breed of public servants who will have a vested interest in disputing as many areas of urban responsibility as possible with their counterparts in the City Hall or urban offices.  What is really wrong is that successive Governments have failed to make the capital available to the local authorities to carry out that part of their work which is very important, such as urban renewal, and the clearance and redevelopment of derelict sites.  However, the Bill has not made it easier for the local authority to acquire such property.  This money would be far better spent in providing extra resources to existing democratically-elected local authorities. If the £50 million of repayable advances allocated in this Bill were, for instance, made available to local authorities for housing purposes that would nearly double their housing capability for the current year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="421" /> My party must oppose this Bill, therefore, because it is not a serious attempt to deal with the problems of urban blight. It is simply a device to secure the support of an independent Deputy in the Chamber and give the public the impression that the Government are trying to tackle the problem of our inner cities and urban areas and at the same time create a machine that can be put at the disposal of the property lobbies in urban areas containing some of the most valuable real estate.  Let me repeat that the failure of successive Governments to provide the necessary capital for the local authorities is the reason we have this problem in the urban areas.  I refer in this instance to the urban area which I know, Mallow, which is an area of poverty, which succeeded very well in providing the services such as housing, water, sewerage and so forth, but failed in the matter of urban renewal, clearance and redevelopment, for the reasons I have stated.  If the Government are serious about their commitment to urban renewal they should introduce a Bill aimed at reforming local government, extending its powers and making it more democratic and responsive to the needs of the people, instead of trying to foist on local communities another group of bureaucrats and party hacks who may or may not be able to promote the process of urban renewal.</P>
    <P>This Bill is badly conceived, badly drafted, and we will be opposing it.  The answer to the problem is that the local authorities are there to act as local authorities and all that is needed is that the capital be provided to let them get on with the job of the renewal, clearance and redevelopment of the inner city and the urban areas of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Brady,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dublin South-East):</i> I would like to thank the Deputies who contributed to the Second Stage debate.  I thank especially Deputy Keating for his personal good wishes to me on my appointment as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is important legislation.  Deputy Keating and other Deputies felt that the <Col N="422" /> Bill only skirted around the crucial issues and did not deal with some of the real problems.  The Government will not claim that this Bill is the answer to all the problems of urban areas.  I went to some trouble in my opening remarks to explain this to the House.  The Bill is the first of a series of measures, legislative and otherwise, which we have in mind.  I have already referred to the plans which I have for local authorities and devising means by which their existing activities relevant to urban renewal can be made to work more effectively.  I mentioned also a review of the compulsory purchase law which is ongoing at present.  The Derelict Sites Act will be examined.  In addition, both the Minister and I have already referred to the intention to review the Planning Acts generally.  Proposals have been put forward for administrative action to improve the operation of our planning system.  Therefore, the Bill should be seen as one element only in a package of measures designed to improve the environment generally in our urban areas.</P>
    <P>In connection with CPO law, tentative proposals to improve the situation and to speed up the process have already been worked out in my Department.  There are, however, serious legal and constitutional issues involved.  For this reason the Minister has asked the Attorney General for an opinion on these proposals before any further action is taken.  However, there will be no avoidable delay on my part in bringing forward whatever legislative proposals can be devised to improve and speed up the process.  This branch of the law is particularly difficult and complex.  I give a commitment to the House that as soon as such legislation is ready I will bring it to the House.  The improvement of CPO law is seen as a vital element in relation to the regeneration of urban areas.  The present Bill has had to be framed on the basis that the commission will initially use the CPO system.  Whatever improvements can be made will apply to the commissions also.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that the setting up of the commissions is not intended to displace planning authorities from having a primary responsibility in renewal and <Col N="423" /> regeneration or to imply that an area must have a commission if it is to progress in dealing with such problems.  At present all planning authorities are obliged to include in their development plans suitable objectives for renewal in urban areas and to take steps to secure the implementation of such objectives.  This basic system will remain.  But not even the strongest supporters of the local authorities system, among whom I include myself, would claim that planning authorities generally have been successful in stimulating urban renewal on the necessary scale.  This remark is not intended as a criticism.  It is obvious that there are considerable difficulties involved and in spite of these difficulties there have been some notable achievements.  However, much more rapid and widespread progress needs to be made and not only in Dublin. I have been at pains to tell the House that this Bill is not designed for Dublin alone and it has been very tiring listening to speakers opposite giving the impression that the Bill is for Dublin only.  That is not the case; it is a national plan.</P>
    <P>The development commissions will enable redevelopment to be undertaken in two designated areas to start.  The work will augment the efforts of the planning authority and will develop a momentum which we can reasonably hope will lead to a new interest in inner urban development generally.  These pilot schemes will enable us to judge how best this kind of approach can be used to complement and support the work of the planning authorities within the overall planning and development system.</P>
    <P>It will be part of my task to see how the existing physical planning and development provisions as they relate to urban renewal are working and to evaluate achievements and constraints.  I will be visiting a number of urban areas to see conditions on the ground and will be discussing the problems with local representatives and officials.  In the light of this examination I will consider what statutory or other changes are necessary and feasible to enable the planning authorities to make a wide and more effective attack on the problems of physical decline in urban areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="424" /> Under this Bill attention is not directed specifically at depriving local authorities of their powers.  I have stressed repeatedly that no attempt is being made to usurp in any way the powers of local authorities and any Deputy who tries to give a contrary impression is guilty of misleading the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn and other Deputies sought details of inter-departmental and inter-ministerial consultations about the proposed transfer of the Dublin Port and Docks Board site.  I do not think the Deputy seriously expects me to disclose such information.  The Bill was the subject of normal inter-departmental consultations and final decisions on it were made by the Government, taking all relevant considerations into account, including legal advice.  I do not propose to say any more on that topic at present. However, I would add that the Dublin Port and Docks Board recently met the Minister for Transport to discuss the Bill and had a meeting today with the Minister for the Environment.  The Minister heard the representations made by the board and advised them that he would give further consideration to section 8, in consultation with the Government, and would communicate further with the board.  There is no attempt to steamroll any legislation through this House and any such suggestions are quite erroneous. I am hopeful that this meeting will eliminate these fears and misconceptions. The suggestion that the Bill will make port workers redundant is absolute nonsense.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the provisions in the Bill in regard to planning matters.  Some Deputies expressed concern about these, particularly section 12, under which development carried out or approved by a development commission would be exempted from the normal planning control system and subject instead to a consultation system basically similar to that applying to State authorities. This is far from bringing the Minister back into the planning system in the same way as Ministers were involved up to 1977.  I need hardly assure the House that this was not what the section was designed to achieve.  However, I am concerned that section 12 may leave open <Col N="425" /> the possibility that people will see this as a step towards the return of political control over the appeals system, although this was not intended.  Accordingly, we will consider between now and Committee Stage what amendments could be made to section 12 to eliminate any possibility or appearance of political involvement in planning appeals or equivalent decisions.</P>
    <P>One possibility would be to introduce An Bord Pleanála into the consultation process contemplated in section 12. Another possibility might be to confine that section to developments carried out directly by the commission themselves &mdash; in other words, public authority developments. These and other possibilities will be examined between now and Committee Stage with a view to finding an approach on which the whole House can agree.  This is to be the spirit of this Bill. In the light of the contributions which have been made the Government will do everything to ensure that the Bill is designed to be acceptable and to carry out the task intended.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies who have contributed <Col N="426" /> to the debate and give the Minister's firm assurance that no attempt is being made to usurp local authority powers.  We will be working in tandem with the local authorities at every stage.  Our concern is to get on with the job of improving living conditions and uplifting urban areas throughout the country.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I wish to make it clear that the Minister's response falls far short of what we expected and, contrary to what we were led to believe throughout the day, he has failed to guarantee that An Bord Pleanála will be involved.  We reject his response.</P>

      <P>I said last evening I was very disappointed with the Government amendment to this motion, or perhaps I should say not so much disappointed with the Government amendment but at the Minister's remarks thereon, which surprised us all by giving no undertaking whatsoever about the National Film Studios, although we might have expected such, considering the wording of that amendment.  Therefore, there is no question of this party supporting such an amendment, since the remarks made in its support contradicted its every word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to return to the paramount question, which is the retention of the studio facilities at Ardmore in Bray, County Wicklow.  That is the basic question concerning all of us on this side of the House.  The essential value of Ardmore is that it is a complex.  Any film production benefits in an organisational and financial way from being able to control its operations from one base, where equipment, a preview theatre, post-production facilities, transport and so on are all provided on the one campus rather than being scattered in hotels, cinemas, depots and so on.  The facilities at Ardmore Studios fulfil these requirements and, as we said last evening, it would be now an impossible undertaking to set about building that complex.  The core of this problem is that the studio complex should be retained.  However, I am not suggesting that it should be or must be retained at the previous level.  We know there have been severe financial problems for the studios up to this.  I believe it is advisable to re-examine the structure and running of the studios and to ensure that not only will the facilities remain open but that at the first possible opportunity <Col N="430" /> they will be on a self-financing basis.  I believe that can be achieved by establishing a system known as the four wall system, the studio facilities with a basic care and maintenance staff, including the vital technical staff and craftsmen involved in the studios to keep that complex open and running.  The necessity for keeping the studios open on that system is agreed as essential by many people in the film industry, including many members of the new film board who make no bones about their views.</P>
    <P>It was, to put it mildly, astonishing that the Minister failed to consult the new film board before announcing his decision to close the studios.  I believe the film studios could be made self-financing in a relatively short time, given that the Minister has already announced his intention to write off the debts.  If we ensure that the studio complex is retained for the Irish film industry we will have preserved an asset for the country and we will have redeemed a situation where those studios looked doomed to closure as new hope was starting for the Irish film industry with the foundation of the new film board.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Government to withdraw their amendment to the Labour Party motion.  I believe this is the best course of action and that the House will then be able to agree to the Labour Party motion and give its approval to a request to the Government to keep Ardmore Film Studios in operation as an absolutely essential asset to the growth of the film industry in the country.  I hope the note of acrimony which entered into the debate yesterday can be forgotten, that we can see some reason now and agree that a decision that was made hastily and brutally can be rescinded because of the views expressed on all sides of the House and by the very many responsible people throughout the country who are concerned not only with the employment and tourism features of having film studios available in Ardmore but also with the establishment and growth of a real Irish film industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Waterford) Mr. Gallagher (Waterford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> In sponsoring the amendment on behalf of The <Col N="431" /> Workers' Party asking that the Ardmore Film Studios be taken into public ownership I would like to stress that the motivation of the Workers' Party in putting forward the amendment was not because of any rigid ideological or dogmatic attitude as regards the Workers Party's attitude towards the concept of State enterprise but because, having examined the situation and having had detailed talks with the workers committee involved in Ardmore our party are absolutely satisfied that there is a viable future for the Ardmore studios but only under the ownership of the State.  Our amendment has at least the advantage of clarity over the motion proposed by the Labour Party and the amendment put down by the Government.</P>
      <P>The motion and the Government's amendment are little more than pious platitudes expressing that Ardmore can be preserved in some shape or form.  Our amendment calls quite clearly and unambiguously for taking the studios at Ardmore into public ownership.  The main argument put forward on this occasion and on the first occasion this subject was raised in the House on an Adjournment Debate by the Minister was a financial one.  The Minister cited the hardly comparable example last night of Bord Fáilte to show how unviable film studios are in terms of attracting foreign earnings to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ardmore film studios are not in the business of selling holidays.  They are in the business of creating an Irish film industry.  I believe there is a real future for the Ardmore film studios.  There is an attempt now by the Government to scuttle the future of the film studios and of the film industry.  The Minister claimed that the studios had lost £2.5 million up to the end of last year but he also admitted they have generated £12.5 million in foreign earnings.  The Minister made a rather ridiculous comparison yesterday evening when he tried to equate the earnings by Bord Fáilte during 1976-80 when they generated £1,948 million in return for a State input of £69 million.  He then turned around and he made a comparison <Col N="432" /> that Ardmore film studios gave a return of only £12.5 million on an investment of £4 million.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta are continuously bailing out firms in the private sector.  Could they claim that type of return in the interest of the economy?  The figures for losses are inflated.  This is because of back interest, which added £875,000 to the £2.5 million loss, 38 per cent of the total.  If one examines the shabby manner in which the Government announced the closure of Ardmore studios, when the Dáil was in recess, it leaves a lot to be desired in relation to the attitude of the Government.  Nowhere can this more strongly be applied than in regard to the workforce.  They only received notice on the day of the proposed closure, which was a contravention, as was pointed out last night, of the Minimum Notices Act, the Redundancy Payments Act and the Unfair Dismissals Act.  While accepting all these breaches by the Government I again recollect what I stated on the Adjournment Debate.  Workers have come to expect this type of attitude and treatment from firms in the private sector but for a Government, especially this Government who are continually preaching to the workers the desirability of good industrial relations, to turn around and without any notice whatsoever to put these workers on the dole queue is an indictment of the Government and their attitude towards public relations.  One wonders how seriously the Government consider the fate and the plight of ordinary working people.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have never bothered to introduce legislation to allow for directors on the board of Ardmore studios.  This shows their lack of commitment to the film industry.  If the Minister was aware of the real situation at Ardmore, he would never have stated in his defence of the closure, that the commercial film interests were boycotting and, to use his own phrase, hostile to the enterprise. On the eve of the announced closure, a public meeting was organised by the workers concerned and various public representatives from the area attended. The commercial interests involved in the film industry here also attended and they <Col N="433" /> were 100 per cent in favour of the motion proposed at that meeting which was agreed unanimously.  Not alone did the commercial industries support the maintenance of Ardmore as a viable operation but they believed it was essential for the future of the industry as a whole.  That is a documented statement and has been presented to the Minister. I have a copy of the letter which was signed by the various interests concerned in the commercial side of film making here.  Yet the Minister can say that the commercial interests are hostile to the concept of Ardmore studios.  This is rubbish and is a statement which needs to be clarified.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which needs to be highlighted is that, as far back as June 1981, the workers concerned were conscious that something was going wrong in Ardmore studios and they made a detailed submission to the then Minister, Deputy O'Malley, pointing out areas where restructuring was concerned, where savings could be made and where the industry could be made viable.  After the closure they made various attempts to meet the Minister and were fobbed off continually. One wonders how the Government can remain so blissfully ignorant of the real situation in Ardmore.</P>
    <P>Ardmore film studios are located in a highly desirable residential area.  Is it the prospect of disposing of the 33 valuable acres on which Ardmore stands which has caused this apparent blindness on the part of the Government?  I hope the Government realise the sense of outrage at their peremptory and precipitate decision to close Ardmore which has been expressed not alone in the film industry and in Bray but throughout the country. Members of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have uttered pious platitudes about saving Ardmore studios.  I do not believe these pious platitudes are worth a hat of crabs.  We believe Ardmore studios are worth saving and that is why we have tabled this amendment and why we are going to test the sincerity of the parties involved.  We want to see how sincere these parties are in their commitment towards ensuring the maintenance of a viable, ongoing and desirable national <Col N="434" /> asset in the shape of Ardmore film studios in public ownership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the amendment before the House.  Previous speakers have gone through the history of the studio so there is no need for me to repeat it.  When one considers the quality of the product from Ardmore studios over the years, it shows what can be achieved by skilled Irish craftsmen and artists.  Every Member of this House wants to see a film studio maintained.  They are necessary for film making and it is fair to say that one of the reasons why this amendment has come before the House is that further money was not available from the public purse to keep the studios going.  We are all aware that there is a statutory limit of £2 million on State guarantees to companies and the studio had reached the point where it was nearing that limit. Naturally, the banks would be unwilling to increase financial facilities without receiving further guarantees which would have to be financed from public funds.</P>
      <P>Why did the previous Government not provide money in the Estimates which would have allowed the studios to continue? The amendment before the House is signed by the previous Minister, Deputy O'Leary and also by the former Minister for Labour, Deputy Kavanagh. If both of them were concerned with the industry and about security of jobs it would have been more fitting if they had put aside money so that the studio could have been maintained.  The studio is an asset and I have spoken about the quality of their products.  If we could link quantity with quality we might have a viable studio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How does one maintain a studio?  The amendment tabled by The Workers' Party wants to maintain the <i>status quo.</i> I do not know if the previous speaker had anything in mind with regard to where the necessary finance would come from in order to do that.  That point was overlooked but nevertheless I accept he is genuine and that he wants to see employment within the studio and that it be viable.  Film makers in general want to have a facility available whereby they can process and continue with their craft of <Col N="435" /> film making.  When one considers the location of Ardmore studios, situated near the countryside and also on the doorstep of a capital city, it offers a great deal by way of external and internal location. Furthermore, a very large force of skilled workers has become available within the locality because of the proximity of the studios.</P>
    <P>Everybody wants to see the studio viable and nobody is happy with the loss of employment.  We want to see a situation where continuous work is available. Over the years I have met various interests in the film business and I am concerned with and share their interest in seeing their industry develop further. Some time ago I met workers from the studio, who were themselves justifiably concerned that there was not sufficient action within the studio, that the situation as it was could not be maintained.  I know the desire of the Minister to see that film studios develop, that they prosper and that we have sustainable viable jobs within the industry.  I share that view.</P>
    <P>The studios are an asset without question. It must be very tragic that they should close and one is shocked to feel that such a facility would not be available. I am confident that the Minister, on behalf of the Government, will be able to ensure that the film studios continue in the area, that employment will be available to people who excel in their skills and have proved themselves to be personnel of ability.  I hope that there will not be much of a time lag until the studio is operating at Ardmore.</P>
    <P>By agreement, I seek leave of the House to withdraw the Government amendment in favour of the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Government move to accept the Labour Party motion but I should like to take this opportunity to put a number of things about Ardmore Studios on the records of the House.  In considering whether the National Film Studios at Bray should be closed or not it is necessary to do so from national and local viewpoints.  We have always been renowned for having a culture which boasts a great tradition in the art forms.  Currently, we are celebrating the great literary works of the internationally famed Irish writer, James Joyce.  Cinema and television and the new age of video are all parts of the art form and as such we must consider their importance as much as our established literary talents.  Cinemas and films have experienced great changes in the last two decades.  The international cinema industry suffered with the introduction of mass television ownership, more particularly with the advent of colour television. Gone are the days when large movie moguls would invest large sums of personal wealth in both studios and films. Gone also is the tendency for several large studios concentrated mainly in the US and Britain to dominate production of films.  The film world is now more interested in reality and there is a definite move away from the large studio sets towards location work.  Because of this country's unique setting of both rural and urban landscape it has become over the years the venue for many popular films which use Ardmore as a base.  Its proximity to Dublin and to Wicklow, the garden of Ireland, make it an ideal centre for location work.  This unique blend should not be lost either to the national or international film industry.  Allied to its valuable location facilities are the undeniable local techniques and technical expertise built up over the years and which can provide the type of service that <Col N="437" /> international film companies require.</P>
      <P>We are concerned that there has been a loss of jobs for the people employed there at a time of a high level of unemployment in Bray.  While recently the figures at national level have shown a slight drop, at the same time the number unemployed in the Bray area has increased. The unique skill of the technical experts cannot at this point be utilised, and what is particularly damaging is the fact that future Irish talent in the film industry cannot have the opportunity of being trained on Irish soil.  At local level there is shock among Bray townspeople that such a facility should now be removed from the town.  Over the years the studios have become synonymous with the town, giving it a national and international reputation. There is concern about the loss of employment and there is lack of understanding in the town as to why the studios should be closed.</P>
      <P>A further point requires to be made regarding the feelings of the people of Bray over the closure.  Because of its proximity to the capital and the fact that a good many of its inhabitants worked in the capital it was always considered as a dormitory town.  By many it was regarded as a distant suburb of the capital.  That has changed rapidly in recent years because Bray has built up some basic industries and there has been considerable development in Bray itself and in north Wicklow.  One of the developments was that Ardmore studios became the National Film Studios when taken over by the Government.  When one looks at employment facilities in Bray one has only to recall that in very recent years the location of an AnCO training centre and a regional technical college was denied to the town despite the best efforts of local bodies and public representatives.  Now the Government are going to remove a national institution from the town and as a public representative from the area I am naturally concerned that the Government are not displaying the same concern in the case of Bray as in other towns throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From a national point of view let us examine the implications of the closure. Over the years there have been many <Col N="438" /> statements by the Government to the effect that there should be a national film industry.  The first positive step in this direction was taken by the Coalition Government when the then Minister, Mr. Justin Keating, set up the National Film Studios.  It was only a start on the road towards an indigenous national film industry which would by its dynamic efforts attract the necessary investment to have a spin-off effect in terms of the economy generally and to foster individuals who would have the expertise to produce films of international repute without relying solely on foreign film makers to use the station.  The recent success of the excellent film, <i>Excalibur,</i> serves to highlight the fact that such an aspiration is capable of being fulfilled.</P>
    <P>However, the follow-up of the Government since that time has been sadly lacking, thereby denying the prospect of Irish film makers showing to the world what they can achieve in this art form.  The Government have not alone failed to provide for the necessary progression of the industry but they have removed the industry from the bottom rung of the ladder.  The fact that such facilities and expertise are being lost will be seen in hindsight as a retrograde step.  I do not think that anybody is suggesting that changes were not needed in the operation of the studios but if radical changes were necessary could they not have been discussed with the people involved?  Surely the same type of situation existed in respect of difficulties that arose in many other parts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Governments in many countries have taken action to preserve their film industries. In his statement last night the Minister indicated that the Government are dealing with this matter on the basis purely of economics and that because the Ardmore studios were not a viable proposition, it was found necessary to close them.  But if one has regard to the statements of perhaps every Minister in the Cabinet from the Taoiseach down in the past few years, one finds that on many occasions they have accused members of this party and of Labour particularly, when in Government of only being interested in balancing the books.  The <Col N="439" /> Government tried to give the impression that they were the party who were interested in people and in humane actions so far as this type of situation was concerned. To disprove that, we need look no further than the statement of the Minister for the Gaeltacht yesterday in the House in connection with these proposals. What the Government have done has really been a case of balancing the books without taking into account the benefits that would accrue by way of the spin-off effects of having the studios in a viable position.  However, I am glad that the Government are accepting the amendment tabled by the Labour Party.  I hope that the Minister will consider the various proposals that have been put to him in this House in the past two evenings and that the necessary steps will be taken to put the film industry on a proper and viable footing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted very much to speak on this motion because, as the House may recall, I spoke at length on the previous legislation as it went through the House in respect both of the National Film Studios and of the Film Board.  With due respects to my Wicklow colleagues I would not wish any impression to go from this House that Ardmore is the private property of the people of Wicklow.  While many Wicklow people derive a good livelihood from the studios, the product is of essential importance to the rest of the community.  Looking around at the people who are elected to this Chamber, it never ceases to amaze me how anybody, particularly on the Government side, could have the nerve to say that we do not have the capacity for a national film industry.  If we were to transfer this operation to Ardmore we would on occasion have the capacity to make <i>Dallas</i> look like a rather boring serial.  In that rather jocose comment is a recognition that there has been a film industry in this country for up to 50 or 60 years.  The film industry will not be given a guarantee of existence simply by retaining the physical part of the Ardmore studios.  As the debate on the film board would indicate, the industry depends on a lot more.  In <Col N="440" /> that context I am talking about an Irish film industry with Irish performers, writers, producers and people with the skills essential to provide the back-up services required but I would make the analogy of the Ardmore studios as an essential component to the Irish film industry in the following way.  The existence of a printing press in a country is no guarantee of having a literature of that country but in the absence of a printing press, in the absence of facilities to produce and distribute a country's culture, there will not be a literature at all.  In the period of colonial exploitation the Irish people had exactly that experience.  Unlike most other peoples in western Europe, our culture is largely a vernacular and oral culture.  The building component of it, a component that is manifest in every other European country is absent in Irish terms.  This is because of the colonial oppression that took place from the year 1600 onwards.</P>
      <P>Therefore, at the outset it should be understood clearly that the Ardmore studios are an essential base on which an Irish film industry can be constructed. Without the studios there will be no Irish film industry.  That must be underlined frequently because if we accept that point of view and if the commitment of the State is towards an Irish film industry, what is at issue is the question of the way in which the studios are made viable and not whether they should exist.  On behalf of Labour I welcome the decision by Fianna Fáil to withdraw their amendment and to indicate their support for the Labour Party resolution.  I have the confidence of calling it a resolution because I believe that is what it will become.</P>
      <P>The motion tabled by this party reads:</P>
      <P>That, having regard to the preservation of essential skills for servicing the film industry in Ireland, Dáil Éireann requests the Government to take whatever steps are necessary to maintain and develop the studio facilities at the National Film Studios of Ireland, Ardmore, Bray, County Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the phraseology, &ldquo;to take whatever steps are necessary&rdquo;, we are signalling <Col N="441" /> clearly to the Government a degree of flexibility as to how the studios can best be maintained, managed and operated. We are clearly identifying that these studios are owned by the National Film Studios of Ireland.  It is because that company is a publicly owned one that I suggest to The Workers' Party that their amendment to our motion is at best superfluous, or perhaps, they did not understand the context in which it was being argued, and at worst it is a cynical piece of political opportunism.  Frankly, what we saw earlier today with the extraordinary anti-semitic bias in the contribution of the speaker on behalf of The Workers' Party in the Lebanon debate, leads me to fear the worst and to suggest that it is political opportunism.  How can one take into public ownership something that is already in public ownership? What kind of nonsense, ideological or otherwise, is that?</P>
    <P>They are right to use the phrase &ldquo;public ownership&rdquo; in another sense because what we have seen from the Government, the establishment and journalists of the establishment press, is a concerted attack on the concept of public ownership, on the concept of the State sector and on anything which the State secto-might do which in some way might be profitable.  There is the most extraordinary belief, as I expressed earlier today in regard to the Dublin Port and Docks Board and the urban area development legislation, that somehow or other public ownership is automatically inefficient, that it is congenitally linked to inefficiency, in contrast to private ownership which, by definition, is always efficient and profitable.  There are 150,000 workers unemployed at present and the vast bulk of them came out of the efficient, productive private enterprise sector. As a European Socialist party's slogan states: &ldquo;if you think the system is working, ask someone who is not&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government are now accepting the terms of our motion and we accept the bona fides of that move because they did not have to accept it and they have the voting strength to reject it.  The motion means what it states.  I cannot <Col N="442" /> help but notice the beaming smile of the Minister for the Gaeltacht.  He is a good Deputy at giving additional and extended meanings to the English language.  I want to put on record what the Fianna Fáil Government are committing themselves to do.  They are going to accede to a request of Dáil Éireann to take whatever steps, not some steps, are necessary to maintain and develop the studio facilities of the National Film Studios of Ireland. If the retraction on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party by Deputy Ciaran Murphy is to be accorded the dignity of the House and to be taken fully and honestly as a positive retraction &mdash; I acknowledge the nod of the Minister for the Gaeltacht&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a nod up and down, not sideways, and meaning &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a definite &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. The first thing that should be done is for the Government to give new instructions to the liquidator whom they placed in on top of a publicly owned company to cease, with the explicit instructions which are effectively to liquidate the facility.  The Labour Party, and the House, should be happy that tonight Parliament will decide to make a formal commitment towards Ardmore Studios and to the Irish film industry, by extension.  In saying that we can only condemn the way in which the Government moved to undermine this industry and the manner in which the notice for receivership and the decision to close the film studios was taken in the first place.  It was quite an outrageous piece of Galtierism and is something we should not see ever again in the way any Government operate.  If a company in the private sector operated in anything like the same way Fianna Fáil would be the first to shout abuse about it.  We do not see any distinction in terms of worker participation, industrial democracy or the rights of workers whether they are with a public or a private company.  In this instance from the chief executive down to the person in receipt of the lowest pay or the most casual worker in Ardmore Studios they were all treated with utter contempt.  On behalf of the workers I reject that method and say to <Col N="443" /> Fianna Fáil, this is not the way to go about attacking the public sector or the sector over which they have control.</P>
      <P>The decision of the Government to take &ldquo;whatever necessary steps&rdquo; indicates that some kind of finance will be required.  Everybody concedes that there are major financial problems attached to the studio.  If one analyses the accounts one will see that the problems do not relate to the operating costs in the main; they do not relate to the capital development programme because the assets, the facilities, are there; and they do not relate to the revenue accounts.  There is the demand from the commercial sector of the industry, the TV commercials and so on, because 50 per cent of the production of Irish TV commercials is done either there or on location.  Even allowing for the technological improvement in much of the camera equipment a lot of commercials by definition, because of the way they are designed, need to be prepared in the studio.</P>
      <P>In those three areas of economic activity the studios can maintain a viable performance. Indeed, when they were under the caretaker control of RTE they did that.  The problem relates to the way in which their capital equity structure is established and to the usurious rates of interest the banks are extracting from the public sector.  It is part of the hypocrisy of the financial institutions and establishment here that on the one hand the kind of rapacious usurious activities of the banks can put at risk &mdash; indeed, they very nearly did so because they pointed the finger at the Minister for Energy and effectively forced him to close that industry with all the implications for the future of that industry and job security &mdash; the future of an industry because it was considered to be no longer viable.  Yet, the same banking institutions can lend millions of pounds for property speculation on sites that have collapsed around their ears at St. Stephen's Green and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bankers, at their annual dinners, talk about fiscal responsibility.  The Central Bank has the nerve to lecture us, the politicians, about the careful management <Col N="444" /> of State resources.  As far as I know, the banks use the money of ordinary depositors.  On the one hand, they can be outrageously cavalier in the manner in which they lend money for property speculation &mdash; there is now clear documented evidence of that &mdash; and on the other hand they put the boot in through the necessary channels and bring down a viable industry in every respect bar the usurious rates of interest and the way in which it was under-financed by previous Governments. They brought down not just a particular plant or studio but the foundations of a national film industry.</P>
    <P>Who became the agents of the banks? The Fianna Fáil Party, a party who attempt to lay more claim to a commitment to the development of an Irish national culture as an integral part of national independence, as an essential part of the decolonisation process which cannot only be confined to economic liberation but also to cultural and spiritual liberation.  That was the common bond among many people who supported the Fianna Fáil Party and their apparent support for the language.  Yet, in one area going into the 21st century, the most vibrant area for cultural transmission, the audio-visual medium, they were prepared to destroy at base the potential for the dissemination and development of that national culture.</P>
    <P>I would like to think, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party and the people who support them, that that was an act of stupidity rather than malice, but the consequences if it had been allowed to go through would have been enormous. What Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis would support a resolution saying that we, the members of Fianna Fáil, undertake to dismantle the Irish film industry and its potential for the cultural development of the Irish people?  Yet that was precisely what that Saturday morning raid on the Ardmore studios constituted.  I am glad that the Fianna Fáil Party and Government have been obliged by the process of this House, by the debate within this House and by the representations of the trade unions, the film industry representatives and the people of Wicklow to think again in relation to the future of the <Col N="445" /> studios.  This is a good day for democracy here.  I would like to think that it is the beginning of a good day too for the economic control of the assets of this country and a warning shot across the bows of bankers who apply totally different sets of criteria to different economic ventures.</P>
    <P>In trying to point out to the Government the manner in which they might take whatever steps are necessary to maintain and develop the studios, I would say that the first essential step must be to reform radically the capital structure of the company and to eliminate the treadmill of interest charges which are accumulating and which if not dealt with will bury the company yet again in the same way as happened before.  We and, no doubt, the workers of the company will expect that, whatever productivity arrangements are made, the Government will respond in return by providing adequate levels of equity capital for a vibrant, productive, wealth-producing sector of the public economy which has a capacity to extend beyond our wildest dreams, certainly beyond the dreams of our parents and previous generations, the dimensions and capabilities of an Irish culture and provide it in such a way that we can have a worldwide audience for it. That is not a grandiose claim for the potential of the Ardmore studios.  The technology of satellites, video and the microchip in general will be in the 21st century what the paperback novel was in the post-war era.  The quantum in terms of time will sandwich that to such an extent that the distance between now and the Gutenberg printing press will be equivalent to the next 20 to 30 years in terms of micro-electronic technology and the audio-visual industry.  At the base of that are the Ardmore studios with their capacity and existing skills, and we were on the verge of killing all that here.  On whose behalf?  That of the anonymous directors of the AIB, the Northern Bank, the Bank of Ireland and those other responsible gentlemen who have financed dereliction and vandalism in the city of Dublin.  What kind of nonsense rules this country?  Let us hope that today has seen a bit of sense and sanity.  On <Col N="446" /> behalf of the Labour Party let me thank the Government for their decision to accept the wisdom of our motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague.  Deputy Quinn, has really concluded for me in his remarks but since I introduced the motion to the House I want to speak a few concluding words on it.</P>
      <P>I was a member of a Government for eight months along with my colleague, Deputy O'Leary and we are two signatories to the notice of motion.  We were accused by both the Minister and Deputy Murphy of signing a motion knowing that when we were in office we had not put money away in order to maintain the studios at Ardmore.  The Minister must know and must have been told by the colleague whose place he is taking here tonight, the Minister for Industry and Energy, that in that Department arrangements were being made in the week the Government fell to set up a new board to run the Ardmore studios.  There would be little point in setting up a new board to run the studios if the financial arrangements were not considered also at the same time.  Time did not allow us to put that operation together.  There was a change of government by the narrowest of margins, but let me say that during my time in office I attended 97 Cabinet meetings. I did not sit around then not taking decisions.  We took decisions because we had to take them in view of the huge mess that we inherited and had to try to sort out in a very short time.  To come here and suggest that every decision that had been neglected for the previous four years by the administration we replaced could be made by us in seven or eight months is a great compliment to the individuals who formed that Cabinet and endeavoured to do what we did in our very short time in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly this is one area which for my part I would like to have seen concluded. Tonight I am glad to say that in the space of 24 hours the Minister has seen and accepted the wisdom of the motion and is now accepting that what we are saying to him is an argument.  Perhaps I was harsh last night when I suggested to him that the Fianna Fáil Government over <Col N="447" /> various periods in office had dealt my constituency many difficult and almost deadly blows, but that constituency had come back and indicated to Fianna Fáil time and again that they had better mend their ways in their approach to industry and employment in that constituency. When Fianna Fáil came into power their first act again was to close yet another industry in my constituency.  They went beyond all one could take.  I wanted to voice that feeling of great indignation on behalf of the people of Wicklow.  The only thing that could be offered to the employment situation in Wicklow was yet another closure under Fianna Fáil.  Something had to be done quickly.</P>
    <P>I hope that in accepting this motion tonight Fianna Fáil have called a halt to their destruction of the industrial base of my constituency.  I hope they are now turning back the clock to the period when the then Deputy Justin Keating brought in industries such as Noritake to Wicklow and expanded the industrial base.  I hope we will see industries such as the film industry built on and expanded and that the wisdom of what we have done here in putting down that motion will be apparent.  We will see, as I suggested to the Minister last night, that there is a base for a film industry under Irish control, in public ownership, run, as I suggested, by the Irish Film Board with RTE or with the IDA.  There is no use in my repeating those suggestions.  The object of this motion is not just to retain 50 people in employment at the ridiculous figure put forward by the Minister of £40,000 per job.  I listened to the Dáil report on the radio this morning and it seemed that all that was said in this debate was that the Ardmore film studios would cost the taxpayer £40,000 per job. I thought I had explained at quite some length that in the making of a film anything up to 300 people could be employed and a great deal of spin-off employment is given to the hotel and catering industry and also to the tourist and transport industries.  All this money was brought into this country and it was not simply 50 permanent jobs we were talking about in Ardmore but a great many more besides <Col N="448" /> and not merely in Wicklow.  The Minister himself suggested that they make films even in Mayo.</P>

We have already suggested the method by which the film industry could best be expanded. Obviously that is through public ownership. Purposely our motion was as wide as possible so that the Minister could accept it and deal with it through whatever form of public ownership he considered most appropriate.  If he thinks that by accepting the Labour Party motion he can somehow slide out of his responsibilities towards the workers at Ardmore and tell the liquidator to break up the industry and sell off the property and the land, he will not succeed.  We will be watching closely what happens and we will know what the Minister is up to if we see newspaper advertisements offering the land to <Col N="449" /> speculators and planning applications being made for housing in the Bray area.

They can be used for the making of films, TV commercials and video films.  They should not be used simply for the packing and despatch of video tapes.  We want to see the studios developed on the basis for which they were created and used by the National Film Board.  It is suggested that they should make four films a year.  There is very little use in having aircraft if you have not an airport; there is very little use in having a film industry if you have not a film studio.  We need studios in order to make Irish films.  The Minister is very keen on airports and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Today at Question Time the subject matter of the Talbot agreement was raised by Deputy Kelly and there were a number of supplementary questions asked by that Deputy, Deputy FitzGerald and myself.  The subject matter was the agreement which was entered into between the Government, Talbot Ireland, the ATGWU and the ICTU in regard to 90 assembly workers. The agreement is dated &mdash; Members will know the significance of the date &mdash; 10 June 1981.  The agreement, which I propose to put on the record of the House as it is the basic issue in dispute, is signed on behalf of the Taoiseach by Noel Whelan and Padraig Ó hUiginn and by a representative on behalf of the company whose precise signature I cannot decipher. It is signed on behalf of the ICTU by Tom McGrath, on behalf of ATGWU by Dan Browne and on behalf of the ITGWU by somebody called Halpenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="455" /> The agreement between the Government, Talbot Ireland, ATGWU and ICTU in regard to the 90 assembly workers is as follows:</P>
    <P>1. The Government are fully confident that the IDA who are actively engaged in finding a suitable viable project or projects to provide alternative employment for the 90 assembly workers, will be able to set up such a project within a period of six months. The type of employment will be comparable in nature to the existing assembly employment; the wages and conditions will be negotiated by the trade unions on the terms appropriate to the new employment.  In the event of redundancy occurring in the new company the Government will ensure that the statutory redundancy payments will be related to the number of years' service of the men during their employment in Talbot.</P>
    <P>2. The Company have agreed to sell or lease all or parts of their Dublin factory for the proposed project and the necessary negotiations and valuations are in progress.  In the event of the factory not proving suitable for a new project, it will be the intention to locate the project in suitable premises in the area e.g. the Airways Estate.</P>
    <P>3. (a) During the interim period to 16 October 1981, the workers will be given training appropriate to the employment mentioned in paragraph 1 and receive AnCO training allowances and pay-related benefits as from the entering into force of this agreement. AnCO will arrange for credited social welfare contributions during the training period and holiday leave at the rate of 1½ days per month will be provided.</P>
    <P>(b) During this period to 16 October 1981, the Company will make up the difference between the AnCO basic training allowances and the pay-related benefits to the value of the average take home pay of the workers during the period 1 November 1980 to 31 January 1981.</P>
    <P>(c) During this interim period to 16 October 1981, payments will ensure <Col N="456" /> that the take home pay of workers in the interim period from 17 April 1981 will be maintained. 4. If by 16 October an IDA funded project as referred to in paragraph 1 has not provided employment the Government will arrange to continue until such time as this employment has been provided and until the AnCO training has been completed to make up the basic training grants and pay-related benefits to the value of the average earnings as calculated in 3 (b) above subject to any increases as a result of adjustments to wage levels arising from increases granted under National Pay Policies.  When the training has been completed and if the employment referred to in paragraph 1 has not yet been provided, the Government will continue to maintain the average earnings defined in the previous sentence.</P>
    <P>5. (a) The Company undertakes that each of the 90 workers shall be paid two full weeks pay for each year of service plus a sum in lieu of notice. The total amount will be paid by 17 June.  For this payment only, service will be calculated up to October 16 1981.  Twenty-six weeks service or over will be counted as one full year.</P>
    <P>(b) The company will also pay an <i>ex-gratia</i> sum calculated on the basis of 17½ days leave to each worker.</P>
    <P>(c) The Company and Trade Union will jointly review the pension and insurance schemes with a view to the transfer to the workers of the entire benefits and rights of the schemes, if the Trust Deed so permits.</P>
    <P>(d) It is intended to submit this Agreement to the Labour Court for registration as a Registered Employment Agreement under Section 25 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.</P>
    <P>It was then signed by the signatories I mentioned earlier in my contribution. The net effect is that average earnings are guaranteed to the 90 workers concerned for life.  The cost to the State in 1982, as provided for in the Book of Estimates and as elaborated on in a reply by the Taoiseach to me on 3 June last, will be £475,000 in the Vote of the <Col N="457" /> Department of Industry and Energy.  A sum of £186,496 has been expended to date and of the original 90 workers involved who ceased employment at present the provisions of the agreement are being applied to 88 men.  On a very crude calculation I would say that the men concerned will obtain for the rest of their lifetime payments of approximately £20 million.  They are so guaranteed under this agreement, without question. No matter how it is examined by the Attorney General of the current Government, of the immediate past Government or of the Government of the day up to 10 June 1981 the men concerned are guaranteed for their lifetime on the assumption &mdash; and I think it is a reasonable assumption &mdash; that it is highly unlikely that a suitable viable project will be set up providing the type of employment for the men concerned, and here I quote &ldquo;will be comparable in nature to the existing assembly employment&rdquo;.  There are a number of basic questions to be asked.  The date of the agreement was 10 June 1981, as I recall, the day before the general election.  Who authorised this agreement?  Was it the Government? Was it the Taoiseach?  Was it the Minister for Finance &mdash; who presumably was involved &mdash; and who issued the directions to the public servants concerned who have signed this agreement, men of senior status within the Department of the Taoiseach who presumably signed, and it is clearly stated here in the agreement, on behalf of the Taoiseach?  Why was such an agreement entered into?  These are questions which I consider &mdash; and I made the point here earlier today when I used the term committee of inquiry &mdash; warrant a tribunal of inquiry.  In fact I shall go further and say that an agreement of this nature, a unique one in the history of this State, indeed in the history of industrial relations in Europe, because I cannot find a comparable agreement anywhere in western Europe, warrants a tribunal of inquiry into the circumstances under which it was signed.  It must be remembered that in next year's vote and for the vote every year thereafter so long as the assembly workers concerned remain unemployed, they will be paid <Col N="458" /> average earnings topped up by the State over and above any normal, statutory redundancy payments, over and above any pay-related benefits in addition to basic, statutory social welfare entitlements and any holiday moneys or anything of that sort.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputy FitzGerald who raised the matter earlier wishes to raise some questions also in relation to the matter.  I think it warrants elaborate explanation on the part of the Taoiseach at least.  Most certainly these men had their absolute entitlements.  But the question now arises that every other worker on say £19,000 a year declared redundant, whether it be those in Fieldcrest or anywhere else will be seeking the same entitlement.  It is a fundamental question at the very root of Irish politics and at the root of what we have been saying here, of people entering into agreements for political purposes a day before a general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter came to my attention as Taoiseach about three weeks after the Government changed, when it was drawn to my attention that a serious industrial dispute could arise unless holiday pay were paid to the men concerned.  I asked to see the agreement under which this provision was made.  I was given a copy of the agreement, together with the Opinion of the Attorney General on it.  The Attorney General expressed astonishment that any responsible Government or public servants could have entered into an agreement of this character.  I immediately asked to see the civil servants concerned with a view to establishing how such an agreement &mdash; which involves the commitment of the State to pay a sum of the order of £30 million or upwards to 90 people over their working life &mdash; could have been entered into.  My recollection of that discussion is that two points were made to me: first, that the agreement was entered into on the direction of the Taoiseach and they had no alternative but to accept his direction; secondly, that the agreement did not in fact, as appears on the face of it, involve a definite commitment for the lifetime of the workers concerned to pay <Col N="459" /> them because it had been varied by what was described to me as an exchange of letters.</P>
      <P>I asked to see the exchange of letters. There were produced to me two letters one written to the union, one to the firm involved.  There was no reply to the letters. I asked: where was the exchange of letters?  I was told that this was the exchange of letters.  I asked: why was there no reply from the trade union to a letter which purported to vary the agreement by limiting the period over which this payment could be made and my recollection is that I was told that no reply had been expected or sought.  That was the exchange of letters purporting to limit this agreement.  I was sufficiently disturbed as to the appropriateness of the payment to say that payment of holiday money could be made only if the accounting officer of the Department of Finance took personal responsibility for the payment as being legally authorised whatever about its justification in terms of the national interest.  I understand the money was paid.  I take it that the accounting officer of the Department of Finance took responsibility for the payment being legally authorised.</P>
      <P>I found the whole matter astonishing but I found, I have to say, in the months that followed, it was but one example of many ways in which matters had been handled during the previous 18 months. I should add that the agreement itself not only states that the Government are fully confident that the IDA, who are actively engaged in finding a suitable viable project or projects will be able to set up such a project within a period of six months, but requires that if the factory is not suitable for the new project it will be located in suitable premises in the area. I was advised that this involved a legal commitment to provide employment in a factory in the area and that if it were offered anywhere else then it would not fulfil the requirements of the agreement and the £30 million odd would have to be paid out over the lifetime of the workers concerned.  The area concerned is, of course, the constituency of the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> I also raised the question of what industry was contemplated that the IDA were so certain would be provided that the Government entered into a commitment they were so certain would never arise and were willing to risk £30 million of the State's money for this purpose.  I failed to obtain from the civil servants concerned any indication of any IDA industry there was any likelihood or probability of being established.  I can only conclude from the investigations I made that there was no serious prospect of an industry and that that clause was put in without any real belief that an industry would exist.</P>
    <P>There was a provision in the agreement also for training.  It was provided that up to 16 October 1981 the workers would be given training appropriate to the employment mentioned in paragraph 1.  As there is in fact no employment mentioned in paragraph 1 because no such industry existed and was not seriously contemplated, the workers were trained for no particular purpose during this period and were paid for their training during that period.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, it transpired that the Taoiseach had written a letter to the general secretary of the union saying that the workers, in addition to being entitled to this money, were entitled to supplementary benefit during the period of the dispute, something not contemplated by the agreement and, I understand, not contemplated by the discussions nor anticipated by the trade union or by the workers.  By that mischievous act of sending that letter the Taoiseach added to the burden the State had to carry in this particular matter.</P>
    <P>Those are the facts so far as I can recall them accurately.  I hope I am doing so.  I have done everything I can to jog my memory of the matter in respect of the discussion, which I found traumatic at the time.  It was indeed one of the traumatic experiences I had on entering Government to discover that this State had been run in this manner during the previous 18 months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> Deputy FitzGerald's cloak of self-righteousness surrounds him but the simple fact of the matter is that he had an opportunity when in government, as Taoiseach, to deal with this agreement as he saw fit.</P>
    <P>The record is quite clear that in December last, when the payment from the employment guarantee fund ended under the agreement the Government of the day, under Deputy FitzGerald, sought the advice of the Attorney General. He told them he was doubtful whether the agreement was legally binding. Deputy FitzGerald's Government took a decision to end the agreement and, within three hours changed their mind and decided to go ahead with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that Deputy L'Estrange has to come in here barracking proves that my points are getting home.  As I explained today we agreed to <Col N="462" /> the proposals put forward by the trade union congress in order to obviate one of the most serious confrontations in industrial relations the country has ever seen. The fact that it was so serious is evidenced by the fact that the Coalition Government programme specifically included a statement to the effect that &ldquo;Recent legal decisions have placed the status of picketing procedure in doubt.  Full legal protection will be given to ICTU arrangements for all our pickets.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was included in the Coalition Government's programme underlining what I am saying that this was a very serious development in industrial relations. By painstaking negotiations and by securing commonsense all round we avoided that confrontation and the agreement emerged.</P>
      <P>The simple fact of the matter is that the Coalition Government maintained the agreement even though their Attorney General advised them that it was not legally binding on them because they saw, as we did, that the alternative was industrial chaos.</P>
      <P>I can only conclude from the fact that Deputy Desmond and Deputy FitzGerald are raising this matter now that they are doing so just to try to extract some miniscule political advantage from this situation and that the end product of their arguments is that we should have let trade union leaders and decent ordinary Irish workers go to jail.</P>

      <P>The proposals which were presented recently by the Commission seek to improve the organisation of the various inspections and formalities which affect the carriage of goods between member states.  They are expressed as a global approach to facilitating the free movement of passengers and goods across all the internal frontiers in the Community.</P>
      <P>As there are implications for other Departments concerned with border crossings (e.g. Customs, Health, Environment, Agriculture) detailed consideration will be required before I am in a position to say definitely what effect these proposals could have on goods traffic arrangements between both parts of Ireland or in our dealings with other member states.</P>
      <P>I can say that both the Irish and United Kingdom customs administrations already adopt a joint approach to facilitation of goods traffic across the land frontier, and it appears at first sight that existing customs procedures correspond closely to what the draft directive contemplates.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to be afforded an opportunity to clarify this issue for the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The position is that Annascaul Community Care Company was not among the applicant groups selected by the former Minister of State for Capital Grant assistance under the community, youth, recreational and employment programme.</P>
      <P>However, in a letter of 2 March 1982, to the Secretary of Annascaul Community Care Company, the former Minister of State announced that he was prepared to approve them for a grant under the Department's youth employment scheme.  This scheme is completely independent of the Department's capital grant programme &mdash; the community, youth, recreational and employment programme &mdash; and is operated on entirely different lines.  In the course of his letter the former Minister of State did not refer to the fact that he had not selected this application for capital grant assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> In view of this decision, my Department wrote to Annascaul Community Care Company on 18 March 1982 stating that their application for capital grant assistance could not be acceded to and enclosing the necessary data for application under the temporary grant scheme for youth employment.  To date the necessary completed application form for assistance under this scheme has not been returned by this group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 868 and 869 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 1981 the committee of St. Mary's Community Centre made application for capital grant assistance towards the cost of development works at the centre, under the community, youth, recreational and employment programme. This application was not among those selected for capital grant assistance by the former Minister of State who committed the entire sum of money allocated <Col N="337" /> to my Department for the purposes of this programme.</P>
    <P>The former Minister of State did however announce in a letter of 2 March 1982, to the committee that he was prepared to approve a grant under the Department's youth employment scheme, although the appropriate application and data for consideration under this scheme had not been submitted to my Department.  In view of this decision my Department wrote to the local organisers on 16 March 1982, stating that it was not possible to accede to their application for capital grant assistance and enclosing the necessary documents for application under the temporary grant scheme for youth employment.  They were invited to make application for grant aid under this scheme if it was considered appropriate to their needs.</P>
    <P>An application for assistance, under my Department's temporary grant scheme for youth employment, was received in respect of St. Nathy's Community Centre in May of this year.  Following consideration of this application in my Department, I am pleased to say that a grant of £12,250 has now been approved in this case to provide employment for five young workers and a supervisor for 25 weeks.  This figure includes a sum of £1,500 for materials and £1,000 for craftwork.  The committee are being informed to this effect.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the great efforts being made by numerous community, youth and sport groups throughout the country to provide recreational facilities which was evidenced by the fact that almost 700 applications for capital grant assistance were received in 1981 under the community, youth, recreational and employment programme.  However, as the entire sum of money most recently allocated to my Department for the purpose of providing capital grant assistance in support of community initiatives for the provision of recreational facilities was allocated by the former Minister of State, I am not in a position to consider requests for grants of this nature at the present time.  Should further moneys be placed at my disposal for such purposes <Col N="338" /> in the future my Department will consider all applications on their merits.</P>

      <P>Following a dental examination in January last the name of the child in question was placed on the Eastern Health Board's waiting list for orthodontic treatment. The child is due to be examined in September-October next by the health board's visiting orthodontic specialist who will assess the gravity of the orthodontic condition.  If the condition is assessed as being suitable for treatment by the principal dental surgeon at the Finglas clinic then the child can receive treatment fairly quickly.  If, however, the condition is a complicated one requiring the services of a specialist orthodontist then the treatment will have to be carried out at the Dublin Dental Hospital.  At present there is a long waiting list for treatment at the Dublin Dental Hospital and it is not possible to say when the child's treatment might commence.</P>
      <P>Five new posts of consultant orthodontist have been approved for the public dental service and one of these posts is in the Eastern Health Board.  I am hopeful that it will be possible to proceed with the filling of these posts soon and this should greatly reduce the waiting time for orthodontic treatment.</P>

      <P>It has long been accepted that noise of excessive level and duration can cause damage to hearing.</P>
      <P>Apart from the physical damage which may be attributed to it, such noise is distressing and is not conducive to good health in general.  Persons at greatest risk are the operators of the amplification equipment and also people employed in such establishments who, by the nature of the work, are exposed above an ordinary level.  This may only become evident when permanent damage has already been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> High volume sound is a popular feature at modern entertainment.  The most effective way of dealing with it would seem to be through the encouragement of a wider public appreciation of the dangers involved together with, if feasible, the introduction of controls for the protection of the workers involved.  I will be pursuing this matter in consultation with the Health Education Bureau and the Minister for Labour.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for a qualification certificate on 20 January 1982 and he stated in his application form that he had made a previous application for this certificate.

      <P>Requirements in relation to the storage of petroleum are contained in the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, under which the Minister for <Col N="351" /> Labour is the appropriate Minister, and in regulations made by him under that Act.  The Act generally provides that no person shall have petroleum-spirit in his possession or under his control except in a store licensed by the appropriate authority.  Licensing functions under the Act in the County Dublin area are carried out by Dublin Corporation on behalf of Dublin County Council and I have no direct function in the matter.  I have, however, made inquiries of Dublin Corporation and I am informed that applications for licences for the storage of petroleum have been sought by approximately 300 applicants in Dublin city and approximately 100 applicants in Dublin county.  The Corporation has also indicated that difficulties are being experienced in the processing of these applications due to a shortage of fire prevention staff.  It is hoped that this situation may be improved as a result of recent competitions held by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  I may add that there are no proposals before me in regard to staff.</P>

    <P>I should add that the bulk of the timber is sold by tender and prices inevitably vary, mainly as a result of market forces and harvesting-processing costs.  Moreover, sales of sawlog &mdash; especially large sawlog &mdash; are effected by such factors as competition from comparable imported timber and outlets available to purchasers for disposal of sawmill residues.</P>

    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current strength at these stations is the maximum that can be provided at present having regard to overall resources and other demands on Garda services.  However, a substantial number of extra gardaí are being recruited this year and, while the precise locations to which they will be allocated have not, as yet, been decided, it can be taken that the police needs of the stations in question will be considered when the additional manpower is available for assignment to the various centres.</P>
