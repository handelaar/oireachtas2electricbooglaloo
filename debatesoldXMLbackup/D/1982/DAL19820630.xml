      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 3, 12 (resumed), 13, 5 and 16; business will be interrupted at 12 noon to take Nos. 5 and 16.  Private Members' Business from 7 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. will be item No. 30 (resumed).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister means is that he is in a hurry to enact legislation that will force companies to buy products they do not want to buy or at a price which they think is too high.  What is the urgency about this legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hegarty who is sitting beside the Deputy probably could inform him of the situation.  Deputy Kelly <Col N="270" /> should be well aware that the previous Government took a decision in principle to buy the Whitegate oil refinery and this was finalised by this Government.  The refinery will be ready to come on-stream in August and that is the reason for the legislation.</P>

    <P>As Deputies are aware, some weeks ago we debated an expediency motion and a similar motion was debated in the Seanad.  This motion is purely a formality to establish the select committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the terms of the motion that it is likely that a representative of The Workers Party or the Independents will not be able to participate in this Committee because of the numbers involved.  I understand from the Journal Office that it would be necessary to have 13 members on the committee to enable a representative of The Workers Party and the Independents to take part. This committee is most important and I do not think we should be excluded.  I ask the Minister if the position is as I set out <Col N="276" /> and, if so, will he extend the numbers on the committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The membership is normally a matter for the Whips to arrange between them but in view of the question raised by the Deputy I will examine what can be done in the circumstances. I am sorry I cannot give the Deputy an immediate answer but I will certainly consider the point raised by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last Dáil this problem arose and in one of two cases the Government &mdash; in fact my party &mdash; ceded one of our places on the committee to enable the Independent group to be represented.  The precedent is there and the Minister will find it.  The Minister will have no difficulty in making arrangements to have one of the Fianna Fáil places given to Sinn Féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can rest assured of our good disposition towards the request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Waterford) Mr. Gallagher (Waterford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> In view of the Minister's answer and considering that he is favourably disposed towards our request, how soon may we anticipate a reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will look into the matter immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach in view of recent publicity attached to Údarás na Gaeltachta&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not on the Order of Business.  We are dealing now with item No. 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Then my question may more appropriately be directed to the Minister for Finance.  In view of the recent publicity surrounding Údarás na Gaeltachta, would it not be more appropriate to move them from Schedule B to Schedule A?  I think this would answer a number of the questions that are exercising the public mind in relation to this body.  That is within item No. 1.  The <Col N="277" /> Minister has said it is a formality that this be accepted.  I am suggesting that in view of recent events it is important that an tÚdarás be moved from Schedule B to Schedule A.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it was a formality simply because this was debated a few weeks ago, as was a similar motion debated in the Seanad.  Probably that was the more appropriate time for a debate on the placing of certain companies in the schedules.  The position is that the expediency motion has been passed by both Houses and out of the formal motion establishing the committee the Dáil committee is now before us.  I suggest to the Deputy that Members will have an ample opportunity in that committee to enable them to consider what changes they wish to make in regard to Údarás na Gaeltachta or any other body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem with regard to parts (1) and (2) of the motion. The Minister will note that it is possible to include in the terms of examination of the committee bodies that are not primarily trading or commercial if they are in the second schedule.  The committee will be empowered to examine the trading and/or commercial aspects and overall operational results which might well include matters that have nothing to do with commercial considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This means that this body could be extended to include bodies that are wholly non-commercial within the terms of paragraph (1) but paragraph (2), which is the part of the resolution which actually allows them to add additional bodies, refers solely to bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities.  The reason I am raising this is that my party and I feel that there should be an examination of State-sponsored bodies that are not commercial. Commercial bodies governed by the discipline of profit and loss, as all these bodies are, at least in theory, have already some check on them but State-sponsored bodies which are non-commercial and have no discipline of profit and loss and simply receive money each year from the Exchequer, are even more <Col N="278" /> suitable subjects for an inquiry of this sort than those that are already included.</P>
    <P>In view of the somewhat ambiguous terms of the resolution I would like to have clarification from the Minister and the Government as to his and their intentions in regard to either a similar, parallel examination of non-commercial bodies or, alternatively, extending the remit of this committee to include non-commercial bodies.  I would like to ask the Minister his intentions in the matter and if he is in favour of the idea of having a similar inquiry in respect of non-commercial bodies.  At the last count, I think there were approximately 60 non-commercial State bodies spending between them almost £800 million on behalf of Government Departments which, because they are State-sponsored bodies, may not be the subject of parliamentary questions in this House.  There should be some alternative means of inquiry into their activities, particularly when they are spending such large sums of money.  Would the Minister consider either extending this committee to include non-commercial bodies or, alternatively, setting up a parallel committee to look at non-commercial bodies?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the establishment of this committee, I take the point raised by the Deputy which refers to commercial State bodies.  With regard to non-commercial State bodies, obviously consideration will be given as to whether it would be desirable, possible or advisable to establish such a committee. This committee relates to non-commercial State bodies and the expediency motion was passed by the Dáil and the Seanad.  I am quite prepared to examine the Deputy's request with regard to non-commercial State bodies, without any commitment at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should direct my next question to the Taoiseach.  Could he say when the Government might consider making a decision on whether a committee should be set up to examine non-commercial bodies?  All sides of the House agree on the desirability of such an inquiry.  I should like the Taoiseach to <Col N="279" /> indicate his personal interest in the matter in a constructive, non-partisan way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister concerned, naturally, that these powers of investigation should be extended as much as we can cope with. I suggest to the Deputy that the best thing is to get this committee set up, get it operating and then perhaps we could have an inter-party discussion as to the next step we would take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not really need to set up this committee to see how it works to decide whether we will have a similar committee on non-commercial bodies.  We already have extensive experience of how this committee works and we have all the material evidence available to make a decision about having a similar, parallel committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We should put this committee into operation and then have a further discussion on the matter.</P>

      <P>Last month there was a by-election in Dublin West.  During the course of that by-election promises were made, which if granted, would cost around £30 million.  These promises include the provision of eight or nine schools, an Irish college in Inchicore, the building of certain roadways and a community centre in Ballyfermot.  All our inquiries showed that there were no funds available to meet these promises.  When I raised the matter in the Dail subsequently by way of a question to the Taoiseach the Government seemed to be ashamed to furnish details of the costings of these promises.  In fairness, I should say the Taoiseach was not there and the question was dealt with by the Minister for Agriculture.  Now that we are moving the writ for another by-election caused by the death of the late lamented Deputy Callanan, I would like seriously to suggest to the Government that it debases the political process when a Government indulges in this type of election activity. On the day I had the question down to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture, apart from refusing to furnish any details of the cost of these extravagant promises, seemed to indicate that promises which were made were not going to be met&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not think it is in the interests of democracy that we should have a repetition in Galway of the type of approach adopted by the Government in Dublin West.  I saw questions on the Order Paper in the name of Deputy Molloy which seemed to indicate a message of the same kind.  I urge the Government not to repeat in Galway the type of political exercise they engaged in in Dublin West.  It can only lead to total cynicism on the part of the electorate.</P>

I suggest to him that we fight the by-election in East Galway and that we discuss these issues down there in front of the people. I should also like to say that this Party and this Government are prepared to go before the people when a by-election arises and are not prepared to skulk behind a majority in this House to avoid going before the people, as the Fine Gael Party did in the case of Cavan-Monaghan. I was very interested&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In connection with this motion before us I was very interested to hear Deputy FitzGerald say recently, or rather a report in the press as his having said recently, that he believes that by-elections should be held as soon as possible. I would be very interested to know where the change came on the road to Damascus between his attitude in regard to this by-election and his attitude in regard to the Cavan-Monaghan by-election last <Col N="282" /> year.  I would be interested to hear an explanation in regard to that factor.  But, as regards promises to the electorate, I believe that the Fine Gael Party, rather than making those sorts of unfounded allegations against this Government, should hang their heads in shame because of the fact that, in an unworthy power grab here in this House on the Finance Bill, they were prepared to throw the finances of this country into complete and utter chaos.</P>

When he goes to East Galway one of the issues he might care to discuss at the chapel gates is how he managed to convince his colleagues to spend £400,000 of State money in the past fortnight in the purchase of Tulira Castle.  It would be interesting to know &mdash; and the electorate of South Galway and East Galway in particular would be interested to know &mdash; whether or not there was a valuation by the Valuation Office of the lands in question, whether it was up for public auction, that nothing more than, at maximum, £200,000 was available on offer, and that the Taoiseach found it fit to convince his colleagues to spend £400,000 on the purchase of the 285 acres concerned?

The Government have the matter under consideration. The Government have also asked the Valuation Office for a valuation of the property, which is in accordance with normal procedure.  No more or no less than that has happened.  We are sick and tired of people raising such issues for the purpose of smearing the Taoiseach and members of this Government and party by those who, as I said last week, can do nothing but speak <i>ex cathedra</i> on everything. They are infallible, they have never done anything wrong.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe rightly raised the point in relation to the attitude of the people to this House.  Many commentators have given their points of view in relation to that matter.  If there is disillusionment among the people in relation to the activities of this House it is because of the attitude of members of the Fine Gael Party.  The time has come for the people to be made fully aware of the activities of that party.  In relation to every single thing under the sun&mdash;let it be Tulira Castle, Údarás na Gaeltachta or anything else&mdash;this party, Fine Gael, speak <i>ex cathedra</i>.  Nobody else knows anything contrary to what is being said by the Fine Gael Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention of intervening until I heard the points made by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education. The Taoiseach seemed to resent a mis-statement, as he put it, by Deputy Desmond in regard to Tulira Castle.  I should like to remind the Taoiseach that I put down a question on the subject of Tulira Castle, possibly even before the death of Deputy Callanan.  I was not concerned with the rights and wrongs of the proposed purchase but rather with the procedure, which appeared to be following an all too familiar pattern whereby decisions of this kind were made in his familiar Olympian way by the Taoiseach asking if it was correct, as reported in the papers, that he personally was &ldquo;favourably disposed&rdquo; to the acquisition of this castle.  That question, had it been taken by the Taoiseach, would have been answered yesterday, but he chose not to take the opportunity to correct the mis-statement which from what he now says, was obviously implicit in my question and he passed the question to the Minister for Finance, who will find it at No. 88 on today's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="294" /> That pattern of behaviour of passing on questions which it does not suit him to answer is also unhappily familiar, but it is not the case that it is Deputy Desmond's fault if he is under a misapprehension about this.  Ever since that question was put down the Taoiseach has had an opportunity to speak and explain what his part has been in the matter of Tulira Castle.</P>
    <P>My second point arises from the statement by the Minister for Education that not one halfpenny of State money would be spent on schools in the Dublin West constituency in consequence of anything said from his side during the by-election campaign.  I imagine the people of Dublin West would have been surprised to have had that assurance three weeks ago.  The night before that by-election I was at a meeting in a hall in Inchicore organised by a group interested in providing facilities for an Irish language school.  It was addressed by the Minister for the Gaeltacht; and I am sorry to offend him by saying that I have never heard as nauseous a performance from a Minister as he delivered that night.  In a low, trilling voice he whispered endearments into the ear of the Irish language, in which no one ever knew him to have any interest until he became Minister for the Gaeltacht a few months ago.  He promised the people that after consultation not only with the Minister for Education but also with the Taoiseach, who was daily on his tail to inquire what headway was being made on this matter, this school would now go ahead.  All obstacles would be swept aside, the land would be acquired and the school would be erected.  Naturally, the unfortunate, duped and bewildered people gave a hearty round of applause to the Minister, and they were encouraged by hatchet men among themselves, skilfully planted, to rise, propose, second and pass a resolution that everyone present would vote the following day for Mrs. Lemass.  Witness to that episode can be borne by Deputies Jim Mitchell, Dinny McGinley and Paddy O'Toole who were present.  I have never seen such a slimy performance, and we never want to see that sort of thing again in a by-election or in a general election.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> If the Minister for Education has the nerve to assert that not a halfpenny will be allotted for extra schools on account of anything said last month in Dublin West, I want him to put on record in this House that if he has occasion to present a Supplementary Estimate during the rest of this year not one halfpenny of the money will be traceable or trackable to anything in the parishes of Inchicore. Ballyfermot or points west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to intervene in this debate.  I share very much the sentiments expressed by Deputy O'Sullivan in his intervention. While sitting here looking and listening, the reason for this debate here this morning struck me very forcibly.  It is because there is nothing else which divides the people in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. Deputy Kelly is quite correct in that assessment.  When there is no fundamental difference, in political, economic or social terms, between the two major parties, it is inevitable that a debate will deteriorate into the kind we have heard this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly, Fianna Fáil have been totally irresponsible in the management of this country's financial affairs.  I believe sincerely that they have done irreparable damage to the future of the country and, in particular, of its children.  As far as the political scene is concerned, what is wrong is that we have not matured politically as a country.  We have put down the guns, but the two major parties are still fighting a Civil War.  Because there is no fundamental difference between them, there has been no political advancement.  It has been retarded by the sad incident which took place about 60 years ago.  People must realise that there is a right and a left&mdash;some on the right being extreme and some a little more centre&mdash;to political, economic and social issues and that there is a left approach to these issues, a socialist approach.  A look at the other European countries will show that, though they are not in full health, they are very healthy by comparison with us.  That is because they recognise that there are two distinctly different ways of <Col N="296" /> approaching these issues.  We have not realised that.</P>
    <P>We are talking about personal assassination. This is a substitute for real politics, because we have no real politics. The Irish electorate had better wake up to that fact very quickly.  Character assassination does not come just from this side of the House, it comes from within Fianna Fáil's own party at times.  Sniping is going on, engendered not for the good of the country, although I did hope at one stage that it was, but by animosities and rivalries within parties, differences which could be kept within bounds.</P>
    <P>I supported a public statement by a former Tánaiste about three of four weeks ago because I thought it in the national interest to do so.  However, many people on the Government side are telling the people week after week that the policies being pursued by the Fianna Fáil Party are extremely detrimental, to say the least, to the best interest of this country, but when the division bell rings, they walk into those lobbies.  They must have political hernia by now, wondering which side they are on.  That must stop.</P>
    <P>There are serious economic issues before us, but they can be solved if serious political thought is given to them by the politicians and particularly by our electorate.  A man's personality is not important, whether he is a glad-hander, slapping people on the back, shaking people's hands, kissing the babies and chatting up the women.  Those things are not important.  We must mature as a country and realise that what is really important are the policies to be pursued in the future and advocated by the different parties.  Until we reach that day, the kind of debate which we have had for the last hour will continue as a substitute for real politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach or Tánaiste confirm a report in a Sunday newspaper over the weekend that the Galway East by-election would by used for the launching of an economic plan? Given the Taoiseach's record in this area of policy&mdash;the Department in relation to economic planning and development which is desperately important for the <Col N="297" /> future of the country &mdash; would he now assure the House that during the by-election campaign important measures such as this will not be used as a campaign gimmick?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why there is a great rush for a by-election at this stage.  I am quite sure that the former Deputy, the late Johnnie Callanan, would never have wished his seat to have been filled as rapidly as is now proposed. Most of us would agree that by-elections are a good thing during the term of any Dáil and are a barometer.  However, we have had the movement of that barometer within the last few weeks.  The Taoiseach would have been well advised to let this seat remain vacant at least for the summer.  There are precedents for seats being left vacant for almost a year. Deputy O'Kennedy's seat was vacant for a considerable time when he went to Europe.  If we looked at the records we could find many more examples of this. However, the Taoiseach and his Government have seen fit to test the electorate in East Galway and I suppose the House will give its consent to that today, spoiling the holidays of many Deputies who have worked so hard and have been rigidly held in this House over the last few weeks.  However, I suppose that is the life of a politician and we must live with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Cluskey, I too, wonder why we had this debate this morning, which has turned into something like an Adjournment debate.  I have assessed the position somewhat differently from Deputy Cluskey.  The development of this kind of debate has come because there are very many issues which the Government should be tackling and have failed to tackle.  We would appear to have a caretaker Government who are prepared to sit back, do their public relations bit, but no real work.  If we were to look through the records of previous debates on the moving of writs, I doubt if we would find any as lengthy as today's.  That has happened this morning because Deputies, not only on this side of the House but on the other side&mdash;as Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out this was seen here last night&mdash;are frustrated at the performance, <Col N="298" /> or lack of performance, of the Government.</P>
    <P>I hope that some good will come from the moving of this writ.  I speak particularly to the Minister for Education who has, unfortunately, left the House.  I am sure, however, that he will get the message. Because of that Minister's directive to the VECs and community schools throughout the country, no appointment of teachers is now taking place.  This may not be so serious where ordinary teaching posts are involved, but it is quite serious when new schools are being set up as are a number this year &mdash; six or eight in County Dublin.  We in County Dublin find ourselves in the position of having held interviews, agreed on a candidate, who is also agreed on by the school board, but we cannot appoint that candidate.  This is a most serious situation where a new school is to open in September and the principal is appointed.  He cannot, however, give notice to his present school or take up his new position.  The new school is to be opened in September, the children have been enrolled, the board of management set up, but no principal appointed.  It is important that principals of new schools should be appointed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to contribute briefly to the debate.  I do not want to delay the House.  I was impressed by the remarks of Deputy Cluskey who restored a certain amount of sanity to the House, which had become necessary.  As a Donegal Deputy I should like to put on record that during the Donegal by-election we had what could be described as a devolution of authority from the central seat of Government to County Donegal: the entire Cabinet and all the junior Ministers were there for three weeks under the stewardship of the Taoiseach personally and the Minister for the Environment. We had the spectacle of the Minister for Health going around the county tearing up Dunlop tyres at an awful rate opening extensions to hospitals and community units.  We had the Minister for the Environment making promises about building houses in Donegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want an assurance that the tactics employed in Donegal will not be repeated in East Galway.  Only a fortnight ago a young woman came to me and said: &ldquo;When will my cottage be built&rdquo;?  That cottage was advertised during the by-election in County Donegal.  To add insult to injury, on the reverse side of the paper carrying the advertisement was a photograph of the Fianna Fáil candidate with the caption &ldquo;Vote Fianna Fáil for Prosperity&rdquo;.  That house has not been built.  At that time, 250 houses were advertised.  They were re-advertised last week in the Donegal newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, we had the spectacle of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs going around with a spade in his hand turning sods for automatic telephone exchanges in County Donegal.  Some of them have not been opened yet.  We had promises from the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry about piers and harbours that would be attended to.  A trowel has not been <Col N="300" /> used on them yet.  We had the Taoiseach talking about cross-Border trade and traffic and about a cross-Border study between Donegal and Derry.  No money has been spent on that.  We had the then Minister for Education, Deputy Wilson, going around promising extensions to schools.  There was not a national school in County Donegal that did not want an additional classroom.</P>

      <P>The vacancy we are about to contest in Galway arises from the passing of the late John Callanan. Many of us admired his independence of spirit and the manner in which he epitomised service to the people.  As far as I am aware there is a long tradition in the House that we would have a certain amount of respect for the families of the people involved in terms of the length of time that would be allowed to pass before the writs were moved.  The haste in this case, as far as I can gather, is unprecedented. Therefore, I ask whether at least the courtesy of consulting the Callanan family was followed before taking this decision.  That should have been done <Col N="301" /> and I hope it was.  After all, we are about to try to fill the vacancy caused by the death of one of our colleagues who worked hard for people of all political persuasions in his constituency, and I suggest that any action we will take should not besmirch his record or cause any worry to his family.</P>

      <P>On the last point raised by Deputy Keating I assure Deputy Keating and the country that he need not have any fears whatsoever.  The Fianna Fáil Taoiseach and Party did the honourable and decent thing with regard to the feelings of the family of the late John Callanan, a man whose contribution to this nation, in debates here and in his work at local authority level, is something we are all proud of, proud that he was a member of this party.  This matter was not only discussed with the Callanan family, but Mrs. Callanan said that in the national interest the by-election should proceed as soon as possible, as Deputy Callanan himself would have wanted. That is what we would expect from the Callanan family.</P>
      <P>We have had here this morning a disgraceful debate, with the continuing smear and innuendo that we have had from that side of the House for some time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for raising the specific questions relating to the property concerned was that in <i>The Irish Times</i> there was a report by Michael Finlan &mdash; I have a copy of the report before me &mdash; about a specific statement by the Government spokesman to the effect that the Taoiseach was favourably considering that the State acquire Tulira Castle in south County Galway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proper that any Member of the House should ask pointed specific questions relating to issues, for example in respect of the Valuation <Col N="304" /> Office and, more particularly, when the State has indicated a favourable prospect of acquisition.  I will continue to raise those questions here and I want to serve notice to those on the Government back benches, and the Fianna Fáil Party, that I will never be motivated in any way by a personal imputation against the Taoiseach or any other member of his Cabinet. We have got to get away from this business in Leinster House that when questions relating to State money, the acquisition of properties, planning permissions, development plans and a whole range of serious national issues are raised there will automatically be a cry that this is a personal attack.  It is not personal and I would not waste my time in Leinster House trying to be personal on those issues.  If the State wishes to acquire property I want to see acquisition carried out properly, effectively and on a net balance of advantage.  If it is not proper I will oppose it vehemently in the House.  That is my explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to contribute my personal observations by way of a reply to what Deputy Desmond said.  In fact, I accept that Deputy Desmond did not intend any personal imputation against me and that he was asking questions which this side of the House would have to accept were legitimate.  If there is a question of the State purchasing property then any such purchase should go through the normal channels and the Government should be answerable to this House for any decision to purchase any property.  That is the way we have always done our business and that is the way we intend to continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have indicated to a few people who have asked me that I would be favourably disposed towards the purchase of this property.  In fact, I am favourably disposed towards the purchase by the State of any such properties coming on the market if we can afford them and if they can be secured on the right terms.  I believe that attitude was shared by the previous Government.  We had the case recently of Adare Manor coming on the market and this Government, and I believe the previous Government, looked as favourably <Col N="305" /> as they could at the possibility of acquiring that property for the people of the country, for the State.  I am very much influenced in all this by something that took place in my own area some time ago.  I will give full credit to Dublin County Council, and the Chairman at the time, Deputy Boland, for what happened there.  We had a very beautiful historical piece of property in Malahide, Malahide Castle, and Dublin County Council in an act of unprecedented foresight and maturity &mdash; I said this several times in public &mdash; purchased Malahide Castle for the people of the country and, in particular, for the people of Dublin.  In my view that was one of the most important things that has happened in the area of local government for a long time.  Already the local authority, the people of the community and the Government have reaped enormous benefits from the purchase of that estate by Dublin County Council.  I am very much influenced by the beneficial results which have flowed from that decision to acquire Malahide Castle for public purposes in my approach to any other properties of this sort that come on the market and which are offered under one set of conditions or another to the State for acquisition.</P>

      <P>Provided the price is right, provided the proper procedures are gone through and provided, as Deputy Desmond said, that the balance of advantage is in favour of the State and the people.  We have &mdash; I think the last Government faced this issue also &mdash; a continuing situation arising in regard to such properties.  Increasingly these types of fine historic old properties are coming on the market and being offered to the State.  So far we have not evolved any consistent policy in regard to their acquisition by the State or local authorities nor do I think had the previous Government. In the interests of the nation, the future and the benefit to people in local areas we should try to evolve a consistent policy in regard to that.  I want to assure the House, and Deputy Desmond since he <Col N="306" /> raised these matters, that the procedures will be proper, accounting and valuation procedures will be gone through, and the decisions taken will be in the best interests of the country and the people in the area.  Those decisions will be brought before the House, if necessary, and explained and defended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I made the point that the company which is now 50 years old was established for the purpose of supplying sugar.  There was also the social aspect taken into consideration in regard to the location of some of the factories.  In spite of all the problems encountered by the company it has successfully achieved what it set out to do. It has succeeded in supplying the home market and capturing a lucrative export market in spite of the handicaps of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  We are now outside the scope of that agreement and that has disadvantages in that the company must now compete in an open market in Europe.  We are now wide open to imports from other EEC countries but because of the company's ability to produce competitively it has been able to resist that opposition.  At present we are growing in the region of 88,000 acres of sugar beet.  The target is 90,000 acres. This should be our aim in the interests of efficiency.  We need to take up our full quota for the group to be efficient.  It is a difficult operation but the company are devoting a lot of time to it at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the company was founded they got £5.5 million from the State.  The company are 50 years old and that was a pittance especially when one considers there are about 4,000 people directly employed by them.  There are up to 7,000 <Col N="307" /> people growing beet.  Taking the number of people involved in haulage and so on, the figure would be almost twice that number.  If the company made a mistake it was in endeavouring to do the impossible over the years through borrowings and so on to keep going on the kind of financing they received.  I never knew a time when the company were not short of money.  I remember when financial commitments were such that they hampered the operation.</P>
    <P>When the company set up Erin Foods they were expected to build a completely new industry with its own infrastructure, skills and factories out of the profits made on sugar.  That has proved to be an impossible task.  Substantial sums are needed to pay for work which has taken place. The factories have been modernised and there has been massive new replacements of machinery and new sugar silos have been acquired.  The money has been spent on those and the company are now ready for another 50 years.  Silos or new equipment will not be needed next year.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out yesterday, when we look at the size of French and Danish factories and the advantages they have, we are at a disadvantage in trying to compete with them.  There are large quantities of beet processed daily through those plants.  They also have an advantage from a grower's point of view. Larger amounts of beet are grown there per farmer than there are here.  We have a large number of small growers.  I like it this way but, from the company's point of view, it is a more costly operation to service.</P>
    <P>Over the years when money was scarce in farming, the company helped to finance the crop.  They gave good credit terms to the farming community in regard to fertilisers, seed and so on.  This must be appreciated.  There was many a small farmer who would not be considered by the banks or lending institutions because of the size of his operation.  He was a welcome customer at the doors of the company.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that Erin Foods were a drag on the funding of the company.  While they have been a cost I <Col N="308" /> should not like the impression to go out that they should not have been established. If Erin Foods had been properly funded initially, been given their own terms of reference and were not tied into the sugar group, this would have gone ahead more rapidly.  They were held back at a crucial time when funds were badly needed.  Instead of forging ahead on to the market place we started to cut back and close down.  That was not a good idea especially in the context of what I said about food imports.</P>
    <P>We spend millions of pounds on imported foods.  The Erin brand is the only thing we can point to and say to the consumer, &ldquo;This is Irish food.  Please buy it not because it is Irish but because the price is right and it is of the best quality&rdquo;. Supermarkets do not give pride of place to Erin Food products.  I went into supermarkets in the towns where the factories are located and in other towns and failed to find these products.  Where they are to be found they are not in a prominent position.  In some cases we had to bring indirect pressure to bear on supermarkets to convince them they are not playing the game.</P>
    <P>I should like to think of Erin Foods as a company which brought new technology into agriculture.  Successful growers of fresh vegetables were given that technology free, <i>gratis</i> and for nothing from Irish Sugar Company personnel.  It costs a lot of money to train a person in AnCO. The company have provided technology for young people for nothing.  Growing for Erin Foods is a gilt edge operation. One gets a contract and is given a price. One knows in advance what one's margins will be.  Regrettably, the margins have not been as lucrative as they might have been because of the sales position. That has nothing to do with the products but with inflation and high interest rates. Our EEC counterparts are more than happy with the 10 per cent they get from the EEC whereas it is useless to our farmers. In my constituency, in parts of Carlow and Wexford and, indeed, in the west there are highly competent farmers growing vegetables.</P>

Under the cash receipts system a registered person may pay VAT in the usual two-monthly taxable period by reference to the cash received in that period irrespective of when the goods or services to which the cash refers were supplied.  Under the usual system the trader pays VAT by reference to the value of goods or services supplied in a particular taxable period irrespective of when payment for the goods is received.

In other words, that they cannot have one official receipt and another receipt which is unofficial in respect of an amount levied in cash and which is over and above the amount appearing on the official receipt.  A large number of the people who will be availing of the services <Col N="312" /> of these professional bodies will not be registered for VAT and, consequently, there will be no question of their claiming VAT back.  To put it another way, their records will not be coming back to the Revenue Commissioners by way of another person claiming VAT refunds on the payment made to the professional person.  In respect of these ordinary people who will be using the services of these lawyers, what provision will there be to prevent evasion by reason of the professional person seeking a cash payment in addition to the official fee?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(i) at any time during the year of assessment he was of the age of 65 years or upwards or if under the age of 65 years he was at any time during the year of assessment in receipt of an income less than £7,000 per annum, and,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the debate last week on this Finance Bill many references on all sides of the <Col N="314" /> House were made to the desirability of moving towards a more equitable system of taxation.  There has, of course, been no agreement as to how this should be done.  In these amendments I had hoped there would be general agreement.</P>
    <P>One of the sections in our society most in need and most deserving of income tax relief in respect of the rent they pay are those people living in private rented dwellings.  This seemed all the more desirable because the expenditure involved could be balanced by the consequent tax returns from the previously undeclared income of many of the landlords involved.  This combined approach would be a significant step in a movement towards equity.  In the context of the inadequate public financing of the local authority housing programme many thousands of families and single people are forced to accept private accommodation at exorbitant rents of £30, £40, £50 per week and more.  Such rents are being paid for rooms and very substandard accommodation.  People in poor circumstances who can least afford such rents have little alternative but to pay them. Surely they deserve income tax deductions in respect of these rents.  Equally the landlords who exploit people in this way and evade tax on a widespread scale should be made to pay their fair share of taxation.  There will never be a fair taxation system unless effective measures are taken against those who evade and refuse to pay their just share.</P>
    <P>I believe that the amendments I have put down go a little way in the direction of greater social equity by subsidising those most in need and taxing those who in many instances are guilty of major tax evasion.  The Finance Bill in section 5 already provides for tax deductions in respect of rent for tenants over the age of 65 years.  However, it would be too simplistic and very costly to do what one of the amendments&mdash;not put down by myself but by the Labour group&mdash;would seek to do, which would be to delete this reference to an age group and give the deductions to all tenants irrespective of their means.  This would assist both rich and poor and defeat the whole purpose of the exercise.  A more equitable <Col N="315" /> approach would be to attempt to define those tenants most in need of help.  This, of course, is far more difficult to achieve and explains why I have put down two alternative amendments, neither of which, I must admit, I am completely satisfied with.  The intention is to set an income ceiling of approximately £7,000 per annum which is just under the average industrial earnings.  This would seem to direct the tax concession at those in poorer circumstances.</P>
    <P>For discussion purposes I added an alternative amendment referring to taxable income, which may be a more equitable way of confining the benefits to needy tenants.  There are difficulties in both of these amendments, but I believe that the principle is correct and should be accepted.  Furthermore, section 138 (a) of the Income Tax Act refers only to married persons.  I believe there is a need for an additional amendment bringing in widows and widowers, who constitute one of the most forgotten sections of the community and who very often are in extremely insecure circumstances.  I suggest that a deduction of £500 is most inadequate in the case of widows and widowers and should be increased to £1,000.  A further amendment seeks to increase the deduction of £500 to £750 for all other persons on the basis that rent is often charged on the size or number of rooms and not on the number of persons occupying them.  In this context a deduction of £500 per annum is very small and should be increased.</P>
    <P>It is fairly easy to anticipate that the response of the Minister and perhaps even of the main Opposition party will be to say that this is a very laudable proposal but in the economic circumstances the money is not there.  I understand that it is estimated to cost £15 million this year to implement these amendments.  However, I do not accept that view because the whole basis of the amendment is that a claimant to prove entitlement must refer to the identity and address of the landlord who will then in turn be taxed on the rent he receives.  This process will provide an effective register of landlords which all other efforts to date have failed <Col N="316" /> to achieve.  The cost of the amendment could thus be offset by the income accruing to the Exchequer from the previously undeclared income of many landlords. The end result of these amendments, if they are accepted, will be a real move towards social equity.  I do not accept that there will by any significant cost involved for the reasons I have already outlined. I hope that the Minister when replying will refer specifically not just to the cost of providing the concessions but also to the amount which will be returned when the income of the landlord is taxed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to intervene more than once in the discussion on this amendment.  I should like to make a few preliminary remarks.  I very much support the principle of the amendments proposed by Deputy Gregory.  As the House is aware, since June 1981 it has been the policy of my party to introduce a tax allowance for rent payments.  We believe it is necessary to introduce a degree of fairness as between people who are buying their own houses and can claim interest as a deduction against income tax on the loan they take out for that purpose, and people who have chosen not to buy their own houses but to rent them and can get no tax allowance of any description for the rent payments they make.</P>
      <P>This has led to a situation in which the number of units of rented accommodation has been reduced over the past 30 years to half its previous level, because people are not using this means of providing accommodation for themselves. This is unsatisfactory from a number of points of view.  Obviously, rented accommodation is a more flexible type of accommodation.  It can be changed more easily than accommodation which is bought and usually retained for the person's lifetime.  As the family goes through the family cycle, accommodation needs vary.  They start off as a married couple with relatively small accommodation needs.  Then when all the children are at home they have very substantial accommodation needs.  As the children get married and leave, their accommodation needs diminish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> Under the present owner occupancy system, they are forced to have a house large enough to provide for their peak accommodation needs and which is under-utilised when a smaller number of people are occupying it.  This is not the best use of our housing stock.  Any encouragement towards the use of rented accommodation as distinct from owner occupancy, or at least putting it on an equal footing in the terms of tax advantage, would lead to better utilisation of our housing stock.  Unlimited funds are not available for the building of houses, as unlimited funds are not available for any other purpose.  Therefore, we should ensure that our tax code does not encourage under-utilisation or the excessive use of housing accommodation which cannot be fully utilised for most of its life.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory has made the social case for the amendments quite well.  I want to add the economic case which, standing on its own, might sound somewhat heartless, but it still has validity in view of our limited resources.  There is a strong economic case as well as a social case for encouraging the use of rented accommodation.  Therefore I support what Deputy Gregory's amendments seek to achieve.</P>
    <P>The Government of which I was a member were committed to the idea of extending the allowance to all people living in rented accommodation without any restriction as to age, income or otherwise. We took that view because we felt, as Deputy Gregory now feels, that substantial amounts of untapped income were going into the hands of landlords which this proposal would bring to light, and which would go a great distance towards paying for any costs the project would incur in terms of tax revenue lost. In Government we were advised that the Revenue Commissioners, whose estimates in these matters are always accurate and non-partisan, believed that the amount of revenue which would come in from tracking down evaders would not be as great as we on the outside thought it might be.</P>
    <P>They said they had undertaken a very substantial campaign in previous years to track down tax evasion by landlords, a <Col N="318" /> campaign which had been reasonably successful.  Therefore, while the additional tax evasion which would be caught would be significant, it would not come near to offsetting the cost of the allowance. In view of the additional cost and the difficult budgetary situation we faced we decided, on an experimental basis, to see how it worked, to introduce it initially for people over the age of 65 years with a view ultimately to extending it gradually to everyone as finances permitted. We took a very significant first step in extending it to people of 65 years of age and over.</P>
    <P>In his amendments Nos. 33a and 33b Deputy Gregory has put forward the logical next step, namely, to make the allowance available to people on low incomes in addition to those of 65 years of age and over.  As this is the next step we would have taken as finances permitted, I cannot have any objection to this proposal in principle.  My only concern is its cost this year, in what we all recognise as an almost disastrous financial situation.  As between his two amendments, I have a very strong preference for amendment No. 33b as against amendment No. 33a and I should like to say why.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 33a simply gives this allowance to people with an income of £7,000 a year or less, regardless of whether they are single or married with five children.  This is gross income, not taxable income.  Obviously in the hands of a single person with no liabilities, £7,000 a year is worth a lot more than it is in the hands of somebody with a wife and five children to support.  The amendment makes no distinction between family circumstances.  Deputy Gregory recognised that, and I believe that is why he put down the second amendment which has not got that objection.  It is concerned with taxable income, not with gross total income.</P>
    <P>A person with five children could earn a larger gross sum because he would have a larger number of allowances than a single person and he would have a taxable income of less than £4,500.  The single person would not have the same allowances and would have exhausted his taxable income of £4,500 at a lower gross <Col N="319" /> income.  The second amendment makes the distinction, which I believe is necessary, between the situation of a person who is married and has a number of dependants and a person who is single and has not got the same need for an allowance of this sort.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I have no problem with the principle involved in Deputy Gregory's amendments.  I prefer the amendment No. 32b scheme.  My problem is with the cost of it.  I would be glad if the Minister would give us an indication of the cost of the two amendments separately. In a sense, the cost of the second amendment would be of more interest and value as distinct from the first amendment. Could the Minister further let us know what would be the cost if section 33b were changed, say, to a taxable income of £2,000 or £1,000?  Obviously the more one reduces the taxable income figure the more one confines the number of people who can claim it and the more one has a situation where it is only the really low paid who can benefit from it. Possibly £4,500 would cost too much and would bring in more people than we could afford to bring in to this tax allowance scheme at this stage.</P>
    <P>If that is the case the Minister should not say that the whole idea should be thrown out altogether simply because it would cost too much but suggest a figure which he would be prepared to accept in cost terms, a lesser figure that would bring in a lesser number of people but would still be accepting the principle which is a good one of making this allowance available to the low paid.  I hope that we can conduct this debate in that sense in trying to find in the House a proposal that is acceptable in terms of the principle which we all accept of helping low income people with their rents. There is no question but that the Minister also accept this because if he did not he would not have introduced the section which was in my budget as well.  There is common cause between us that we should do something about the subject.  The problem is how much we can afford this year to set aside for the purpose.  The Minister might consider giving us information <Col N="320" /> as to the different costings at different levels of income which might be used for this purpose.  If he could give us that information it would be possible to reach agreement on an amendment which would be acceptable both from a social and a cost point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The substance of this section highlights a very serious inequity in our taxation system, the basic unfairness that arises as a result of the positive discrimination which our taxation system as at present constituted accords in favour of houseowners as against house tenants. A person who is buying out his house or who has a house and is trading up in the market and raising a greater mortgage for the purpose of obtaining the tax concessions that would apply to that mortgage can claim that mortgage against his income tax.  Let us consider the basic position where that person has no tax allowance and chooses to upgrade his house: he buys the house and pays his mortgage out of his taxed income.  The income tax system then allows him to make deductions of his mortgage payments against his income tax.  It was suggested in the budget statement that those allowances should be confined to the standard rate but that has been taken out of the present Bill to enable the person in that category to have the allowance at the full marginal rate of tax that that person pays.  Therefore a very substantial subsidy is accorded in the taxation system to a house owner buying his own house and more often than not to a person who is trading up and buying a more expensive house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very substantial concession. Let us first consider who is paying for that concession which is accorded to that relatively well off section of the community. It is the general body of taxpayers who pay for that concession because if that concession was not made, the shortfall in the overall taxable income would not arise.  So the general body of taxpayers have to make good that deficit in the tax they pay.  Many of those, and probably most of those who comprise the general body of the taxpayers, are people who do not own houses at all.  Yet they <Col N="321" /> are in the position in this system of having, in their tax payments, to subsidise that tax concession which is made to people trading up and buying more expensive houses.  I would go further. Many of those people might not even have the luxury of being the tenant of a house let alone own one.  Young couples, possibly with children, unable to buy a house, unable in the present economic situation even to rent a house, unable to obtain a local authority house, perhaps living in overcrowded conditions in a parent's house or the house of parents-in-law, working and having PAYE contributions deducted from their wages are having part of that tax directed towards making up a shortfall in tax revenue which arises by reason of that concession granted to the house owner and even to the house owner who is trading up into a more expensive dwelling.</P>
    <P>In this situation tax equity requires that at least the same concession should apply to a person who is renting a house as to a person who is buying one.  It follows almost as axiomatic that the person buying the house is in a stronger financial position than the person who is renting one.  So why give the concession at the full marginal rate to the person who has the house and who has even traded up, and deny the very same concession to the person who is not that well off and is compelled by reason of his circumstances to remain in rented accommodation?  On that ground alone it is a matter of basic equity.  There should be a basic principle of allowing rent in full to be claimed against income tax whether a person is under or over 65 years of age&mdash;and I cannot see the rationale of the distinction in age.  That very valuable tax concession to house owners should be extended to tenants who pay rent.  If one says that the country cannot afford that because it would be too costly I would say that that should be balanced by a <i>pro rata</i> reduction in the concession that is accorded at the other end of the economic scale, to those people who are that well off that they are buying houses or trading up to more expensive houses.  At least let there be that measure of balance introduced between those two situations.  But to <Col N="322" /> draw a distinction that favours the well off as against the less well off is a glaring and basic inequity in the tax system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a few points.  Deputy Taylor has made some points which I would have referred to and he obviously knows the scene very well.  The amendment is a good amendment because it specifies the income under which a person would benefit from the tax allowance.  I would have thought that in this kind of situation granting allowances to people possibly occupying very expensive flats would not be the thing to do.  But this is different because it specifies the taxable income.  To qualify for the benefit a person would have to name the landlord and show the amount he was paying.  This would be very interesting because for once the landlords would be identified and the amounts they were collecting would be certified.  This would be an easy way for the Revenue Commissioners to get these people to pay.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the local scene.  There are three towns in the north Cork area where I come from.  When people get married and look for accommodation, irrespective of what the landlords ask, they have to pay.  In most cases for a kitchen and another room they pay £36 a week.  In the same house, three or four young families could be living, all paying high rents.  What are the Revenue Commissioners getting from that landlord?  I believe the amount collected is infinitesimal because no record is kept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that people who occupy such accommodation are being discriminated against because people repaying a loan to a local authority or financial institution will get full benefit in their assessment for medical services. People who apply for medical cards and state they are paying £40 a week rent, are lawfully entitled to have £33 of that amount taken into account when assessing their eligibility for medical cards, but because they cannot have that amount certified, they cannot get the benefits they should.  If a tax allowance was granted to tenants of unscrupulous landlords it would be a further benefit to all <Col N="323" /> because they would identify the landlords and specify the amounts of rent charged.</P>
    <P>This amendment specifies the income under which a person would qualify.  I do not think Deputy J. Bruton's argument was very convincing.  He said he agreed with about 75 per cent of the amendment and felt that the income which would accrue to the Revenue Commissioners from collecting tax on rents paid to the landlord would balance against the cost. I disagree.  I have not done any calculations but I imagine the amount would be very substantial.  In my view, the amendment is a good one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not an exact situation of discrimination from the tax point of view between people who are purchasing their houses and those who are renting accommodation.  Deputy Taylor said people who are purchasing their houses are getting a full tax allowance. He should know that is not so. There is a restriction on the amount of interest which can be claimed &mdash; in any one year for a single person the amount is £2,400 and for a married couple £4,800.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a lot more than the amount proposed here for rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  I will make my case and then the Deputy can make his contribution.  A person purchasing a house not only pays the interest on the loan but he must repay the capital. There is no tax allowance for the capital element of the repayment.  What is being proposed here by Deputy Gregory-Independent is that the full amount of the repayments for a person renting accommodation should be allowed for tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person purchasing his own home will have more interest in keeping his house in good condition than a person renting. If we encourage more people to rent rather than purchase accommodation, the general condition of our housing stock will deteriorate.  Deputy Gregory-Independent said his amendment would increase tax revenue by reducing the amount of taxation lost through evasion. <Col N="324" /> With the passage of time the amount of tax lost through evasion in this area has diminished substantially.  Deputy J. Bruton, as former Minister for Finance, should know the facts better than any backbencher.  A few minutes ago he said he was surprised at the small amount of tax lost through evasion by landlords.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor mentioned discrimination in favour of the relatively less well off who are purchasing their own houses. Many young home owners who are barely existing could hardly be described as &ldquo;relatively well off&rdquo;.  The arguments put forward by Fine Gael, and the fact that they are supporting this amendment, seem to be strangely at variance with the oft expressed sentiments of Deputy Kelly in favour of self-reliance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock spoke about his constituents having to pay exorbitant rents. If this amendment is accepted, his constituents will have to pay even higher rents because the landlord will seek to add the element of tax he will have to pay to the rent in order to compensate for the fact that he is being taxed on the rent charged.  The question of rent control and fair rents is a different question from rent allowances for tax purposes.  In the absence of more substantial arguments from the Opposition I would be inclined to oppose the principle of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of amendments are being taken together and amendment No. 34 is in my name.  The main purpose of my amendment was to try to tease out the actual cost of global taxation relief so that I could see precisely the dimensions of any particular relief. In the short time I was in the Department of Finance I was unable to get a precise costing of giving relief across the board. Quite frankly, I was far more preoccupied at the time with mortgate interest relief which was a far bigger issue in terms of budget assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see merit in amendment No. 33b put down by Deputy Gregory.  My assessment of amendment 33a is that quite unintentionally it would give a net balance of advantage to single persons rather than to married persons or widowed <Col N="325" /> persons.  The giving of tax relief on income bands as distinct from taxable income bands is highly regressive.  I find amendment No. 33a less preferable than amendment 33b.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 33b is in accord with amendments I tabled in relation to section 1 where we attempted to improve the basic tax exemption levels.  Giving a rent concession to persons on low income who pay a relatively high rent is a progressive step and is socially equitable.  We have to examine carefully the precise costings given by the Minister.  I do not think that what is involved would be very expensive.  If there was a total exemption across the board to everybody, irrespective of general income, as was proposed in my amendment No. 34, I think we might be talking about a sum ranging from £21 million to £25 million.  I am just hitting a figure in terms of my own personal assessment and I accept that I may be wildly inaccurate because there were no tax tables available to consult on the matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 33b, we might well be talking in terms of £4 million or £5 million where it is proposed to set the level at £4,500.  At any rate, there is a wide range of imponderables in terms of assessing the cost.  I do not accept entirely Deputy Bruton's view that the yield from landlords who are not giving their rent returns would be very low.</P>

      <P>I agree the yield would be far less than is popularly assumed.  Some people think the Revenue could collect sums ranging from £80 million to £90 million but I think we might be talking of figures in the region of £10 to £12 million.  However, that is quite a substantial amount.  I share the view put forward by Deputy Sherlock.  I have constituents in Dún Laoghaire who have to pay very high rents.  In a four storey dwelling there could be five or six families paying rents ranging from £25 to £30 per week for one room and kitchen and sharing toilet and bathroom facilities.  Many <Col N="326" /> young married couples are paying such rents.  Deputy Gregory drew the analogy of a housing officer demanding rent receipts.  In Dún Laoghaire the corporation give points in respect of rent paid relative to income and we award additional points to tenants on the housing list but they must produce proof of payment. Dublin County Council do not award such points.  In any event, there is an income ceiling requirement to qualify for a house.  It is fair and reasonable that tax relief be given even while people are on the housing waiting list.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the view put forward by Deputy O'Dea that a landlord automatically would put the cost on the rent. We tabled amendment No. 41 but unfortunately it was ruled out of order.  We wanted the establishment of rent tribunals. I accept that this matter must be approached in an integrated way but I would point out that the Dáil did not introduce a system of rent tribunals despite lavish promises to do so.  This was set out in the manifestos and programmes of various political parties.  There was the notorious letter written by the Fianna Fáil Director of Elections, Senator Eoin Ryan, in the 1981 general election where, on official Fianna Fáil notepaper, there was an absolute assurance that rent tribunals would be established in the following session.  Promises have been made, particularly to backbench Deputies behind me, that there will be a system of rent tribunals but the Dáil will go into recess on Friday week and we will not come back until the end of October.  In the meantime there will be no rent tribunals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Worse than that, we have compounded the problem because as from 25 July next 25,000 or 30,000 tenants in private rented dwellings will not have any protection although I accept they may get supplementary social welfare benefits as a contribution towards their new rents.  I will give the House an example of what may happen.  Without giving any names, in Blackrock there are six or seven houses privately owned that were covered by the regulations.  The tenancies were protected. However, the landlord has informed the tenants that from 1 August <Col N="327" /> they will have to pay between £140 and £180 per month.  I cannot imagine that the Minister for Social Welfare will produce a massive subsidy for such tenants. Under the new regulations he may give a subsidy of £25 per month but I have no doubt that the tenants will be faced with a very heavy financial burden.  Many thousands of people in protected tenancies will have to pay massive increases in rent but they will not get any tax relief on the increases.  That will apply to 30,000 people.  In this year's budget the State has provided approximately £6,500,000 to give an element of subsidy to such tenants but they will experience great hardship in meeting the enormous rents that will be demanded.  People in that position, particularly those on low income, deserve a minimum of tax relief and that is why I favour it.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Taylor, has drawn attention to the exceptionally favoured position of some people.  I happen to be one of those who had the good fortune or foresight to buy their own dwellings.  In 1964, I bought a four-bedroom dwelling for £3,600.  Repayments are currently about £6 per week and I own the dwelling.  The dwelling has appreciated over a period to £40,000.  I have also received rates remission on it and mortgage interest relief.  I am in an extraordinarily favoured position relative to people down the road from me who are renting a similar dwelling for £240 per month and getting no tax relief.  There is an imbalance in favour of the private landlord and the introduction of tax relief is fair and reasonable.  Amendment No. 33b is a reasonable amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister may work himself into a political panic on the basis that the Finance Bill might be amended.  So what? It may cost £6 or £7 million in terms of the State having set aside that amount for tenants of private rented dwellings.  But the Minister should have set aside about £14 million because, when all the judgments come down from the courts, there is going to be a terrible crucifixion of tenants in private rented dwellings.  If the <Col N="328" /> Minister accepts a particular amendment, so be it.  That is the wish of the House and I do not think it will essentially destroy the integrity of the budget, provided Deputies behave in a responsible manner in terms of introducing amendments and provided that we do not regard the Finance Bill as a Dutch auction.  I am sure no Deputy thinks that, if the Minister accepted one amendment, many more could be tabled.  That would be quite untenable and the very antithesis of attempting to get a Finance Bill through the House.  The Labour Party favours 33b on balance.  We have not heard from the Minister as to the relative costs and I would be glad to have that information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to Deputy O'Dea's comments on amendment No. 34 in reply to previous speakers. I suppose it is only natural that Deputy O'Dea, being a landlord, has considerable experience of letting accommodation and that he would make the case for landlords.  My amendment was intended to relieve hardship in cases of distress in rented accommodation.  There is an obvious need for a rents tribunal because too often tenants are at the mercy of market rents.  The whole question of market rents has gathered strength but the concept of a fair rent has not been underlined to the same degree. Of course there is much tax evasion in this area by landlords.  I have experience of this tax evasion in Limerick because there has been a big influx of students into the city with the setting up of NIHE. Deputy O'Dea must be aware of that because his previous employment was in that institution.  The city was not geared to provide accommodation for all these people.  There was also an influx of workers with the setting up of the Alumina project on the Shannon Estuary and it was an El Dorado for speculators.  It is common to see houses being turned into flats and sitting tenants dumped out on the street in a cruel and callous way to provide accommodation for flats.  Sometimes there are as many as nine or ten flats in a house which had previously been occupied by one family.  The amount of income from such a house is very high <Col N="329" /> and the amount of tax paid by the landlord is small.  That is going on a big scale in Limerick.</P>
      <P>It is very hard to do something about these abuses, but on the other hand you cannot throw your hands in the air in horror and say you cannot control it. There must be efforts made to go after landlords and make them pay their fair share of tax.  The situation is very difficult for newly-married couples who are looking for accommodation.  A number of students can share the same flat but that is not so in the case of a married couple. In Limerick there are 1,000 people not on the list who are looking for houses and there is a terrible scramble at the very bottom by people looking for accommodation while they wait to be housed.  The human factor must also be taken into account.  Landlords have rights, but so have tenants.  I think the rights of landlords in private property are regarded as superior to the rights of people to decent housing and accommodation.  We have attempted to counterbalance this in our amendment.  Deputy Gregory's second amendment could also be difficult because it is hard to enforce a means test and that is what he is seeking.</P>
      <P>There is also abuse with regard to fire regulations which are often totally ignored.  I have looked at Deputy Gregory's amendment and listened very carefully to him and I am willing to support his second amendment as being a step forward.  I am not fully happy with it, but his views are preferable to those of Deputy O'Dea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The general principle of providing subsidies through the tax code is not one which we favour but there is an obvious need for some steps to be taken to provide relief for people who have to place themselves at the mercy of private landlords.  The provision of these reliefs, both to those who have mortgages and to those who rent accommodation, adds to the number of loopholes that already exist in the tax code for those who successfully evade paying their fair share of tax.  Possibly there are three grounds for extending these reliefs to the private rented sector, giving them parity <Col N="330" /> with people who have mortgages.  It would be intended to provide at least some assistance to those now paying high rents.  Also it would constitute a method of endeavouring to ensure that landlords register so the tenant would qualify for the relief.</P>
      <P>We have put down an amendment, I think No. 42, seeking that whatever regulations are implemented under this section will have teeth and that landlords who fail to comply with the registration requirements be fined £1,000.  Unless some such provision is implemented the effect of this amendment will be practically entirely increased rents payable by those at present paying such rents.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that there is not a lot of evasion taking place in this sector. A number of Deputies have cited examples of situations of which they are aware. I might give one example of two houses in the Rathmines area owned by the one person.  He has broken these houses up into single-room flats, has installed bottle gas heaters in each room and is charging £30 per week for each single room to unfortunate single persons and married couples provided, of course, they do not have any children.  Therefore his net take from those two houses amounts to £400 per week.  There is no way that that is justifiable.  Any relief this amendment might afford would be beneficial.  The Revenue Commissioners must be given some teeth, or some ability to chase such landlords, to ensure that the rents they reap from such people are taxed in a fair way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, unless also rents tribunals are established, even the taxation of landlords will result in these unfortunate tenants having to pay even more rent. Experience has shown that where the building industry or landlords are given concessions, those concessions are not passed on to tenants.  Two examples spring to mind.  One is the £1,000 grant to first-time buyers of houses, the net result of which was that, within three months, the cost of houses rose by £1,000.  Also the elimination of rent on private dwellings&mdash;which passed also to private landlords&mdash;did not result in any reduction in rent for the tenants of houses <Col N="331" /> or flats.  In fact it is fairly common now, and seems to be becoming an established practice, for landlords to evict tenants on a regular basis in order to prevent such tenants either reporting them to the Revenue Commissioners for tax purposes or so that they can raise the rent.  Again I can think of one specific example of a landlord who changed the tenants of his house three times in the past 12 months and, on each occasion, raised the rent.  In that case a rent which commenced 12 months ago at £20 per week per room is now £35 per week per room.  There is clearly widespread exploitation of people who cannot afford to buy their own homes.  Neither is it a question of foresight, as Deputy Desmond maintained. There is very little chance for any young person or married couple who must pay out £35 per week for a room to put together a deposit for a house and or the costs of a solicitor and so on.</P>
    <P>A practice has developed in the Dublin area of landlords whose married tenants, when they have a child, are put out on the street.  In the past month or so Dublin Corporation have had a list of 21 families in one week who were put out on the street as a result of private evictions. Under the law obtaining a local authority is bound to make an offer of accommodation to such families.  In effect, therefore, private landlords are using the law and the obligation on local authorities to rehouse homeless families to gain additional rent for themselves and avoid a situation in which they have families with children living in their flats.</P>
    <P>To summarise, I should say the idea of extending the tax relief to tenants could be of immediate benefit but, in the long-term, the net result will be higher rents.  Indeed even the advantage of having landlords register may result in higher rents unless this House gets down to tackling the whole issue of fixity of tenure for tenants, security and a fair rent.  The only way of doing so is to provide rents tribunals. This House dealt some months ago with rent restricted tenants.  There is a firm commitment given to the House that the Minister for the Environment will introduce rents tribunals in place of <Col N="332" /> district courts in that area.  There is, certainly in the Dublin area, something in the region of 100.000 private flatdwellers. These people are literally being crucified by private landlords.  I emphasise that the responsibility rests with this House to introduce legislation to prevent that practice being continued.  The benefit I see in this amendment is that, to some extent at least, it will ensure that the private landlord must register in order that the tenant may benefit from the tax relief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reiterate that my principal concern in putting forward these amendments was to assist those people most in need.  I am concerned with that specific principle, not necessarily with the actual detail of particular amendments.  I welcome the support of various Deputies of the Workers' Party, Deputy Kemmy, the Labour and Fine Gael Parties for the principle inherent in these amendments.  I also suspect that my amendment, No. 33b may perhaps be the better of the two because it should discriminate more in favour of larger families, widows with children and so on, rather than the blanket income limit imposed in amendment No. 33a.</P>
      <P>When replying I would ask that the Minister give as detailed information as possible on two aspects brought to light so far.  The first is the whole question raised initially by Deputy John Bruton in his reference to the reports he had in the past from the Revenue Commissioners that there was a vigorous campaign perpetrated against landlords that was largely successful, that the amount of income accruing to landlords not now being taxed was fairly small and that, consequently, if this were now taxed it would not amount to a great deal.  I find it extremely difficult to accept that view. Can the Minister indicate to us specifically what information he has available to him in regard to the amount of money currently coming into the Exchequer as a result of taxation of landlords and what would be the projections of his officials if my amendments were agreed and if landlords, who have previously undeclared income, were taxed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> I believe strongly that a large number of landlords still have undeclared income, still evade tax on a significant scale.  I accept what Deputy Desmond said that it may not be enormous, in the region of £80 million to £90 million, but it would be something significant.  He suggested that it may be in the region of £10 million.  If that amount could be made available I consider that a very significant sum.  It would be a major step towards a more equitable taxation system if the guilty landlords were forced to pay this. That is why I have emphasised in further amendments the process by which that income can be taxed.</P>
    <P>I would like to reiterate what Deputy J. Bruton said in relation to the second question.  If for reasons of cost amendment No 33a is not acceptable to the Minister, would he indicate if any taxable income is acceptable to him as a level which would provide at least the first stage towards achieving the equity so many speakers have said they are concerned should be achieved?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to reply in detail to the points which have been raised, some of which have been accepted in principle.  It is very easy to accept something in principle.  I would like to deal with amendments Nos. 33a and 33b first.  If the intention behind those amendments were accepted it must be appreciated that a very complex system for accounting for his income and rent by the taxpayer would be required to enable the scheme to operate at all.  Some system of marginal relief would be required, where a taxable income is just in excess of £4,500 or £7,000 income or, in the case of weekly payments £87 and £135 a week, for the purpose of phasing out the relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the existing PAYE system the relief could only be given by a refund of tax at the end of the year of assessment because it would not be possible to forcast in advance if the taxpayer's taxable income would exceed £4,500 in the one case and, in the other, £7,000 income, if in a particular week or weeks his taxable income would fall below £87 or £135 or if marginal relief should be accorded to the taxpayer because his taxable income <Col N="334" /> would be somewhat over £4,500 or £7,000.  It would not be possible to have a workable arrangement whereby the employer would adjust the employee's tax deduction in particular weeks without reference to the tax office.  It would be impossible to adjust the PAYE system to provide for intervention by the tax office on a week by week basis.  In the case of self-employed it would be impossible to allocate their income on a week by week basis.  I should also say that if a single person with £7,000 or £4,500 taxable income is entitled to relief a very strong and plausible case could be made on the basis of the Murphy decision that a married couple should be entitled to relief if their combined income did not exceed £14,000 or their taxable income was £9,000.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer in general to the section which deals with this matter and to quote from the budget speech of 27 January when Deputy Bruton said:</P>
    <P>The Government programme proposes a tax allowance for private tenancies up to a maximum of £1,000 rent. The full implementation of this would, it is estimated, cost in the region of £15 million to £20 million in a full year, in tax foregone.  In present Exchequer circumstances this could not be afforded. In order to focus first on the area of greatest need, the allowance will be made available to taxpayers aged 65 and upwards who live in private rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Government have accepted the view that a tax relief for all private tenancies would not be feasible in the present economic circumstances.  The allowance has been retained specifically in order to provide relief for the elderly, who, as we all know, are a specially deserving section of the community.  That was the information in January.  On the basis of up to date information, to extend it right across the board would cost in the region of £30 million in a full year or £20 million in 1983.  Amendment No. 33b would cost £16 million in 1983 and £25 million in a full year and amendment No. 33a would cost £16 million in 1983 or £24 million, £1 million less, in a full year.  There has <Col N="335" /> been a lot of talk about the balancing of the scale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Waterford) Mr. Gallagher (Waterford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> On a point of order, would the Minister please repeat the costings in relation to amendments Nos. 33a and 33b?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  The costing in relation to amendment No. 33b is £16 million in 1983 or £25 million in a full year and the costing in relation to amendment No. 33a is £16 million in 1983 or £24 million in a full year.  The cost of the full allowance would be £20 million in 1983 and £30 million in a full year.  This is amendment No. 34.  There has been a lot of discussion about the balancing that would take place because of the fact that landlords would now be obliged to pay tax since the tenants would not get this benefit unless they named, and the Revenue Commissioners got to know about, the landlords.  A lot of landlords are already in the tax net and we cannot at this stage estimate what extra revenue would accrue from the operation of this new proposal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gregory asked me to give the information <i>vis-à-vis</i> the existing amount of money taken in from landlords.  I cannot give that information because it is buried in the overall taxation system.  I believe for Dublin there is one section in Dublin Castle dealing with landlords but that is not the case throughout the rest of the country.  It comes in with all the taxation and not specifically from landlords. I would also like to say&mdash;I am sure Deputy Bruton appreciates this&mdash;that it will take a lot of time before this new system finds its way down to the landlords. It becomes operative next year. The Revenue Commissioners will have to check; all the landlords will not come in and say that as a result of these proposals they are liable for tax.  The Revenue Commissioners will work hard to make sure that everyone of them do, but it will take time.  It will be some significant time before a large amount of money is forthcoming to the Exchequer from those new proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept the amendments, primarily <Col N="336" /> on the grounds of cost and, secondly, on the grounds of the difficulties which would arise under PAYE and which could be resolved only by resort to repayments necessitating a very large number of end of the year reviews. Deputy Bruton and his party in their programme for Government outlined the wish to do something in this general area. But, as he said on 27 January, because of the cost, which is now much more than was expected at that time&mdash;£20 million to £30 million or £16 million to £25 million, whichever way you want to look at the amendments &mdash; it was only possible to do it for the over 65-year-olds.  That is the position.  One can accept that the principle has already been established. This is relief that has been introduced for the over 65s.  I have given the reaction to the amendments.  I am sure Deputies will appreciate that I could not anticipate what might be in any future budget in relation to the extension of this benefit.</P>

Such people are forcing the Government, and the people of County Donegal, through malicious claims to make good the loss of this boat to the owners.  The Government should make that point clear and it should not be necessary for me to put down a parliamentary question.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say he is against that.

      <P>The manpower and other resources allocated to specialised units like the drug squad are matters for decision by the Garda authorities in the light of their assessment of needs and having regard to overall resources and other demands on Garda services.  They have informed me that they consider that the equipment and facilities available to the drug squad are adequate for present needs but that they are considering proposals to increase the strength of the permanent units of the squad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> I must emphasise that members of the drug squad are not the only members of the Garda Siochána who are dealing with the prevention and control of drug abuse. In fact, drug abuse is included as part of the standard induction training of every member of the Force and all members are regarded as preventive officers in this respect.  This aspect is being further emphasised in a current and expanded training programme which aims to ensure that each Garda division will have a substantial number of its members trained in the detection and prevention of drug abuse who will work in close co-operation with the permanent units of the drug squad.</P>

Forty new cases of heroin addiction are admitted to Jervis Street Hospital daily.  The ages of those involved range from 16 to 25 years and some have been as low as 13 years.  Does the Minister not agree that as heroin is now the most freely available drug on the streets in Dublin, this is a situation which calls for drastic action, and for the families who are involved it is nothing short of murder for money</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not wise of the Minister to bring party politics into this serious problem.  Apart from the increased numbers in the drug squad and the increased training for gardaí throughout the country, has the Minister considered taking up with Governments abroad, especially in source countries, the question of ways of preventing drug trade to this country?  Is he aware of this type of co-operation between other countries and source countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda have had communications with their colleagues in many other countries on this matter. <Col N="347" /> They are in constant contact with them in their daily fight against drug abuse. Very recently I availed of the opportunity of discussing this drugs problem with senior police officers from another country. We discussed how the campaign to defeat drug abuse might best succeed.  The Garda are satisfied that the resources available to them, particularly in respect of manpower, have been deployed and will not be increased until such time as further manpower becomes available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister confirm that the strength of the drug squad is as follows: one detective inspector, three detective sergeants, 14 detective gardaí and two ban-ghardaí and that there has been a reduction in numbers to the extent of one in five compared with six weeks ago?  Can the Minister say also whether the chief of the drug squad has asked for further personnel in the recent past and, if so, if the Minister is prepared to respond to that request immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the person the Deputy considers to be the chief of the drug squad is one and the same person as the one I have in mind. Consequently, it would be difficult to answer the question, but I would make the point that to speak about a reduction in the numbers of the drug squad would be unfair and inaccurate.  Members of the drug squad have been deployed in what is known as the serious crime force, of which the problem of drug abuse forms the greater part, with the purpose of pursuing and following up those people known as the godfathers of drugs in Dublin City and throughout the country. There has not been any reduction in the personnel directly involved in the campaign against those who push drugs and sell them publicly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">

I, too, have heard references being made frequently to certain families and in that context the serious crime squad have been formed and supplemented with personnel from the drug squad, people who have very special expertise and experience in this area.</P>

      <P>In the light of the discussions the Minister has had on this matter with the Garda Commissioner, has he been made aware by the commissioner that in Ranelagh in a semi-derelict property which is owned by Dublin Corporation, there are a number of squatters who are known to be pushing drugs openly but that the corporation for a variety of legal reasons have been unable to move against them?  If the Minister is so aware will he direct the forces of the serious crime squad to this situation since one of the families to whom Deputy Mitchell was referring is implicated in this Ranelagh house?  It is a situation that needs to be dealt with urgently because it is a serious slight and imposition on all of the families in the vicinity concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he intends improving on the manner in which families of prisoners receive information on the medical condition, visiting rights and general position of their incarcerated relatives.  For instance, relatives have <Col N="349" /> arrived at the Curragh to be informed that their son, brother, has been in the prison hospital for some time previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there is any deficiency in the standing arrangements which would call for intervention by me.  In general, it is a matter for the person in custody to inform his relatives of the fact that he is in custody and of any other relevant details and he is afforded facilities for so doing.  He may not wish to do so, in which case his wishes are respected by the prison authorities.  In certain cases, of course, it would be appropriate for the prison authorities to take the initiative in contacting a prisoner's next of kin, for example, if he became seriously ill, and they would do so.</P>
      <P>I understand that the arrangements in regard to persons detained in the Military Detention Barracks, Curragh Camp, are similar to those in the other prisons.  It is not the practice of the authorities there to notify next of kin as a matter of course that a person has been transferred to the General Military Hospital in the camp, unless, of course, he is seriously ill, and, in any case, the hospital is situated in close proximity to the barracks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be delighted to look into that, but the Deputy will appreciate that there are certain situations that might arise &mdash; for instance, medical supervision might require a certain situation while on the other hand there might be the question of security having regard to where the hospital is located.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dogs Act, 1906, gives the Garda certain powers to control dogs.  I presume the Deputy has in mind the serious difficulty posed for sheep farmers where stray dogs are concerned? I do not consider that my Department or I should have responsibility for introducing such legislation.  While I accept that there may be sections in legislation prepared in other Departments that will impose the responsibility of enforcing it on the Garda, I do not consider the Garda should be the only people with the responsibility of being dog collectors. They have other onerous duties and it would be too much to ask them to take on the role as suggested in legislation which has been sought from my Department by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="363" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the role of the Garda Síochána, what they should do and what they should not do.  Does the Minister not accept that three Departments are involved in this problem?  Is it not time that he, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for the Environment should ask one Department to look after the problem &mdash; I suggest the Department of Agriculture &mdash; somewhat along the lines of what has been done in Wicklow and Longford?  This would alleviate the enormous loss suffered by the country in the way of exports and damage to the sheep industry here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still of the opinion that I should not be the Minister responsible for the introduction of this legislation. I am sure the Deputy is aware that recently the Law Reform Commission published a draft Bill dealing with civil liability in respect of animals, but that Bill did not evoke the type of public debate I would have liked to see.  However, I recognise that farmers have suffered serious losses as a result of damage caused by dogs.  I accept that new legislation may be necessary but I do not accept that it is my Department or I who should have that responsibility.  I think the question would be better put to another Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that according to existing law dogs must have a collar and a tag?  I was in the House when Deputy Haughey introduced the legislation and he told us it would be rigorously enforced by the Garda Síochána.  He said he did not believe in having legislation on the Statute Book unless it was enforced.  Will the Minister agree that unfortunately legislation in this area has not been enforced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Síochána have many duties.  The Deputy is aware that enforcement in any area cannot be done to the exclusion of enforcement duties and other duties in other areas.  If the Deputy has any cases or areas in mind <Col N="364" /> and if he can give to the gardaí a written statement  evidence of what he has referred to, I am sure they will be glad to take it.  However, if he is implying in what he has said that the Garda Síochána are not doing their duties, I reject that.</P>

The Garda Síochána have responsibility in various legislative areas for the enforcement of the law in relation to stray dogs but that does not necessarily mean that they have other duties in this area.

There is responsibility under section 11 of the 1906 Act with regard to the collection of dogs but I do not think it should be the total responsibility of the Garda Síochána in the way <Col N="366" /> suggested.

    <P>&ldquo;(i) at any time during the year of assessment he was of the age of 65 years or upwards or if under the age of 65 years he was at any time during the year of assessment in receipt of an income less than £7,000 per annum, and,&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying before the adjourment of this item, in view of the points I have made already, particularly on the grounds of cost as well as the difficulties which will arise under the PAYE system, it would not be possible to accept these amendments.</P>
      <P>I would say to the Deputies concerned with the amendments that, in view of what I say, what Deputy John Bruton said in January and again over the last few days because of the cost and financial constraints generally it is not possible to go beyond the 65-year olds on the initiation of this relief.  However, once the relief is established, as it will be under this provision in the Bill, obviously the hope on all sides of the House will be to have it extended as soon as the financial position improves and allows such extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also we shall have the Commission on Taxation report, which I shall have examined fully prior to the next budget.  There is also the fact to which I have referred already that huge anomalies could arise if the content of the amendments was accepted, because then many people with very high incomes would have a taxable income of only £4,500.  For the reasons I have given I would suggest to the Deputies that, in the light of the financial situation obtaining and until such time as <Col N="416" /> that improves, it would not be possible in view of the cost of implementation of this amendment to accede to that request at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we have had a figure from the Minister for the cost of this amendment.  The figure he gave was £16 million for exempting people with less than £4,500 taxable income. Although I know Deputy Gregory's intention was to devise an amendment specifically for the low paid, it happens that this amendment, which is based on a figure of £4,500, is helping people who have above-average incomes.  There is a total of 808,000 people in the income tax net of whom 428,500 or 53 per cent, more than half, have incomes of less than £4,500.  I believe on this issue there is very broad agreement in the House that we should make an amendment to help the lower paid but I believe the amendment in relation to £4,500 is going further than helping the lower paid.  It would help more than half the eligible taxpayers in the country.</P>
      <P>I would like to mention two alternative possible levels of taxable income which could be used for the purpose.  If you were to say that people with a taxable income of under £2,000 were to benefit solely from the concession, then you would be talking about 21 per cent of the total taxpayers in the country, that is the lowest paid people in the country.  That obviously would not cost £16 million.  It would cost in the region of £6 million. You would be talking about an amendment which was more directly helping the lower paid rather than the majority of taxpayers and it would also cost significantly less.  If you were less generous and took only those who had taxable incomes of £1,000 or less you would be helping only 10 per cent of the total taxpayers. Your cost would then be around £3 million, which is a very small sum to pay for establishing the principle that you want to help the low paid people in respect of their rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel in this discussion we should try to find a consensus across the House between the Minister and the other Members of the House on a figure somewhere <Col N="417" /> between £1,000 of taxable income and £4,500 taxable income which would accept the principle of helping the low paid in respect of their rent and would also be fiscally responsible.  If you were to take the lowest figure, of £3 million, you would not be talking about an amendment which would cost a very substantial sum.  If that amendment costing £3 million were accepted it would not cost anything this year.  The revenue would be next year so the Government would not be in a position where their current budget deficit would be affected. They would be in the position of having to find in the overall budget for next year £3 million to help low paid people in respect of their rent.  The House should try to reach a consensus on this.</P>
    <P>My party are very anxious to go as far as we can along the road of finding consensus in the House on this point between the Minister and the other Members of the House.  I say that very deliberately because the Government should be wary of adopting the attitude that no amendment whatever proposed by anybody except the Minister for Finance can be accepted.  If that is their attitude they are in effect saying that this debate is a complete waste of time and we should not be discussing the Finance Bill at all because no matter what anyone says the Minister will not change a single line of the Bill.  I am sure the Minister and his colleagues fought very hard to become Members of the House and they would not wish a situation to be created where the debates of the House meant nothing as they would if the Minister persisted in the attitude he seems to have adopted that no change, no matter how modest, no matter how responsible, in respect of anything in the Finance Bill can be contemplated. I am not certain that is the Minister's attitude.  It certainly should not be his attitude.</P>
    <P>The Minister may take the view that on any amendments to the Finance Bill, no matter how modest they are, once there is a cost issue involved, he has to dissolve the Dáil and plunge the country into an election that night.  This is constitutional nonsense.  The House has a responsibility to fulfil to amend the <Col N="418" /> Finance Bill, as its majority sees fit, in a responsible fashion.  We must ensure that the Finance Bill is passed before any election takes place.  If the Government, having considered all the amendments put forward in the debate, decide that the changes to be made are too wide-ranging for them to accept after the Finance Bill has been passed, they can then have an election if they decide that is what they need.  As I said on other occasions outside the House, for the Government to say, as they seem to be saying, that they will not accept any amendment, no matter how small, to the Finance Bill, is negativing the value of this debate and if they go on to say that if such an amendment is made they will dissolve the Dáil overnight, then it is they and not the House who will be plunging the country into financial chaos.  They are under no obligation to dissolve there and then. They are perfectly free to pass the Finance Bill, as amended by the House, as it is the job of the House to do and only having done so, if they then decide that they cannot work with the Finance Bill, that there is not enough money, they can have an election at that stage.  If they decide in midstream, during the course of the discussion on the Finance Bill, to have an election and thereby jeopardise the possibility of the Finance Bill being passed before 25 July, when the resolutions passed on budget night in regard to this matter run out, it will be the Government, not Members of this House who are doing their duty in proposing amendments to the Bill, who will be plunging the country into financial chaos.  The Taoiseach needs to think a little more deeply about the issue before he rushes in a panic on to television and the radio to make statements about the so-called irresponsibility of the Opposition when in fact by making those statements he is contemplating this highly irresponsible deed.</P>
    <P>I further remind the House that there are many precedents in other countries in relation to Governments who have failed to get support on every item in a Finance Bill.  One example is the Callaghan Government in Britain who accepted certain amendments in relation <Col N="419" /> to proposals in their Finance Bill.  They had an election after they passed the Finance Bill.  They decided they could not live with those amendments.  They said they accepted them for the time being and they would try to get a new House that would support their line.  That is the normal constitutional practice to adopt in a situation like that.  The Government, as I already said, would be acting irresponsibly if they adopted any other attitude.  I hope they will not do so. That is why my party have been trying to find a consensus in the House.  None of us gains anything by engaging in exaggerated statements as seems to be the approach on the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>We should debate this issue of rent relief for tenants as an issue.  It deserves to be debated in an unemotional way when we are all trying to reach consensus on the subject.  I am sure that Deputy Gregory will feel, like my party, on the basis of further information, that when his amendment will benefit 53 per cent of the total taxpayers it is not only going to the lower paid but is going to others as well and that perhaps another figure could be chosen.</P>
    <P>There is another point made by the Minister, that there would be problems in administering the relief.  He suggested that there would have to be some form of marginal relief for taxpayers who have &mdash; let us take a figure of £2,000 &mdash; a taxable income of £2,100 who do not get any income relief as against those who have a taxable income of £1,900 and who get tax relief.  Those people would then be worse off.  I am sure the Revenue Commissioners have plenty of experience in solving matters like this.  If the Minister can be persuaded to accept the principle of this amendment and if he does not devise a way to get over this between now and Report Stage, we can devise a suitable system of marginal relief which would get over that problem.</P>
    <P>The other technical difficulty the Minister mentioned in relation to the amendment is that you would not know if someone has a taxable income until the end of the year in relation to the £2,500 or the £4,000.  His income might go up and he <Col N="420" /> might not be claiming the allowance.  He said that clearly he could not be allowed a relief on a week by week basis.  He would have to wait until the end of the year when a refund would be given if his income had gone up to qualify him for the relief.  I do not believe that is a problem. I do not see any reason why one cannot wait until the end of the year to get such relief.  It would be a simpler transaction in that there would be one refund to be made, one cheque to be sent.  By waiting to the end of the year also rather than doing it on a week to week basis it would be easier to make the calculations regarding whatever marginal relief is introduced because that would be just one calculation done at the end of the year rather than an on-going running calculation having to be made week by week by the employer during the year. That is the way we should seek to frame the practice in regard to the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that there would be difficulties in operating this, that introducing such a new concept into the revenue law would cause a big problem for us because it is such a new concept.  I do not accept that either because no relief will actually fall to be given to people in respect of their income until next year. All they are being asked to do this year is to keep the receipts and it is only next year that the relief will come into operation. The Revenue Commissioners will have up to nine months during which they can make whatever calculations or arrangements are necessary from an administrative point of view.  The Minister may also claim that if we make the amendment at this stage there could be some unforeseen problem that would come up to keep the Revenue Commissioners working assiduously on the subject over the next couple of months.  The Minister may say that next September or October they may come up with a problem and say that they should have mentioned that to the Minister when the legislation was going through the House. They may say that they cannot find a way of solving it and, consequently, could not operate the scheme.  That is not so either.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that subsection <Col N="421" /> (5) states that the Revenue Commissioners are given power to make regulations, for the purpose of giving effect to that section, with respect to the allowance granted by this section, or to any matter ancillary or incidental thereto, or, in particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, to provide for certain things.</P>
    <P>One can see from the first few words I have read that the Revenue Commissioners have power to make regulations to govern any unforeseen problem that might arise from the fact that this is an amendment introduced to the Finance Bill rather than something that was in the Bill from the outset.  That is an inevitable danger in amending any Bill.  One cannot think of everything no more than any Minister for Finance cannot think of everything when introducing a Bill. Rarely has a Minister for Finance introduced a new tax or an new tax concession without having to come back to the House the following year to amend.  That is not a great problem.  In this instance we have a solution built into the section in that subsection (5) provides the Revenue with the power to make further regulations to iron out any detailed problems that might arise in the administration of the section or the amendment to it that may be made in the House.</P>
    <P>The £4,500 figure consisting as it does of more than half of all taxpayers and costing £16 million is going further than we can afford at this juncture and we should, either by agreement here substitute another figure, as we can do orally, for the figure of £4,500 in Deputy Gregory's amendment or, failing that, come back on Report Stage with another figure which is more reasonable from the Revenue and low income point of view.  I appeal to the Minister and the Government in their own interest as much as in the interests of the House to adopt an open attitude towards amendments of this kind which are put forward with a view to solving a real problem and not to say that because they are the Government they will not accept any change whatever.  That is not a politically judicious attitude for the Government to <Col N="422" /> adopt.  It is an attitude which shows a lack of appreciation for the prerogative of the House which is even more serious.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that a situation which existed at the time of the Minister's budget speech, which was already in imbalance, has been thrown into greater imbalance by the Finance Bill.  I refer to the imbalance between the taxation concessions made available to rent payers as opposed to those made available to houseowners.  In the Minister's budget statement it was provided that houseowners paying mortgage interest would have their relief to tax limited to the standard rate whereas in the Bill an additional concession has been provided to that category extending the relief to the full marginal rate of tax they pay. That extends the imbalance between people paying rent and those who own their own houses.  It is entirely indefensible. Equal concessions should be given to the less well off sections who are paying rent.</P>
      <P>The view of the Labour Party is that we should try to achieve a situation of parity where at least the same concessions on taxation would be available to people who pay rent as to those who own houses.  It would be the ideal to have an across-the-board situation.  I realise the Minister is facing a substantial deficit and perhaps we will have to try to achieve something less than that.  I should like the Minister to give a figure to the House on this.  What is the cost to the Exchequer of altering the tax concessions to houseowners from having their tax concession limited to the standard rate as was specified in the budget speech, to having it at the full marginal rate as is provided for in the Bill?  It would be reasonable and in the interests of equity in the taxation system for the Minister to consider altering the position which now faces the House in the Bill back to the position which he outlined in his budget statement. The money saved could be made available as a tax concession to those who are less well off and are paying rent.  I regard that as a basic minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a gross inequity to have a situation where people who pay rent or, even <Col N="423" /> worse, people who are not in a position to pay rent and are neither tenants nor householders but live with in-laws and have not the financial means to buy or rent, subsidise through PAYE those who are in a position to own their houses.  The alteration which the Minister has made in the Bill has made that situation worse. Would he not consider reverting to the budget situation &mdash; limiting that relief to the standard rate and making that saving available, in a formula the House could agree on, to tenants who pay rent?  A small balancing factor would then be brought in at no extra cost.  No extra deficit would be involved.  I would not be satisfied with that position as an eventual solution.  Parity should be achieved between the two but, if the Minister made that concession, we would have achieved something along the road to equity in taxation as between the people who rent houses and those who own them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reply to some of the points raised before there are any further contributions.  I wish to be helpful in all cases but this is not possible if there are a number of points raised by various speakers.  To take Deputy Taylor's point and the changes in the mortgage interest relief, if it was possible for me to implement what was proposed on 27 January and in the budget I would have done so.  It was not possible to do that.  It was not possible to limit the interest relief to the 35 per cent band on the capital allowance of £35,000.  If I could do it, I would do it.  I would have done it in the Finance Bill in June.  I stated it in March and my predecessor, Deputy Bruton, stated it in January.  It was not possible to implement it.  That is the reason for the change.  The amount is insignificant.  The maximum figure would be £½ million.  That is the reply I must give on the advice I received in relation to that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton spoke about the possibility of taking figures other than the £4,500 mentioned in Deputy Gregory's amendment.  I have before me the amounts of money involved.  If the taxaable income was £1,000 the cost would be <Col N="424" /> £3½ million next year and £5½ million in a full year.  If it was £2,000 the cost would be £7 million in 1983 and £11 million in a full year.  If it was £2,500 it would be £10 million in 1983 and £15 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I shall not take this opportunity to refer to other points made by Deputy Bruton in relation to amending Bills or possible general elections.  Nobody on this side of the House referred to those.  It was Deputies from Deputy Bruton's own party who were contributing on various amendments in the debate last week.  At least two Deputies were involved.  I think Deputy Collins was one and a lady Deputy the other.  I am not sure who it was so I shall not mention any name. However, they said all they wanted was a vote to get rid of the Taoiseach and the Government.  It was not any wish on their party to help the lower paid when we were dealing with the amendments last week. I want to make that point clear in relation to what Deputy Bruton said.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the extension of the relief to people other than those over 65 years of age one must look at it across the board.  If we introduce income limits or taxable limits we will cause chaos in the PAYE system.  Deputy Bruton had much praise for the Revenue Commissioners and for the officials.  I endorse totally what he had to say in that regard, but the advice I have from these people is that the Deputy's suggestion if accepted would lead to the total disruption of the PAYE system.  What was intended in the Programme for Government in June last was that this provision would apply across the board, that there would be no income limits and, consequently, no problems <i>vis-á-vis</i> entitlements at any time during the year.  In the case of the 65-year-olds and upward the position will be that they will hand in their rent books this year showing exactly the amount of rent they have paid and based on those figures they will get the tax allowance in the following year.  That is a simple system, and one that does not give rise to problems that might be brought about in respect of income limits.  While I cannot anticipate budgetary decisions at this stage, if there were to be any extension of the scheme <Col N="425" /> it would have to be by some mechanism other than the PAYE system.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Bruton and other Deputies who have spoken, I, too, can accept this suggestion in principle.  But we must be realistic and the reality is, in the first place, the question of cost and, secondly, the mechanism that would be used to translate that principle into effective relief for the people concerned.  It is not possible to do so within the existing system. As I said earlier, while one can take account of all the points raised in relation to the lower paid, the problem is to find a mechanism which can produce the desired results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat puzzled by what the Minister has said.  He has spoken of the danger of a total disruption of the PAYE system.  I should like him to expand a little more on what he means by that.  Deputy Bruton went to some trouble to point out that if we were to operate the system as he suggests, regardless of whether there are income limits involved, the simplest way of doing it would be to wait until the end of the year when we would be in a position to establish what people's incomes were and what bracket of tax they came into.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>These people would then be in a position to furnish details of the rent they had paid during the year.  I see no great difficulty in establishing from the P60 form of every employee what the adjustment to his tax would have to be on the basis of information supplied about his rent payments.  I cannot see how, operated that way, a total disruption of the system would result.  All that would seem to be required would be an extra calculation to be made at the end of the year in precisely the same way as it would be done under the Minister's scheme.</P>

      <P>The number involved is 700,000 and the employer, not the Revenue Commissioners, would be the one who would have the information concerning <Col N="426" /> taxable income.  To do as the Deputy suggests would involve going through the income of every claimant and this would totally disrupt the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but we are not talking about having to go through the tax records of everyone in the system.  We are talking of going through the records of those who would claim and who produce the evidence required.  This is similar to what is provided for in the Minister's scheme.  The employer will not be involved.  He will not have to do any more than that which he does now, that is, to produce the P60 forms showing how much income the employee has received and how much tax has been deducted.  In the light of that information it would be for the Revenue Commissioners to do another calculation for those people to whom the system applied in order to net out what the tax situation would be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Revenue Commissioners do not have details of taxable income until the end of the year.  Therefore, the only way in which this could be operated would be that, by being in a position at the end of the year 1982-83 to know what the taxable income was, the benefit for the year 1983-84 would have to be on the basis of the 1982-83 taxable income.  That would cause administrative difficulties and chaos.  That is the advice I have from the people whom Deputy Bruton has been praising.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a general point.  The Minister has quoted correctly that part of Deputy Bruton's January budget statement in which he said that the Government programme proposed a tax allowance for private tenancies up to a maximum of £1,000 and that the full implementation of that was estimated to cost in the region of £15 million to £20 million in a full year in tax foregone.  According to the Revenue Commissioner's estimate in January last, without there being any question of taxable income limitation, that would be the amount in terms of revenue foregone. <Col N="427" /> Was there any income limitation in the Government programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>There was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If one reduces this amount to approximately 53 per cent of taxpayers, which would be roughly anybody earning up to £7,800, it is fair and reasonable to say that the cost would not be as the Minister says but between £7 million and £10 million in, not this year, but in the year 1983-84.  We are not talking about anything in terms of provision for 1982.  This benefit comes into operation only in the tax year 1983-84.  I would not be the last person to suggest to the Revenue Commissioners that there may be a slight overestimation aimed at scaring certain people.  There may be some of that going on, but we cannot buy overestimation in terms of cost.</P>
      <P>My questions, then, are: for the over 65's, how much will the scheme cost in 1983-84?  The figure in that respect has not been mentioned so far.  Secondly, regarding the original estimate of from £15 million to £20 million in a full year in terms of tax foregone in the former Government programme, how is that now apparently only half of what it was originally estimated to be?  How is it doubled up?  We are assuming that everybody who is paying rent is going to apply for tax relief.  It is an assumption, not necessary a valid assumption because some landlords and tenants have cosy arrangements between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something in the section about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not always disclose precisely what they are up to and the arrangements are more cosy than financial in many respects.  It is assuming, for example, that there will be no clawback from the landlords in terms of tax on income from the tenant because there would be a higher incidence of tax detection with a system in operation for tax receipts, and there is no allowance for that.  It would be allowing at the very minimum a couple of million pounds in <Col N="428" /> that context for these two areas.  I see the merit of what Deputy Bruton is talking about but I favour changing the section at this stage, not letting it stand part of the Bill.  Remember that whatever comes into operation will be in operation next year and will have to be contained in next year's budget.  There is no provision at all for it in this year's budget.  It would be up to the Minister in the budget of 1983, 1984 or next year's budget to put in whatever we would give today &mdash; £2 million, £3 million or £4 million.  You would take that on board in your budget for 1983. That is feasible, but what value does the concession now contain in next year's Estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reply to two questions posed by Deputy Desmond. In relation to the quotation, I said that on the basis of more up-to-date data it is now estimated that tax relief for all private tenants will cost in the region of £30 million in a full year or £20 million in 1983.  Perhaps Deputy Desmond has not had some experience, but Deputy Bruton will have had, that any Government or Minister can ask for certain information. I think Deputy Bruton has already made this point in relation to the publication of a Bill and I myself on advice have a number of technical amendments down which have arisen on further examination of the issues.  The same thing arises in relation to initial examination of any proposal. That was the advice given in January.  The position today is that it is £30 million in a full year and £20 million in 1983.  These are not figures off the top of my head or made up to this size for the purpose of frightening people off the issue.</P>
      <P>In relation to the second question asked by Deputy Desmond, the cost of the concession now in the Bill, proposed firstly by Deputy Bruton and secondly by myself, is £600,000 in 1983 and £900,000 in a full year and 28,000 taxpayers over 65 years of age will benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some problems with the Minister's figures.  I would be very hesitant to suggest that he was not supplying figures that were wholly accurate, <Col N="429" /> but I would like him to tell us the basis upon which these calculations were made.  Was any allowance at all made for possible revenue effects in terms of additional detection of people who have hitherto evaded tax, or was that ignored as if it had not occurred at all?  If so, as Deputy Desmond said, the figures were not truly accurate.  I would not tend to be as optimistic as others in the House might be about the amount of detection, but we must expect some detection to occur.  I have difficulty with the Minister's figures. He said that the entire scheme to give it to everyone would cost £30 million in a full year.  He also says that Deputy Gregory-Independent's amendment 33<i>b</i> would cost £24 million in a full year. Deputy Gregory-Independent's amendment involves just over half of the taxpayers, 53 per cent in fact, having taxable incomes of less than £4,500.  How can it cost £24 million to give it to just 53 per cent and no more than £30 million to give it to 100 per cent of all taxpayers?  There does not seem to be any proportionality between those two figures.  Either the £30 million for all taxpayers is under-estimated or, more likely, the £24 million for Deputy Gregory-Independent's amendment is over-estimated.  They cannot both be right, because £24 million is somewhere in the region of 80 per cent of £30 million, whereas taxpayers with taxable incomes of under £4,500 are only 53 per cent of all taxpayers.  How can you have a concession for just over half of all taxpayers which is to cost 80 per cent of the cost of giving it to everyone?  Those figures do not seem to make sense and the Minister should explain them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first point in relation to the cost, these are the figures that have been given to me.  I am not inflating them.  As I said earlier, this cost would be reduced to some extent &mdash; the extent is unknown &mdash; by the extra tax collected from certain landlords who at present are evading tax.  It will be some significant time before that benefit would accrue to the Exchequer and some years later before the Revenue Commissioners get around to the landlords, etc., but that is the system that will be set in train. <Col N="430" /> These costs are compiled from statistics that the Revenue Commissioners have and any other information.  They are fed into the computer and these are the figures that come out.  There is no question of attempting to inflate them.  That is the best information I can get and the Deputy can see that it is even changed from the information he himself got in January in relation to costs.  He made a statement in the Dáil on that on 27 January.  I am going, as he did, on the figures given to me based on statistics and other information fed into the computer.  This is the information that followed in relation to either the overall exemption or exemption up to £4,500.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave a figure of £50 million to £60 million for mortgage interest relief for up-market people.  This highlights the point I was making.  It can be seen that house purchasers benefit from the Exchequer by way of tax relief to an amount of approximately £55 million. As the Bill stands people renting houses get a concession of £.9 million. That appears to be a glaring imbalance on the wrong side.  Would the Minister not agree that this glaring inequity ought to be balanced?</P>

      <P>They have been encouraged by successive Governments through different incentives, such as the £1,000 grant or this mortgage interest relief concession, to do so for a number of years.  We are talking about moving <Col N="432" /> towards helping those in rented houses, but because of financial constraints both the previous administration and this administration feel that as far as we could go this year was relief for the over 65 year olds and this would be implemented next year.  One cannot pick on something which has been on-going policy of successive Governments and say that because the scheme is costing £50 million or £60 million we should provide the concession for the rented side at a cost of £10 million, £15 million, £20 million, or whatever.  That is not a valid argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand how anybody could stand over a situation where tax allowances are provided for people in private rented accommodation while ignoring local authority tenants. Why is there such a difference?  Deputy Gregory-Independent asked about the cost to the Exchequer this year and the Minister said it would not cost anything. Is he saying that what will happen in 1983 is that the concession will increase the deficit by £16 million?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the last point first.  The way the system will work as proposed in the Bill is that the rent paid until December 1982 will be given as an allowance for the 1983-84 year. That means there will be no cost this year as the system will only come into operation next year.  The £16 million to £24 million would add to the cost of running the country next year.  In regard to local authority tenants they are already in highly subsidised accommodation.  It was not intended that the concession would <Col N="433" /> be granted to them.  As everybody appreciates, a subsidy system operates in local authority rented accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be true to say that a section of the local authority tenants are subsidised but the majority of people paying differential rents are not being subsidised?  The system says that the rent will be assessed on the income of the principal earner, that could be an 18 or 19 year old person just started work. In such a case the subsidy would be very little, if they got any at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the differential rents system very few people would be paying an economic rent.  The majority of these tenants are in highly subsidised accommodation.  There may be a few examples at the top of the scale but I do not know of any such people.  Most people are getting a subsidy.</P>

      <P>We have had a number of complicated amendments, no less than five amendments, three from Deputy Gregory-Independent, one from Deputy Kelly and one from me.  There are six amendments to one section, all inter-related and very complicated.  From what the Minister said it appears we are talking about a range of costs in 1983 of <Col N="434" /> between £12 million and £15 million in terms of actual relief.  This would mean that everybody in the community earning less than £8,000 would be getting a tax allowance for rent.  I have some honest misgivings about that because I believe one has to bring in parallel with that, the rent tribunals system.  Otherwise there would be subsidisation of landlords as well.  We have detailed figures of the cost of each amendment.  The ultimate logic will be that on Report Stage those of us who are in full possession of all the information will have to frame an amendment and there will be no question of an &ldquo;out&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>People have advanced various reasons why these amendments are unacceptable but those reasons must be examined.  Apparently the Revenue Commissioners got the figures wrong in the proposals in January. At that time the cost was estimated at £15 million to £20 million but now we are assured by the Revenue Commissioners that the real cost would be between £25 million and £30 million.</P>
      <P>I appreciate fully the difficulties facing the Revenue Commissioners in trying to assess private rents and how tax relief might be given.  That is a difficult exercise at the best of times and the Revenue Commissioners have my sympathy.  However, it is extraordinary that the figure was given in January of £15 million to £20 million but now the Minister tells us it is £30 million.  The Minister has a legitimate point in stating that he would have to make provision for £30 million if the benefit were allowed across the board. Deputy Bruton, quite rightly, pointed out the cost involved.  Deputy Sherlock has shifted his ground very considerably from where he said last weekend &mdash; as did Deputy Gallagher &mdash; that the reason they could not support Deputy Gregory's amendments was that landlords would benefit.  Apparently that is not the excuse now.  Ten minutes ago the excuse was that local authority tenants would not benefit.  We realise that local authority tenants pay differential rents varying between 25p per week to a maximum of £17 per week.  Generally this concession does not apply to local authority tenants and, consequently, that argument does not hold.  The Deputy will have to search for another argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party have tabled an amendment providing for relief across the board.  We have got the cost and, frankly, I will not be pressing my amendment because I do not think we can afford £30 million of straight relief on that basis although I have very strong views about mortgage interest relief.  Relative to what people get in private rented <Col N="436" /> accommodation, mortgage interest relief is enormously beneficial to householders generally.  I am convinced there is a strange discrimination in this area.</P>
    <P>The kind of amendment I would favour would be that anyone with a taxable income of £2,500 should get this relief.  It is easy to make it up.  It means that a married man with an income of approximately £5,500 with tax relief of £2,900 plus an extra £200 for two children and an extra £100 between overdraft, VHI, insurance and so on would get benefit.  It would benefit a person earning approximately £110 per week as distinct from giving it to someone with take-home pay of approximately £170 per week which would be the effect of the amendment put down by Deputy Gregory.  An amendment along the lines of £2,500 would be entirely reasonable and that is what I would table.  Deputy Gregory and I would have common ground on that and we would not destroy the integrity of the budget.  However, the only way we could do that would be on Report Stage. I throw out this suggestion to Deputy Gregory, to Deputy Kemmy and to those people who want to help low income families who have to pay exorbitant rents.  I am sure there are people in Mitchelstown, Charleville, Fermoy and in Mallow who have to pay rents of £30 per week for two rooms out of a take-home pay of £85.  They are the people who must be considered for tax relief. I respective of any reservations I may have about colleagues in terms of their political attitudes, I will go all the road with them if they put forward amendments on those lines.  However, I have reservations about going all the way with them where six out of every ten taxpayers would get the benefit under the other amendments.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy Sherlock speaks, perhaps he will bear with me for a moment.  If he is going to speak on the matter to which he has referred already I will help him by telling him that it is not unknown in this House for Deputies to plead with, to cajole or to criticise the great body of ladies and gentlemen called the press but it is not <Col N="437" /> acceptable that we make a direct comment, especially an uncomplimentary one, on any one person.</P>

The Workers' Party are not looking for any way out.  We will make any decision on the consideration we give to any issue.  At the same time, I looked at the Press Gallery and I said Mr. O'Malley should get that straight.  I am often surprised how people can concoct things which are very far removed from the truth.

      <P>Arising from what Deputy Desmond and other Deputies have said in the last hour in relation to the fact that some sort of taxable income limit should be looked at on Report Stage, I would be less than honest if I said I would take this approach on Report Stage.  We have got a Commission on Taxation who will be giving us some idea in relation to the overall question of taxation. Because of the fact that anomalies can be created, as already referred to by <Col N="438" /> Deputy Bruton and Deputy Desmond, in relation to any income limit that could be agreed on or accepted, I said I could not anticipate any budgetary measures for the future but that the basis for this suggestion was laid in the Programme of Government of the previous administration last June.  Deputy Desmond referred to the figures that were announced in the budget statement of 27 January of £15 to £20 million, which was the estimate at that time and which my predecessor, Deputy Bruton, could not concede because of financial constraints.</P>
      <P>The amendment we are debating mentions the sum of £4,500.  That would cost £16 million next year and £25 million in a full year.  It is not possible within the financial constraints at present to concede those amounts of money.  I accept in principle what is being asked for, but the realities have to be faced in regard to the mechanism that would be used and where the money can be found.</P>

      <P>This has been a long day, although it has been useful and constructive. I have no desire to push my amendment to a division.  I have listened attentively to the Minister's point of view and he has come some of the way to meet us, at least verbally.  He might not like to accept some of the onus we are trying to place on him with regard to tenants, especially young married couples, who are being exploited in all our towns and cities.  However, perhaps it is the duty of a Minister for Finance to tackle this problem and to alleviate the sufferings of people who are as helpless as sitting ducks and are at the mercy of unscrupulous and ruthless landlords in using the acute housing shortage to enrich themselves and make large profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill should have been flexible enough to take into account what we have said and to help to alleviate this distress and hardship.  Unfortunately, he has not done so to my satisfaction.  I have a duty to refer to this in the House.  This does not mean I am withdrawing my amendment; I will put it to a division in the future if I can, if procedure allows me to do so.  If I can make common cause with Deputy Desmond and Deputy Gregory <Col N="439" /> in this area I am willing to do so, but that presupposes that the Minister is willing to compromise in improving his present legislation to meet some of the points we have made in this debate.  I hope we will get that undertaking from the Minister because, while we can all pay lip service to this principle, the reality is different. If the Minister is willing to meet us in a spirit of compromise, I am willing to withdraw my amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the idea behind amendment No. 33b.  However, the House will appreciate that there were problems pertaining to amendment No. 33a the main one being that it was based on gross income of £7,000, thereby giving benefit to people who had an <Col N="441" /> income of £7,000 regardless of whether they had a large family or no dependants whatever.  It meant simply that if one had an income of less than £7,000, no matter what was one's situation, one got that benefit.</P>
      <P>This amendment, No. 33b, does not have that defect in that it is related to taxable income &mdash; in other words, income after deduction of allowances.  Therefore, a person with a large number of allowances will reach a taxable income of £4,500 at a higher gross income than a person entitled to very few deductions. Amendment No. 33b is fairer in that it takes better account of the actual situation of families likely to be claiming this allowance.</P>
      <P>We have been told that the cost of Deputy Gregory's amendment, on the figures as indicated here, would be in the region of £24 million in a full year and £16 million in 1983.  Of course, it would cost nothing in this year and does not therefore affect the current budget deficit for this year in any way &mdash; we would have the time between now and whenever the amendment was passed to find the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister raised some technical objections to this concept of taking taxable income and saying that people with less than that taxable income shall be eligible for the allowance and people with more than it shall not be eligible.  The difficulty he raised was that it is not possible to know whether a given person has a taxable income of more than or less than that sum until the end of the tax year.  Therefore it is not possible until the end of the tax year to know whether or not that person is entitled to the rent allowance.  My view is that that problem can be solved if the relevant rent allowance is made in the form of a single cheque to be sent to the taxpayer at the end of the year, not during the year as he earns the money but at the end of the year after all of these calculations have been made.  This would remove any administrative difficulties the Minister might have raised against this allowance. Of course it would mean that a taxpayer would have to wait a little longer for his allowance.  But, rather than get no allowance <Col N="442" /> at all, because the Minister claims that the administrative difficulties would be insuperable, it would be well worth while waiting until the end of the tax year and have it received in one cheque, as I have suggested.  That disposes of that problem.</P>
    <P>The whole idea here is that we are seeking to help people who are in rented accommodation.  At present, as Deputy Taylor brought to light, there is a tax benefit in the region of £50 million being given to people who own their own houses in the form of mortgage interest relief.  That tax benefit is given them regardless of how well off they are, regardless of whether it is being used for their second, third, fourth, or fifth house in terms of moving from one house to the next.  Therefore it lends itself to trading up in the market, to people improving their standard of accommodation, perhaps indeed to increasing house prices by virtue of the additional demand that process generates.  At the same time people who rent their accommodation get no benefit whatsoever from the Revenue Commissioners.  It is our view &mdash; and has been our view both in Opposition and in Government, in the joint programme that Fine Gael agreed with our former colleagues in Government in the Labour Party &mdash; that to remove this inequity, there should be an allowance against income tax for rent payments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>As I explained before Deputy Fitzpatrick came into the House &mdash; and I am glad he is here now &mdash; the considerations that led us into not going the whole way in introducing these concessions were primarily financial.  It was our wish to bring in a comprehensive rent allowance system. But in the January budget we decided it would be better as an initial measure, given the cost problem that would ensure next year but not this year from introducing a broader allowance <Col N="443" /> system, to introduce an allowance solely for those who were over the age of 65.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel it is appropriate that the debate on the Committee Stage of this Bill be used as an opportunity for <Col N="444" /> improving on any proposal emanating from any Government.  As the House is aware, this proposal was one that was made in my budget and has been adopted by the present Government.  But the fact that I put it forward with the restriction to those over 65 does not mean, in the light of arguments advanced in this House from Deputies of any party, that one might not see the possibility of improving on that proposal.  Clearly, at a time when there was very limited finance available, it was reasonable not to extend it to all people, and reasonable to introduce a restriction to people who were over the age of 65.  However, if it proves possible to introduce a further distinction making the relief available to those under the age of 65 who have low incomes only and not to those with large incomes within the generality of the taxpaying public, if that becomes technically possible, as it now seems it is in the light of the debate so far, then it is right that we should consider whether this matter should not be examined again.</P>
      <P>The problem here is clearly one of cost. The Minister has told us that the cost of Deputy Gregory's amendment would be as I have already indicated.  He has also said, however, that if one were to choose a lower figure, if the maximum taxable income that one could have if one was to avail of the allowance was £2,500, one could arrive at a figure of £15 million for the full year cost.  If one took a taxable income figure of £2,000 one could arrive at a figure of £11 million.  On the other hand, if one took a figure of £1,000 taxable income one could arrive at a full year cost of £5,500,000.  While £24 million is a very substantial sum, £5,500,000 is not quite such a substantial sum.  I feel we need to look at this whole subject anew in this light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also feel that this debate must be influenced by the fact that the Minister has taken a totally negative attitude towards any amendments to this or any other section.  This has only emerged in the last few minutes when it became clear that the Minister was not prepared, even on Report Stage, to entertain amendments in respect of this matter.  I hoped, as I said in my opening remarks on this <Col N="445" /> section, that we would be able to reach a compromise.  I hoped the Minister would be as forthcoming on his side of the House as we wished to be in suggesting modifications, looking for costs, weighing up what we would like as against what we can afford and reaching a reasonable compromise between those considerations.  The Minister seems to have adopted a stance which in my view is a negation of the whole debating process in this House, the purposes for which the House has been established, that it does not matter what amendment or suggestions are proposed by anybody, no matter how reasonable they are or how much valid argument is proposed in their favour, he will not change a single line of the Bill so far as this matter is concerned.</P>
    <P>That seems to be a very unreasonable attitude for the Minister for Finance or any Minister to adopt in a matter of this kind, particularly when it seems a majority of the Members of the House want some change in respect of this section. The Minister, in opposing this, is speaking as a representative of a minority in the House.  That needs to be contemplated on by the Minister and by everyone else before judging if he is right in adopting such an inflexible attitude in respect of specific, realistic and modest proposals that might be made for some modification to help the low paid in relation to rental income.  While I have said I would not be totally happy with the extent of the concession that might be granted in Deputy Gregory's amendment, extending as it does to relatively substantial costs, I believe the Minister, if he wishes to have the co-operation of the House and the co-operation of the majority of Members in the House, should be more concerned than he seems to be, in reaching consensus as to amendments that could be introduced on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>We would not be asking him to spell out the nature of that amendment at this stage or to say what figure he would be prepared to agree to in terms of the maximum taxable income one could be earning before one could claim this relief but we would be asking him at least to give an indication that he is prepared to consider <Col N="446" /> amendments along these lines.  That is precisely the reverse of what he has indicated he is prepared to do.  He is not prepared to do anything.  He is not prepared to entertain any amendments whatever.</P>
    <P>The Minister may console himself by saying that this is showing great fortitude on his part.  I do not believe that is so.  It is fortitude at the expense of tenants in rented accommodation for whom small concessions could be made at relatively modest cost.  We have been canvassing various concessions, costing in some cases as little as £5½ million next year and, perhaps, even less if further modifications or restrictions could be introduced between now and Report Stage that would limit the concessions in one way or another to ensure that it was only those who are absolutely deserving get the benefit. It is unfortunate, and in many senses a negation of the processes of the House, that the Minister should adopt the attitude he has in this matter.</P>
    <P>I have also said &mdash; this is an important point that Members need to consider carefully &mdash; that we need to encourage the rented market for housing for economic and social reasons.  The position is that over the last 20 or 30 years the amount of available rented accommodation has reduced to about half of what it was at the beginning of that period.  Less rented accommodation is available and much more reliance is now being placed on owner-occupied accommodation.  The latter type of accommodation is a less flexible and less economical method of meeting our housing needs as a community because if one owns a house one keeps it for life regardless of whether one is using the full house or only some of the rooms in it.  At some stage in the family cycle one might use the house to the full but at other stages in the cycle one would find oneself only using one or two of the rooms with many left vacant.  If one owns the house one can do nothing about making better use of the available housing accommodation unless one breaks it up into flats.</P>
    <P>We have been pouring millions of pounds of the taxpayers' money and national resources into housing.  As long <Col N="447" /> as we keep disproportionately pouring it into owner-occupied houses we are going to have a situation where our housing stock will be seriously under-utilised. People may say that is a somewhat esoteric argument.  It is not and Deputies in Dublin constituencies know of couples who have reached the stage where most of their children have gone away and got married.  They will realise that there is a considerable amount of under-utilised housing accommodation in the area. Likewise, we have a situation where when families are at a certain stage, the early teenage-stage, the same house is not big enough.</P>
    <P>There is a reasonable case to be made for encouraging people, as is the case in other countries, to adjust their housing accommodation if they are living in an urban setting.  It is not possible in a rural area if one is living on a farm.  There is no reason why people should not be encouraged to move to and from houses that are more suited to their housing needs at a given time in their family's development.  That can be done relatively easy if there is a substantial and active rent-housing market.  Over the last number of years by giving disproportionate benefit, as Deputy Taylor correctly pointed out, to people in terms of mortgage interest to buy their own homes we have given disproportionate encouragement to a rigid owner-occupied housing market and discouragement to the existence of an active rented housing market by not allowing any tax allowance to one and allowing a significant tax allowance to the other.  The result has been that we do not have the flexible housing market or the best use of the housing stock we should have.  It is not due to the fact that, as many people say, the Irish people like to have a house of their own.  That is almost a social cliché that has become acceptable here.  People want a house that suits their needs at a given time.  The reason they are going for owner-occupied accommodation is that they get big tax advantages and because there are big tax penalties if they go for rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>The amendment in a modest sense is <Col N="448" /> seeking to remove this artificial imbalance in terms of incentive in favour of owner-occupied accommodation and radically against rented accommodation and the development of the rented accommodation market here.</P>
    <P>In this discussion we are raising issues of considerable importance not just in terms of the cost of the amendment which, if it is suitably modified, will not be very significant, but in terms of the best way of using our capital.  Any investment in housing is a utilisation of our capital and we must use it to the best possible result in terms of better accommodation for our people.  We need to encourage the provision of more rented accommodation and the amendment is a step in that direction.</P>
    <P>I should like to bring to the Minister's attention, and to the attention of members of his Party, the fact that Deputy Gene Fitzgerald in his budget in January 1981 introduced a proposal to encourage the provision of additional rented accommodation. He introduced a tax concession for the development of new rented accommodation, not a tax concession for the tenant.  That was a step in the right direction.  That move by Deputy Fitzgerald was a reasonable one to bring forward.  Our proposal is, broadly speaking, consistent with that trend.  We should try to see if we can find a way of suitably modifying the amendments being proposed so as to keep the cost at a relatively modest level and, at the same time, move in the direction of encouraging the rented accommodation market. We have discussed the various levels of cost that would be introduced and we need to look at them further because it is regrettable that the Minister has not given any indication that he is prepared to give consideration to any amendment on this subject now or on Report Stage.  The debate could have come to an amicable and speedy conclusion a while ago if the Minister had indicated such a willingness.  He did not do so and therefore we need to explore the matter further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton made quite a philosophical argument about the imbalance between rented and owner-occupied <Col N="449" /> accommodation.  That same imbalance existed in January.  It is not something that has happened since January.  It is easy for Deputy Bruton to talk about a compromise or concession ranging between £5½ million and £25 million when his great argument about the imbalance between rented and owner-occupied accommodation existed in January.  I cannot argue about that imbalance. I agreed with that point but it existed in January and the best Deputy Bruton could do then, as we are doing now, was to provide £900,000.  Now he is talking about expenditure ranging between £5½ million and £25 million and in my view that is hypocritical of a former Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>That begs the question as to the intention behind the attitude adopted by Deputy Bruton and Fine Gael in regard to this series of amendments, particularly amendment No. 33.  I have been accused of not being forthcoming and not being flexible.  I have said already that one could accept in principle the intention behind such amendments but, as they are budgetary measures, I cannot anticipate at this stage what budgetary decisions might be made in relation to any extension of the concession.  Like other Deputies, I could accept the intention in principle outlined in the amendments but I would be less than honest if I said I could come forward with an amendment on Report Stage.  I have already pointed out the anomalies that may occur when going this way in regard to taxable income.  I also pointed out the difficulties about administration and pointed out that the Report of the Commission on Taxation would be issued soon.  When that report is issued we will have an opportunity of looking at this whole area in regard to income tax, PAYE, PRSI and all other tax concessions.  That is as we said we would do and we hope to be in a position to make proposals arising out of that in the January budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot anticipate what the budget decision might be in relation to any extension of this.  It is disheartening to find Deputy Bruton, and Fine Gael, in the space of a few months deciding to support an amendment making the minimum cost <Col N="450" /> £5½ million and the maximum £25 million, particularly when in January they were prepared to spend £900,000.  That does not seem to make sense and their intention is not clear.  Between now and Report Stage they are seeking consensus between all parties and the Government on a figure ranging between £5½ million and £25 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy have anything left to say?  He should save his breath until then.  What we are charged with is to make decisions on the Finance Bill.  What we have been asking for is that a proposal in the Finance Bill be modified to take account of a number of arguments to which we attach some weight and to which the Minister said he could attach a deal of weight and with which he has sympathy.</P>
      <P>We are talking of a range between £5½ million and £20 million which would be the cost of the amendments which have been proposed in a full year.  We are also talking about a range between £3½ million and £10 million in 1983 which would be the range of possible alternatives to the specific amendments we are now discussing. The Minister seems to have moved to the position where he says that if anything was to be done along the lines we are proposing, it would not have a direct effect on the Exchequer until 1983. We have established that.  We are not talking about the effect on this year's finance but the effect of deciding in this year, 1982, to make provision similar to that in the amendment under discussion, but perhaps with a different income figure, and implementing that decision next year in 1983, leaving the Exchequer position under that head untouched in 1982 and leaving untouched, in so far as it is appropriate to use that word, the Minister's financial targets for 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is another area where the Minister disappointed me more than anything and has not given a full explanation of his objection to the suggestion we made. This was that we would make provision this year that the allowance would be granted and the whole matter would be <Col N="453" /> settled at the end of the tax year.  The Minister said that this would cause serious disruption of the whole PAYE system. When he was challenged about that he did not give an adequate answer.  I should like him to reflect on that again. He may find that when we take the fact that the financial impact of these proposed amendments would be in next year because of the way we have suggested the system be implemented, he might be a little more relaxed and flexible in his approach.  What we are proposing &mdash; we can frame an amendment at a later stage &mdash; is that the allowance be set up this year and that we make provision that people whose taxable income is not above £X would at the end of the 1982-83 tax year be granted an allowance in relief of a proportion of their income tax liability on the basis of the amount of rent which they had paid during that year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> For 1982?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Or for the year beginning 5 April 1982, if the Deputy wishes it that way.  We could look at those details if the Minister is open enough to accept that we can come back to it on Report Stage. They would get an allowance in relief on some of their tax liability at the end of 1982-83 tax year for rent which they proved they had paid during 1982 or the tax year 1982-83.  The effect is the same. If we end up, as Deputy Bruton said, at the end of the year making a refund of a proportion of tax to the individuals concerned, they have got value out of the concession for the year.  They may not have it through the year but they will have had value for the concession.  They will have had substantial relief on a part of their income tax liability and we will have achieved with that system what we set out to achieve with the amendment we have before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are technicalities.  The essential point is that it can be done at the end of the tax year.  The financial impact of it will be in 1983, as the Minister said.  It would not necessarily be a complicated calculation.  I am not sure the Minister has answered this point completely.  He <Col N="454" /> went into a discussion about what the complications would be for employers if they had to fill in various forms for their employees.  I do not see any reason why employers should be brought into it.  We should have a direct computation of the tax relief on the basis of the evidence presented by a beneficiary of the rent he has paid on the one hand and on the other the records available to the Revenue Commissioners on the amount of income tax the person in question has been assessed for during the year.  There is no reason for an employer to come into it.  It could be done independently of the employer.  There could be a direct transaction between the Revenue Commissioners and the person in question in order to settle his entitlement.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that we should move on this before we have the report of the Commission on Taxation.  I wonder what members of that commission must think when they read the debates we have in the House on the areas which cover taxation.  I am sure there were nights when they were unable to sleep because of anxiety about what next we would expect them to cover in their report.  I doubt very much that they will be able to produce a report next month, and that begins tomorrow, that will cover specifically everything that we expect them to cover.  I am not sure whether that report will go into the kind of detail that we would need to assess the merits of proposals such as the one we are discussing now.  In any case the Minister is not making of this a matter of principle.  He is prepared, and I congratulate him on this, to implement the measure which we had put forward in January to have effect this year.  He is prepared to do that without making any appeal to the Commission on Taxation and without waiting for them to produce their report.  Why, then, should he wait for the commission to report before operating the same kind of measures in favour of perhaps a much wider group of people?</P>

      <P>They must act on the basis of what we wish them to do.  But if on any occasion we are proved wrong, we must come back and amend the relevant part of our tax legislation.  Occasionally we <Col N="456" /> find that the mechanism set up by the Revenue Commissioners proves for one reason or another not to be entirely suitable for the job concerned.  Without intending any disrespect to the commissioners, it is our responsibility to have the system right, to say what way the tax system should work.  We are the ones who must go before the people every so often and put our heads on the block.  We are the ones who must explain to the public whether the tax system is doing what we want it to do and whether it is having the effect on them that we told them it should have.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made some play of the fact that the imbalance between rented and owner-occupied accommodation has not happened only since January.  He should not dwell too much on that argument.  The situation has not come about only since last January nor since last June nor in the last ten years.

      <P>Our whole cultural approach seems to be that the first step we want people to take on marriage is to saddle themselves with a debt that will continue for a large part of the remainder of their lives.  Not everybody who buys a house is in the position to which the Minister has referred.  Not everybody is in the position from time to time of constantly trading up in the housing market.  There are people who buy houses and who are never in a position to trade up.  A big proportion of those who buy houses of all kinds, whether local authority or privately-built houses, do so with the intention of remaining in them for the rest of their lives.  This is not a new development. Deputy Bruton was drawing attention to one aspect of a wider problem, which is that we seem to inculcate in our young people this almost automatic obligation that as soon as they marry, or even earlier, they must take on the very substantial debt involved in buying a house and this is probably at a time when they wish to start a family.  There <Col N="457" /> are other ways of dealing with the question of organising one's lodging for the rest of one's life.  I notice that the Minister has left the House.</P>

      <P>I cannot take very seriously the Minister's remark in criticism of us in terms of the financial effect this proposal will have.  As I have said, that financial effect would fall in 1983.  The Minister was at some pains to point out how much of it would happen in 1983 and how much would happen in a full year, but he seems to have forgotten that none of it would happen in 1982.  He seizes on this argument of circumstance to criticise us for putting forward an amendment while we had up to last January and indeed since made the point that we must take very seriously the financial targets set in budgets. We said at the time that we should take very seriously the kind of deficit we aim at securing.  To say the least I find it gratuitous of the Minister to come here and criticise us on a head of expenditure that would not occur until next year, to criticise us on grounds of financial rectitude when he has not told us from where he will get the £45 million which has been given away already this year after his own <Col N="458" /> budget and in complete contradiction of what he said on budget day.</P>

I ask the Minister to take that point on board and make it clear to some of his more vocal backbenchers here who do not seem to have understood what we are talking about as far as costing is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with some of the points which the Minister has brought forward in support of his totally obdurate stand in relation to a very limited set of proposals which will have the effect of doing something worthwhile without conferring a direct financial benefit in the year 1982 to which the Minister belatedly seems to attach some importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is by way of a general background to the kinds of things we have been saying. Once again I ask the Minister and Deputies on that side of the House to consider very carefully the following proposition.  If the Minister is not prepared to go as far as the amendment before us goes, that is to provide for relief in respect of rents where the taxable income of the person concerned is less than £4,500 a year, will he consider any one of the other suggestions which have been made such as that we would apply this either in the case of people whose taxable income is less than £2,500 a year or, failing that, less than £2,000 a year or, failing that, less than £1,000 a year? Thus we could make clear the acuteness of this problem which has been underlined by a number of Deputies on this side of the House and which I am sure is not unknown to Deputies on that side of the House and we can make progress and show that there is a commitment to making some further progress along that line than is seen in the Bill before us.  I ask <Col N="460" /> the Minister also to consider the possibility of simplifying the system to the point where we could do all of that without causing what he claims will be major disruption in the PAYE system which would not in any way be rendered necessary or inevitable by the amendments which we are proposing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment to amendment No. 33b:</P>
      <P>In subparagraph (i) to delete &ldquo;£4,500&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£2,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It may seem somewhat confusing but I am proposing an amendment to Deputy Gregory-Independent's amendment. Deputy Gregory-Independent has spoken quite eloquently, pointing out to the House that he wished to provide tax relief to persons with a taxable income of £4,500 maximum.  He did so, having withdrawn his earlier amendment No. 33a which he accepted has given, generally speaking, an imbalance of relief to single persons as against married persons.  The costs have become apparent in the House and, accordingly, I am moving that &ldquo;£4,500&rdquo; be removed from Deputy Gregory-Independent's amendment and that &ldquo;£2,000&rdquo; be inserted in place of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As every Deputy here knows, a married person's allowance under the current Finance Bill is £2,500.  If one adds to that say £300 for three children which is the current allowance, £50 for insurance and so on plus the special allowance for PAYE or PRSI of £312 or £600, a married person would have total allowances of £4,162.  Add on taxable income of £2,000, and roughly speaking, the effect of my amendment would be that anybody who is earning around £120 per week would get the benefit.  Deputy Gregory-Independent's amendment would give tax relief to about 55 out of every 100 taxpayers in the country.  That is a very large number.  Under mine, which is the amendment to the amendment, roughly <Col N="461" /> speaking about 19 out of every 100 would get the benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not an unfair figure because there are roughly 800,000 taxpayers.  The Minister said 70,000.  In fact my amendment is extremely modest. That would mean about one in every ten would get the benefit.  The cost is the biggest issue before the House today. The Minister has said, and we must accept his word, that Deputy Gregory-Independent's amendment would cost £15 million for nine months of next year and £25 million for the full year 1984.  I estimate that the £2,000 of taxable income relief, the basis that we would give, would be about £5 million or £6 million in 1983 and about £6 million, £7 million or £8 million in 1984.  The proposal is entirely modest and reasonable and must be contrasted with the fact that everybody in this House knows &mdash; Deputy McCreevy is an accountant &mdash; that the amount claimed for mortgage interest relief which Deputy Taylor has talked about is £60 million.  Deputy Taylor winkled out the figure of £9 million in respect of repairs to dwellings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I misled the House.  I said 70,000.  It should be 170,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I said 19 out of every 100 and 170,000 out of roughly 850,000 makes a lot of people.  In other words, putting it crudely, the worker Deputy Sherlock spoke of, the man with gross earnings of £120 per week, which is away below average earnings of £145 a week, <Col N="462" /> living in Mitchelstown or Mallow or Charleville or any town in north Cork who would not be getting full factory wages but just about what the employer would get away with giving him, would benefit from this if he is married with three children.  We are not asking the Minister to have this included in this year's budget; the money will be found in the 1983 budget.</P>
      <P>That would solve the problem.  There would be no division and Deputy Gregory-Independent would have ensured that the widows, the deprived, the poor and married men on low wages would benefit.  The lowest 20 per cent of PAYE wage-earners would benefit.  Private rented tax relief would not be given to the farming community because they do not come under the same tax system reliefs, nor would local authority tenants benefit because there is a differential rents system in operation.  That system has a large number of anomalies in it because it is not truly a wage-related system. It is wage-related only in so far as it takes into account basic wages, not true earnings. Income tax takes into account actual earnings.  If we want to reform the differential rents system, that should be done by this House, not just by NATO and the Minister at their annual jamboree. These are fundamental issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest the Minister accepts the amendment to the amendment.  This would mean Deputy Gregory-Independent would not push to a vote amendments Nos. 33b, 34a or 34b.  If the amendment to the amendment were taken first, it would avoid precipitating any traumatic results in terms of a vote.  We have spent all day discussing these amendments and I would like to be helpful.  Deputy Gregory-Independent spoke very clearly and indicated his willingness to act in a constructive way.  Neither he nor I knew what the cost of his first amendment would be until it was mentioned in this House &mdash; something of the order of £16 million for 1982 and £35 million in a full year.  I would have great difficulty in supporting such a move and, accordingly, I ask the Minister to accept the amendment to amendment No. 33b which <Col N="463" /> would give great relief and would be of considerable benefit to many people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> The Labour Party, The Workers' Party and Deputy Gregory-Independent have put down amendments to this section. I find it very difficult to see any sincerity in the speeches made by Fine Gael Deputies who failed to table any amendments to relieve people paying rents in the private dwelling sector.  I listened to Deputy Dukes and Deputy J. Bruton for a considerable time expressing concern for these people.  If they were so concerned they should have done something about it in their January Finance Bill.  The section dealing with relief for people over 65 years was included in that Bill, but they did nothing to help the rest of the people.  Circumstances have not changed and financial circumstances have not improved since then.  If they could not see their way to providing for these people then, I do not see how they can expect the Government to do so now.</P>
      <P>I read many of Deputy B. Desmond's speeches when he was very active in the Department of Finance.  At that time he should have asked his Minister for Finance, Deputy J. Bruton, to include these amendments. The situation in the private dwelling sector is causing grave concern.  I can see merit in the proposals put forward, but I know from experience that any improvements which have been introduced in this House, whether through the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Health, the Department of Labour or AnCO, were taken step by step.  We have taken a first step in this Finance Bill by providing a concession for those over 65 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A look should be taken at rents paid for private dwellings.  I have always been concerned about this problem.  I represent a Dublin constituency and can see the enormous rents being charged.  We should set up an inquiry to look into the rents situation.  There are many people in this city paying exorbitant rents for the accommodation offered.  A future <Col N="464" /> Finance Bill could make provision for them.</P>
    <P>People buying their own houses are given a tax concession on the interest they pay.  If we were to grant the concession in this amendment we would have to ensure that we were not encouraging landlords to further increase their rents. That would serve no purpose except to enhance landlords' incomes.  Landlords are not properly registered and we should have a comprehensive register.  We will be taking a step forward in this area when we pass the Landlord and Tenant Bill and we will also have a rents tribunal. This problem is so important that it should not be tackled on a piecemeal basis.  If concessions are given, they should be given to those in most need. We should have a list of registered landlords and we should lay down certain standards.  This is something we will have to do eventually.</P>
    <P>As I said, I see merit in these amendments. Deputy Dukes and others said the rebate based on the 1982 income would not be given until 1983.  It may not be paid in 1982 but the charges will be incurred during 1982 and the rebate will be given in 1983. I am convinced that any Minister for Finance framing future budgets would have to take into account rebates which would have to be paid at the end of that financial year and budgeted for in the current year.  It would be a good budgetary proposal to take it in the current budget, to pay the rebate at the end of the year and to carry on in the following year with the same kind of proposal. Implementation of Deputy Desmond's amendment would cost in the region of £5,500,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> If a rebate has to be given at the end of the financial year provision should be made for it some time during the year. Deputies will have an opportunity during the year to make proposals to the Minister regarding this matter.  I accept that there is merit in what is being proposed but all implications must be studied. If we establish in the Finance Bill the provision <Col N="465" /> to give the concession to those over 65 years, I have no doubt that the concession will be extended in future years.  This has been the practice in the area of social welfare.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that if anomalies arise they will be corrected and any loopholes will be closed.  If we introduce the provision this year the Minister for Finance will be able to build on it in future years. I know many people who are paying very considerable rent for one or two rooms while others who buy houses get tax relief.  However, we must be careful in the way we introduce the concession being sought.  Otherwise there will be a chaotic situation for the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners. We must establish clearly what exactly is the situation with regard to landlords and rents charged and, above all, we must make sure that when the concessions are given they will go to the people who pay the rent.  We must make sure they are not an encouragement to landlords to increase the rents.</P>
      <P>I accept that there is merit in the proposal but it needs much further examination. We have made a start this year and I hope that next year the Minister for Finance will consider the matter to see if it is possible to include other people who pay rent for private dwellings.</P>

      <P>After listening to Deputy Fitzpatrick and others it appears to me that everyone in the country has the right to make submissions or to have a view on what should be done with the amendments except the elected Members of this House.  I am not too concerned in this section to deal with suggestions made by my constituency colleague about tribunals and so on.  My view is that we should do what we were elected to do, namely, to deal with this legislation in a reasoned and reasonable way and to consider amendments in that light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All we have heard so far is innuendo, heckling and all kinds of nonsense from the Government benches with regard to reasonable arguments that have been put forward in the House.  So far as I am concerned, I have to look at the matter in the light of overall budget strategy and <Col N="466" /> in the light of the reasonable arguments that have been put forward.  The Minister's comments on mechanisms and consultation with the Revenue Commissioners are boloney.  It is our job as legislators to decide what goes into a section of a Bill and if there are difficulties at a later stage in administering the legislation it is a matter for those concerned to take it up with the administration of the day. It is a matter for this House to decide on the legislation we consider is appropriate for the people who elected us.</P>
    <P>I do not accept what the Minister has said.  In fact, all he did was to mumble something about mechanisms. I ask the Minister to give us a clear indication of where he stands, and if he is not in the position now to say where he stands on the section will he indicate to the House his overall attitude and take up the matter on Report Stage?  This would leave Members on this side of the House in a better position to consider the section and the amendments.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept any of the amendments or the figures mentioned in them &mdash; the most recent was the figure of £2,000 given by Deputy Desmond &mdash; will he indicate what figure he is prepared to accept?  Is he prepared to go away and consider the arguments that have been put forward with a view to putting something before the House on Report Stage?  At least this would give the House an assurance that he is taking account of the serious contributions being made here.</P>
    <P>The amendments have been put before the House in an orderly way but the only difficulty is that they have not come from Dublin West in the middle of a by-election or from Galway East prior to a by-election. If they had come from those areas the Minister would have no difficulty in finding the money, and a lot more money with it.  I do not accept any of the nonsense thrown out by the Minister in relation to this section.</P>

Then Members might be able to make a clear decision and get on with the business of the House.  From what the Minister has said it is very difficult to accept what will be the cost.

I do not see any great disagreement between us and any other Members of the House.  The amendment is very acceptable to most Members but I find it very difficult to see how any Member could introduce these amendments and not suggest that there is difficulty in private rented accommodation. Young married couples seeking temporary accommodation have difficulty in finding homes because they have or are expecting a child.  An English person or a Pakistani cannot get accommodation because of their accent or the colour of their skin.  This amendment has been brought into the House merely on a monetary consideration and not on humanitarian grounds.  I object to it because it does not deal with the underlying problems of rented accommodation. The great difficulty is that landlords and landladies are not subject to legislation in respect of discrimination and those who are anti-family.  I suggest to the proposers of the amendments that they withdraw them on the basis that there is a need to look at these aspects in conjunction with their amendments.  I do not disagree with Deputy Gregory-Independent on most issues, but the whole area of rented accommodation should be dealt with and not merely tax relief.  If Deputy Gregory-Independent could introduce a Private Members' Bill that would consider the human aspect and the appalling lack of accommodation for young married couples, the price of land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The right of the Fine Gael Party to intervene in this debate or to make a contribution in support of a relief in income tax for people who have not got houses of their own and who are forced by one circumstance or another into renting houses seems to be questioned by Members of the Government party.  They seem to think we have no right to make a contribution on this.  We have a perfect right to do so.  Deputy Bruton, when he was Minister for Finance, was the first Minister to write into a Finance Act a provision which gave relief to tenants of rented dwellings.  It is high time that such a provision was made.  I go further and say that, if in the past there were wrongs and necessity for such relief in respect of income tax, in recent times the necessity for such relief has been increased and is much more apparent.</P>
      <P>The house building industry is about to come to a halt.  I met representatives of the building industry yesterday evening and they told me that men are being laid off all over the city.  In Cavan, the biggest builder has laid off 50 men over the weekend. If that is any indication of what is happening all over the country the building industry is grinding to a halt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when we have more young people in the country than ever before, when people appear to be getting married younger than they ever did before, requiring more houses, we shall have an acute housing shortage.  We are now in a free and open market and it has been established by decisions of the Supreme Court that rent restriction, as it was practiced here since 1914, is no longer permissible in accordance with our laws.  All this seems to suggest to me that we are going to have a situation in which rents will be higher, in which people will be forced to pay rents they cannot afford. <Col N="471" /> Regrettably, and I say regrettably, we have reached a stage at which we need far more local authority houses than ever before.  In years gone by the trend here was towards owner-occupied houses.  The trend seemed to be that young people wanted to build their own homes some distance from a town, look after them and take a pride in them.  I suppose they still have that earning but nobody can convince me that they are able to afford the mortgage repayments to provide themselves with such houses even if they could get the necessary mortgage finance.  All that seems to me to impose a new obligation on our legislators and indeed on society in general to make up in some way for this new demand on householders, people who have to live in houses, and everybody must.  I cannot think of any better way of coming to the rescue of such people than by granting them the relief from income tax these amendments propose.  I am speaking now in a general way about the amendments.</P>
    <P>Whether people on the opposite benches believe it or not I have said I seriously and honestly believe that since the first day the PAYE system of income tax was introduced there was a huge obligation on our legislators, whether they be Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Coalition, to devise a fair system of taxation. It is high time that this little pocket here was removed from suits and that people paid on their income no matter what that income amounted to once it reached &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy, what we are discussing here is the question of relief of tax on rent paid on private dwellings.  I think the Deputy has an appreciation of Committee Stage debate and will realise that, on that, we are not talking about relief on mortgages, nor are we talking about the housing industry or PAYE.  I would ask the Deputy to direct his attention to the relief proposed in respect of private rented dwellings.</P>

What the Chair is doing with Deputy Fitzpatrick is what he has done with all speakers to date, in endeavouring to direct his thoughts and attention to the relief of tax on rent paid on private rented dwellings.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I will try and be very relevant, Sir.  It would be possible to enforce the rules of debate on Committee Stage to such an extent that one would merely be confined to saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; and I think the Chair would agree with me that that would be reducing things to an absurdity. If there were plenty of cheap houses in the country, if people had endless money and the building industry was flourishing there might be no necessity for this relief. But I make the case &mdash; I shall not labour it indefinitely or to the extent of nausea &mdash; and argue strongly that, in prevailing conditions, with a huge population of young married people seeking houses all over the place, with the price of houses gone out through the ceiling with people being forced into flats, this constitutes no more than the introduction of equity into the taxation system.  My colleague, Deputy Fitzpatrick <i>(Dublin South-Central)</i>, says there is undoubtedly good example the National Coalition Government introduced into the January budget which will be followed.  I am sure it will but that is a case of &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;.  A further effort should be made now, in this debate, to give some relief to the lower paid or income group which is what Deputy B. Desmond's amendment seems to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gregory suggested for people under 65 an income of less than £7,000. <Col N="473" /> Deputy Desmond goes considerably lower than that.  This is not giving something to well-off people.  This is a proposal to do something in ease of people who are getting it more than hard to live, more than hard to pay rent and make ends meet.  If that has to be done by biting into the better-off a little, then let it be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister should meet the amendments which have been debated here at some length.  There would be some hope were the Minister to come in here and say: &ldquo;Look I cannot do that but I am prepared to do this as a token of my concern for the people involved&rdquo;.  Even since January last things have got worse, even since January prices have gone sky-high.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole question of rented accommodation and the allowances given for it is a major social question. I believe the House should find time at some stage to conduct a debate on the whole area of rented accommodation and the major social difficulties surrounding it.  I feel to jump at it in a quick bite on the Finance Bill does not do justice to the real difficulties felt by people in rented accommodation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the particular amendment to amendment No. 33b recommending the figure of £2,000 against the earlier figure of £4,500 I hold the view that giving allowances of this nature in this way will almost certainly have the effect, which we are not trying to achieve, of putting up rents for people in those rented dwellings.  We could find ourselves legislating a subsidy for landlords if it is not accompanied by a wider package of rent laws.  For example, one such rent law, which I could suggest, is something to do with the standards of such accommodation. If you are going to give allowances perhaps you should not give them on every little room.  Perhaps we should say that we will give an allowance on rooms which conform to a certain standard of living, fire regulations and all the usual things most people take for granted.  Many of those little dwellings we are talking about do not live up to those standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would fear that broadening the net above 65 years, which is obviously a good idea and is a step in the right direction, in taking in the people under a certain figure would have the effect of putting up the rent.  I believe this is a major social question which the House has not addressed itself to for many years and should do so in the future.  I do not <Col N="475" /> believe that a subsidy is the answer.  I feel that control of rents and control of the standard of accommodation would be a much more sensible approach to it.  All this needs a broader look than is possible under an amendment to a section in the Finance Bill.  I feel it does not do it justice.</P>
    <P>This brings us back to the broader question.  Every single section in this Finance Bill could be amended by an extra £7 million or £20 million.  We had one last week about the exemption limit. There could be reasons given for raising the exemption limit.  Those are all excellent amendments and ideas but we come back to the basic principle that if you have a budget problem and a deficit problem and are committed to reducing it you have to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  While I welcome the 65 year old allowance, I ask that at some future date we get down to having a look at the overall social question of rented accommodation.  I feel we should not accept this particular amendment because it would have this effect which we would not intend.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on something Deputy John Bruton said much earlier. I welcome his philosophical approach to the overall question of rented accommodation versus private ownership.  We have to be careful about going too far in the other direction.  I take the view that one of the best ways to redistribute wealth, a phrase we all pay lip service to occasionally, is to encourage as many people as possible, through State assistance and so forth, to own their own homes.  If we go too far the other way and over-concentrate on helping everybody to get into rented accommodation and decide that this is suddenly the answer to all our problems, are we not centralising the power and the wealth in the country into the handful of people who own the rented accommodation and the master blocks of apartments?  Is that not centralising the wealth of the country into fewer and fewer hands?  The people who advocate strongly the rental system should be a little careful that this has not the effect of concentrating wealth in a few hands, which is not the way we wish <Col N="476" /> to run our society.  We want to spread the wealth as broadly as we can among the people who need it.  I would like to see a debate sometime on the whole social difficulty of rented accommodation.  In the meantime, I feel it would be unfair to interfere with the planned budget deficit by giving away too many millions of pounds and I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would like to make a few points on Deputy Barry Desmond's amendment to Deputy Gregory's amendment.  The principle, which is being sought, has already been incorporated in the Finance Bill and in the budget introduced to the House by Deputy John Bruton.  I believe there is agreement on all sides of the House that people over 65 in private rented accommodation should get such relief.  We are now discussing if this should be extended to other categories.  It is customary to think of the old as being the group in society who are most at risk.  Poor people are at risk particularly in relation to private rented accommodation.  This side of the House fully endorse the idea of a tax allowance for people over 65 who are frequently retired and in bad circumstances but old people have not a monoply of poverty and misery in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other sections in society who are on low incomes and who would be helped substantially by an income tax allowance along the lines suggested in Deputy Gregory's amendment and in the amendment suggested by Deputy Barry Desmond.  Many young people are very poor.  Young people aged 18, 19 and 20 years who have to leave their homes in different parts of Ireland, travel to Dublin and live in rented flats on low incomes are frequently very badly off. An allowance against their income tax would be very helpful to them.  I believe that all sides of the House agree that the man on £120 and £125 a week who would benefit by Deputy Desmond's amendment, with two or three children living in rented accommodation is being discriminated against <i>vis-á-vis</i> the home owner on equivalent wages or on higher wages. We have almost elevated to the level of a philosophy our help for home owners <Col N="477" /> and for people to purchase their homes. There is a lot of benefit available now under the income tax code to people who acquire a mortgage and become home owners.</P>
    <P>Some modifications to this were suggested by Deputy John Bruton in his budget.  These were incorporated in the Fianna Fáil budget of 25 March but they were subsequently dropped in the Finance Bill.  Income tax relief to the home owner is now being given at the highest marginal rate of 60 per cent. Another variation between the two budgets is that income tax relief of £9 million on repairs to houses is now restored but those in most need, the people who cannot afford to buy a house&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not necessarily disagree with the Minister bringing this in.  We have a philosophy that we want people to own their own homes.  It is very difficult for people to do so nowadays but we are not giving much help to those who rent.  I question the view from the Government side of the House that the fact that there is no register of landlords would prohibit us from extending this benefit.  One of the effects of this, if it was extended to all those who rented private accommodation, would be that very quickly we would have a register of landlords.  Those living in private rented accommodation would surely claim the allowance and, consequently, a very accurate register would be in the possession of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are considering the cost of <Col N="478" /> the various amendments it should be borne in mind that they are gross cost figures.  The acceptance of this suggestion would mean that an enormous number of tax evaders would then come to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners. We all know that those who have accommodation to rent frequently do not declare the income from it.  Very often the amount of rent received is watered down in tax returns.  While I accept that the Minister's figures are accurate in gross terms, I doubt if they have any substance at all in net terms.  It would not surprise me if the Minister ended up with more revenue following the introduction of this concession to those on low income.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the principle granted to those over 65 extended to all taxpayers. I do not have the information to put forward a suggestion as to the level of income one should pitch the concession at but Deputy Desmond's amendment, substituting £2,000 for £4,500, looks reasonable.  It seems to strike the right balance of income.  It would benefit those most in need without being extravagant and giving an allowance where one was not necessary.  I should like to ask the Minister to consider our contributions in the spirit they have been offered in and if unable to accept our amendment he should bring forward one on Report Stage to incorporate the ideas that have come from all sides of the House.  In the twelve months I have been a Member of the House I have not seen such agreement on anything.  Such a move would be welcomed by all in a non-contentious way.  Acceptance of the amendment is one way of ensuring that the Finance Bill progresses systematically although slowly through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the Deputy that Deputy Bruton on 27 January said that in present Exchequer circumstances it could not be afforded to give such a concession right across the board.  He said that, in order to focus first on the area of greatest need, the allowance would be made available to taxpayers aged 65 and upwards.  That statement was made by Deputy Bruton when he was Minister for Finance and <Col N="479" /> that provision is contained in the Finance Bill.  Unfortunately, the discussion on this matter has gone on for a long time. On many occasions I refrained from replying to some points because I did not wish to delay the proceedings but the discussion has been informative.</P>
      <P>The principle of the intention in the amendments is something we do not disagree with.  It is the timing, the cost and the implementation of such measures that need to be debated in greater detail. The cost of the amendment which proposes an income limit of £2,000 would be £7 million in 1983 and £11 million in a full year.  All Deputies should realise, particularly Deputy Bruton and other experienced Members, that proposals such as this are more appropriate to the budget.  It is a budgetary measure which is relevant to the 1983-84 tax year.  Therefore, it is more appropriate to the budget for that year.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to go into all the arguments that have been discussed here during the last five hours but I have been asked by a number of Members to have another look at this before Report Stage. I can agree to that but I am doing so &mdash; I want this clearly understood &mdash; without commitment.  I have been asked to have another look at the matter and I have been given other ideas which may be described as a commitment or not in regard to further budgetary measures but, as I have said, I cannot anticipate budgetary decisions for the future.  I do not wish to appear unco-operative and say I will not have a look at this matter between now and Report Stage.  I will have a look at it but it will have to be accepted without commitment.  I am prepared to do that.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's remarks.  It appears that persistence has paid off.  The many contributions today highlight the need for relief in this area for those who pay rent.  I hope the suggestions, if accepted, will benefit those who pay rents, which in cases are exorbitant, without getting any recognition for the money paid.  I accept that many people are in a position to pay the <Col N="480" /> rent but there are many on low incomes who are paying high rents having regard to the type of accommodation offered.  In some cases the rent is grossly excessive and unjust.  I say that by way of general criticism.  Many landlords have maintained people in good accommodation down the years and been paid a just rent but there are others who abused their position in regard to accommodation.  As a result we have had a big number of people seeking local authority houses.  I hope the Minister's recent statement will afford the House an opportunity of looking at it further and in the light of the amendments which were made extend relief as far as possible to more people whether by age, income or a combination of both.  This is very important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned last night I was dealing with the viability of the Fieldcrest plant.  I was speaking about the marketing situation. While we believe that the plant is viable and should be continued, I should like to point out some of the problems which arose in the development of the plant particularly in regard to marketing.  I refer to statements made by the president of Fieldcrest America in 1977.  That was over three years before the plant came on stream.  He said they were developing a European market and expected to take a significant share of it when the factory came on stream.  That was very good news.  We felt there were experts coming in who were not waiting until the factory was in production to find markets.  The scene changed in 1979 and in an interview with <i>Textile World</i> the president stated that the Fieldcrest marketing men were not too deep in Europe but were only approaching the threshold.  This was very disappointing.  In an article in <i>Business and Finance</i> on 18 March 1982 the same president said that they were changing from a totally domestic company to one which would be international.  Now he said they had an international point of view.  They were beginning to look outwards and would have to look abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 1979 £30 million, that is 90 per cent of the money, was committed to the plant.  This shows the makeshift approach to marketing and procurement of markets for the plant.  To add to these difficulties, we had a situation where there were incorrect towel sizes.  People might say a towel is a towel.  With any article one markets one must have the right product.  Size and style is important as is colour and this is where the marketing end failed.  It was a recipe for disaster. Sales were on an agency basis.  There was <Col N="482" /> no follow through by the Kilkenny plant. It was operated from America by a London-based sales agent.  Markets could not have been established with that kind of approach to selling the produce of one of our biggest plants.</P>
    <P>As a result I agree with The Workers' Party amendment that there should be an inquiry into why the American people were given 51 per cent of the equity of the company for £2 million.  Carrolls of Ireland had an investment of £8½ million and I am sure the Bank of Ireland had the same commitment.  The IDA had £12 million.  Yet these people were let in for £2 million and they walked away and left it to us.  I hope this will be reported to the Minister.  It is unfortunate that he is not here to hear it.</P>

      <P>Through PAYE and social welfare contributions the people who work there paid £100,000 per month. Now the State is paying them £250,000. That amount of money would be sufficient to continue the company in operation. The Minister may say the company lost £10 million.  I pointed out last night that most of this was lost when setting up the plant.  The plant cannot be sold at present but this is because we are in a recessionary period.  Would anybody want to buy a plant in such a time?  It is only natural that they would wait until the climate changed and there was a possibility of making a profit.  We all know that the IDA did their best to find a customer for the plant and we give them credit for that.  They launched a big worldwide operation to try to sell the plant but they have been unsuccessful to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to keep the plant open. <Col N="483" /> The Minister went to America recently. It is my information that there are not too many companies coming to locate here.  It is also significant that the Taoiseach in a statement on <i>Today Tonight</i> on Friday night said that where there was any hope of keeping an existing plant working it should be kept in operation and that we should not be going out and bringing in further new companies and going into a green field situation.  As a result, Kilkenny Corporation hope to meet the Taoiseach in the next few days and point out to him that we have a plant which could be made viable and profitable.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear that it was the Minister's opinion that he would be throwing good money after bad if he were to keep the company open.  That is not what the people in Kilkenny think.  It is not what the workers in Fieldcrest think. We are disappointed that this is the Minister's attitude.  Government agencies announce new projects with perhaps 50 jobs with a fanfare of trumpets.  Here we have 650 jobs at stake and many more in services in Kilkenny and there is nothing about them.  We have the best workers. There were no disputes in the factory. They reached 60 per cent capacity in production. About 85 per cent would have made it profitable.  This was in relation to a quality towel.  There are other products which the company could make to make up the other 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>The McKinsey Report states that this company could be profitable in 1983 if certain courses were taken.  In 1984 it would make a profit of £1.6 million and in 1985 £2.3 million.  They have confidence in the company.  This company began to trade in a recessionary period. It has never traded out of a recession. The market for textiles as well as for most other products is on the floor.  Can we not give this company a chance to trade in a reasonable market and, as a result, show that it is viable?</P>
    <P>Money has been provided by the Government for Clondalkin, Scarriff, Ardmore Studios, Talbot and so on.  A Bill was put through the House yesterday afternoon dealing with Irish Steel Holdings. <Col N="484" /> There are 500 people working there not 630 as there are in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>The company, which was modernised at a cost to the Exchequer of £80 million, lost in the year June 1981 a total of £26.3 million while the anticipated loss to the end of June 1982 is £22.8 million.  A fraction of that is all that would be necessary to maintain employment for the 630 people we are talking of.  That is why we are asking the Minister to take action in this case.  Irish Steel Holdings are not expected to be profitable before 1986 or 1987.  The Minister has told us that the steel market is poor and that prospects for the company are precarious.  Having regard to this sort of situation, one can only conclude that there is much discrimination in so far as Kilkenny is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am calling on the Minister to visit the Fieldcrest factory and to see for himself what the situation really is.  I am confident that if he does so he will make up his mind to make available to the receiver the finance necessary to keep the company in operation until such time as arrangements can be made to keep it open on a long-term basis.  We are not supporting The Workers' Party amendment. It is not specific enough whereas the Labour Party motion and our amendment are specific in asking the Minister to open this factory in 1982.  I might add that voting either for or against the amendment will not be the cause of a general election but if the motion is carried it will give heart to the workers involved, to the people in the service industries there and to people of the surrounding counties also.  I will be very disappointed if Kilkenny is discriminated against.  This is the first Government-promoted factory ever to be located in Kilkenny and it would be a scandal if it were to be allowed to die at this stage.  I am disappointed that the Minister has not been present during my contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the motion before the House and the amendments to it spell out the same message, that is, showing our concern for the 630 people whose jobs have been lost at Fieldcrest and asking that those jobs be replaced either in the Fieldcrest operation as we know it or <Col N="485" /> by way of an alternative industry.  There is a call in one of the amendments for an inquiry into the whole operation of the plant from the time it was opened until it closed down.  Our first concern must be for the 630 workers involved.  The despair among the people in Kilkenny can be readily recognised.  There is distress and hardship on the part of the workers concerned, many of whom left secure employment to live in Kilkenny and build their future around the Fieldcrest operation. Who would blame them for having done that when one of the companies in that partnership were one of the leading firms in the US together with the banks and Carrolls, who are one of the leading companies in this country?  Indeed, Fieldcrest, Kilkenny, could be described as the Rolls Royce of Irish industry but now it could probably be compared to an old Morris Minor.  The reality of the situation was brought home to us when the receiver announced that the factory was closing.</P>
      <P>Many of the workers had come back to Kilkenney and bought houses there.  Their situation now in terms of the loans and mortgages to which they are committed is intolerable.  It was very sad to hear that immediately after the factory closed the banks informed those employees who had availed of special loans that the interest rates were to be increased immediately. For people facing the dole queue that was very bad news.  There were many others, too, who had committed substantial amounts on foot of the setting up of that factory.  For example, local traders had expanded their businesses in order to gear themselves to what they expected to be boom trading years, but how quickly that dream has failed.  Even the local authorities spent huge amounts on the provision of services to facilitate the Fieldcrest operation by way of ensuring that the best possible services were available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big question we must ask is why the project failed.  There was an excellent work force there and during the period of the factory's operation, only half an hour was lost by way of industrial disputes. That is an impeccable record and one that any company would be proud <Col N="486" /> of.  The average age of the workers was 24 so that what we are talking of is a young skilled work force that would be the envy of any company.</P>
    <P>We know that the management and marketing organisation of the company were deficient.  The marketing was undertaken from a London-based office without any communication with Kilkenny and reporting directly to the US.  We know also that the question of design and taste was not taken into consideration. But, leaving aside all that, we must ask why the company were allowed to continue without any question being asked while bit by bit the operation was being run down.</P>
    <P>Another question we must ask is why Fieldcrest with an investment of £2 million were able to take 50 per cent of the shares in the company.  The banks held an additional 25 per cent while the remainder was held by Carrolls.  The IDA invested £10.6 million in the plant and there was an additional £1 million spent on training.  Yet the IDA had no say in the running of the company.  That sort of situation is far from desirable.  While I do not think there should be any post mortem or witchhunt at this stage, there is a lesson to be learned from what has happened. Whoever made the decisions in regard to this plant initially probably did so in good faith.  However when I learned recently that final approval for the project was issued one week before the 1977 General Election, I wondered whether this was indicative of many of the decisions made at that time in relation to this operation.  We were told then that there were potentially 1,200 jobs involved and that that target would be reached within a certain number of years.  A short two years later there is no job there.  Whoever made the original projection was very far out.</P>
    <P>In terms of employment, the Fieldcrest operation absorbed 30 per cent of the total work force in Kilkenny city.  Therefore, one can imagine the effect that the closure has had on the area.  One can add this to the many other closures that have occurred in Kilkenny in recent times &mdash; Quigley Magnesite, another American company who decided to pull out and the <Col N="487" /> many small engineering works which were flourishing at one stage but which also have gone.  In addition there is the stoppage at Castlecomer mills.  As a result of all of this, the situation in the area is very bleak.  I call on the Minister to make a decision that Kilkenny be declared a disaster area.  In view of what has happened over the last two years, particularly the closure of Fieldcrest, special consideration should be given to the Kilkenny area.</P>
    <P>Should this factory ever have been put in Kilkenny?  We were told a few years ago that this was certainly a viable operation and now we are told that it is not. Fieldcrest Kilkenny never got a proper opportunity.  They started in a recession. They should have had some special concession to ensure that they would ride over rough times and get to a profit-making position which they did not expect to attain until 1984.  A few months ago a restructured package was drawn up between the various partners in which they decided that they would invest £28 million and part of that investment would be £8 million from the State in the way of grants.  Taking into consideration that £8 million which was agreed on, the loss of PAYE and PRSI which I understand amounts to about £5 million per annum and the payment of social welfare that would have to be made to these workers, we are talking about £15 million alone. This £15 million could be put to better use in the Fieldcrest factory than being paid out in social welfare.  The workers of Fieldcrest do not want social welfare. They want work, and we are appealing that they will get that work through whatever means are available.  I ask the Minister to ensure that work is made available to the people of Fieldcrest.</P>
    <P>Recently I was informed reliably that Fieldcrest America are now looking for the European market which was there for Fieldcrest Kilkenny.  If Fieldcrest Kilkenny try to prevent them breaking into this market they will be put into liquidation immediately.  The only hindrance to Fieldcrest America getting that European market which was dearly fought for is that they must pay 16 per <Col N="488" /> cent duty.  Fieldcrest America by spending £2 million in Fieldcrest Kilkenny have succeeded in breaking into the European market.  It is a sad day in Kilkenny or any place in Ireland when we can be used by an American company to break into the European or any other market.  Our Government should take this to the attention of the EEC to ensure that this type of operation will not continue, because we are nothing but pawns in a chess game at this rate.</P>
    <P>This is not a time for a post mortem. All Members who have taken part in this debate have indicated that their prime interest in opening the factory either as it exists or by any other means whatsoever is to ensure that those 630 jobs are recreated for the people in Kilkenny.  We must learn from our mistakes, and we must look into the whole operation of huge investments into companies and we must get better guarantees than two years' operation here in Ireland, because that is all we have got out of Fieldcrest America.  When Fieldcrest came to Kilkenny we had not a very bad unemployment situation.  We imported the problem that we have in Kilkenny now. We could have done without Fieldcrest had we known what was to happen.  We would have been much better off if Fieldcrest had never come to Kilkenny.  It is easy to say that now, but that is the situation.  We have imported the problems, we have mass unemployment in our city.  Our traders, shopkeepers and various other people are suffering because of what has happened.  It is time that this sort of what I call shady operation came to a halt.  Many very successful companies have come in here and have done a good deal for the Irish people and the employment situation in general, but one can become very suspicious when one sees how this whole operation came about and how it ended.  Some lesson must be learned from it.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying I hope he will tell us the exact position with regard to Fieldcrest Kilkenny.  Have the company definitely gone?  Will they open again?  What progress has been made? These questions must be answered in the interests of the people of Kilkenny and <Col N="489" /> county as a whole.  Is the plant viable? Was it viable two years ago?  If it is not viable now how was it viable two years ago?  Can it be made viable?  Would that mean new plant and machinery?  How can we tackle this to make sure the people return to work?  It was boasted that this was one of the most modern factories in the world; we had the best work force in the world, yet it all came to nothing. Fieldcrest Kilkenny are no longer in operation.  Masses of people are on the dole queues.  What does the future hold for those people?  The people in Kilkenny are very tolerant.  I hope the Minister will realise that and will give Fieldcrest Kilkenny the attention they merit to ensure that the people there are returned to work.  They do not want dole, they want sound jobs and are prepared to work at those jobs.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to answer the questions I have posed and that the fact that we have had this debate here will ensure that it will not be too long before the wheels are turning in Fieldcrest Kilkenny either with the operation as it was or with a new partner or group of partners.  We do not mind how it comes about provided the work is supplied for the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>Tonight I feel even more saddened than I did when here on 9 June last I made an appeal to the Minister to bring pressure to bear on the Government to keep this plant in operation for some time at least in order to give an opportunity to try to get a purchaser. Unfortunately, that pressure if it was there was not successful, and tonight my concern is for the workers who now are idle and not alone in the city and county of Kilkenny but in the adjoining counties also.  These people in all good faith went into Fieldcrest a little over two years ago.  I was at the official opening and I looked then on the future of that company as one of the greatest that anyone could imagine for a company in this country.  They were being funded and backed by people for whom I had over the years the greatest regard, the IDA. The Bank of Ireland, who are not in the habit of going into ventures such as this, <Col N="490" /> and Carrolls were prepared also to invest in Fieldcrest Ireland Ltd.  My thoughts were shared by the many people who left other employment, came back to Kilkenny and took up positions in this mill because they wanted to live among their own people.</P>
      <P>It was my impression that this company never got a chance.  For a Government to allow the doors to be closed on a factory which had been in operation for only two years was very wrong.  These people working in Fieldcrest had made their homes locally and looked forward to full employment for the rest of their lives.  I am still waiting for an answer about what went wrong.  It was not the fault of the workers.  The people in Fieldcrest are convinced, as I am, that this is a viable operation.</P>
      <P>I cannot imagine how any Government could allow this factory to close.  To create such unemployment was wrong.  We must look at what this unemployment will cost the Department of Social Welfare &mdash; I believe it will cost in the region of £240,000 per week.  There was investment by the IDA, Carrolls, The Bank of Ireland, and Fieldcrest; capital investment of only £2.5 million got them 51 per cent of the equity in the company.  We welcome foreign industrialists but is it right that at a time of recession they should be allowed to walk out and leave 630 people unemployed without any future prospects, unless the factory is reopened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was on a number of deputations that ment the Minister and hoped a buyer would be found for this plant and we all shared that hope up to the time the factory doors closed.  As I said on numerous occasions, it is easier to get a buyer for a factory in production than for a factory which is closed.  I hope it is still possible to get this factory back into operation.  I appeal to the Minister to use his influence to get the wheels in motion and to get these 630 people who have nothing but unemployment facing them back to work.  That can be done if enough pressure is exerted.  I am not speaking of political pressure because during this debate each representative from my constituency, of various political views, <Col N="491" /> expressed concern.  We do not consider it an excuse to be told by the Government that they do not have the money to keep this factory going.  They were supposed to have the money for the Clondalkin Paper Mills, the Talbot motor works and the inner city.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Crotty, mentioned that this was the first factory ever established in Kilkenny by the State.  Let it not be said that this factory closed because the Government refused to reopen it and to give employment.  We mouth pious platitudes and talk about youth employment which, I believe, is a plank in the manifesto of the present administration, and tonight we heard that the average age of the workers in that factory was 24 years.  Everything must be done, and will be done, to ensure that they get a chance to earn their living in this Kilkenny factory.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay a tribute to everyone concerned with Fieldcrest, the workers and those who accompanied me on deputations, for the orderly way they conducted their negotiations at a time of uncertainty and hardship.  I believe the Minister is sympathetic because he gave the deputations the impression he would do what he could. I do not doubt that but saying he will do his best is not good enough.  I and my colleagues want action on this matter.  On behalf of the people in my constituency and in the adjoining counties, I ask the Government to come to the rescue and to give back their jobs to the 630 workers of Fieldcrest.  As things stand these people have nothing to look forward to in the future.  I appeal to the Minister to put pressure on the Government to reopen the factory.</P>

      <P>I share the same concern for the young skilled workforce of Fieldcrest. As a result of the failure of the plant and of a decision by the promoters to put in a receiver who closed the plant &mdash; it was not the Government who closed it &mdash; I accept that the livelihood of many people was affected and I share the concern of other Deputies for the social and financial <Col N="492" /> problems with which these people have to cope.</P>
      <P>The Deputy spoke about sincerity and reality.  Politicians in this House should be sincere in the way they approach this type of situation.  We should tell the people what is the real position.  We should not create expectations that cannot be lived up to, because that would be unfair.  For Deputies to think that bringing in a notice of motion here is the answer to the situation at Fieldcrest is unrealistic.  These people are not living in the real world and they are not facing up to their responsibilities as Members of this House.  At the moment the work force believe certain information that is being disseminated but which is not based on fact.</P>

      <P>However, the motion before the House and the amendment which has been moved, if adopted, would represent a fundamental and far-reaching shift in the policy of successive Governments towards industrial development.  I would not be surprised if this were not realised but I must make it clear to all Members of the House, and they must be fully aware of the consequences when voting on this matter, that neither the Government nor the Minister for Industry and Energy is legally in a position to instruct the Industrial Development authority to make finances in any form available to any particular company.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> The IDA were established by the Oireachtas as an autonomous agency and have functioned as such an agency with the agreement of the Houses of the Oireachtas for over 30 years.  Acceptance of the motion before the House would undermine the functions of the IDA which have been carefully entrusted to them and would lead to the undermining of the confidence and trust placed in the authority.</P>
    <P>A Private Members' motion is not the vehicle by which a major change in industrial development strategy is brought about.  As the House is aware, a major review of industrial policy is underway at present and I am committed to the publication later this year of a White Paper on the subject of industrial development strategies to be pursued to the end of the decade.  This publication will present the appropriate opportunity for the house to express its view on present policies, on any shortcomings which it feels exist and to put forward proposals for improvement.</P>
    <P>It is in such a context that industrial policy generally should be discussed, not in the context of a Private Members' motion relating to one firm only.  I might mention here that the competence and ability of the IDA are the envy of most other countries and they have been recognised as the most successful and professional development authority in the world.  Acceptance of the motion by the House, undermining the authority's autonomy, would at least dent their image if not damage it irreparably.</P>
    <P>The Fieldcrest towelling operation in Kilkenny has been the subject of much public discussion and indeed was discussed at length here not only last night but on 9 June.  Given the importance of the issue and the amount of attention which the subject has received, I welcome this opportunity of setting the record straight in relation to this project. I think it important that I should outline the history of the project up to the time of its closure, before dealing with the present situation.</P>
    <P>The first proposal which came before the Government in July 1975 was for the establishment of a towel manufacturing <Col N="495" /> plant in Kilkenny with Fieldcrest the only promoter of the project.  That package which was approved by the Government involved direct investment by Fieldcrest and grant assistance from the IDA.  Following this approval, the board of Fieldcrest reviewed the project and requested a revision of some of the elements of the project in the light of the continuing economic markets, the rate of inflation in cial markets, the rate of inflation in Ireland and <i>de facto</i> sterling devaluation <i>vis à vis</i> the US dollar.</P>
    <P>Following subsequent negotiations between the IDA and the promoters, the Government approved a revised package in January 1976.  In August 1976 Fieldcrest were of the view that the project could not proceed without a joint venture partner.  Fieldcrest and the IDA then conducted a search for a suitable partner because it was clear that failure to find such a partner would lead to the project having to be postponed indefinitely.  P. J. Carroll &amp; Company Limited and the Bank of Ireland decided, subject to the approval by the Government of a revised grant package, to participate with Fieldcrest in the Kilkenny venture.  This decision was taken after detailed technical, financial and marketing studies, commissioned by the Irish partners, had confirmed previous research by Fieldcrest that the project was a viable one.  Thus in May 1977 the Government approved a new package now involving Fieldcrest, the Bank of Ireland and Carrolls as promoters. The total investment in the Fieldcrest project was £25 million by the bankers as loans, £16 million approximately in equity from the promoters and £11 million by the State through the IDA.  The State thus contributed about 20 per cent of the total investment.  These are the actual figures which speak for themselves. For Deputies to contend that the promoters' contribution was negligible is clearly not supported by the facts.  It is a matter for the promoters when putting a product to the IDA Authority to decide between themselves in what way the shareholdings are to be distributed.  That is a decision for the promoters when they are making any proposition and it is not <Col N="496" /> unusual in this or any other case.  I think it is useful here to remind ourselves what the intentions of the promoters were.  The intention was to establish in Kilkenny a modern facility capable of producing high quality towels which would be sold on the European market.  The success of the project would depend on a number of things being right.</P>
    <P>The product would have to be of an acceptable standard, output would have to be high enough to justify the very large overhead cost, the price on the European market would have to be both sufficiently competitive to make the prospect of competing with existing producers a realistic one and, at the same time, be sufficiently high to cover the cost of production.</P>
    <P>From the time production started there was a number of problems in the Kilkenny operation such as quality control. This in itself is not unusual when a new plant comes onstream.  Of more importance was the unexpected and continuing failure to penetrate the European market to the extent necessary to make the Kilkenny operation viable.  Fieldcrest's considerable experience and success in the United States market did not translate successfully to the European market.  The net result of this was that the company incurred losses of £10 million to September, 1981, losses which now amount to about £14 million.  In fact, in the year ended 30 September 1981, they incurred losses of some £6 million on sales of £10 million.  These are not my figures, they are audited figures which anyone can inspect.  Sales on the European market were indeed being achieved but not to the extent projected originally by the promoters.  Moreover, the losses on these sales were quite dramatic.  These losses which culminated in the closure of the plant on 11 June 1982 have been attributed to the severe downturn in world markets but there is also evidence that the company's management and marketing organisation was deficient.</P>
    <P>There is not doubt that the setting up of a marketing organisation based in London, reporting directly to the United States and not to the manufacturing base in Kilkenny, was a serious deficiency and did not enable the company to penetrate <Col N="497" /> the European market to the extent necessary to make the operation viable.  This organisational set-up was a contributory factor in the ultimate collapse of Fieldcrest.</P>
    <P>The problems which faced the project were recognised and faced by the promoters. In the course of 1981, consultants were appointed whose recommendations in their preliminary report were, in essence, that a new marketing strategy should be adopted and a comprehensive financial restructuring be undertaken. The restructuring package, which involved substantial additional State assistance together with further contributions from the promoters, was approved by the then Government in December 1981.  This financial package was structured to provide that: The Irish partners could ensure that the company strategy and management were geared to the demands of the European market; the restructuring package was based on the assumption that, with the right management and marketing, the company would have been able to achieve the requisite level of sales and make the restructuring pay off; the three partners would contribute in approximate proportion to their present shareholding; the Irish partners, as a result of the timing of their contribution, would bear a higher proportion of the business risk, and would be in effective control of the company; and funds would be injected annually over a three-year period but the parties would be contractually committed to make each investment at a specified date provided previously agreed performance targets were achieved by the company.</P>
    <P>At the time of approval of the further financial assistance for the company which as I said was in December 1981 and which I repeat was based on a preliminary report, it was projected that the proposals then put forward would establish the project on a sound financial basis. However, and I would like the House to understand very clearly the following, that particularly because of the market situation, it was recognised by the then Government that the future prospects for the company had still to be categorised as high risk.  That background to the <Col N="498" /> Government decision must not be forgotten. Nevertheless, it was confidently expected that all partners in the company would co-operate in the implementation of the proposals.  Unfortunately the consultants' final report which came to hand in early February 1982 did not, as expected, confirm the market forecasts and projection as outlined in the preliminary report.  This final report, the continuing and deepening of the recession allied to the company's losses caused the American partners, Fieldcrest, to lose confidence in the turn around of the company and they decided to withdraw from the project because the company was insolvent. This culminated in the appointment of a receiver to the company of 9 March 1982, on the day I took office.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt anybody. I will sit around a table and put the facts in front of anybody who is interested. After the appointment of the receiver, both he and my Department, through the offices of the IDA, made intensive efforts to secure a takeover of Fieldcrest as a going concern.  I know it hurts when the truth comes out.  It hurts because the Opposition are the people who took the responsibility of putting it there and who restructured the package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA contacted up to 100 companies in the textile sector and, specifically, pinpointed 12 individual companies, who as world leaders in the textile sector, offered the greatest prospects for a take-over of Fieldcrest.  Those 12 companies were visited by the IDA and, as a result senior representatives of most of them visited Fieldcrest.  Also, at the request of the receiver, a firm of international textile consultants carried out a study of the plant with a view to determining whether its facilities might more profitably be employed diversifying its production facilities into other sectors of the towelling market or into alternative products. As a result of that assignment, the consultants visited a number of companies with a view to interesting them in the plant.  However, none of the companies <Col N="499" /> contacted by the IDA made an offer for the plant as a going concern.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of inquiries to date from interested parties arising out of the IDA's strong drive to attract a new promoter or combination of promoters. However, none of these has so far translated into offers for the plant as a going concern.  Three of these inquiries are being actively pursued by the IDA at present.  I must point out here that the IDA in seeking a takeover of the Fieldcrest plant have had an open mind about the type of package which would be involved.  I did not give them a narrow brief.  The people who are charged with that responsibility know their business and have served this country well.  For someone to suggest otherwise is another inaccuracy.  The IDA in seeking a take-over of Fieldcrest, had an open mind about the type of package involved and it is not, as has been implied, a case of the IDA seeking a purchaser for Fieldcrest in the same fashion as the receiver. The possibility of IDA involvement in such a project has never been excluded.</P>
    <P>The question of Government assistance towards a reopening of Fieldcrest when a viable operation can be put together has never been in doubt and I assure this House and the people of Kilkenny that the Government will never be found wanting when the project can be put properly together.  The possibility of IDA involvement has never been excluded and I hope everyone accepts that.</P>
    <P>The receiver has no immediate plans to dispose of the assets and his plans in this regard will be contingent on the take-over prospects.  I must add that the receiver has made every effort to facilitate the Government's efforts to arrange a takeover.  There is no question of this plant being broken up in three weeks' time.</P>
    <P>In relation to the future of Fieldcrest, I must put it on record that my information is that if the Fieldcrest plant were to be reasonably profitable it would need: (a) sales of £25 million per annum; (b) a major textile partner with expertise in production and marketing; (c) change in <Col N="500" /> equipment; and (d) a large injection of money.  The market has not been there up to now for the quantities of product which would make the plant viable and certain of the companies which visited Kilkenny said that if they were to become involved they would have to consider changing the product by the replacement of existing equipment &mdash; looms &mdash; which they regarded as unsuitable for their production needs.</P>
    <P>The point has been made by some Deputies that if the project in December 1981 was regarded as warranting Government assistance what has changed since then.  A number of things, a number of very fundamental things have changed including the final less optimistic report on market prospects by the consultants. Fieldcrest, the United States promoter, withdrew from the project.  The Irish partners in the project have also withdrawn.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is only wasting time, he does not want to know the facts of the case at all.  There can be no doubt that the placing of the company in receivership, something done by the banks, had an impact on the market for the company's products.  That is why the situation is quite different now from that which existed in December 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to turn now and look in detail at what has been happening to the pricing of the company's products, and the Deputy might listen carefully.  Prior to closure the company had established a standard cost which assumed an 85 per cent level of production capacity.  Such a production level has never been achieved.  The company has been producing at approximately 60 per cent capacity level but using the same cost as if production was at the higher, 85 per cent capacity level.  As costs have not been reckoned on the basis of actual production, that is at the actual 60 per cent capacity level, the company has been selling well below real cost.  Successful marketing, which is required here, is the ability to put the right product into the right market at the right price at the right time. That is something on which everybody is agreed.  Unfortunately, Fieldcrest had at least two of those wrong.  The product needed to be adapted to European requirements and the price needed to be <Col N="502" /> increased, or output increased and unit prices reduced.  Unfortunately, the timing of the Fieldcrest investment was not ideal because of the recession.  Unfortunately, also the course of action proposed in Deputy Pattison's motion is not practical. Many companies with extensive experience in towel-making have to date declined to become involved in the Fieldcrest operation even on very favourable terms offered and Deputy Pattison's motion in reality, therefore, calls on the Government via the IDA to take over with the help of existing management and workers the running of a towel manufacturing operation and a sales business.  I do not doubt the ability for one moment of the management and workers or their resolve in this matter but it is not the business of the Government or the IDA to become involved in the management of the production of high quality towels and the sale of them in a concentrated European market to the extent required. The scale of potential production in Fieldcrest was vast &mdash; amounting to 140 miles of towel per week.</P>
    <P>That is the scale of the problem when one talks about making Fieldcrest viable, about the IDA and the Government instituting the marketing organisation to sell that quantity of towels.  Profitable disposal of this amount is the marketing task which could have to be faced.  Again I must stress the need for a promoter who has the ability and will to penetrate the European market.  It is the absence of this factor rather than the absence of Government will or Government financial resources which has meant the closure of Fieldcrest.</P>
    <P>The realistic approach is to look at the project as it is, recognising that a market does not exist for the quantity of output which would make the operation viable, as it stands, to try to attract people who will enlarge the product line and establish sustainable employment.  This is precisely what the IDA are doing and will continue to do with full Government backing. They are at present discussing possibilities with a number of firms regarding Fieldcrest.  I am, and the House now is, fully aware of the extent of the problems. Solutions must be found but the Government <Col N="503" /> cannot be expected to do what companies who are very experienced in the marketing field cannot do.  The only sensible course is that being pursued at present by the Government in endeavouring to attract a promoter or a combination of promoters with the requisite skills both in terms of technology and marketing who can ensure that whatever is produced in Kilkenny can be sold in sufficient quantities to guarantee the future of the plant.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of inquiring into the reasons for the failure of Fieldcrest. As Deputy Pattison has indeed said, I do not want the IDA inhibited in their contact with industrialists, Irish or foreign, by the shadow of witch-hunting. There can be no productive outcome from witch-hunting.  However, when there is a failure of the size and importance as Fieldcrest it is useful to see how and why it happened.  I am not talking about a public inquiry.  An examination should, however, be carried out of the process involved in committing a substantial amount of State funds to the project. It should be established whether the failure could have been reasonably predicted, and if so, why the investment took place.  As Minister I must take steps to ensure that any required improvements in the decision-making process in projects such as these are carried out.</P>
    <P>It has to be recognised, of course, that any new industrial project carries a risk and some, inevitably, will fail.  There is no crystal ball available when decisions like this are being made.  The only sure way of avoiding failure is to do nothing. Nevertheless, we must do what we can to minimise the risks of failure.  The examination which is proposed in my amendment is just that sort of mechanism.  I think it only sensible to learn from failures, whether they be our own or others. An inquiry on the lines suggested by The Workers' Party could have an inhibiting effect on would be investors not alone in Fieldcrest but in industry generally in Ireland and could lead to a loss of additional industrial projects and additional employment.</P>
    <P>In summary, what I am saying to the <Col N="504" /> House is simply this, I have demonstrated clearly to the House that this Motion is not the vehicle by which to change industrial policy and strategy.  If the House does not accept that I want Members to think clearly before voting on this motion &mdash; that they are voting to change and undermine what successive Governments over 30 years have entrusted to the IDA, the autonomy to enable them assess any project.  If Members want to short-circuit that by coming into this House and call on any Minister, whoever he may be, to take decisions on such projects, then I would remind them that they are on the slippery slopes.  I can tell them also that I know where they will finish up.</P>

      <P>I shall turn now to some of the suggestions made.  Deputy Pattison said last evening and I quote him:</P>
      <P>Neither do I suggest the IDA or the Government should artifically keep Fieldcrest open only to close it again in a few years time.  That would be an insult to the workers and a waste of public money.</P>
      <P>Deputy Pattison must be aware, as I am, that to take over the operation, as he suggests, would cost the taxpayers of this country £8 million, in a situation in which 70 per cent of the sales that have gone out in recent times have gone to Marks and Spencer and Carrefour.  Is he suggesting that the taxpayers of this country and, indeed, to this House that we should subsidise those customers to the tune of that amount of money?  If he does not want to take over something that will be a liability on the State, neither do I nor do I think does anybody else.</P>

      <P>They should realise that I want to reopen it, the IDA want to reopen it, everybody else wants to reopen it.  I have made it abundantly clear that the success of any business venture is simply as Deputy Pattison enunciated last evening and was the response he got from one of the companies who deal with Fieldcrest.  They are prepared to deal with any new company, to continue business with the new company provided delivery, price and quality continue as they were.  I have clearly demonstrated to the House this evening that there is no way the price can remain as the price they were paying for it clearly because of the costings to which I have referred, because of the losses endured.  If the House is suggesting that we should take up those losses then they should come out honestly and say so &mdash; that we are supposed to step into any factory that fails to sell on a market and subsidise foreign customers. That is the reality of the situation and let us face it.  Deputies should not shelter under umbrellas trying to produce false information, trying to mislead people into thinking that introducing a motion here will open the Fieldcrest factory in the morning.  We all want to do that.  The sensible way forward is as I have suggested.  Deputies should think about undermining the whole of the IDA, the legislative processes of this House practised over the last 30 years; they should think about that carefully before casting their votes this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have clearly shown that I am realistic and I want everybody else to be just as realistic.  I want the House to be realistic in thinking about the effect on industrial investment.  I want them to realise that the Government motion constitutes the only sensible way forward in this situation.  I can say this without contradiction, that at present there is one major European company looking for a partner, and the IDA are looking around for a partner who will take it over.  But there are three stages to this approach by the IDA.  One was a single take-over which has not succeeded. The second one was a variety of partners &mdash; one major European company is already looking for one and expects to have a decision taken &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; within the next three to four weeks. The third one down the line from that is a combination of people who will come together with various products.  That production line will produce six miles of towel on one single production line. Everything is specifically designed to the economies of scale on which that is operated. There will have to be changes in that machinery because I am reliably informed that the sector of the market that could be penetrated with high quality towels at this time would only represent approximately 25 per cent of the total production of Fieldcrest.  That gives an idea of the scale of the problem that is there and sweeping it under the carpet, shaking your head at the unreality of the situation will not ensure any great success for the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people in this House must face up to their responsibilities.  There is a reality which will have to come into Irish politics and the sooner this happens the better. When somebody over there talks about a Talbot deal let that person not forget that Deputy Garrett FitzGerald, as Taoiseach on 23 December last, activated that and passed it over to the poor Minister for Industry and Energy to solve his problems. He had the hypocrisy to stand here opposite me and five times asked the Taoiseach to answer a question on it <Col N="507" /> when he knew that as Taoiseach he transferred it over to my Department.</P>
    <P>We have the hypocrisy of people trying to say that the Government changed and did an about turn on the Ardmore Studios. They certainly did not.  I repeat tonight that the Government's policy in relation to that stands and trying a trick of the loop situation with a notice of motion that did not spell out what they wanted brought in by a party who would not support a motion that was specific in relation to the nationalisation of that asset will not solve anything.  Are we now talking about total nationalisation or are we not?  I ask the Labour Party to make up their minds on whether we are, come out specifically and say so because there is another party sitting on their back who are prepared to say it.  They should let the House decide if we want to nationalise every industry that will fail in bad or serious times.  That is the reality of the situation and they should realise it before they cast their votes here tonight.</P>

There is provision in section 33 of the Industrial Development Act, 1969 and in section 9 of the Industrial Development Act, 1977 which gives the IDA the authority to purchase or take shares to any extent the IDA may consider desirable in the body corporate owning, controlling or managing the undertaking or in a body corporate participating in the ownership, control or management of the undertaking. It gives them power to form or take part with other persons in the formation of such bodies corporate and it gives them power that no shares shall be purchased or taken by the authority whereas, as a result, the authority would have a majority shareholding in a body corporate unless the Minister shall have approved of the proposed purchase or taking of shares.  That is what I am asking the Minister to do.</P>

      <P>It has been stated that it did not matter which way Deputies voted, but the way Members vote on any issue is important.  We are all aware of the high value the Taoiseach places on a single vote in the House.  It is wrong to suggest that the way Members vote is immaterial.  The Minister raised the question of how responsible we were.  If he was in our position in the last three months as representatives for Carlow-Kilkenny <Col N="512" /> when this issue came to a head he would have adopted the same attitude that we have.  The matter has been a burning issue in Kilkenny since 8 March and in the following three months the public representatives did not raise the issue in the House.  Is that not responsibility? How far does one carry that, particularly when it is contrasted to the action of the Minister's party when the Clondalkin Paper Mills closed.</P>

Motions were tabled here about the nationalisation of Clondalkin. The representatives of Carlow-Kilkenny in the last three months had confidence in the Minister and the Government.

      <P>We have been too responsible and sincere in our approach to this major problem.  We have not raised any expectations unnecessarily or created an unreal world.  There has been complete political responsibility to the level that the five Deputies were criticised <Col N="513" /> in the local press for our silence in the last three months on the problems of Fieldcrest.

      <P>I have not pursued Motions as irresponsible as those introduced by Fianna Fáil when in Opposition. They put forward Motions about the nationalisation of Clondalkin Mills at a time when it was possible to make another arrangement to get those workers into employment.  The Minister outlined the history of the plant since it opened and in doing so he partially let the cat out of the bag.  At one stage, <Col N="514" /> pointing across to these benches he said: &ldquo;You are the people who put it there&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister also said that he did not give a narrowed brief to the IDA.  I looked through everything the Minister said, including his statement of 9 June in reply to a Private Notice Question, and he only spoke about the attempts to find a buyer for the assets of a going concern.  He did not mention anything else except the efforts of the IDA to take over the entire plant as a <Col N="515" /> going concern.  I am putting my Motion to the House in the hope that it gets support.  It is not an ill-conceived motion. It is well thought out and that is why the Minister does not like it.  We have not at any stage played politics with the situation. If we wanted to play politics we had three months to do so but we did not and we are not doing so now.  If the House means anything it means that when 640 people lose their jobs it is the duty and responsibility of those elected to represent them to raise the matter on the floor of the House.</P>
      <P>I will not make any apology to this or any other Minister for coming in with a motion which is the best one to try to save those jobs and get the company back into business as quickly as possible.  I accept the addendum that will be moved by Deputies Crotty and Governey.  If possible I will accept the inquiry.  If it is not possible at this stage I will put down a separate motion with other Deputies asking for a full inquiry into all the circumstances surrounding Fieldcrest.</P>

      <P>Before Private Members' Business I was welcoming the relief given and hoped the Minister in his wisdom would go as far as possible to provide relief for people in rented accommodation. This legislation will benefit two sectors of the community, those over 65 years of age and those below a certain income limit.  The introduction of this important measure is very important and I hope it marks the first step towards helping those people.  For far too long people who had to pay rent each week failed to get any benefit.  I hope that in this financial year the Minister will go a little further than he has indicated so far. I realise that whatever is done will cost money, whether we are talking in terms of £5,500,000 or £20 million.  Obviously there is a difficult situation as far as finances are concerned, but having regard to the money that is made available for other schemes and projects I hope the Minister will make some improvements in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the section in principle. <Col N="524" /> Whatever is decided finally, I hope that help will be given to those who need it.</P>

I said I would do so without any commitment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> We have been discussing this Bill for two days.  On many occasions I have seen Finance Bills being discussed in this House and we have always reached the stage when the Bill has had to be passed without several sections being debated.</P>
      <P>In this Finance Bill there are 97 sections. As we know there is a statutory regulation regarding the time this Bill must be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Opposition have been debating section 5 since practically 10.30 this morning.  I should like to remind them that there are several sections of the Bill that require serious consideration. We will reach the stage, if not this week then certainly next week, when eight or ten sections will have to be put through without debate.  There are amendments before the House that would entail additional expenditure.  I ask Opposition Deputies to consider seriously the whole financial structure of the country at the moment.  I ask Deputy Bruton to consider the consequences of the last division and what that may mean with regard to capital and the operation of companies.  It is all right for us here to play politics, but people outside have no interest, good, bad or indifferent in what we do here.  They are concerned about jobs, prices and inflation.  These are the important matters we should be discussing here, not endeavouring, as have the main Opposition party, Fine Gael, to score political points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> Of course there is merit in the amendments put down by the Labour Party and Deputy Gregory.  When finances permit I could see a Minister for Finance giving the amendments careful consideration and accepting them.  However, we must have regard to the financial situation. There is no doubt that any concessions given will have to be met by increased taxation, and this will mean a further increase in inflation.  That means the loss of more jobs.</P>
    <P>We should direct our attention very closely to the issues involved in this Finance Bill.  There are already concessions in the Bill for people over 65 paying rent for private dwellings.  The motion put forward here by Deputy Gregory and Deputy Barry Desmond can be looked at when our finances are brought under proper control.  It would be irresponsible at present to push the budget deficit over and beyond what it is now.  We want to maintain the present budget deficit.  This is only one of many amendments we will have to consider as we go through the Finance Bill.  There is about £140 million involved in amendments to the Finance Bill.  No responsible Minister for Finance could make concessions like that without throwing the whole financial structure of the country into chaos.  If unpopular decisions have to be taken, so be it.</P>
    <P>People today are looking for responsible government.  Fine Gael have not put down any amendments.  If they were sincere with regard to putting down amendments to section 5 of the Bill they had the past three weeks to formulate them.  They did not do so because Deputy Bruton knows perfectly well, from his budget in January, that the amendments and concessions he is looking for here cannot be granted.  It is not good enough to see that type of politics being played in the House.  People will know what Fine Gael are like when they see them supporting amendments that they had not the courage to put down themselves.</P>
    <P>I am very sympathetic towards people who are paying high rents for private flats.  I fully understand the pressures they are under, and I believe we will have to look at this section because they are entitled, at a future date, to some concessions <Col N="526" /> with regard to income tax.  Some are paying astronomical rents.  When the finances of the country are brought under control that is the first sector I would ask the Minister for Finance to grant concessions to.  Trying to get an amendment to section 5 of the Bill to grant concessions at this time, without looking at the whole issue of private rented dwellings is only doing it on a piecemeal basis.  We should have a full debate in this House and a complete examination of private rented dwellings.  We should see that they are properly registered, that their standards are reasonable and that any concessions given by way of income tax will not be passed on to the landlords.  When landlords see concessions being given in many cases they raise the rent.</P>
    <P>I know his feelings about that section of the community, that they do merit consideration.  I can see merit also in the previous amendments put down by the Labour Party and The Workers' Party. But we must wait until the finances of the country improve before embarking on these types of concessions.  Before thinking of taking decisions on this issue I would ask the House to ascertain exactly what we are voting for and what will be the implications for the whole of our economy.  There is no way that we can vote through measures here directing the Minister for Finance to do this or that.  I am convinced that that is an irresponsible attitude.  We shall see what will be the financial consequences for this country if we pursue policies such as those.  I can assure the House that financial experts would take a serious view of the outcome of that type of policy.  If there is anything we need in this country it is financial injections; there must be foreign investment to finance industry.  People who think there is sufficient finance here to get new factories started and our infrastructure going must be living in cloud cuckoo land.  Anything we do here to undermine the confidence of outside interest or affect finance coming into the country will hurt one section of the community only, the unemployed, those seeking jobs or those who may already have jobs.  It is with that in mind that we should view the whole of this debate in a <Col N="527" /> serious manner, because we can push the finances of the country to a stage where they will be irretrievable, when everybody in the country will be in trouble.</P>
    <P>Of course there are merits in these amendments.  At a future date on a Finance Bill I would be the first to ask the Minister to look at this section and ascertain whether the provisions of the amendments tabled here this evening cannot be granted in some way.  We must see what figures are arrived at if our budget deficit is held under very trying conditions.  We must remember that every country in western Europe and indeed the United States also is at present suffering the same type of depression. Inflation and unemployment are high, interest rates especially are high in every country in Western Europe.  This has the effect of creating mass depression right across Western Europe.  We must realise that we are isolated here on this island. To think that we can act independently, without taking into consideration the impact and finances of other economies, is not being realistic.  We must ensure in this House that we create a climate receptive to foreign investment.  The best way that can be done is within the context of the Finance Bill.  That is, I believe the whole object of a good Finance Bill.  I can see merit in the amendments.  But at this time, especially taking the whole of our finance into consideration, it would not be opportune to grant such concessions. Rather there should be a thorough examination of private flat dwellings and, when that has been done, then by all means ask the Minister for Finance to give some concession to those people paying high rents for flats in private dwellings.</P>

      <P>I advanced various arguments this morning against Deputy Gregory's amendment.  Various Deputies replied to the arguments I advanced.  One of those Deputies, Deputy Kemmy, sought to reply by the sort of usual argument <i>ad hominem</i> he uses.  That means that when he cannot deal with issues he tends to attack the personalities who <Col N="528" /> advance arguments about those issues.  I will tell Deputy Kemmy that anything he can say about me in this House or outside it, whatever he may say about me here, I can say much more about him and I say to him across the floor of this House, outside or wherever he wants to hear it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand some of the arguments advanced by the people across the floor.  Deputy B. Desmond spoke at great length about rents tribunals and the exorbitant rents landlords are charging tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have said that there is some merit in Deputy Gregory's amendment. I accept that there may be some merit in it.  I can see merit in anything that seeks to help or aid the oppressed.  But the question of rents tribunals, fair rent, fixity or security of tenure is a big social question.  I cannot for a moment understand what that question has to do with income tax.  I cannot see any necessary connection between the necessity for fair rents, rents tribunals and so on and the terms of this Bill.  Deputy B. Desmond seemed to suggest, in the course of his arguments, that if these rents tribunals had been established the amount of rent people would be paying would be much less than obtains at present.  That may or may not be the case.  He seemed to suggest that if rents tribunals had been set up in the context of the rent restrictions legislation the rents which tenants of controlled tenancies would pay ultimately would be far less than those that would otherwise obtain.  Of course that approach overlooks the fact that in the legislation dealing with controlled dwellings, we established District Courts, we <Col N="529" /> appointed District Justices specifically to hear cases of rent control.  We issued very definite, firm guidelines, to those District Courts which will be dealing specifically with applications from occupants of rent-controlled dwellings.  There seems to be no evidence to suggest, that rents tribunals would decide the issues any differently.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Dea, the Chair explained to Deputies during the course of their contributions that unfortunately a certain latitude was taken.  Because of that the Chair did accept references to matter which, in the opinion of the Chair, was not entirely relevant.  You say correctly that reference was made to tribunals.  Deputy Fitzpatrick on one occasion referred to the price of land.  We had a miscellany of matters. I would suggest to you that on every occasion I did indicate to the speakers that, while they might make a passing reference, they should not develop that extraneous matter to any great length.  I know I can rely on Deputy O'Dea to keep himself within the confines of the latitude allowed other Deputies but not to move outside it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I will, that gives me very wide latitude.  I have listened to every conceivable subject discussed today on these amendments.  I am endeavouring to confine myself to answering <Col N="530" /> some of the points raised by Deputy B. Desmond.</P>
      <P>The question of rent control and security of tenure is largely a social one which the Government are considering at the moment and which will ultimately be debated in the House as a separate issue. That has nothing to do with income taxation. While I see some merit in the amendments, and I see the reason why Deputy Gregory has put them down, I cannot see any justification for using the Finance Bill and the income tax laws to bring about much needed reform in the area of rent and rent control.  That is a separate question and I would like to see it dealt with separately.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry Desmond started off by supporting the amendment that tenants in private dwellings, whose income does not exceed £4,500 per annum, should be allowed to claim the rent against their incomes for tax purposes.  He then introduced an amendment to the amendment to the effect that the people who would be allowed to claim rent against their incomes for tax purposes would only be people whose taxable income was up to a limit of £2,500.  That is the sort of tactics which the main Opposition party have been engaging in for the specific purpose of defeating and embarrassing the Government without any regard to the financial consequences for the country of the budget being defeated.  The figures have already been put to the Opposition, the people who only a few short months ago preached financial rectitude and who are now prepared to throw the country into financial chaos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes advanced the argument that since the rent which the occupants of private residences can claim as a deduction for tax purposes can only be given as a sort of tax rebate at the end of the financial year, it should not be taken into account in calculating the budget deficit for this year.  I remind Deputy Bruton and the other Deputies on the other side of the House that financial rectitude is a continuing thing.  They sought to use that argument in relation to the payment of corporation tax and VAT being moved around.  They stated that it is keeping the deficit down this year only, at the expense <Col N="531" /> of increasing it next year.  They are now advancing the very opposite argument in support of a totally irresponsible approach to this Finance Bill and to the amendment.</P>
    <P>I believe if this amendment is accepted many social consequences will inevitably follow, not all of which will be good.  The question of fair rents and the whole area of landlord and tenant legislation and a comprehensive review of the whole area of landlord and tenant relationships would have to be postponed.  I would not like to see that happening because in the present order of things I know it will be coming up fairly soon.  I do not want it to be side-tracked in this way.</P>
    <P>People do not in general have as much regard for the accommodation they do not own themselves as they do for the accommodation they purchase and which they will ultimately own absolutely themselves. Consequently, if we change the tax laws in such a way as to encourage more and more people into rented accommodation, the housing stock of the country will deteriorate.  I said that this morning and nothing I have heard since leads me to believe anything else.  I ask the Opposition parties in the interests of the financial rectitude they have preached so often and in the interests of honesty, if it is not too late for honesty as far as Fine Gael are concerned, to change their attitude now and accept the section as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section gives effect to the commitment made by the Minister for Finance in his budget statement. That commitment in turn repeats the same commitment given by the previous Minister for Finance in his budget statement.  Therefore, the original budget of this year was supported by the two main Opposition parties in the House at the moment.  One, therefore, is entitled to ask what has changed to justify a change of this nature.  One is entitled to ask the spokesman for Fine Gael, who was then the Minister for Finance, what has changed from the time he introduced his budget after deep and serious consideration was given to such a provision <Col N="532" /> which, if he had the opportunity, I assume he would have introduced in the Finance Bill.  One is entitled to ask the Labour Members of the House, who were involved in that Government &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not very impressed by what I have heard since I came into the House and I am waiting for the opportunity to be unimpressed again. If my intervention invites the Deputy to repeat again what he said maybe I will have served some purpose.  The objective criteria I mentioned still applies.  The second point I want to make is that Deputy Bruton will be aware that over two years ago I asked the commission on taxation to look at the whole range of our tax laws to bring about greater equity in taxation. Among other things the House must be conscious of the fact that in terms of allowances either for rent or in respect of rental incomes, going back over the years, irrespective of which Government were in office, we would like to be assured that we were always aware of the consequences of allowances of the kind proposed this evening by the amendments. Somebody thinks of a number, and the numbers being thought of this evening by two different Deputies vary considerably.  In one instance the number is £4,500 income and in the other case it is £2,000 income.  I am not sure where Deputy Bruton stands in relation to all of this and what his number is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea has been very convincing on this.  The reality is that from the <Col N="533" /> point of view of the tax code and appropriate fiscal policy it is not just a question of thinking of a number and it is not a question of thinking what would seem to be reasonable in given circumstances without looking at the consequences of what that may be in other areas.  One of the consequences that immediately occurs to anybody, without giving deep consideration to it, is that in respect of similar type property there could be two different rentals asked for, one where the beneficiary would be entitled to the kind of allowance being spoken of here and the other where the beneficiary would not be entitled to the allowance.  This could, as Deputy O'Dea pointed out, have repercussions in the whole rents structure, which is a different matter entirely.  We cannot play fast and loose with our tax allowances simply on the basis that it seems to be reasonable that people at a certain level of income should be given special exemptions having regard to the rent they pay.</P>
    <P>That is my second point.  My third point has already been made but should be repeated, that the cost this year would be £16 million and next year £25 million. Certainly, that is not consistent, whatever else Deputy Bruton may have said, with anything that he or those representing him said before now.  Apparently, they seem to be in a mood not of fiscal rectitude but fiscal carelessness.  We have seen one example of this in the House this evening.  Taxpayers' money is no longer an issue, spend it where ever you can even though there may be impossibilities facing you in trying to achieve what all of us in the circumstances might like to achieve.  The attitude seems to be to spend the money anyway and let the country face the consequences.  For those three reasons I cannot support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Dea was in order in mentioning rent tribunals in this context it might be helpful to deal with the matter.  The obvious point is that rent tribunals would be a more informal method of having disputes about rental issues settled.  The problem at the moment is where people have to have <Col N="534" /> recourse to the courts.  They have to go through a degree of formality in regard to pleadings and settlements that they find it very difficult to reach a solution to their problems.  As a result they forbear from availing of the legal remedy at all. It is as a result of that that people continue to pay rents which are in excess of those they can afford.  Deputy Kennedy said he was interested in hearing my views and specifically invited me to express them.

      <P>The Minister for Finance gave certain assurances in regard to what he would be prepared to consider on Report Stage.  He said that without any commitment he would be prepared to look at the matter.  As to the technical <Col N="535" /> issues involved there is a need for a delay between now and Report Stage.  There is a case for waiting until Report Stage to frame the precise terms of an amendment as to how it would technically operate. The Minister brought forward a number of technical difficulties that could exist in regard to the way in which this matter would operate in practice.  It is reasonable that he, and the House, should wish that we should have an opportunity to have the amendment framed in such a manner, with the assistance that is available to the Minister so that it would operate properly and would not cause problems such as those referred to by the Minister.  The problems, I believe, he maximised unduly but they are problems nonetheless.</P>
      <P>If we are to accept his assurances of being of any value the Minister should be clear about how much money he is prepared to set aside for this purpose or if he is prepared to raise the money in some other way.  The Minister has indicated that he is prepared to take this matter seriously between now and Report Stage and, as to the technical drafting of the amendment he needs time, but he does not need time to say how much money he is prepared to put on the table.  Deputy Gregory, and other Members who are interested in this subject, would have reasonable grounds for pressing the Minister to indicate precisely what his financial parameters are on this matter.  The Minister should be able to tell us whether he is prepared to set aside £5 million, £4 million, £1 million or £10 million to extend this to the low paid.  It is reasonable that we should press him at this juncture for clarification on this point.  I would hope that he will be prepared to give such clarification because it would assist us in deciding on the course of action that ought to be taken further in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further point I should like to raise with the Minister is the question of the difference between the estimates of cost given for 1983 and for a full year.  As I understand it 1983 is a full year and rent paid right from 1 January 1982 will be allowable against tax in 1983.  Is it <Col N="536" /> because it will only be allowed in respect of the nine months of 1983 that are part of the 1983-84 tax year that 1983 is a lesser year in cost terms than a full year, which, presumably, would be 1984?  In order to understand the figures that have been given by the Minister it would be useful if we had that data.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way I can respond to that is by saying that it is nine months of the next financial year, from April to December.  In next year's financial year it is nine months of the 12.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the information I was looking for.  It is important that the Minister indicate the amount of money he is prepared to set aside for the amendments he may introduce on this subject. It is not sufficient for us to accept the assurance, welcome and all that it is, that the Minister will consider this matter seriously between now and Report Stage without some indication, broadly speaking, as to what financial parameters he is talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be of interest to the House to know in this context whether the Minister proposes to raise the money by some other way or whether he simply proposes to borrow the money necessary for the concession he has indicated to Deputy Gregory he is prepared to consider.  I do not think it is sufficient to continue on the basis of an assurance that was reluctantly dragged from the Minister after a long debate.  It is worth recollecting to Members who might criticise us for the length of time we spent on this section that it was only at the end of a five-hour debate that any assurance at all about the matter being considered on Report Stage was extracted from the Minister.  If the Minister had given assurances of that sort at the outset of the debate the debate might have been a good deal less lengthy than it was.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for permitting this question. I put down a Private Notice Question earlier but it was disallowed as the Ceann Comhairle did not think it satisfied the criterion of urgency.  I took the opportunity of pointing out after Question Time that the Ceann Comhairle was misinterpreting what I was trying to do or was probably misinformed.  I am not blaming the Department or anybody for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circular letter I referred to in my question was sent out on 14 May.  The matter has become urgent over the last few days.  It was acceptable on 14 May and there would not have been another word about it if the Department had moved quickly to give the allocations to the various committees.  As the allocations were not given, it has transpired in the last few days that teachers selected by VEC selection boards cannot be appointed.  This is causing a very serious problem.  It causes problems at interview stage for some teachers because many of <Col N="538" /> them apply for more than one position. When they do an interview they are unaware a week or a fortnight later, even though they know they were successful &mdash; I admit that they should not know but it is common knowledge that teachers know if they were successful because word leaks out &mdash; whether they will be appointed.  This is holding up the work of the interview boards.</P>
    <P>We have enough problems without being held up by the Department.  As a member of a VEC committee we find it extremely difficult to bring selection boards together.  I am sure the Minister and the Department have received many complaints not only in the area of VEC appointments but also appointments to other schools.  It is not unknown for me to be called three times in the one day to know if I would be available the following week for a selection board.  That goes for the entire membership of the VEC.  Even when boards are set up and there is agreement about the date and so on, when the day comes someone has opted out.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at this area. I am sure the Minister is well aware of directive No. CL 33/82 which was sent out on 14 May in which it is stated that no steps should be taken for the appointment of teachers to either new or replacement posts until the allocations have been determined.  This is the crucial point.  The allocations have not been determined and, therefore, the appointment of teachers cannot take place.  I regret this.  It is causing great inconvenience.  It is causing serious problems in two areas of my constituency, in Firhouse where we are starting a new community college of 1,000 pupils in September this year and in Willington where we are starting a new community college.  Both colleges are in course of erection and those connected with the building of them are working overtime to ensure that they are ready to commence in September.  It is almost 1 July and the principal has not yet been appointed.  The Minister must take a serious look at the situation.</P>
    <P>Both selection boards have met and made their recommendation to the school boards.  Both school boards have accepted the recommendation but the <Col N="539" /> teachers cannot be informed and, therefore, cannot notify the schools in which they are working at present.  This means that advertising the vacancies which will be created in the other schools by the filling of these posts will be held up.  This should not be allowed to continue for any longer than midnight tonight and I ask the Minister to take steps to ensure that this is so.  Not only should we be appointing principals on 1 July but they should be appointed on 1 January where new schools are commencing on 1 September. We did this in the case of Springfield in Tallaght.  Without casting any reflection on the performance of other schools, the performance in that school can be highly commended and it is due partly to the fact that the principal was appointed in good time.  A principal has to make out a programme for the year.  It is frightening to have the responsibility of starting a 1,000 pupil school in September.  In one case there are 110 pupils enrolled which is a disadvantage for any school which is starting.  I prefer to see the number at 70 or 80 for the first year to give the school a chance.</P>
    <P>We have two people appointed for both schools but neither can give notice to the school they are presently working in and neither can take up the appointment to get Firhouse and Willington off the ground.  This is a vitally important matter.  Perhaps it would be acceptable in an area where there would not be as great an intake.  In Firhouse and Willington there was need last year and the previous year for such schools and the intake this year and in succeeding years will be greater than is desirable.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the Minister.  I know he has had a hard and somewhat disappointing day and I am sure he is anxious to have some discussions about that.  I plead with him to announce the allocations and have it in the hands of the VECs tomorrow or the next day at the very latest so that these appointments can take place.  It is not such a bad situation if it is the case of a principal taking over a school that is already in operation, but I am confident that the Minister with his interest in education will realise the great <Col N="540" /> disadvantage for these schools by reason of not being able to appoint principals. You have given me permission to bring into the debate the matter of the selection boards, and I trust that the Minister will have regard to this matter also.  However, the problem this evening relates to the directive of May 14.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Education (Professor O'Donoghue) Minister for Education (Professor O'Donoghue)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the concern which led Deputy McMahon to bring this matter before the House.  It is important that we should try to make in good time arrangements for teaching posts and so on so that we might provide the best opportunities possible for pupils.  In particular I recognise the sort of knock-on effect of being late in making some appointments and then having teachers changing posts.  This can result in being well into the new school year before replacements are appointed in some other schools along the line from which teachers have moved.</P>
      <P>The basic reason for the delay arises from the manner in which allocations are determined.  Each committee are expected to make a return to the Department showing their pupil numbers, details of various courses and so on.  This enables the Department to determine the number of teaching posts that should be sanctioned for the new school year.  In the case of 1982-83, for instance, the schools were asked to make their returns by the middle of December 1981 in the case of third-level courses and by the middle of January 1982 in the case of second-level courses.  Had those returns been furnished in reasonably good time the Department would have been in a position some time ago to settle the allocations. However, what happened was that the final returns for second-level courses were not received until the end of last month &mdash; 27 May &mdash; and in so far as third-level courses were concerned, it is regrettable that returns are still outstanding at least in the case of one college.  Happily, most of the latecomers have managed to furnish the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy might well ask why I could not give the go-ahead in at least some areas earlier, but I will return to that in <Col N="541" /> a few minutes.  The essential reason is that before allocations can be decided for any one committee we must consider the overall funding that is available for additional posts and there must be some allocation made of any additional staff as between the requests from the various committees, 38 in all.  That is the reason for the Department having always held back the determination of the new teaching quotas for the coming school year until such time as all committees had furnished the information.  It became apparent that although we were not in a position to decide the allocations, the various committees were going ahead and advertising posts.  That was understandable in a number of instances, but had there been simply a general acceptance of that situation there could have arisen the danger that the total number of posts filled would exceed the number which the Department could authorise. That was a danger that had to be averted for two reasons.  First, some signs have emerged in recent years of a number of committees exceeding the total number of staffing posts to which they were entitled.  When that happens the situation becomes difficult in terms of clawing back those excess appointments in later years. Secondly, there is a reason for not allowing any excess to emerge in the current year because, as the House knows, we are conscious of the rather restrictive financial climate in which we must operate. Speakers from the other side of the House would be the first to lecture us were we to permit any excess expenditure to emerge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that these principals have to be appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that in a moment.  I am talking about the general reason for the delay in fixing the allocations and I am stressing the point that the Department were not willing to give any sort of general approval for additional teaching posts until the necessary information became available.  If the Department were simply to allow piecemeal sanctions to go ahead there would be a real danger of excess expenditure <Col N="542" /> arising and many people, both inside this House and outside, would then consider it proper to lecture the Government in general and myself in particular for permitting such a situation to arise.  In the circumstances of this year I consider it proper to try to being home to the committees that we must live within the budget allocations for the current year. That will not be an easy task.  For that reason we have to stress that committees could not simply take it on themselves to make the appointments.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I recognise the difficulties that can emerge in certain instances especially in relation to the staffing of a new school.  My understanding is that in a number of instances and particularly in the two to which Deputy McMahon referred permission was given for the appointment initially of principals and vice-principals and that while sanction for the filling of the other teaching posts had not been given, that sanction is now going out.  What has happened is that since information came in, the allocations for regional and technical colleges were issued on the 9th of this month. That meets one part of the requirement. The general allocation for second-level is only now being issued.  I assure the Deputy that is going out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be dispatched tomorrow, though the earliest ones may have been dispatched.  It is more correct to say that they are being issued and should be distributed by tomorrow.  I recognise that this is late in a school year, but given the system under which we operate that type of situation must inevitably arise if schools are tardy in furnishing the returns which they are required to furnish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in the Minister trying to shift the blame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right to shift the blame and it is wrong that we should have some of the practices under <Col N="543" /> which we must labour.  I will not allow myself to be diverted now into giving a number of examples, but it is correct to fix the blame where it properly belongs. If schools and committees do not furnish the information that is required of them, and especially if they are five or six months late in furnishing that information, they should be expected to suffer some hardship or delay as a result.</P>
      <P>An area in which I shall ascertain if better arrangements can be made for future years is in the case of new schools, because I do not think that these can be blamed for the shortcomings of existing institutions.  If a new school has been sanctioned it should be possible to say as a first charge that staff must be provided and that that type of allocation should be issued in good time.  I would like to explore the possibility that for those existing schools and colleges who furnish their returns on time we could devise a system for authorising their approved posts.  If that means that the latecomers lose out and do not get a fair share of extra posts, that is their fault.  I believe in letting the guilty ones take their punishment and not having the innocent parties suffer alongside the guilty ones.  I would be quite willing to explore the possibility of devising some alternative arrangement which would distinguish between the innocent and guilty parties in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One complicating matter is that a two-stage process is involved in fixing this staffing arrangement of colleges.  First there is the process of establishing the number of posts which a school or college may create and fill on the basis of their pupil data.  Secondly &mdash; this is the complicating factor &mdash; there is the requirement for the committee as a whole to live within the financial allocation available to them.  In times of rapidly changing money values, severe inflation and so forth, a committee may not be able to find the money to permit every school or college to appoint the full number of staff to which they might be properly entitled. In other words, there is a requirement to tailor the number of appointments within the budgetary allocation.  This is the complicating factor which must be taken into <Col N="544" /> account if one is to devise some sort of differential issuing of approval for appointments in various committees.  I would be quite happy to explore the possibility of introducing such a differential arrangement in future years.</P>
    <P>I hope that what I have said helps to explain why the delay occurred.  I repeat the assurance that the staffing numbers for all the second level colleges are now being issued; in other words they will have been dispatched no later than tomorrow.  In the case of the two new colleges to which Deputy McMahon referred, the authorisation of the principal and vice-principal posts has been approved recently, I am informed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It must have been since Monday because the board met on Monday and while they accepted the recommendation they could not notify the people involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I will check the exact date, but my understanding was that it had already been approved.  The other point which Deputy McMahon raised, which is not really a matter for tonight, is the question of selection committees and whether we can devise a more convenient set of arrangements in that area.  We need to look at the various demands and pressures which the very rapid growth of education has placed not simply on school resources, teachers and so on, but also on the many other dedicated people.  It is right to recognise the tremendous input of time, effort, thought and general commitment which the community get from their unrecognised and frequently unsung members who would include public representatives such as Deputy McMahon who have to give so much of their time to helping the committees to fill their posts and to discharge the many other responsibilities placed on them.  I will certainly explore the possibilities for improvement along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement even at this late stage, but can I take it that he will take steps to ensure that principals are not caught up <Col N="545" /> in this net in future?  It may not be his responsibility next year, but surely he can do something now to ensure that principals of new schools will be appointed in <Col N="546" /> January of the year when the school is due to start in September.</P>

      <P>It is not proposed to fill the vacant part-time postman post at Lavagh post office.  In accordance with long-standing policy of motorising rural postal deliveries where it is economical to do so, the delivery route has been absorbed in a full-time motor post based at Tubbercurry post office.  Present plans do not envisage any further changes in postal delivery arrangements at Lavagh and post office counter services are not affected.</P>

      <P>It had been expected that Castleblayney and Ballybay exchanges would be converted to automatic working earlier this year.  Unfortunately, this was <Col N="380" /> not possible because of a problem affecting the control link between Castleblayney and Kells which is the controlling centre for operation and maintenance in the area.  Measures to deal with the problem have been devised but, until they have been proved effective in practice, it is not possible to give an exact forecast for the changeover to automatic working. I am, however, hopeful that conversion of Castleblayney exchange will take place by September at the latest, and that Ballybay will be converted to automatic working shortly after.</P>

      <P>Under the primary school <Col N="389" /> transport scheme, eligible children are allowed free transport to their nearest national school only.</P>
      <P>Those children in question who are national school pupils are not attending their nearest school, Leitrim National School, and are therefore ineligible for free transport.</P>
      <P>Under the post primary free education scheme, the country has been divided into catchment areas.  Recognised post primary pupils who reside at least three miles from the post primary centre of the catchment area in which they live qualify for free transport to that centre.  When such a pupil attends a school in another centre he/she may be allowed free transport from the nearest pick-up point inside the catchment boundary of the centre attended on the transport service to that centre if a spare seat is available and no extra cost to the State ensues.  The pupil must make his/her own way to the catchment boundary.</P>
      <P>Those children in question who are attending post primary school reside in the catchment area of Kilmihil and are eligible for free transport to that centre and there is a suitable transport service nearby.  As they are attending school in another catchment area they must make their own way to the catchment boundary of that centre (pick-up point Creegh) and they may avail of free transport from there.  I understand they are availing of that facility.</P>

      <P>While lasting health hazards have yet to be proved, there is evidence glue-sniffing may lead to damage of the liver, lungs, kidneys, bone-marrow, blood and skin. The short-term health hazards associated with glue-sniffing are running eyes and nose, sores around the nose and mouth, a cough, bronchial problems, weight loss, tiredness, general listlessness and apathy.</P>
      <P>However, the greatest danger associated with glue-sniffing is the risk of accidents. Many of the deaths and tragedies attributable to glue-sniffing are not caused by the actual sniffing, but occur after the inhaling has taken place.  When a person is under the influence of glue he is unable to co-ordinate his thoughts and actions and can endanger himself and others.  There is also the risk that the sniffer will become unconscious and collapse. The practice often causes vomiting and there have been reports of deaths occurring as a result of a sniffer losing consciousness and inhaling vomit.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit from 11 February to 1 March 1982, after which date he was certified fit to resume work.  Pending inquiries as to the nature and origin of his incapacity disability benefit was authorised on an interim basis.</P>

    <P>Disability benefit was paid at the maximum appropriate rate from 15 February 1982, fourth day of incapacity.  As pay-related benefit is not payable for the first twelve days of any claim this benefit only became payable from 25 February 1982, thirteenth day of incapacity.  The amount of pay-related benefit due on the claim from 25 February to 1 March 1982 amounting to £15.74 was included in a <Col N="397" /> cheque for £72.21 which was issued to the claimant on 21 May 1982.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 29 October 1980 and was paid from 3 November 1980, fourth day of incapacity, in respect of himself, his wife and one child dependant. All benefit due to 30 December 1980 was issued at the time.  He was not entitled to pay-related benefit as his earnings in the governing income-tax year 1978-79 were not sufficient to qualify him for such payment.</P>
      <P>From January 1981 the claimant submitted medical certificates under a different RSI number and was paid benefit on the basis of this number as a separate claim.  Disability benefit was authorised at the maximum rate appropriate to a single man and pay-related benefit was also authorised on the basis of earnings in the 1979-80 income-tax year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January 1982 the claimant submitted a claim form for increases in respect of dependants and at that stage the two claims were associated.  As the claim from October 1980 was continuous the claimant was not entitled to pay-related benefit from January 1981 as his entitlement was still governed by the amount of earnings in the 1978-79 tax year in which year he had not sufficient earnings to qualify. As the amount of the overpayment by <Col N="399" /> way of pay-related benefit from January 1981 to February 1982 exceeded the arrears of disability benefit due to him in respect of his dependants from 31 December 1980 to 13 March 1982 no adjusting payment is due.</P>

The estimate received however indicated a hearing aid of a type which was not included in the standard price list previously furnished by the supplier.  The latter was requested to confirm the appropriate list price but a reply was not received.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 12 October 1981 to 9 January 1982, after which date he was certified fit to resume work.  He was paid initially to 17 October 1981 at which stage the certificates submitted by him quoted a different RSI number and <Col N="400" /> inquiries were necessary in order to establish whether he was in fact entitled to payment.  The matter has now been resolved and all arrears of disability benefit and pay-related benefit due for the period 19 October 1981 to 2 January 1982 were issued on 29 June 1982.  Payment for the period 4 January to 9 January 1982 had already been made.</P>
      <P>As regards unemployment benefit the claimant received payment from 12 January to 8 May 1982 when he exhausted his maximum entitlement of 390 days payment.

      <P>The person concerned, who attained age 66 on 13 December 1980, claimed a contributory old age pension on 5 February 1981.  His claim was refused as he was already in receipt of retirement pension at the maximum rate appropriate to a married man.  The maximum rates of both pensions are the same and under the overlapping benefits regulations a person is precluded from receiving <Col N="401" /> both pensions at the same time.  It has been verified from the designated post office that he is cashing his retirement pension orders at present.</P>
      <P>A retirement pensioner on attaining age 66 is entitled to free travel and may also qualify for the same fringe benefits, such as free electricity and free television licence, as an old age contributory pensioner.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The qualification certificate which the person concerned held was revoked by a deciding officer with effect from 24 <Col N="407" /> March 1982 on the grounds that his means exceeded the statutory limit for entitlement to a qualification certificate. Accordingly, he does not qualify for the receipt of unemployment assistance.  He is assessed with means derived from the farming of land of which he is the beneficial occupier.</P>
    <P>The person concerned appealed against the decision of the deciding officer but the decision was upheld by an appeals officer.</P>

      <P>It has been the policy of successive Ministers for Defence to provide adequate training facilities for the FCA.  However, because of the current requirements to give priority to operational units of the Permanent Defence Force the number of junior officers made available for duty with the FCA falls short of what I would <Col N="408" /> wish.  Every effort is being made to increase these numbers within the resources available.</P>
      <P>I should point out that in addition to the junior officers a considerable number of senior officers and non-commissioned personnel are employed with FCA Units.
