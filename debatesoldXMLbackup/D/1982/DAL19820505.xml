      <P>Yesterday on the Order of Business I raised the question of a decision by Mr. Justice Barrington on Monday to grant a year's bail to a man convicted of manslaughter of a woman accompanied by gross sexual assault.  A further statement has been issued today by the Rape Crisis Centre deploring this decision and the Taoiseach said he would make a statement on the Order of Business today or would communicate with <Col N="214" /> me yesterday.  I have not as yet received any communication from the Taoiseach and I was expecting a statement today on the Order of Business, as promised yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech of the Minister of State in regard to this Bill was a grave disappointment to me.  The Bill provided the first opportunity for a discussion on development co-operation issues in this House since the present Government took over the reins of office. I hoped that the opportunity would be used for the Government to provide a general statement of policy or general intent in the area of development co-operation. The Coalition Government adopted a very advanced view in this area and I was hoping that we would get from the Government a confirmation that that view would be continued under the present administration.  Our Government adopted the UN target of .7 per cent of GNP as an ODA target but, more important, adopted a specific timetable for the attainment of that target by the end of this decade.  Furthermore, in the 1982 Estimates we provided for an increase in ODA from £18 million in 1981 to £26.335 million in 1982, putting this directly on target in the achievement of that timetable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where do Fianna Fáil stand in this?  I believe we are entitled to be suspicious of Fianna Fáil's attitude in regard to development co-operation.  Our suspicions <Col N="217" /> are raised by their record in the past and the fact that the provisions were not made in the past by Fianna Fáil Governments to advance in any significant way towards the attainment of the UN target.</P>
    <P>I also notice that the Taoiseach has not so far appointed a Minister of State with special responsibility for development co-operation.  That is another straw in the wind which heightens my suspicions in this area.  I do not in any way cast aspersions on the excellent Minister opposite who is in charge of the Office of Public Works but it seems rather peculiar and unusual that a Minister with that portfolio should be talking in this House about development co-operation issues.  I had hoped that we would have a Minister of State responsible for development co-operation to deal with this Bill or alternatively, if it is not the intention of the Taoiseach to appoint such a Minister of State, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs would grace the House with his presence and give an indication of his views.  I accept that for technical reasons the Bill was originally presented to the House by the Minister for Finance since there are financial measures involved, but these financial measures relate to moneys which we will be making available towards improving the lot of developing countries.  From that point of view this Bill falls into the ambit of development co-operation.  I and many others who are interested in this area are particularly disappointed that the opportunity has not been taken to make a broad statement in this field.  I now hope and expect that, if not in reply to this debate, then at a very early date we will have a clear statement of general policy from the administration in regard to development co-operation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, with some reservations. In the technical sense the Bill is very acceptable to the Opposition since it was originally introduced when we were in government.  My reservations are related to the background to the Bill and the possible limits to its effectiveness and the agreement establishing the Common Fund for Commodities.  We must look at <Col N="218" /> the background in assessing how effective this Common Fund will be.  There is a very high dependence by developing countries on exports of primary commodities. This has been an accepted fact for many years and it must be considered in the context of any effort to improve the terms of world trade in favour of developing nations.  We also know that commodity prices, excluding petroleum, have declined steadily in real terms and by the end of 1980 had reached the lowest level for 30 years.  This may not seem to be of great importance but when one considers it in tandem with the high dependence of developing countries on the export of primary commodities, one will appreciate the devastating effect on their economies of the low level of commodity prices now as compared with 30 years ago.  Taking into account all the problems from which they suffer, such as inflation, this is a very important factor. Furthermore, primary commodities have a declining share of world trade.  Excluding fuels, the share of primary production in world trade has fallen from 38 per cent to 19 per cent over the past two decades. This reflects the declining position of developing countries in the context of world trade.</P>
    <P>They have, of course, very many problems. The real difficulty is that over 90 per cent of primary commodities are exported in raw form.  There are very considerable difficulties for them in regard to processing and marketing of primary commodities and the whole system disfavours developing countries. Many of them have attempted to have an added value content in their primary commodities but their efforts to process domestically have been met by marketing and industrial structures which have hindered their entering the international markets.  There are a whole range of other difficulties, including a widening range of protectionist measures on the part of developed countries and limited access to finance.  The financial institutions are controlled by the developed world and there is no great incentive, particularly where there is competition for funds, for finance to be made available to developing countries as opposed <Col N="219" /> to what would be regarded as safe, secure concerns in the developed western world.</P>
    <P>They also suffer from the problem of non co-operation in regard to the transfer of technology, the withholding of trade information and a whole host of other restrictive practices.  The result is that producing countries in the developing world tend to receive only a very small fraction of the final consumer price for commodities.  In many cases the margins at wholesale and retail level are far greater than the price received by the producer.  These difficulties are compounded by other factors.  There is limited control by developing countries over the export sales of their primary commodities. They encounter difficulty in gaining entry to distribution channels beyond their own borders.  In many cases the transnational corporations predominate in production, marketing and distribution, providing substantial scope for transfer pricing.  The developing countries have unequal access to marketing information, while there is privileged access to transnationals at every stage of the marketing process.</P>
    <P>There are exchanges throughout the world dealing with primary commodities but where is the participation of developing countries in these exchanges?  The exchanges have been set up and are run and controlled by the developed world and with their lack of participation the developing countries are again at a loss.</P>
    <P>There is another factor which involves transportation.  Shipping and transportation facilities are not controlled by the developing world&mdash;in fact they are almost totally controlled by the developed world&mdash;and in that situation large potential earnings for the shipment of their primary commodities are foregone. Even worse, developing countries have little flexibility in timing shipments to use the markets to the best advantage.  Additionally, both tariff and non-tariff protection in many developed countries reach very high levels and this constitutes a major restraint in increasing export earnings in developing countries in respect of primary commodities.</P>
    <P>It is important to have a look at the <Col N="220" /> whole picture of trade so far as developing countries are concerned in case we might think that merely establishing a common fund for commodities is going to provide the solution to all the problems. We have to fit this Bill and the international body that is being set up at this stage in regard to commodities into the whole picture to get any real assessment of the benefit which this commodity fund will provide and to get any picture of what impact it will have in providing a solution to the trade problems of the Third World.</P>
    <P>In considering the Bill and the agreement we are ratifying now, it is important to have regard to the steps along the line on which this agreement developed.  The base line is probably the UNCTAD-IV Conference in Nairobi in 1976.  As is usual in international conferences, there was fine language about the problems and vague general commitments in regard to finding a solution.  If one considers the proceedings at Nairobi and the resolution adopted there, one will find that all the countries there were convinced of the need for an overall approach and an integrated programme for commodities.  They agreed on a programme of global action to improve market structures in international trade and commodities of interest to developing countries.  Generally the objectives laid down at that conference were such that if they had been fully achieved something very significant would have been done.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling some of the principal objectives.  I refer to Volume 1 of the report of the UNCTAD-IV Conference in Nairobi in 1976.  The first objective on which all countries were agreed was that it was necessary to do the following:</P>
    <P>1.  To achieve stable conditions in commodity trade, including avoidance of excessive price fluctuations, at a level which would:</P>
    <P>(a)  be remunerative and just to producers and equitable to consumers;</P>
    <P>(b)  take account of world inflation and changes in the world economic and monetary situations;</P>
    <P>(c)  promote equilibrium between supply <Col N="221" /> and demand within expanding world commodity trade.</P>
    <P>That was the first and principal objection but in addition to that there was a further list which concerned the improvement and sustaining of the real income of individual developing countries, the improvement of market access and reliability of supply, the improvement of market structures in the field of raw materials and commodities, the harmonisation of stocking policies, the improvement and enlargement of compensatory financing facilities for the stabilisation of export earnings of developing countries and so on.  It is relevant for anyone interested in this area to read what was agreed at that international conference and to see how far we have gone in the context of this Bill and the International Common Fund for Commodities towards achieving those objectives.</P>
    <P>I spoke about reservations but the main point I would stress is that there is a danger that we might think we have achieved a lot when what we have achieved is very little indeed.  The agreement establishing the Common Fund for Commodities was adopted in June 1980. I accept that it will go a small way&mdash;but only a small way&mdash;towards overcoming the problems and meeting the objectives of UNCTAD-IV and it has to be seen in that limited context.</P>
    <P>When figures are floated around one gets the impression of enormous funds being available, of tremendous goodwill on the part of the western world, of the emptying of pockets to meet the problems. A very sizeable figure of US $750 million has been mentioned and at first glance that appears a very substantial figure.  However, we should examine the figures closely.  Very often in this area figures are quoted that are never fully realised and, perhaps even worse, much of the money does not bring any direct benefit to the Third World.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the figure of US $750 million.  A sum of $400 million is for the first account but of that only $150 million is being contributed by governments in cash.  Already that reduces the direct cash contribution very substantially.  There is to be a further $150 million available in <Col N="222" /> case of need but, again, in the past we have seen where funds were established, where calls were made but were not met. The balance of $100 million is to be in callable capital for use for fund managers as security for raising loans on the open market.  Therefore, we should not get the impression that there will be a body provided with $400 million by the developed world for the first account.</P>
    <P>The same applies in regard to the second account.  Of the $350 million we find there will be $70 million from the minimum contribution together with voluntary contributions.  I wonder about these contributions.  The point I am making is that we should not be carried away by a figure of $750 million, thinking that money is on the table and available.  It is not.  It is as simple as that.  It may be available in certain circumstances but the past record of many of these multilateral agencies would not provide any certainty that all the money would be available now or at any time.</P>
    <P>When looking up these figures I came across an old hobby horse of mine concerning the contributions made by the countries known as Group D.  It cannot be stated often enough that while we try to arouse support and sympathy for the developing world in this country, we have at all times to put it in perspective, and in particular in the perspective of what is coming from the eastern block countries.  According to Keesings Archives, 19 October 1979, I noticed that as usual the major contribution of 68 per cent comes from Group B, the developed countries, 10 per cent from the Group of 77 and 17 per cent from Group D the eastern bloc countries.  Again I question the amount of money being made available by the Communist world for any multilateral fund to help the developing world.  We hear their avowals of fraternal support and sympathy but when it comes to producing hard cash it has to be said they are always in the background.  This cannot be forgotten and they should always be reminded that the level of their contribution does not in any way equate their rhetoric to their support in the Third World.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="223" /> The best way we have of making that point is by showing that we are doing our bit, that we are doing our best.  In that situation we would have a moral position from which we could exert pressure not alone on other countries of the western world but on the eastern bloc.  This is a point worth noting.  We should continue to press in every way we can in the times ahead because these countries in the Communist world will have to be made stand up to their international obligations in a way they have never done before.  It is up to us to continue to exert pressure to ensure they do so and the best pressure we can exert is the moral pressure of being above reproach in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is an aspect to this common fund which causes me some concern.  Another of my hobby horses is the bureaucracy of multilateral aid organisations.  Here we have a common fund to be managed through a governing council and an executive board.  We have a new major multilateral organisation.  Each member state will appoint one governor to the council. This means we will have an enormous top-heavy council, meeting God knows how often, but presumably not having an executive function.  This is a big international body and one is entitled to wonder at the cost and expense of the management and control of such a body.  The council will elect 28 executive directors to sit on the board and will appoint a managing director.  In addition a consultative committee will be appointed to advise on projects suitable for financial aid from second account.  I cannot say if that is the best structure, but over the years of negotiation, since Nairobi 1976, this was one of the factors in regard to the power of control in the situation. Ultimately, from the point of view of structures and voting rights, normally negotiation results in the achievement of a delicate balance between the Group of 77, the western world and the eastern bloc.</P>
    <P>As a small country with an interest in developing co-operation we should be aware not only of the dangers of these big international organisations, of another layer of international bureaucracy, <Col N="224" /> but of the amounts of money we are supposed to be providing, hopefully, to give direct benefit to the Third World but which is wasted on international bureaucracy. I worry that a fair amount of the funds which will be provided for this common fund will be wasted on administration.</P>
    <P>The last FAO report &mdash; one that shocked me &mdash; stated that over 60 per cent of the funds were spent on administration. Such a figure does not call in question the merits of attaining the objectives of an organisation like FAO, but it calls in question the will of the member bodies to reduce this waste and to get rid of a large amount of those layers of bureaucracy so that the funds being contributed will go towards directly benefitting the Third World.  This will have to be borne in mind by us in the years ahead.  So far our subscriptions to international bodies have been so small that we have not had any right to question the structures.  Now with a developing policy in this area, and hopefully with greater funding in the years ahead, this is an aspect which will have to be looked at very carefully.</P>
    <P>We talk about our problems in finding savings in our own structures &mdash; there is the problem which exercises the mind of the Minister and his colleagues in his Department &mdash; but we must have the same approach in regard to these international organisations and, as a small country, we must continue to press that point.  We must put an emphasis on the cost-effectiveness of the multilateral organisations generally.  To some degree we have a weapon in our own hands.  If we are not satisfied with the cost-effectiveness of these multinational organisations we can ensure that the small amount we contribute is either not contributed or not increased.  I know there are mandatory contributions which have to be made but, in the area of voluntary contributions to these multilateral bodies, we have the weapon that the small amount of money we contribute is under our own control.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we have a developing bilateral aid programme ourselves which is far more cost-effective than much of the <Col N="225" /> work of multilateral agencies.  We can tend to provide increases in the bilateral areas rather that the multilateral area. These are all policy options which will be available to the Government in the years ahead.  These are matters which must be considered and on which policies must be agreed very quickly as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>From the Opposition benches we welcome this Bill.  It will go a small way towards providing help for the Third World by making funds available for the provision of butter stocks and so on.  In joining in the setting up of this organisation, let us not believe that we have in any way solved the trade and economic problems of the Third World.  We should see it in the context of being a small move.  Now that we have joined in this small move, we should commit ourselves to joining with others in providing bilaterally and multilaterally in the years ahead better steps towards a solution of the problems of the developing world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this Bill.  It is appropriate that we should discuss it because perhaps we are not too far away from becoming a Third World country ourselves. It might be in our interest to know the advantages to be gained from this fund, the International Common Fund for Commodities.</P>
      <P>I am interested in the definition of a Third World country.  I should like the Minister to tell us the countries which fit into that category and the countries which benefit from aid such as that which is being provided in this Bill.  Sometimes I am mystified as to where exactly this aid goes.  I should like to see a list spelling that out clearly.  There is a great deal of indifference in this country because of the lack of knowledge of where exactly the money goes.  If the public knew the destiny of that money they would be far more willing to contribute a sizeable sum of money which we could afford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each year we aim to contribute something like .7 per cent of our gross national product.  That is the aim.  I do not know if we have ever succeeded in achieving that goal.  I am particularly interested to <Col N="226" /> know what countries throughout the world meet that target.  I suspect it is largely confined to members of the western bloc.  I would be interested to see a table indicating the amount voted by every country in the world to funds such as this.  I am quite sure the United States, West Germany, France and the other major countries in the western bloc contribute the stipulated amount, .7 per cent of their GNP.  Do the eastern bloc countries do likewise?  Do Russia, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, who have a reasonably high standard of living, keep their end up?  Do they contribute to funds such as this?</P>
    <P>It would be extremely unfair to expect a small country such as ours to contribute one million American dollars, which is the amount mentioned in this Bill, together with a further 250,000 dollars to such a fund if countries with vastly greater resources are not pulling their weight.  Probably we could afford to pay more, but there will be a begrudging attitude if it is found that countries which are much better off materially than we are, are not contributing anything at all, or very little.</P>
    <P>One of the objectives in this integrated programme as stated by the Minister is to stabilise the price of commodities at a level which will help to maintain adequate production and at the same time be consistent with the long-term progress of developing countries.  I can see a great deal of sense in the stabilisation of prices of commodities.  It means that the poorer countries will get a fair price for their produce at all times.</P>
    <P>We have often heard of exploitation by the larger powers of weaker nations and underpayment for crops in particular. Quite often the United States is blamed in this regard, and particularly central and southern America.  In essence the Bill is praiseworthy and must be supported. I see some dangers which I should like the Minister to consider and which may be inherent in such stabilisation.  We should not be prepared to pay prices which are above the going rate.</P>
    <P>Recently there was a meeting of the OPEC countries and, following many weeks of discussion and quite a bit of <Col N="227" /> disagreement, the organisation in question, which contains some of the Third World countries, strangely enough, came up with a price of 31 dollars per barrel of oil.  This price is quite a reduction on what has been the going rate in recent years.  It drew loud protests, in particular from Nigeria, which I believe &mdash; and I am open to correction on this &mdash; is a third world country and which had been receiving something in the region of $35½ per barrel of oil.  The budget for Nigeria was based on a continuation of that price or, if anything, an increase.  When the OPEC countries agreed to this reduction, because of the fall in demand for oil occasioned by a glut on the oil market, there were loud protestations from countries such as Nigeria which had based its economy and economic projections on a much higher price.  They blamed the countries in the western world for deliberately depressing the price and, consequently, in turn blamed their economic ills on the western world.  That is not the correct way to approach the situation. There must be competition, there must be free trade and prices must fluctuate according to the demand of the markets. Stabilisation of the prices of commodities can be beneficial.  However, it can be used in the reverse sense by making us pay artificially high prices for some necessary and very expensive commodities. Of all of those commodities oil is the most essential and most costly in our economy today.</P>
    <P>I should not like to see the use of the poor mouth by certain countries being abused or utilised in such a way as to militate against our economic policies and forcing us to pay artifically high prices for commodities for which we can ill afford to pay extra money at any time.</P>
    <P>When replying perhaps the Minister would endeavour to specify clearly the third countries involved and which can benefit from the provisions of this Bill. Perhaps he might also furnish us with a list of the commodities coming under the provisions of this fund.  I presume they are comprised of agricultural produce we expect from third world countries, such as rubber, coffee, rice, hard timber <Col N="228" /> products, ground nuts and a whole host of other such products.  I would hope that the commodities would be confined to that range of agricultural produce and also minerals which may be found in large quantities.  I might point out that some of these countries experience difficulties due not solely to lack of stable prices but rather to their lack of organisational ability. I am surprised that funds expended to help the third world are not based more on funding organisational methods and schemes, because a lot of those countries are unable to manage their affairs in a manner beneficial to them.  It is quite obvious to any of us who have been to such countries that that is their greatest problem, they are unable to manage their affairs and need the expertise available in developed countries.  I often wonder should we be providing manpower and experts rather than actual finance.  I have misgivings, such as those expressed by Deputy O'Keeffe, in that so much of this money does not reach the source of the problem, that much of it is used for administrative purposes, on pure bureaucracy and, quite often, in straight-forward corruption.  Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned a figure of 60 per cent, an astounding figure, for administrative purposes.  As recently as yesterday I saw a report from the EEC maintaining that two-thirds of the money allocated for agricultural development in Ireland is used on administrative expenses.  That is absolutely disgraceful.  That type of expenditure cannot be justified.  In this country, whether it be aid from the EEC or aid to the Third World, we must scrutinise the manner in which that money is distributed to ensure that administrative costs are kept at a minimum and that the bulk of the money reaches its proper destination.</P>
    <P>I must pay tribute to Deputy O'Keeffe and to people like Dr. Eamonn Casey, Bishop of Galway, for the manner in which they highlight the problems obtaining in the Third World.  We would be totally unaware of the problems &mdash; we are not sufficiently aware but we would hardly be aware of them at all &mdash; were it not for such people.  We owe them a deep debt of gratitude.  I would ask the Minister <Col N="229" /> to bear in mind that we have the manpower and expertise so badly needed to utilise these funds, help those countries, and that any aid programme should be based more on what we have to offer in that area rather than actual finance so terribly scarce in this country at present.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, hope its objectives will be fulfilled and that its provisions will operate for the good of the people it is designed to help in Third World countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The general tenor of the Bill is very much to be welcomed in its basic intent and objective which is cited as the stabilisation of commodity prices. But there are a number of factors about the Bill I find somewhat disturbing and which would warrant considerable clarification on the part of the Minister.</P>
      <P>First and foremost is the question of what could be the ultimate liabilities of this country under the provisions of this Bill and agreement.  I see a reference to an initial contribution limitation of £1 million.  But it would seem that the matter need not end there because there is provision in the agreement under which this country would be obliged to furnish guarantees to the fund.  I see no reference to any ultimate maximum figure for which this country could be made liable on foot of such guarantees.  I find that a source of some concern.  Conceivably the liabilities we could incur could be substantial because of the very broadness of the possible scope of this fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The documentation refers to commodities and I see no limitation on the nature of the commodities that would or could be dealt in by the fund.  The range of commodities is vast and I would think that the fund would be hard put to it to make an impact across the board on the various types of commodities available. The question then arises as to in whose interest these funds would be applied. Gold, oil, silver and diamonds are all commodities.  Some of these raw materials are produced by the largest, most powerful and wealthy nations in the world.  For example, gold is a commodity with numerous uses not only in jewellery but in industry and the same applies to <Col N="230" /> diamonds.  The primary producers of those commodities, to take just two, are South Africa and the Soviet Union. Could it be that the fund would intervene in the market of commodities of that nature?</P>
    <P>The producers of oil are also among the wealthiest nations in the world, fortunate to be blessed with a commodity they can pump out of the ground and sell, thus building up huge reserves of capital at the expense of other less fortunate countries.  Of particular concern to me is the indication given that this fund will intervene in the market when prices of commodities are falling.  That could be a very hazardous and costly operation.  The price of gold and other commodities in the last few years has fallen disastrously. One could visualise a situation where the fund to which this country will be a contributor might have to contribute further through its guarantees and intervene in a commodity market and purchase vast quantities, no doubt, of that commodity and see the price go lower and lower and lower.  We might find perhaps that we were called upon to issue guarantees for appreciable sums for which our taxpayers would be held accountable.  That requires some clarification and comment.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said that the commodity market is the most speculative of all forms of investment and that the movements in it can go for very long periods in one direction either up or down.  Is this going to be a speculation in the commodity market in which we shall participate? There is an air of doubt and uncertainty running through the Bill and Explanatory Memorandum.  It is not quite clear if this is intended as something to help the Third World.  Is that its objective?  Or is it something that developed countries are gearing up and applying for their own industrial purposes, to procure their raw materials in a certain way?  Frankly, if the object were to benefit Third World countries and assist in their development, it is a very worthy objective and would have my full support in the context of the particular needs of the individual third countries concerned and also in the context of the needs and abilities of our own country to make such contribution.  That <Col N="231" /> is also a very vital factor that must be taken into account in granting assistance to Third World countries.  When you decide to assist developing Third World countries by giving them grants or other assistance at least you know what your contribution will be.  You decide on something commensurate with your own economic resources and means but under this system you do not know what your contribution will be in the end.  We do not know how much we will be called upon to pay on foot of the guarantees provided for in the agreement and which presumably we will be obliged to give if called upon to do so.</P>
    <P>There is also the question which was touched on by Deputy Deasy of the amount of the contribution that actually gets through in a worthwhile way to those Third World countries.  When one makes a direct contribution, presumably virtually all of it would get there but the operation of this fund, it seems, will involve an enormous bureaucracy which will make substantial inroads into the fund.  It has been said and perhaps with some truth that our own bureaucracy is top heavy but at least that bureaucracy provides employment for our own people whereas the enormous bureaucracy&mdash;as I visualise it &mdash; that would be involved in the operation of this fund would be located elsewhere and provide employment in other countries.  That is a major factor.  I have seen the matter of the same common front for commodities discussed in the UK and the question of the location of the fund was regarded there as a key factor.  In the course of the debate in the British Parliament it was stated that the British Government welcomed the creation of the fund and it invited the organisation to site its headquarters in London. The Dutch and Philippine Governments have issued similar invitations but no decision has yet been taken.  I do not see anything to indicate that our Government have issued an invitation to site the fund or any of its institutions or offshoots in this country.  Perhaps the Minister might consider that aspect of the matter to see if that could be done.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look down the list of <Col N="232" /> countries that are participating and to find that both the US and the Soviet Union are participants in this scheme.  It is refreshing to see that there are some matters in which countries of such diverse interests both east and west of the Iron Curtain can participate but it must be said that some of the countries that are indicated in the schedule as participants in the scheme are notorious for their failure to meet their obligations to international funds, to the United Nations.  I think some of them failed to meet their proper obligations as members of the United Nations for the peacekeeping force in the Lebanon.  Can we be sure these countries will meet their obligations to this fund and that their reaction in this case will be different having regard to their failure to meet obligations to other international forces?</P>
    <P>I am concerned that we would have a commitment here to these international commodity organisations.  I do not know how many of them there would be.  We are not told what commodities we would cover.  Our control would be miniscule, virtually non-existent in relation to international commodity organisations because of the relatively small participation we would have.  Yet it seems that those international commodity organisations, remote bodies, staffed by people with whom we would have little connection and over whom we would have little control because of the low percentage of our voting strength would be in a position to involve us in commitments which the Oireachtas would have to meet, as provided in section 3 (4), which states that we would have to vote moneys which are paid under guarantees.  We could perhaps be involved in substantial sums of money and we would have very little control over them.</P>
    <P>The broad thrust of the concept seems good.  I do not know how this thing would work out in practice or if it would be of any benefit to us.  I do not know the extent of the commodities concerned, the stability of the prices of those commodities, the extent to which we would need those raw materials.  One can visualise that the more highly industrialised countries would have a greater need and a <Col N="233" /> greater interest in them.  Perhaps the purpose of setting up this fund is that it will be of immeasurable benefit to them and perhaps little benefit to us.  Those are some of the fears I have after studying those papers.  Perhaps the Minister may be able to ease my mind and that of the House when he replies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett, Clare) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett, Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>,<i>Clare):</i> I would like to thank the Deputies for their contributions and their obvious interest in what is involved here.  I will try to deal with the points made by the three Deputies who made contributions.  The Deputies raised the question of what commodities are involved.  The fund can actually help any commodity provided there is an international body to promote the production and trade of that commodity.  The main commodities so organised at present are cocoa, coffee, rubber, tin and sugar. There is a long list which could be incorporated at any time if there was an international body to promote the production and trade of them.  It is so varied that it contains everything such as cereals, bananas, coffee, tea, vegetable oils, meat, tropical wood, cotton, hard fibres, phosphates, iron ore and many more commodities which could be incorporated under this agreement if the commodity was organised by an international body for the production and trade of that commodity.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor spoke about the question of guarantees and the danger that could be involved for us.  Each guarantee we would be called on to give would have to come before the two Houses of the Oireachtas and the Government.  The Houses of the Oireachtas can exercise their discretion in agreeing to give any guarantee.  The amount of our guarantee would be related to our trade share, which is unlikely to be a significant proportion of world trade.  We are not running any unnecessary risk in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor also referred to the danger of speculation.  This fund is concerned with positive intervention rather than speculation.  Producers and consumers joining ICOs associated with the fund will agree on an equitable floor and ceiling <Col N="234" /> price and market intervention would range between these.  This is not a case of uncontrolled speculation.  The fund is designed to promote stability in the market, as I said in my opening speech.  It is true that the amounts available from the common fund are not great.  The developing countries hoped for much more, but following long negotiations and long discussions this was the most which countries involved in those discussions were prepared to put into the agreement.  It is possibly the usual problem, as Deputy O'Keeffe said, of very good intentions until you are asked to put up the money to prove your good intentions or your great interest in those intentions.</P>
    <P>It is also true that the developing countries are faced with shortage of capital and barriers to trading.  Many international bodies, notably UNCTAD, are endeavouring to help production in the Third World and to liberalise trade.  This will be one of the central issues at the UNCTAD conference which will convene in June 1983.  We must hope that the developed countries will practice what they preach and take more positive steps to enable the Third World to expand its trade.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Deasy mentioned the top-heavy organisations that could envolve from setting this up. This is very true from experience, but unfortunately that is how it is because most international organisations become the major bureaucracies.  It should be realised that the Third World delegations are in the forefront when it comes to creating larger bureaucracies.  This has been the experience with regard to them. They are possibly picking this up from the developed countries.  This has happened with previous international organisations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy asked who benefits.  The principal commodities are cocoa, coffee, rubber, tin and others may emerge.  The beneficiaries at the moment would seem to be the African and Asian countries, a few countries in South America and the Carribean area and also, as has been pointed out, the second account is designed to develop production and research in the weaker countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" /> Deputy Taylor spoke about the siting of the headquarters.  The UK have made a bid for London and they may have a good chance because London has a developed money market and some international commodity organisations already have a London headquarters. The feeling is that the headquarters will be at London, Amsterdam or Geneva. We can try for an Irish headquarters but our chances may not be great.</P>
    <P>The Third World countries and the official development assistance was mentioned during the course of the debate. There was reference also to official development assistance for Third World countries. This is not really a matter for discussion under this Bill but something that could be discussed when the Foreign Affairs Estimate is before the House. While this agreement happens to be the business of the Department of Finance, the question of official development assistance is a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Regarding the assistance we have been giving to these Third World countries, there have been gradual increases since 1974, when the figure was £2,500,000.  In 1981 it was £17.8 million.  That was a sizeable improvement and this year we have adopted the sum provided for in the previous Government's Estimate for 1982 and that is £26.335 million.  There has been a considerable improvement in the amounts each year under successive Governments.  I thank the Deputies for their contributions and for their co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify a point regarding the question of guarantees.  He mentioned that section 3 provides that any guarantee would have to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas but, as against that, Article 14 of the agreement, or the Treaty itself, provides at section B for an obligation on members to provide guaranteed capital directly to the fund.  It seems, therefore, that the State would have a direct liability in that regard.  Perhaps the Minister could confirm whether that is the case.</P>

        <i>(Clare):</i> The money referred to by the Deputy is part of our initial contribution and there is a definite ceiling on that.  So far as guarantees are concerned, any guarantee that we would be contemplating would have to come before the Government first and then before both Houses of the Oireachtas for ratification.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not seeking to oppose the section but there is one point arising out of the Minister's reply on which I should like clarification.  This relates to the question of function as defined by the Minister, and in this case <Col N="237" /> we are talking about the Minister for Finance.  In his reply the Minister of State said that questions relating to ODA and so on should be raised appropriately when the Estimate for Foreign Affairs is before the House, but this is part of the problem.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that for technical reasons there is finance involved and that, consequently, the Bill was introduced by the Minister for Finance.  That Minister has a function in this, but something that was agreed on all sides of the House was the question of the danger of funds being wasted because of bureacracy in these large international organisations.  I pointed out that there is a growing need on the part of this country to monitor this problem and to be continually watchful and aware of the dangers involved.  But who is to do this?</P>
      <P>This brings me to the situation in which the apparent division of function as between the Department of Finance and the Department of Foreign Affairs in this area will ensure that what is everybody's business is really nobody's business.  I believe this to be what is happening in many of the international organisations dealing with Third World problems.  With due respect to the Department of Finance, that is not their business.  In the Department of Foreign Affairs there is a development co-operation division who are dealing with multilateral agencies. That is their problem and they should be continuing to see what is happening on the international front in regard to international agencies.  They should be continually expressing our view regarding cost effectiveness and so on and continually pressing for a solution to the various problems that arise.  Unless we make it clear that that is their function, that that is what we expect them to do, it will not be done.  If we have two different Departments each having a finger in the pie we can be assured that nothing will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am not opposing the section nor am I proposing any amendment to it, I am making a point which must be made. As a member state we are to have a member, one governor on the governing council.  Perhaps that will be the only tenuous contact we will have with this <Col N="238" /> body apart from the provision of funds. We should make the most use of that contact and the person appointed&mdash;presumably a civil servant or a member of the diplomatic corps &mdash; should report regularly to the development co-operation division of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Such reports together with reports from other international bodies would help to build up a picture of these multilateral agencies which are designed specifically for the purpose of providing help in one form or another for the developing countries.  We must be clear how we are to deal with this matter in the future so that we will have the chance of having a more effective voice in these international fora.  If we do not make clear decisions in this regard we will lose the chance of being instrumental in cutting down on the waste and on the bureaucracy and of ensuring that funds are used for the purposes for which they are voted.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> We will be represented on the governing council by a nominee of the Minister for Finance who will be capable of looking after our interests in that regard.  The Bill is a matter for the Minister for Finance because it is a banking piece of legislation.  With regard to the question of co-ordination I do not see any reason why there cannot be proper co-ordination and discussion between the section of the Department of Finance that is involved and the Department of Foreign Affairs which is involved in giving official assistance to the Third World.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response although I understand his thinking.  Inevitably there is good in each Department and all officials work for the State.  I would not question the ability of any staff in the Department of Finance.  However, the approach of such staff to this problem would be different to the approach of officials of another Department.  If we are committed to having a greater impact on the multilateral agencies on the question of development assistance and co-operation <Col N="239" /> with Third World countries then some section will have to take charge of it and the obvious section is the development co-operation division of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  While we have an official from one Department going to a meeting of one body and an official from another Department going to a meeting of another there will not be any co-ordination. I make that point strongly because it is one of the challenges that faces us in the years ahead if we are to continue &mdash; I hope we will &mdash; with our policy in this area of development co-operation. We will have to take more notice of what is happening in the international development agencies.  That is why we should not just have representation for the sake of representation.  We should have policy objectives in mind and one should be able to ensure that such organisations are as cost-effective as possible. That applies to many other organisations. United Nations and EEC organisations. If we are to have this scattered approach to the problem we will not achieve anything.  I accept that I will not achieve much at this stage but I suggest that the various organisations dealing with the Third World &mdash; I am not interested in international finance or banking &mdash;should be serviced by the development co-operation division of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  That division should be in a position to implement Government policy in relation to multilateral aid generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bellew</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday I referred to the folly of the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, introducing in his January budget a proposal to tax short-term social welfare benefits.  I disagreed with that proposal, as did the electorate. However, it is important to acknowledge that there are defects in the social welfare system and it would be remiss of Deputies to ignore that.  Something must be done in relation to the acknowledged abuses that exist in some areas of the system.  One would want to be going around blindfolded and ignoring the facts to pretend otherwise.  Recently I received representations from a man who was annoyed that while he was sick from his employment with a local authority he was in receipt under the social welfare system of £33 per week more than he would have been receiving had he been at work.  That is manifestly wrong.  I know that person was one of the minority who object to this, but it should not happen.  The money could go to more necessitous cases.  The Minister for Finance, in conjunction with the Minister for Social Welfare, should review the regulations in relation to the calculations of the disability benefit, particularly the pay-related element.  If those regulations were rectified an area of complaint would be removed.  It distresses the honest <Col N="241" /> workers that others avail of the system to get benefits greatly in excess of their weekly wage.  I do not know what revenue is lost to the State in this regard, but I am sure that it is sufficient to warrant a look at the regulations and amendment of them in the light of results of any such investigations.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy in every town and village is aware of the malpractice carried on to a considerable extent of persons signing on for unemployment benefit and at the same time working.  Anyone who suggests that this is not happening is not acknowledging reality and is ignoring an issue which is detrimental to the welfare of those who should be in receipt of as much social welfare assistance as can be provided.  I refer particularly to an area where more assistance is needed, although assistance is given &mdash; an area which is in many cases ignored because the people are unable to stand up and fight for their rights.  I refer to the mentally handicapped, particularly those who are looked after by their families in their own homes.  These are very deserving cases which could do with more financial assistance, which could be provided if the abuses were eliminated.</P>
      <P>Another related area on which we have had much discussion over recent weeks is the pay-related social insurance contribution scheme.  There has been an amount of misrepresentation in relation to this subject during the course of the debate.  One should bear in mind that the contributions made under the scheme are paid directly for benefits administered by the Department of Social Welfare, which benefits have been requested by Deputies on all sides of the House.  The most persistent requests are for greater increases in these benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one compares the present pay-related social insurance scheme with the old national health insurance stamp, the present scheme is manifestly fairer and more equitable in regard to the lower paid worker.  Under the old system, the stamp was fixed at one value, irrespective of the gross wage or income of the person involved.  This was grossly unfair to those in the lower paid industries in receipt of small wages, by comparison with their <Col N="242" /> counterparts who were engaged in much more lucrative employment.  I recall receiving representations from those engaged in the clothing industry&mdash;an industry traditionally regarded as one of our lowest paid.  Employees were objecting to having to pay £5 per week in respect of national health insurance stamps when in receipt of wages of approximately £50 or £60 a week, while employees engaged in more profitable industries, earning in the region of £150 per week, were paying precisely the same amount.  If one equated those wages with the present system, the lower paid person would be paying approximately £3.60 per week while the person in the higher remunerated employment would be paying approximately £13 per week.  If one is serious about the distribution of wealth and about social justice this is as it should be.</P>
    <P>It is not correct to submit that the system is weighted more heavily, in its absolute terms, against the lower paid worker.  It is an important element in the field of social justice that those in receipt of a greater amount of financial reward should pay the greater proportion of the taxes.  However, there might be scope for consideration at some later stage, as a result of the review of the system, of a minimum ceiling where the pay-related contribution would begin, just as there is a maximum ceiling where it ceases. Allowing for the recently introduced special income tax allowance which will not really benefit the lower paid worker, if the suggested system were introduced it would directly assist the person in the most vulnerable position.</P>
    <P>I welcome the special income tax allowance of £312 which was discussed in the House yesterday.  This goes a long way towards eliminating any sense of injustice in relation to the new increased rates.  This must be welcomed as an interim measure to help to resolve the existing conflict, which conflict will continue until such time as the system can be examined fully in the light of the report of the Commission on Taxation, which report we expect in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>When discussing this issue, it is important to bear in mind that Deputies will be <Col N="243" /> faced with the stark choice of acceding to requests for less taxation and on the other hand trying to equate that with the demand for increased social welfare benefits. Just as it is not possible to put a quart into a pint bottle, it is equally impossible to extract a quart from a pint bottle.  If we demand services, we must accept that they will have to be paid for. It is important that justice be done and that those in the position to pay are asked to pay their fair share.  In the end, our system of economics, with all its flaws and failings, can only produce a certain amount of tax for redistribution to those in need.  It is right that those in need, such as the elderly, the widows and the unemployed, should receive an amount which will allow them to live with dignity.</P>

      <P>I welcome the decision to introduce a special charge on derelict sites.  The practice of acquiring for subsequent development property which is allowed to fall into dereliction and depreciate in value is one which should have been discouraged long ago.  The media have suggested that the problem in relation to dereliction exists only in this city of Dublin, but every Deputy is aware that it exists in every town and village in Ireland.  For the greater benefit of the community at large, it should be prohibited or prevented.  I hope the special charge will have a direct and meaningful effect on this situation. It is not right that people should be allowed to buy houses, in many cases over the heads of tenants, allow them to fall into decay so that they may sell them at some future opportune moment and make vast sums of money without, in the meantime, contributing anything to the community at large.  It is morally unjustified that this should be allowed to happen and the decision on the special charge is more than welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Minister's statement <Col N="244" /> dealing with decentralisation of Government Departments.  The reintroduction of this measure is very welcome because many people in rural areas were appalled at the decision of the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, to scrap it and deprive very many areas of an impetus to the development of their local economies. I urge Deputies who had their constituencies included in the original proposals to ask the Minister for Finance to re-include them in the revised programme for decentralisation.  I hope that the section of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which had been projected to be transferred to Dundalk will be placed there and save many hundreds of people from having to travel to Dublin to their employment.  The transfer of the Department, while being of benefit to the local economy, would also eliminate a vast amount of traffic on the road between here and the North.</P>
    <P>I also wish to draw attention to the absence of any reference in the budget statement to any decision or intention to maintain the special employment subsidy or levy which was available to the clothing and footwear industries, at least until 31 December.  I welcome the decision to increase the amount of money available under the employment incentive scheme. This is the work experience programme carried out by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to express my appreciation to Deputy Yates and I am sure his contribution will be all the more valuable when he has a little more time to consider it.</P>
      <P>This budget reflects our basic philosophy in regard to the development of the economic and social potential of our country.  That philosophy is that our country, in its people and its resources, has greater potential for growth and development than any other country in the European Community and that potential must be fully realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="245" /> We have a young labour force which is equipped to master the most advanced technological industrial processes; an emerging corps of Irishmen and Irishwomen possessing the enterprise, energy and innovation required to develop a successful domestic economy and export trade; access to a free-trade European market of 270 million people; financial and tax incentives highly attractive to manufacturing and service industry investment; and an economic infrastructure in telecommunications, roads, urban services and facilities, ports and harbours which is being brought up to the highest modern standards.</P>
    <P>The budget gives initial practical effect to our economic and social philosophy though we were unable in the time available to change as much as we would have liked in the budget we inherited.  But we have, as we promised, made important fundamental changes which altered greatly its economic thrust and widened substantially its social dimensions.</P>
    <P>A central feature of our budget is the targets we have set for a reduction in the budget deficit and in the level of borrowing as compared with 1981.  We intend to adhere to these targets through rigid control of the public finances.  Should any additional expenditure become necessary for essential purposes, this will have to be met by a corresponding reduction in expenditure elsewhere.</P>
    <P>If these are not sufficient, additional taxation might be necessary but we must all now realise that we are reaching a situation where the possibilities of additional revenue are becoming increasingly limited and there is a definite reluctance among the general public to accept further tax measures.</P>
    <P>It is mandatory, therefore, that we give greater attention to controlling the growth in public expenditure so as to avoid taxation increases.  We have completed the Departmental staffing reviews initiated by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, last December. The reports on these reviews have now been submitted and will be used as a basis for securing administrative efficiency and savings in all Departments.  This must be done skilfully and sensibly.  Essential <Col N="246" /> services to the community, particularly to the underprivileged, must be maintained and the impetus to greater economic activity and employment must be continued.  Within those guidelines, we intend to control rigidly the level of public expenditure, by ensuring the most economic deployment of staff and the highest levels of efficiency.  This will be a continuing and unremitting exercise.</P>
    <P>Equity in our system of taxation is something that should always be pursued but the need for action has now become a matter of urgency.  We gave the Irish Congress of Trade Unions a commitment under the second national understanding and we have, in all our taxation decisions, acted to achieve a fairer and more equitable system.</P>
    <P>Let me recall that in 1980 we introduced income-splitting for married couples, who now have double the personal allowance and rate bands applicable to single persons.</P>
    <P>The special allowance for PAYE employees was introduced by us in 1980. This allowance recognises the need to alleviate in a special way the burden borne by the PAYE sector.  Persons and families on low incomes have greatly benefited under our programme for greater equity in taxation.  We introduced complete tax exemption limits for people on low incomes, including the ill and the unemployed.  We also provided a system of marginal relief for taxpayers with incomes just above the exemption limit. This provided a worthwhile relief for the less well-off while at the same time ensured that the relief is directed to those most in need.  As a result of this measure, 75,000 persons were removed from liability to income tax in 1980, 33,000 benefited in 1981 and the improvements in the exemption limits announced in this year's budget will remove about 24,000 low-income taxpayers from liability. Many more have benefited from marginal relief.</P>
    <P>Age exemption limits for the elderly have also been raised progressively in recent years and further increases will be made this year.  The tax allowances for one-parent families are again being increased this year and, as a result, widowed <Col N="247" /> parents and single parents will have allowances equivalent to the married allowance.</P>
    <P>The blind persons allowance, dependent relative allowance and the allowance for persons employed to take care of an incapacitated taxpayer or spouse are all being increased this year in a further move towards tax equity.  The tax changes made in the budget, together with our recent decision to make a special increase of £312 in the PAYE allowance for those on the higher PRSI rates, taken in conjunction with the increased taxation on financial institutions and on capital profits are all designed to continue this steady progress towards greater equity in taxation.</P>
    <P>Because we recognise taxation equity as a central issue in our society today, we established the Commission on Taxation to review the entire structure and system of taxation with greater equity as a priority objective.  The main report of the commission dealing with taxation principles and all forms of direct taxation, including PRSI, will be available shortly.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the commission which is representative of all sectors of the community will provide an opportunity to review and consider what the next measures should be to improve the distribution of taxation in order to redistribute the burden of taxation more fairly throughout the community.</P>
    <P>We must also recognise that PRSI contributions now represent direct taxation and must be taken into account in any general reshaping of the taxation structure. We agreed with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in our consultative discussions with them that greater equity required some adjustment in the taxation burden which the combined PRSI and PAYE demands place on employees.</P>
    <P>In making the adjustment we have made of £45 million this year in further PAYE tax allowances, we have gone to the absolute limit that equity and the public finances can sustain at this time.  I am glad that this view has been shared by the trade unions who have welcomed our action as a significant attempt this year to ease the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" /> I should like to stress the importance of the consultative process I initiated with congress and with the representatives of employers and farmers in examining together current economic and social issues.  In our democratic society, such a process of consultation is essential to ensure greater understanding and co-operation between Government and the main economic and social interests in the face of the serious problems we face in the current recession.</P>
    <P>The greater the degree of understanding and agreement between the Government and the main economic groups in the identifying of the extent and nature of our problems the greater are our prospects of success in overcoming those problems.</P>
    <P>We are now well under way with the preparation of the Economic Plan which we intend to be the framework for the main economic decisions to be taken over the coming three to four years.  The objectives of the plan are to generate the maximum increase in sustainable employment; to reduce the rate of inflation; to maintain living standards and make them more equitable while restoring the balance of payments to more acceptable levels.</P>
    <P>In the preparation of this plan, we are enlisting the expert assistance of the Economic and Social Research Institute and other research bodies.  In its preparation, also, we will consult with the representatives of trade unions, employers and farmers and with the National Economic and Social Council.  We see the plan as one which will reflect the views of the community as a whole on what our objectives for economic expansion should be, what resources they will demand, how these resources can be mobilised and how they can best be used to the most productive purposes.</P>
    <P>Through this plan we will chart the course of economic development over the next few years.  We envisage it as the first step in establishing a permanent structure for long-term economic and social planning.  We believe such a structure would be welcomed by all economic and social interests.  It is our intention to develop an effective structure for such <Col N="249" /> planning so as to ensure the widest possible consultation, the fullest possible access to expertise and the greatest possible consensus in our society about how to ensure our optimum economic and social development.</P>
    <P>We are a small community whose financial resources are limited relative to the potential for growth which is inherent in our energies and skills, in our natural resources and in the ambitions of our young people.  We intend to mobilise all available resources in a concerted action programme to expand output and increase productivity and competitiveness.</P>
    <P>This action programme should be based on agreed and clearly defined measures and objectives.  We cannot successfully combat unemployment if we have a divisive and disunited approach as a community to the major issue of economic and social policy.</P>
    <P>We intend through our Economic Plan in the immediate short-term and subsequently through our longer-term economic and social planning to provide the means for uniting our energies, our skills and our resources in a concerted programme to defeat the present economic recession by expanding the economy and improving social equity.</P>
    <P>The possibilities and potential are there.  In the face of adverse trading conditions we have developed a growing manufacturing capacity based on advanced science and technology and well able to sell its products abroad. Proof of this is the fact that this year we expect the volume of manufacturing exports to increase by 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>We have in the Industrial Development Authority one of the best industrial promotion organisations in the world.  It has the task of developing our industrial and service sectors to provide the jobs we need.  It has the energy, the enterprise and the expertise.  We intend to provide the capital and other funds and facilities necessary for its success.</P>
    <P>I availed of my recent visit to the United States to meet President Reagan on St. Patrick's Day, to launch a major new drive by the IDA to increase United States investment in industrial and service <Col N="250" /> projects in this country.  I addressed in New York a large and distinguished gathering of leaders in the business and financial community of the United States. In that address, I outlined the opportunities, facilities and incentives we offered for United States overseas investment and I am confident that many have learned, as a result, how unique and attractive these are.</P>
    <P>While it is necessary to review our industrial policy and to refine our range of incentives and facilities, any such review must be based on the IDA continuing to perform its essential tasks.</P>
    <P>We must be sure that the industrial policies we are pursuing are those which are best for our development in the years ahead.  The international economic climate within which our industrial policy must be developed has changed and our policy must take account of these changes.</P>
    <P>The energy crisis, the impact of the new industrialised countries on world markets and the increased competition for international investment funds, present unmistakable challenges.  The increasing potential of science and technology for industrial innovation and the potential which we have in our indigenous resources can unlock many opportunities and should be developed by us. The review of industrial policy by the National Economic and Social Council, the final phase of which is now nearing completion, will provide the Government with a firm basis on which to plan our future strategies.</P>
    <P>Our rapidly growing export earnings owe much to the energies and efficiency of Córas Tráchtála and we have made special additional provision to intensify their programmes.  We must intensify further our export drive if we are to increase employment and raise our earnings.</P>
    <P>Growth in our economy must come from exports.  Apart from the large exporting enterprises established here, we must direct our own domestic industry, our workers and our management to the opportunities for export that exist or can be created.  A recent survey showed that only two in five of Irish manufacturing companies export.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="251" /> How to expand exports faster will be a central objective of our Economic Plan. We must take all possible measures and provide all the necessary resources to mount a major new effort to increase our export earnings.  The present arrangements, resources and incentives are not sufficient to generate the rate of increase in exports which the recovering international markets will offer from now on. I attach the highest importance to developing new policies in this area in conjunction with employers, farmers, unions and State agencies.</P>
    <P>In these policies, the contribution of our representative offices overseas must be fully utilised and developed.  There are many parts of the world where, for historical reasons, and because of the presence of large communities of Irish descent, we should be able to trade to a greater extent than we have.  A new combined and co-ordinated effort in the United States, for example, between our State agencies and our representative offices promises worthwhile returns in greater sales of Irish products and wider promotion of Irish economic interests.</P>
    <P>The serious financial and trading problems of many of our State-sponsored commercial companies is a cause of grave concern.  We are examining urgently the additional investment needed to alleviate or eliminate these problems.  We have to decide what additional capital provision is justified structure and trading outlook of each company and the effect of their combined requirements on our overall situation.</P>
    <P>We must also ensure for the future that the operations of these companies will be closely monitored by modern management accountancy techniques against specific performance criteria and targets. This will have to be done by a central unit without interfering with the day-to-day decisions and management of these companies.</P>
    <P>Probably the most alarming aspect of the current economic recession is the high rate of job losses.  This requires us to improve our capacity to anticipate trouble in particular firms or groups of firms <Col N="252" /> and our ability to respond quickly and effectively to difficulties.  The rescue services of Fóir Teoranta, the Industrial Development Authority and the Industrial Credit Company must be combined into a flexible, highly-refined co-ordinated service which can both anticipate trading difficulties and provide all practicable and justifiable aid so that job losses and redundancies can be avoided or reduced to the minimum.</P>
    <P>I attach special importance to the greater application of scientific and technological innovation to Irish domestic industry both from the viewpoint of import substitution and export growth. We must work steadily towards an arrangement whereby every manufacturing company and every potential entrepreneur has access at local and regional levels to a combination of expert scientific, technological, financial, marketing and management advice.  This advice will be directed to ensuring efficiency of operation, greater output, increased employment and better product development in a comprehensive enterprise development programme.</P>
    <P>The regional network of third level technological and educational institutes and the State industrial, export and scientific agencies must combine in a concerted regional programme to lift the technological and employment capacity of Irish domestic industry.</P>
    <P>The National Enterprise Agency is a new alliance of trade unions, employers and Government directed towards identifying employment opportunities based on technological innovation.  This agency has now been re-activated and given an initial funding to set about mobilising the resources of modern science and technology in new employment-creating projects.</P>
    <P>I have stressed the regional approach to technological innovation because it is central to the economic and social policy of the Government to mobilise and release the resources of all our regions. Under our concept of economic policy, national output is the sum of the regional outputs.</P>
    <P>We are intent, therefore, on diversifying the economic and social life of the <Col N="253" /> regions.  A great deficiency in many regions is the lack of public service employment.  One of our first acts on resuming office has been to revive the programme for decentralisation of Government posts from Dublin to provincial centres.</P>
    <P>Under this programme we will now start advertising for tender those offices for which sites, plans and contract documents are ready.  Of course, a necessary part of the implementation of this programme is full consultation with the representatives of the staffs concerned so that difficulties and problems can be satisfactorily resolved.</P>
    <P>We will advertise not only for tenders to construct these offices but also for tenders to provide these offices on rental, purchase or other similar terms.  We think that investors in property, particularly those funds which are raised in pension contributions or insurance premiums throughout the country, should now look to provincial centres for investment, particularly where the client is the State.</P>
    <P>The economy cannot develop satisfactorily if the flow of investment funds is channeled to only a few centres.  Other countries have long since ensured that such investment funds participate widely in the economic life of the nation and we are now providing an opportunity for this in our economy.</P>
    <P>To match our commitment to regional development, we are at the same time undertaking a comprehensive new programme of urban renewal.  It has become increasingly clear in the last decade that the regulatory powers of the planning Acts are not sufficient to bring about the balanced economic and social development needed to create living neighbourhoods in our inner urban areas</P>
    <P>We have decided, therefore, to intervene in a positive and energetic way to regenerate those inner urban areas which have suffered economic, social and environmental decline and decay through a combination of unbalanced investment and neglect.  Our approach is threefold. We will set up by legislation, which will be introduced almost immediately development commissions for areas of particular neglect in any of our towns and <Col N="254" /> cities.  There will also be an inner city authority for Dublin in the first instance to implement economic, social and educational measures for the whole inner city area.  Also local authorities are being provided with funds for programmes of special relevance to inner city areas.</P>
    <P>We are initiating this programme in the Dublin city area but our intention is to extend it to other similar areas in other towns and cities.  Already some elements of our programme have been extended to areas outside Dublin like our £1 million fund for the rehabilitation of dwellings in the inner city areas.</P>
    <P>Our commitment to intervening by a combination of administrative, financial and taxation measures to bring back stable neighbourhood life to our inner cities is one that has widespread support throughout the community.  We will bring to this programme the same enlightened resolve which in the past cleared the slums and built the great housing estates of the suburbs.</P>
    <P>We also intend to improve the quality of life in the suburbs.  Too often in the new large housing estates there are instances of social, cultural and economic deprivation even amidst greatly improved housing and neighbourhood conditions.  The National Community Development Agency, which will have a fund of £2 million this year, is a new effort to improve the quality and content of community life by combining State aid and the resources in self-help and voluntary effort of communities faced with economic and social deprivation.</P>
    <P>Our concern to correct the economic and social inequality between inner city areas and other areas which have benefited from the economic and social progress of recent decades is part of our general concern to reduce economic and social inequality in our society.</P>
    <P>We still have significant inequalities of income and opportunity due to social class, family cycle and the fact that we are at a relatively early stage of our full economic and social development.  We, as a Government, are fully committed to reducing progressively these inequalities.</P>
    <P>Our budget measures were based on our fundamental principle of protecting <Col N="255" /> the living standards of the less-well off and increasing as far as possible the transfer of national income to them.  The increase of 25 per cent in social welfare benefits was part of that policy.</P>
    <P>In addition to the general improvement for all beneficiaries, we made a number of special improvements for particularly vulnerable categories of the population. These include the double week's payment in September and December for the child dependents of weekly social welfare dependents.</P>
    <P>We are providing greater equity for women in the social welfare code by removing the anomaly whereby married women who are separated from their husbands cannot qualify for unemployment assistance unless they have dependent children.</P>
    <P>In the field of income tax, we are taking special steps to improve the position of one-parent families, many of whom are women.  As a result of the changes proposed, both widowed parents and single parents will be in receipt of allowances equivalent to the married allowances. This is a progressive development and one which has been pressed for over the years by various concerned groups.  We know from those writing on the subject of family welfare that the costs of maintaining a family are particularly high when there is only one parent and it is right that their vulnerable position should be ameliorated as much as possible.</P>
    <P>Participation in second and third-level education is not adequately spread among all socio-economic classes and we will give special attention to this problem. The increased provision of £200,000 for education services in the educational priority areas of urban centres is a first measure to offset as quickly and as effectively as we can the special educational disadvantages of children in those areas.</P>
    <P>The setting up of a task force and the provision of a fund to improve the housing of the elderly living alone is a new measure reflecting our concern with this acute social problem.  This country has a high proportion of elderly persons living in poor economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>A recent social commentator has said <Col N="256" /> that, because of the structure of modern society, the problems of the elderly rank low, if at all, on most political agendas because they generally have no interest group to represent them.  Let me say firmly that we have always kept the elderly high on our political agenda and I am determined that they will remain there.</P>
    <P>Our special task force has already commenced work with a fund of £1 million this year to repair and rehabilitate the unsanitary and delapidated accommodation occupied by many elderly persons living alone.</P>
    <P>This is part of a consistent series of special measures we have taken over the years to improve the economic and social conditions of the elderly.</P>
    <P>We introduced home help and meals on wheels, the system of welfare homes of which there are now 35, the provision of free travel, free electricity and free television licences, the retirement pension scheme, the allowance to look after an elderly relative and the free telephone rental scheme.  We have now made provision for a rent subsidy for people in controlled rent dwellings, many of whom are elderly.</P>
    <P>A very special reform in this year's budget was the provision that medical cards will be made available to all old age pensioners as of right, a measure which has been warmly welcomed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and pensioners' organisations.</P>
    <P>We have more than doubled old age pensions in our three budgets in 1980, 1981 and 1982, which has meant a very real increase in the standard of living for elderly persons.</P>
    <P>These actions are the practical evidence of our commitment to building progressively a society of greater equality and opportunity for all, including those who have retired from direct economic activity.</P>
    <P>We have taken the first step to deal with the problem of speculative gains on the sale of development land by increasing severely the taxation of such gains. We are now considering other measures to ensure the supply of development land <Col N="257" /> to major urban authorities at costs which will be devoid of speculative gains.</P>
    <P>Many of the elements in our economic and social policies which I have outlined have been strikingly endorsed by the European Commission in its proposals to the meeting of the Standing Committee on Employment which met last week.</P>
    <P>The Commission put forward proposals for a Community action programme to combat unemployment.  This arose from the recent European Council, which singled out the need to combat unemployment as the first priority of the Community.</P>
    <P>The Commission considers that 1982 is the year in which positive decisions could turn the economic tide towards a more self-sustaining improvement from 1983 onwards.  The Commission considers that action should be concentrated on public investment to create public and private jobs, on restructuring of sectors in difficulties, on new enterprises and employment creation and on local employment initiatives and co-operatives.</P>
    <P>Our policies reflect these recommendations. We have increased the public investment programmes which are now at levels which are probably the highest in the Community.  It is noteworthy that the Commission has singled out, among the objectives of public investment, inner city housing and amenity renewal, expansion of the telecommunications systems, urban sanitary services and new energy sources, all of which figure prominently in our investment policies.</P>
    <P>One of the most important measures in our budget was to provide an additional £50 million for investment in the construction industry.  This additional investment is directly intended to provide an immediate increase in employment. The bulk of these funds will be expended by local authorities and it is urgently necessary that each individual authority should get schemes and projects off the ground as quickly as possible so that this extra capital can be translated immediately into jobs.  The quicker they get these projects and schemes under way the quicker will unemployment in the industry be reduced.</P>
    <P>Our programme for expanded technological <Col N="258" /> innovation, ranging from the small industry programme of the IDA and SFADCo to the new National Enterprise Agency, is also clearly within the ambit of the Commission's proposals.</P>
    <P>We expect that the Commission will bring forward, arising from the examination of these proposals, specific Community measures to complement and accelerate national programmes.  The programmes we are already initiating will we hope be assisted in due course by these Community measures.</P>
    <P>I have referred earlier to the need to control the growth in public expenditure. Equally important is the need to ensure that the public administration is fully productive and efficient in the tasks the community assigns to it.  The structure of Government Departments has evolved over a long period of time.  I am not satisfied that they are necessarily organised in a way that takes account of changing circumstances and the relative importance of different sectors of administration.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to make certain changes in organisation and the allocation of functions which would have the effect of a better concentration of effort on major national areas of development. The administrative machinery of Government must be continually reviewed to take account of the changing problems and needs of society and I intend to give effect to that principle.</P>
    <P>We have made a determined effort in the budget to reduce the rate of inflation. We maintained food subsidies, subsidised CIE fares and reversed the decision to impose VAT of 18 per cent on clothing and footwear.</P>
    <P>With the moderating trend in international prices, particularly in oil prices, we have the opportunity over the coming 12 months to reduce significantly the rate of inflation.  This is an economic prize which we must not let elude us by decisions which would generate domestic price increases.  Lower rates of inflation will help our exports, increase employment, reduce taxation arising from public service costs and will lessen the erosion of family budgets.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is still our most important <Col N="259" /> basic industry.  In this respect we differ significantly from most EEC countries where it accounts for only a small proportion of national output and employment. It accounts directly for nearly one-fifth of our total employment and clearly its well-being also greatly affects the development of other sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>We are determined to reverse the downturn which has affected agriculture since 1978, brought about by a combination of adverse influences in prices, input costs and weather.  Some progress in halting the recession in agriculture was made in 1981 with the aid of measures which we introduced in 1980 and early 1981.  We have finalised the reduced interest rate scheme for farmers in severe financial difficulties.  This has come into operation from April 1 and should ease the difficulties of farmers who borrowed for productive purposes but were adversely affected by the recession in their industry and the high rates of interest on borrowed money.  We have also brought grants under the Farm Modernisation Scheme back up to the level at which they were before September 1981 and we are using every avenue open to us at EEC level for an early and favourable decision on farm price increases for Irish farmers in 1982.  It is in our vital interest that Irish farmers and thereby our whole economy are protected in the review of community policies currently being undertaken.  The future well-being of Irish agriculture will also be positively helped by the measures we are adopting to bring down inflation which has been a primary cause of the difficulties experienced by Irish farmers in recent years.</P>
    <P>Work is now under way, in consultation with farmer organisations and research and advisory bodies, on a development plan for agriculture.  This plan will contain the essential measures to unlock the vast potential for growth which exists in the skill of Irish farmers and in the rich resources of our soil and livestock.</P>
    <P>The serious under-utilisation of the capacity of our meat factories and the <Col N="260" /> attendant high unemployment among meat factory workers are matters for grave concern.  Currently the through-put in the factories is only about one-quarter of capacity.</P>
    <P>We are carrying out, through the sectoral development committee, a fundamental study of the practical ways the output of the beef industry can be increased.  This study is being carried out under an expert group representative of trade unions, farmers, meat factories and Government Departments and agencies.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, we are taking immediate positive measures to improve the outlook for this industry.  Expansion of the breeding herd is a first priority.  The calved heifer national-interest subsidy of £70 this year, which we hope to have supplemented by a £22 calf premium from the European Community, is designed to stimulate that expansion.  We are pressing for an even more generous calved heifer scheme from the European Community.  We have succeeded in obtaining the same export refunds from the EEC for carcase beef as for live cattle. We are concerned to tilt the balance in favour of meat exports as against live cattle exports.  Veterinary inspection fees will now be the same for live exports and for meat factories.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture will visit Libya shortly to press that more of their requirements of beef be met from cattle slaughtered in Ireland.  We are also developing beef exports to other new markets, including Iraq, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.</P>
    <P>We have also been concerned that raw material for the factories was being lost as a result of smuggling into Northern Ireland.  As a result of trilateral meetings between the Department of Agriculture, the Northern Ireland authorities and the EEC Commission, improved control measures were brought into force at Northern Ireland factories.  These have had the result during recent months of eliminating or substantially reducing the level of cattle smugggling.  We will closely watch this situation to ensure that the progress made is maintained.</P>
    <P>Oil is an essential strategic resource for the expansion of our economy.  The recent abundant supply of oil on the <Col N="261" /> world market and the stabilisation in oil prices have in no way weakened the Government's resolve to explore our own seas to the full and find and bring ashore our own oil.  Our own oil supplies would remove an important constraint on our balance of payments in which oil imports account for about one half of the deficit.</P>
    <P>Negotiations for the second licensing round will soon be completed.  This licensing round will give rise to a very high level of seismic exploration activity in addition to the continuation of the drilling programme.  There will be a resultant high level of drilling exploration over the next few years in the areas now to be licensed.</P>
    <P>The Porcupine has been the main focus of attention and its possibilities are still being explored.  In addition, improved technology now indicates a very considerable potential in the Celtic Sea.  This year, the Goban Spur will be drilled for the first time.  This will open up a new exploration area and the results could be significant.  The drilling here is being carried out in the deepest water so far explored in our exploration programme. There is steadily increasing evidence to justify an expectation that we will locate and bring oil ashore.  We will spare no effort in that exciting enterprise.</P>
    <P>A major element in our battle to overcome our economic difficulties and pull ourselves out of this recession is the generation of hope and the restoration of confidence.  There has been too much destructive comment and exaggerated criticism.  I appeal now to the Opposition and other sideline commentators to stop running down our economy.  They may see some narrow party political advantage in so doing but they should also understand the damage which they can do to our national morale at home and our standing abroad.</P>
    <P>We welcome both constructive advice and practical criticism.  But generalised negative and destructive statements about or economy and our currency can be very damaging to the prospects for our economy and for the confidence of overseas investors in it.</P>
    <P>What Ireland needs today is a wave of positive thinking.  There are opportunities <Col N="262" /> on every side.  We must identify them and start planning their development. There has been a surfeit of pessimism and protest, defeatism and denigration.  The time has come to list our assets and plan for progress.  The IDA, for instance, have put us into the top league in the world of electronics.  The possibilities in this field and the related area of satellite communication are enormous and exciting.  The sea bed is another new prospect for future development.  We will succeed if we believe we can succeed.  I am not asking for any starry-eyed foolishness or decrying realistic and sensible criticism and analysis.  But I am asking for increased concentration on what can be achieved with the very great resources at our disposal if we organise ourselves efficiently and put in a real effort.</P>
    <P>Our income per head in 1981 was £2,327.  To double that figure over the coming decades is a task well within our ability as it involves raising industrial output and agricultural output by a combined 6 per cent which is clearly realisable. Our newly developed capacity in technological and entrepreneurial skill should, given favourable international economic conditions, enable us to achieve even faster growth and hence double our income per capita in a shorter period.  That is the task and goal which we should face with confidence and faith in our abilities.</P>
    <P>I have given the House an outline of the practical and prudent measures the Government have been taking to reverse the undesirable economic and social trends with which we are faced.</P>
    <P>These measures are designed to put the economy back on course so as to achieve greater output, increase efficiency, improve social equity and, above all, increase employment.</P>
    <P>Through these measures and in our humane approach to our budget proposals, we have clearly demonstrated our commitment to economic progress and our firm resolve to bring about greater social justice.  We are pledged to the constant improvement in the quality of Irish society as a whole.</P>
    <P>In doing so we will harness the ability, the energy, the idealism and enthusiasm <Col N="263" /> of every section of the community and will utilise to the full our greatest resource of all, the talents, the skill and the genuine patriotism of our young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of his speech the Taoiseach referred to the enormous potential of our young people.  As one of those young people and the youngest Member of this House, firstly I must note in the period I have been here, almost a year, the rapid changes that have taken place not only to different sides of the House which Members have swapped within that period but also the different approaches and emphases in terms of dialogue put forward by the respective political parties.  I fail to understand how in comments on the July speech we have moved from a situation of crisis, future instability and insolvency to one where now we talk about positive thinking, new horizons and a better future.  Although I noted in the Taoiseach's speech that he said, quite factually and correctly, that our Government introduced the budgets of 1981 and 1982, it is slightly less than fair to talk about denouncing our input into the 1982 budget.  Our greatest achievement within the seven months was that of going within perhaps 2,000 votes throughout the country of inculcating into people the preparedness and the reality to accept what is so essential if we are to have the right conditions to progress economically, to provide enough employment and to have enough money for our many social needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Taoiseach spoke of the strictly unavoidable nature of our problem, and I regard the acceptance by the present Taoiseach of the demands which many pressure groups make on our society as the difference, in political terms, between the national interest within Fine Gael and the self-interest within fianna Fáil.  As a basically independent Member of this House in so far as I have not been reared to the die-hard political traditions, how hollow the jeers of the Fianna Fáil Members last summer seem.  Then they spoke of the unholy alliance, the chicanery <Col N="264" /> and the Gaiety Theatre when we see now the chicanery in regard to the high office of a European Commissionership. Instead of the Gaiety Theatre document we see the unholy alliance of certain of our Independents and the Summerhill parade document in association with Deputy Gregory-Independent.  All of this leads the ordinary man in the street to a total lack of credulity about politicians in general as to when they are sincere in what they say in this House.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to dwell too much on the political aspect, as it is a debasement of this budget.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance when concluding will speak about my first major criticism, the emphasis that Deputy Bruton put upon the need to reform the way we discuss our budget in this House, and the need to plan the public finances in a better way.  I find it most disillusioning that I am speaking now, in May, about a budget and the Financial Resolutions especially that were voted on in March, and for that reason are now effective.  Therefore, perhaps all of us, even the Taoiseach, are no more than wasting our time reviewing these matters.  It would be far more effective and realistic if we were, with due respect, to take some of the power out of the civil servants' hands in preparing budgets, and we would have a full opportunity to discuss the Book of Estimates on the expenditure side and the different proposals for revenue from October onwards as the previous Minister has outlined. I would like to hear some such commitment being made &mdash; there has been none in either the Minister's speech or the Taoiseach's speech in this area&mdash; and then we could have it reviewed.  That would give an opportunity for Members to debate the budget properly and make a real contribution.</P>
    <P>As 90 per cent of the Minister's budget is similar to what we in Government had produced on 27 January, for which I voted, all Members of this House are in an invidious position in regard to what they can criticise objectively as they have, in fact, voted on it.  My greatest and sincerest objection is the infamous three-card trick that Fianna Fáil have played in this budget.  They have fiddled the figures, <Col N="265" /> cooked the books and deceived the public in their preparation of this budget. The first trick is that in regard to the corporation tax of £36 million.  Not only is this a repeat of Fianna Fáil's previous performance in this area but it will choke further industries and firms who are fortunate enough to be making a profit.  We all know that if growing industries, large or small, are to thrive, they must re-invest in their firms.  Now, instead of having some profits available which they can plough back into the firm, they will have to pay it in earlier payments of tax and this will mean that they will have to borrow more money to finance growth in their enterprise.  Accordingly, less money will be available for job creation and this will affect interest rates and will lead to a situation where the high interest rate of 22 per cent will not abate.</P>
    <P>The second part of the infamous card trick is in regard to tax buoyancy.  During the general election we heard that when Fianna Fáil were returned to power there would be tax buoyancy&mdash;because everything would be all right&mdash;to the amount of £25 million.  As this is insufficient now, they allow that it will have to be £45 million.  I question seriously the grounds for their optimism.  In my constituency I know of no industrial or manufacturing enterprise who in their annual report and accounts for the year ending April 1982 have shown a better year than previous years.  Except for a few in the area of electronics and health care products, all industries are caught in a cost-price squeeze and find that their margins are narrowed and that in regard to the real prospect for growth, that is viable exports, things have become so competitive that they cannot produce goods at a competitive price and, therefore, there is no reason either for their employees or their firms to believe that they will see any tax buoyancy.</P>
    <P>The real queen, the lady in this three-card trick, must be the £140 million raised in bringing VAT forward to the point of importation.  I have outlined the difficulties firms are facing in financing their operations.  I believe that this will be the straw which will break the camel's back. I know of an employer in the south of <Col N="266" /> the country, in Munster, who promised a TD, a Member of this House, that he would take on two young lads.  A fortnight ago the TD approached this employer who said to him, &ldquo;I am very sorry, I cannot take on those two young lads.  In fact, I have to let off three of my lads.  Because I collect my raw material from the docks, it is costing me an extra £40,000 to finance it and I must cut back&rdquo;. In a matter of probably only six months we will see the real effects of this very damaging change.  We must remember that when the Government party put this before the people the expected revenue was £45 million in this area.  They said clearly that raw materials and imported articles, such as farm machinery, which were so essential for viable production and growth areas such as agriculture and industry would not be affected, yet now they have all been affected and will suffer the knock-on effect.  All retailers and wholesalers will have to pass on to their customers the increased costs of financing and this will lead to a situation where the Government's projection of a 2 per cent increase in inflation for the coming year will be extremely inaccurate.  Such an amount could be added on now.</P>
    <P>The concession in regard to stamp duty will cost £2.3 million in 1982 and £3 million in 1983.  We have as yet no indication of the revenue which will accrue in 1983 from the imposition of VAT at the point of importation.  This Government have neatly brought into the revenue for this year two months' revenue from next year.  This is a measure unlike the imposition of, say, 1p on a bar of chocolate, the revenue from which would accrue every year.  The measure the Government have imposed is one of deception; it is fiddling the figures and cooking the books.  It is most unfair and misleading and the opening deficit next year will be between £800 million and £900 million.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the recent economic performance of Fianna Fáil in government. The opening deficit in January 1981 was £515 million but the resultant deficit was £850 million.  Half of the projected current deficit for this year has already been taken up.  I realise that there is scope for improvement and that the <Col N="267" /> election had some effect but I feel that the figure for the projected deficit is wrong and is another case of misleading the public.  There will be resultant political effects.</P>
    <P>A most important matter is the repayment of our enormous debts and our progress as an economy.  Our priority must be to create the right background and climate for growth.  Our immediate concern must be our currency and the high level of interest rates.  Successive Governments have always accepted that ours is a small economy, that we cannot act independently and that we are subject to many European and world factors and changes.  Possibly to our detriment we are not strong or competitive enough to fight these trends.  It is most alarming to compare our interest rates with those prevailing elsewhere.  Interest rates are dropping in Britain, America, Japan, Switzerland and Germany, yet in this country they have never been higher.  At present the rate on certain loans is 22 per cent. Any farmer or business man involved either in the manufacturing or service sectors will find that the cost of financing has risen incredibly and his enterprise may no longer be viable.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have said when interest rates have risen that there is nothing they can do and in their simplest form interest rates respond to the market factors of supply and demand.  If demand exceeds supply interest rates rise.  Both the public and private sectors are now up to their eyes in debt.  The Government, through their own agencies and through the semi-State bodies, have borrowed abroad and are repaying in foreign currencies.  This is very expensive so they have now turned to the home market and have used up so much of the available domestic credit that there has been a credit squeeze on the private sector which has resulted in closures, job losses and the non-viability of various enterprises.  The Government must, through strong leadership and courageous speeches, attempt to reform the will of the people and achieve an acceptance of the need to create the right economic climate, to bring down interest rates and inflation <Col N="268" /> and to cut our borrowing requirement and our current deficit.  Unless we ensure that we do not spend, through Government agencies, more money than we are earning, we will always have to borrow and the private sector will be sqeezed for finance.  We will be in a vicious circle where there is not enough money to pay for anything and we will continue to borrow.</P>
    <P>I do not believe this Government have the political will to be unpopular enough to say to the people that this vicious circle must be broken and that we must cut our cloth according to our measure.  The Taoiseach may say that this is negative and gloomy.  I accept that there are in our economy enormous areas of potential and growth.  Basically we must look for the area where we can produce exports on a viable and competitive basis.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the Public Capital Programme for which £1,004 million has been allocated.  It is reasonable to ask what value we are getting for this money in terms of viable employment.  In fairness to the Government they have a policy on employment.  It involves public works schemes and public sector jobs. The Taoiseach referred in his speech to many improvements in the area of urban renewal and social welfare, the recruitment of extra gardaí, the re-introduction of grants for agriculture and measures to combat unemployment.  All these measures will have an employment creating effect but at what price?  The money will have to be borrowed because we have not the revenue to pay for existing services, let alone new services.  Borrowing will put extra demands on the money supply and squeeze the private sector even further.  These short-term public works schemes and jobs are at the price of long-term viable private enterprise employment.  I would reject that policy in the long-term.  It will prove that any addition to the public sector payroll has only an illusory and short-term effect in solving our unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>We have enormous natural resources. In the agricultural area, we have 1,200 acres of land which, if it were reclaimed, could produce more.  I fail to see why schemes could not be devised, either <Col N="269" /> through the mechanism of the EEC or by the Department of Agriculture, to help us produce more out of our own resources.  We should have a scheme of grants to help Irish contractors carry out the necessary work, using Irish machinery. This would keep the money within the economy and in 20 years' time we would benefit from that.  In addition, we would have the short-term gain of reducing unemployment.</P>
    <P>In the south-east we export timber at £1 per tonne to the Scandinavian countries. In many counties there is an enormous potential for timber and forestry production.  In the west of Ireland one can see miles of bogland that could be developed.  I do not see any reason why this bogland cannot be stripped off.  We are importing coal and other energy products.  We could plant acres of forestry that could be used.  In the south-east we have not even one drying kiln to process timber.  The Department of Social Welfare operate free fuel schemes whereby the Government, out of borrowed money, pay vouchers to people, and rightly so.  Yet we are providing very cheap fuel for the Scandinavian countries. It is absolutely crazy.  This is one area where jobs could be created and where there would be a return for State money.</P>
    <P>The Celtic Sea has enormous potential for herring fishing.  Deputy D'Arcy and the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, will know of the fish processing firm of the Lett Brothers in Batt Street, Wexford. This firm is very successful and it proves that Irish companies and firms can be successful.  It started 25 years ago as a small enterprise in a tin shed but now employs many people.  The firm exports rainbow trout, shrimp and many fish products and it sells quality products at a competitive price.  I do not understand why we are importing fish valued at £10 million when we have enormous potential for mariculture.  I do not understand why we do not utilise fully the lakes in the west of Ireland, the inland rivers and the Celtic Sea.  I know many fishermen have great difficulties at the moment, but much work could be done in the area of fish processing.  Efforts should be made <Col N="270" /> to improve arrangements for storing fish and for selling it at a competitive price.</P>
    <P>This country has enormous potential for tourism.  Somehow politicians and State agencies tend to hive this area off to Bord Fáilte.  Our State agencies deal with people every day of the week, foreigners as well as natives, and I do not know why they are not orientated towards selling this country as a place in which to holiday.  A circular should be issued to each local authority to ensure that the regional tourist board produce a leaflet setting out what each county has to offer.  This leaflet should be easily available.  Every other country does its utmost to encourage visitors and we should not be an exception.</P>
    <P>We should look again at our public capital programme and give it closer scrutiny. I accept the need for infrastructural improvements.  In the short- and long-term we must consider how to help private enterprise by way of grants or subsidised interest rates and so ensure that our abundant natural resources are utilised to the full.  In this way we will create jobs and provide money for the many social services we need.</P>
    <P>In the area of employment I am very alarmed at the lack of incentive to work. I know of many people who have worked and reared their families for 27 years.  For them there is very little incentive to go to work.  They know that when they work they must pay their PRSI contributions, but if they were unemployed they would collect pay-related benefit.  When they are working they pay income tax but if unemployed they would get a tax rebate over one year.  Instead of paying levies on employment they would get redundancy pay if their firm ceased operations. Instead of acting in the national interest and in the interest of their company by accepting a pay increase of 12 per cent, they would get a 25 per cent increase on social welfare benefits.  If they work a five-day week they get paid for five days, but social welfare operates for six days. There is the ludicrous situation that where people on a five-day week have been put on a three-day week because of the recession they find they are better off.  When the economic situation <Col N="271" /> improves and the company reverts to a normal five-day week they have to be compensated for working a five-day week because social welfare operates on six days.  this is a crazy situation, especially as the State cannot afford to pay this cost out of its own revenue.  The money has to be borrowed.</P>
    <P>Low paid workers were assisted by the family income supplement of £4 per week but unfortunately this allowance has been abolished.  This raises a question of whether there is an incentive to work.  I accept that social welfare recipients are dependent on the Government for their livelihood, but there must be a ruthless approach to this matter so that it will pay people to get up and go to work each day. The present situation leads to abuses.  At the moment people draw unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance and also work on the nixer.  If we do not do something in this area we will have a society where dog eats dog, where people on the nixer will be envious of those on the dole full-time and both of those categories will be envied by the people who are paying for them by working full-time. The Government must direct their attention to this matter.</P>
    <P>There are several points in the budget which relate to young farmers.  As Deputies from Wexford know, a few nights ago we had a meeting with Macra na Feirme at which three requests were made, all of which the Government are in a position to grant.  First, there was a request that the two-year period during which stamp duty liability on land to young farmers is removed should be extended.  I am glad that this Government have maintained the commitment we gave in respect of young farmers under the age of 35.  However, this concession should be extended for longer than two years.  In this way farms could be retained as family holdings and young people would have an incentive to come home and work them.  Young farmers could be more ambitious in their plans for their farms and this would be in the national interest.  I tabled a parliamentary question knowing it would be ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle. <Col N="272" /> However, I hope the Minister will respond to this point later in the debate.</P>

      <P>First, is the Taoiseach aware that his reply to Deputy Fitzpatrick is difficult to reconcile with his statement this morning when he said that in the preparation of the plan the committee will consult the representatives of various bodies, including farmers.  He seems to be confusing the order of events.  Second, does he appreciate the significance of the question I asked at the outset about whether it would be a realistic plan, because his speech this morning seemed to cast doubts on this, when he said that he would expect the views of the community as a whole on what our objectives for economic expansion should be, and later he said that this plan would chart the course of economic development over the next few years.  What should be, and what is likely to be, are two different things.  I am sure the Taoiseach appreciates this.  Will he give an assurance that the assumptions on which the plan is based will be realistic, and based on present policies with an indication of the changes in policies required to achieve better results?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two or three questions. They will not take long if I can get through them.  In view of the fact that the year contains roughly 240 working days, and that a public holiday notoriously has a spin-over effect into the days on either side of it, would the Taoiseach not agree that the effect of creating a new public holiday will be to cause a drop in industrial output of roughly ½ per cent thus representing yet a further home-made handicap for Irish industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly a public holiday will have some effect on national output, but it could be hoped that this drop in national output would be more than restored by increasing competitiveness and efficiency throughout the economy.  I should like to point out to the Deputy that, in the European league, we are lower than most with regard to the number of public holidays of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be time enough to bring the number of our holidays <Col N="281" /> up to a European level when our productivity, which is roughly half the German and Dutch average, is also at the European level?  Would that not be a rational way to proceed instead of hanging yet another handicap around the neck of Irish industry which we are all supposed to be supporting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to have a balance between competitiveness and holidays.  The Deputy should remember we are now in the latter half of the 20th century and there are enlightened ideas about the conditions of workers, holidays, and so on.</P>

I might also mention that the allocation of £2 million for the establishment of a National Community Development Agency, referred to by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in his budget speech, will facilitate initiatives to meet the needs of various deprived groups including children. In addition I shall have a small sum available for special developments and I will be giving sympathetic attention to spending this largely in the child care area.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the development of services for deprived children and children at risk, I would envisage the expansion of family support services.  I consider that such an expansion would serve not only to help families in stress to cope with their problems but also as a significant preventive measure against the incidence of non-accidental injury to children.  This would of course necessarily entail an increase in personnel, including social workers.  I shall be examining the extent to which this can be accomplished in the light of the financial position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department are at present carrying out a comprehensive review of the procedures for the management and control of the problem of non-accidental injury to children.  The desirability and feasibility of introducing a service on the lines indicated by the Deputy will be considered in the context of this review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give a definite commitment to the establishment of a 24-hour emergency service? <Col N="288" /> Would he not agree in the light of the fact that three children died as a result of baby battering in the last 12 months such an emergency number is necessary? Would the Minister also consider it also in the light of the fact that until the health boards took over this function the ISPCC for many years operated a 24-hour seven days a week service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pointed out that a review is taking place and that this will be considered in the context of that review.  There is no guarantee that a 24-hour service would make any difference to the incidence of non-accidental injuries. The Deputy is probably aware that in the UK as many children now seem to suffer ill treatment as before the introduction of the 24-hour system.  Their experience has been that problems arose mainly at night and that the assistance of the police was very much required and requested and was particularly valuable in that area.  In fact a number of those who introduced it in England have stopped the 24-hour service.  Nonetheless I have asked the committee to review the position and see if it is desirable to take that action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that baby battering is not something that occurs between nine and five from Monday to Friday and in those circumstances would he not agree that there is a need for a seven days a week 24-hour service with which people who believe children are at risk can make contact and seek professional assistance from social workers? Would he not also agree that at present our services in this regard are defective?</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to think that all our services in every area are defective.  I should like to point out that the gardaí play a very major and welcome part from the point of view of social workers.  The social workers consulted by my Department certainly recognised the need for a strong presence, such as that <Col N="289" /> of gardaí, in the heat of the moment in such situations.  It was regarded as particularly important and in many instances even where another measure was being taken gardaí had also to be called in. They do provide a round the clock service. I have told the Deputy that this matter is being considered in the context of the committee's review.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will probably be aware of the history in regard to this project which is a major one and very urgent and necessary in that region as a whole.  I appreciate the Deputy's concern. Before I left office as Minister for Health last year I had provided the funds to arrange for the commencement of this work.  Those funds were clawed back in the £2.5 million capital which was clawed back by the Minister for Finance of the Coalition Government and the scheme was stopped.  The project had not reached the contract signed stage and the money was clawed back.  I am telling the Deputy that I am still just as committed to going ahead with that project and I shall certainly press ahead with it as urgently and as early as I can within the resources available to me this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The person referred to in the question, who is a juvenile, requires orthodontic treatment.  In Dublin this is provided for eligible persons in two ways. Some patients are treated by the health board's whole-time dentists, usually following examination and the drawing up of a treatment plan in respect of the patient by a visiting specialist orthodontist. Other patients, including those requiring the more difficult forms of treatment, are referred to the Dublin Dental Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A health board dentist examined the child in question and discussed with a parent possible courses of treatment to help rectify the orthodontic condition. He took impressions of the mouth with a view to studying the case further and possibly seeking consultation with a visiting <Col N="297" /> specialist orthodontist.  However, the parent subsequently indicated that she did not wish to pursue this course of action and wanted the child treated at the Dublin Dental Hospital.  The child's name was therefore placed on the waiting list for treatment in the Dublin Dental Hospital.  This list is, however, extensive and it is not possible at this stage to say when treatment will commence.</P>

      <P>It is not possible as yet to state precisely all the changes in the estimated non-capital expenditures on programmes and services, as set out in the Appendix to the Health Estimate for 1982.  This can more appropriately be after the health boards have taken decisions on the changes that can be made in their services budgets taking into consideration the extra funds which have been notified to them.  They are at present considering this situation.</P>
      <P>While health boards will now be in a position to incur expenditure in excess of what would have been possible on the basis of the expenditure allocations approved last January and so avoid drastic curtailment of essential services, it is not expected that this should result in any significant increase in the overdrafts of the boards in the course of the year as compared with what the situation would have been if additional funds had not been made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of growing concern among parents and some chemists in relation to the easy availability of cough mixtures which contain certain types of drugs which are open to abuse by young people; and if he will consider the introduction of stricter control in these circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question by him on 13 May 1980.  The preparations involved are normally available only from pharmacies.  In this connection the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland have alerted all pharmacists to the need to exercise caution in the sale of these preparations, especially to young persons. The society recently issued a set of rules to be observed in regard to the manner in which cough mixtures are displayed in pharmacies and outlining certain precautions to be taken in connection with their sale to the public.</P>
      <P>Having regard to these measures I do not consider that the imposition of stricter legal control is warranted at this stage but I am keeping the position under constant review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the increasing evidence from all sources that this is a problem, is the Minister satisfied with the present situation which is completely based on voluntary efforts and on the goodwill of the pharmacists?  Presumably, there is this goodwill in most cases, though clearly not in all.  Therefore, is there not a need for some kind of monitoring of the situation by the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is monitored, and monitored perhaps in more detail than the Deputy recognises.  But it is not possible, given the great number of these substances which used for their normal purposes are quite harmless, to implement very tight regulations in respect of <Col N="301" /> all of them.  Also, it becomes a matter of increased cost if one tries to do that.  The number of cases of abuses of cough mixture reported to the treatment centre at Jervis Street hospital was 41 in 1980 and 26 up to August of 1981.  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland have alerted their members to the situation and they operate fairly strict regulations in relation to the question of making sure that these cough bottles are not displayed in windows and are given out by supervised staff.  They recommend that there should not be unaided selection by the customer and they have issued particularly strong guidelines to their pharmacists in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Minister is not basing this fairly complacent attitude on the number of cases reported to Jervis Street.

What is the process of monitoring that the Minister speaks about in regard to this area?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the steps being taken to implement the WHO International Code on marketing of breast milk substitutes which was signed by Ireland in May 1981; and if he will indicate in particular: (1) the communication concerning Articles 4.2 and 9.2 that has been entered into with the manufacturers and distributors of breast milk substitutes in Ireland; (2) if he is prepared at this stage to implement <Col N="304" /> Article 11.2; and (3) the names of the non-Government organisations, professional groups and consumer organisations that have been requested to collaborate with him as required by Articles 11.2 and 11.4.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The WHO International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes was adopted in the form of a recommendation under Article 23 of the WHO constitution, to be implemented by member states having regard to local circumstances.</P>
      <P>To assess the relevance of individual articles of the code to circumstances in Ireland, my Department are currently collecting baseline information, as decisions to implement control measures of the nature laid down in the code must be supported by data to ensure the development of implementation measures which are both justifiable and necessary.</P>
      <P>Pending the availability of the necessary information, my Department have secured the agreement of the food industry to the development of a code of marketing of infant formulae.  In compliance with the requirements of Articles 11.2 and 11.4 of the WHO, Code, my Department have consulted the following relevant professional personnel and groups involved in infant and child care, on the proposed code of marketing of infant formulae: Maternity hospitals, An Bórd Altranais, the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, the Irish Medical Association, the Medical Union, the Irish Society of Medical Officers of Health, the Irish Paediatrics Association, the Irish Dietetics Association, and the health boards.</P>
      <P>The intent of Articles 4.2 and 9.2 of the WHO, Code has been accepted by the food industry and is being provided for in the proposed code of marketing of infant formulae.</P>

      <P>The code was originally developed primarily with the developing countries in mind as a result of the particularly pernicious marketing techniques employed by baby food manufacturers in developing countries during the mid-seventies. The detail which has to be formulated is considerable and I do not know when that will be completed.  In the meantime the code of marketing of infant formulae has been accepted and supported by the industry here.  Indeed, they participated fully in it.</P>

      <P>There has been no significant change in the position since the reply to the Deputy's Private Notice Question on 28 April 1982, Volume 338, columns 1447-1451 of the Official Report.  The possibility of a limited restoration of the service which would not involve the normal <Col N="306" /> use of Connolly Station is still under active consideration at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that parcels posted in Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the US and other countries are being delivered in the Republic and Irish taxpayers must pay the cost of that? Industries and commercial firms are being discriminated against.  Goods manufactured by Irish companies for delivery here or for export cannot be collected by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Will the Minister tell the House the cost involved in having companies such as the Lough Swilly Railway Company, a company from Blarney and a company from Kells make the journey to Dublin to collect international mail for distribution in the areas for which they have the contract to serve?  Vehicles belonging to those companies are empty on the journey to Dublin and are not allowed to collect parcels at the local post offices for delivery in the Republic or to be sent abroad.  How much is that costing? Is the Minister aware that because of this difficulty small companies take parcels to Northern Ireland for posting and those parcels are delivered in the Republic?  Those companies cannot post such parcels in the Republic.  Will the Minister explain why the conveyor belt system which operates in Sheriff Street directly into Connolly Station cannot be used to get the bags of mail from the station to Sheriff Street and from Sheriff Street to Connolly Station?  If that system was operated it would be possible to avoid this human conflict that trade unions find it difficult to handle, namely passing a picket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern, a concern I share.  The position is that drivers refused to pass the picket at Connolly Station and that caused a suspension of the parcel post service.  When this matter was raised recently I told the House that the UK and US post was being delivered.  I know there is considerable stress on small companies but I would be surprised if small companies in Donegal are attempting to post parcels because they are aware that there is no <Col N="307" /> parcel post.  I should like to assure the Deputy that my top officials and myself are concerned about this matter.  We are working on it.  In fact, one of my top officials instead of coming here to advise me today should have been at a meeting to try to get a limited service going so as to avoid using the Connolly Station entrance.  I am not able to answer the Deputy with regard to the actual cost of the service but I will answer him if he tables a separate question or writes to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not ludicrous in the extreme for private companies which have a contract for delivering mail to the Donegal area, in the case of Lough Swilly Railway, and the Kells and Bantry areas in the case of the other two companies, to be paid by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to collect foreign parcels and deliver them to their respective areas for distribution by postmen while small companies in those areas, and throughout the State, cannot use the public service? Is the Minister aware that containers bring imports into this country while the export market is being stifled by the Department?  It is not good enough for the Department to say that the drivers refuse to pass the pickets.  That is a fact but it is not the only reason why the Department have suspended the parcel post service.  If this decision was taken by the Department the Minister should have taken into consideration the effect it would have on small industries who want to post parcels from state to state.  Is the Minister aware that in places like his own constituency, a Border area, or in Donegal, a person who wants to post a parcel from one part of the county to another, or from that county to any other part of the Republic, cannot do so and to overcome the difficulty created by the Department's decision to withdraw the parcel post service if that person crosses the Border and posts the parcel in Northern Ireland it will be delivered in the Republic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is that not a ludicrous situation in which to find oneself?  Would the Minister please take a more personal interest <Col N="308" /> in this matter and try to sort it out?  Everyone is being inconvenienced by it and the State are losing a lot of money.  The Minister must know the cost of bringing a van from the points which I have mentioned, empty on the outward journey and full on the return, and the cost of a container from Great Britain or the Continent with parcels to the Republic returning empty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked me already to take a personal interest.  I can assure him and the House that I am now doing just that.  We are working on arrangements for a limited service and, as I mentioned already, officials of my Department were conferring on that today.  It is not easy.  What the Deputy says about posting in the Six Counties would be the natural thing for people living along the Border.  It looks a little anomalous, but I am in the situation that I would like the drivers to pass the pickets in Connolly Station, as many of their fellow trade unionists are doing.  We would have full restoration of parcel services in a very short time if that happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if he would confirm or deny that, where special arrangements are made by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to go to the premises of manufacturers and collect parcels to be posted and bring them to Sheriff Street for delivery in the Republic, this service is continuing, but the drivers in the parcel delivery service were told that, if they did this, they would be suspended or dismissed. Does the Minister consider that, where workers want to collect mail for firms manufacturing goods in the city of <Col N="309" /> Dublin for export and for delivery to other parts of the Republic, they should be told that if they do that in future they will be dismissed?  Would the Minister confirm or deny if that is the case?  If it is not a fact, will he state clearly that, as was the practice which was heretofore the norm with the Department, facilities will be extended to firms manufacturing goods and that the Department will collect these and bring them straight to the Sheriff Street office, or, indeed, that companies that want to deliver them could go to Sheriff Street post office and would be allowed to do so?  Would the Minister clear up that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the workers are very anxious to have a resolution of the present impasse and I am told, after long discussions with one of my top officials, that they are very anxious to have a substantial alternative service under way in the very near future.  There are problems.  However, I can tell the House that we are working actively on this and it is receiving my personal attention.  I appreciate the concern of Deputy Harte.</P>

      <P>Finally, does the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs consider it reasonable that someone in Donegal posting a parcel to Sligo is not allowed to do so and that that parcel must come through the central sorting office?  It is then caught up in the dispute we are debating.  Would it not be reasonable to allow the parcel to be collected in Donegal for delivery in Sligo without coming through the central sorting office?  Is it not a fact that this proposal was put to the Minister by the trade union officials because of the <Col N="310" /> impasse at Connolly Station and that he has not yet told the trade union officials concerned that he is willing to agree to this?  Is it not a ridiculous situation that someone in Galway wanting to post a parcel to Athlone, or in Cavan wanting to post a parcel to Dundalk must send it through the central sorting office, where because of a dispute as a result of men not passing the picket the parcels cannot be collected by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try not to be tortuous. As I mentioned before the Adjournment, the three requests from our young farmers at this time are realistic and easily acceded to.  First, there is the extension of stamp duty, which I have already covered, from a two-year period as an ongoing thing, to encourage the transference of farms.  Secondly, the ACOT educational and training services have made a specific request to the Department of Agriculture for an allocation of £700,000 now for educational and training purposes to further the technical skills of young farmers on the land, especially those with responsibility for their own farms.  I am not aware if there have been any developments on this but it is money which the Minister for Finance should make fully available through the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="380" /> Thirdly and finally, through the EEC under the farm modernisation scheme, there is provision which can be taken up by member states whereby young farmers under 35 years of age can get 10 per cent extra on their grass where the national government pays £ for £ with the EEC. This scheme has been in operation for many years and successive governments here have failed to take advantage of it. I ask the present Minister to do so as this is a form of revenue and I know the previous Government had great difficulty in getting sanction for many measures which they wanted to implement to assist farmers and the income crisis in agriculture. However, they were obstructed by the EEC and here is a scheme that is easily available already and can be taken up without any obstruction by the EEC. I would ask them to do this as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken about the lack of incentive to work, but there are certain areas within the Department of Social Welfare which are ineffective and inefficient and create anomalies.  The supplementary welfare benefit system is operated through the health boards and this creates a situation where someone on occupational or disability benefit or any other short-term benefits from the Department of Social Welfare can wait up to nine or ten weeks for the payments to which he or she is entitled.  This creates severe and genuine hardship as they are left without any income.  Therefore, they are entitled to supplementary welfare benefits and they sometimes go to the local courthouse or health clinic to obtain this money.  Not only is this system most degrading to the individuals involved, who are made to feel like beggars, but it also results in further delays in Store Street because they have to check with the health board offices or their community welfare officers to see if this money has been paid and that the appropriate deduction is made.  This can result in even further delay.  It would be logical and sensible if the supplementary welfare benefit scheme was controlled by the Department of Social Welfare because it would be more efficient, would utilise existing staff better and would ensure <Col N="381" /> that the hardship I have outlined would be eradicated.</P>
    <P>Something radical will have to be done about the six day week for social welfare. If people work for five days a week and get paid for it, it is unfair that people who work a three day week should receive the benefit because the social welfare system operates for a six day week.  It would be fairer if the same level of payment could be issued for a five day period and this would remove the lack of incentive in this area.  People who receive unemployment benefits have to go to their local employment exchanges once, twice or perhaps three times a week or, in rural areas, they go to the local Garda barracks.  The employment exchanges are usually very small, dingy offices, inadequately staffed, which means that hundreds of unfortunate people who are looking for work have to queue.  Employment exchanges have become unemployment exchanges and are no longer finding jobs.  They have become hand-out offices, dole offices and have a humiliating effect even on people who are not receiving unemployment benefit but who go there to make a simple query.</P>
    <P>Manpower offices in rural towns are very scarce and not properly run.  Albeit with insufficient funds, they provide a one day a week clinic, possibly in a hotel, and are crying out for office space.  The Minister for Labour said at Question Time that they cannot find office space in Enniscorthy.  I cannot see why the Department of Labour cannot incorporate into the employment exchange facilities to provide manpower offices.  This would allow people to obtain their benefits and give them up-to-date information with regard to vacancies arising in different forms of employment.  It would also ensure that people who were supposedly drawing money and were not genuinely seeking work would have the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have treated the motorist as something of a punch bag. He or she has now reached saturation point as far as tax is concerned.  When the present Government were in Opposition they loudly and categorically stated that driving a car was not a luxury and <Col N="382" /> was a necessity for people to travel to their places of employment.  We have a very unusual situation in regard to car taxation.  It was abolished as a popular voting gimmick in 1977 and was re-introduced amidst loud criticism and yet it is increased again.  The old reliables of petrol, LPG, diesel, both red and white, have all been taxed again.  Leaving aside the industrial and agricultural usage of these products, which will have an economic effect which I outlined earlier, this increase in petrol is also a savage attack on the motorist.  The increase in excise duties, the increase from 15 per cent to 18 per cent on VAT also fairly substantially penalises the motorist.</P>
    <P>A major bone of contention, especially among people under 25, is the question of car insurance.  People of my age, some of whom did not do a driving test during the period when there was an amnesty and it was not compulsory to do so, find it extremely difficult to get insurance. Naturally enough, many of these people do not drive new cars, they drive second- or third-hand cars which have a value of £1,000 or less.  They find that insurance for third-party, fire and theft comes to £400 or £500.  Often the value of their cars is almost the value of their premiums, which is totally unfair.  When we were in Government we set up a committee to look into this and I would like to hear from the Minister what the up to date position is.  For the present Government to introduce a levy on insurance companies which will extract £2.2 million is a signal of the last nail in the coffin of the driver in so far as there is no question that these insurance companies will pay this levy out of their own pockets.  Naturally they will pass it on to their clients through premiums and it will be prohibitive for young people to drive because they cannot afford the excise duty on the car, they cannot afford to tax and insure it and, even if they could afford to buy the car, they would not be able to run it.</P>
    <P>Though some people argue that the car is a symbol of social status, there is the all-important matter of the motor industry to be considered.  Last November I and all other Members of the House <Col N="383" /> received a submission from the motor industry.  We were told that in the previous 18 months 4,500 people had lost their jobs in garages, in car assembly plants, in the industry in general.  The motor industry is one of the most important among service industries here, but the Government are treating it wrongly. Because motorists have to pay more and more tax, at least the Government should ensure that roads would be kept fit to travel on.  Unfortunately, though national primary roads have received substantial financing and there has been some improvement, county roads show a litany of neglect, though this is an area in which local authorities have a statutory function.  Instead of embarking on improvements, and I am not talking about road widening or eliminating bends, they are down to filling potholes, and even that is becoming impossibly expensive.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the system of financing local authorities, of which there are 87 in the country.  Not one of those has a reasonable credit balance, unlike the situation before 1977 when local private rating was abolished.  I appreciate that it is easy for this side to criticise the Government for not providing sufficient finance for local authorities, but few will suggest alternative sources of revenue. There are other methods of providing revenue for local authorities without putting an intolerable burden on the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the existence in America and other countries of successfully operated State lotteries through which the taxpayers get relief.  These lotteries are professionally run and here they would be a great extension of the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes.  I am thinking of something that could provide great prize money, something that could be run by co-operation between the local authorities.  The Minister for the Environment should look at this suggestion and perhaps commission a report on such lotteries in other countries.  The Prize Bond scheme and other smaller efforts in this direction of saving-inducement have <Col N="384" /> not been successful in any large way.  The kind of scheme I suggest would need the right kind of professional attitude, with a good public relations organisation. Large amounts of moneys could be made to the benefit of local authorities for the good of local services.  At the moment that money is going into betting offices.</P>
    <P>The financial stress has been greater in regard to urban local authorities than county councils.  The Department have to provide minimal back-up to county councils but urban councils do not have the ability to raise rates in the way that farmers can supplement county council revenue.  The only providers of revenue for urban and borough councils are those who pay water and business rates.</P>
    <P>Therefore, a new finance-bearing structure will have to be devised to provide money locally through a system that will be administratively possible.  I have been a member of the Municipal Authorities Association since 1979 and at successive conferences I have urged that a percentage of the VAT paid on purchases in urban areas should be refunded by the Revenue Commissioners to the local authorities.  Such a refund would be only logical because it would give local people an incentive to shop in their own towns which does not exist at the moment and this has been leading to closures and to a decline in property values.  Local councils have been reduced to the status of talking shops, and a scheme of refunds on the lines I have suggested would give some semblance of authority to local councils.  I would ask the Minister for Finance to look into this in collaboration with local authorities.  Submissions have been sent to the Minister in this regard but there was no response of any significance, and another good opportunity has been let slip.</P>
    <P>Still discussing new tax proposals, I understand that before I was born there was an entertainment tax, and though it was difficult to administer and though the character of public entertainment has changed, I suggest that as far as taxation is concerned entertainment must be considered more seriously.  A sum of £45 for a bar extension licence is totally inadequate. Publicans do not receive State <Col N="385" /> grants in respect of their premises.  They do not provide any service other than pints in comfortable surroundings at reasonable hours.  They do not contribute to accidents on the roads, whereas people engaged in bar extensions in discos and night clubs make far greater profits and most accidents on the roads are caused by people who have been drinking throughout extensions until 1.30 a.m.  For that reason, a new form of entertainment tax should be considered and bar extension fees should be increased.</P>
    <P>Some months ago at a parliamentary party meeting I suggested that there should be methods of tax which had been totally untapped.  One was the question of holiday tax on which there has since been action but which I also feel is inadequate. I feel that 10 per cent of a package holiday to any part of the world is reasonable in so far as there are some people who cannot even afford to get to various parts of this country, let alone to various parts of the world.  This is a luxury and should be taxed heavily.</P>
    <P>Another area in which taxation would be unpopular, but which is worth a mention, is that relating to the whole question of bingo.  In my constituency and every other constituency, on five or six nights a week there are buses travelling hither and thither packed with ladies and gentlemen, young people, going to play bingo. I have not been to bingo too often myself, but they are not happy to operate just one card but operate three cards at a time.  While I would not like to impose any penal taxation on women enjoying themselves in their spare time after their hard day's work in the house or out at work, I feel that a small tax initially, an admission tax or whatever, should be imposed because the limits of £500 on snowballs are no longer relevant; we are now into big money; it is no longer a charitable small-time operation for philanthropic purposes.  Bingo is big business. It is a luxury, a hobby, an entertainment, and should be taxed.  This is one area which would not take food out of people's mouths or clothes or footwear off people but would provide revenue to the State.</P>
    <P>In summary, as I outlined earlier, there <Col N="386" /> have been many economical and political changes over the last number of months. We must remember that, whoever is in Government, we have the largest growing population in the EEC, 2 per cent in the recent census.  We have 68,000 school leavers joining the job market every year. The Government have a statutory obligation to provide health services, protection services such as the Garda and the Defence Forces, and administrative services. They are also obliged to provide a framework for educational services, to provide young couples with roofs over their heads and to provide jobs.  Politicians and our system of administration are, at times, too parochial and too political. Now is the time for a national resurgence plan or another national economic plan with a combination of many Departments, all based on indigenous industries in the areas of agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism, with an input in regard to energy, production and market research.  I am informed by people in private industry that while CTT are doing a good job there are untapped markets for our products and that the hard-nosed businessman who makes it his business to travel all over the world to sell his products does find markets for them.  This should be part of our national economic plan.  The public service badly needs to be overhauled.  We have 166 TDs who are all involved in untying the knots of red tape created by the civil servants. While one accepts that there is always a need for fair and proper administration, it seems that it has become completely top heavy when we are dealing with 300,000 civil servants.</P>
    <P>I would also agree with previous Ministers and with the present Minister that it is not possible &mdash; and this is shown up particularly in the case of Britain &mdash; to get all the economic factors right at one time.  One cannot reduce unemployment, inflation and interest rates at one time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The emphasis should be first on getting the economic background <Col N="387" /> right by reducing interest rates and inflation rates, by cutting the budget deficit, by cutting our dependence on foreign borrowing so that we will have the moneys in future to prepare for this type of economic plan.  Then we would have a firm base on which to plan our economy so that it will grow.</P>
      <P>Finally, especially in view of the events since the election when certain Members of this House have been purchased with a high price and when certain other pressure groups have been given in to regularly, I am very much afraid that the only party to provide the real, courageous, tenacious type of Government, regardless of the whims of the people, are Fine Gael.  In the future it will be our Government that will rectify the situation by taking the unpopular decisions that have to be faced.</P>

      <P>The debate to date has been wide-ranging.  At this stage it is difficult to find something new and original and significant to say.  At a time when we have serious economic and social problems it must be the duty of every Member of this House to be constructive, just as Deputy Yates has been, and not engage in political point-scoring.</P>
      <P>Widespread unemployment and the continual, almost daily, increases in living costs are affecting a large section of our people.  Therefore it behoves the Dáil to show a deep concern and an intense desire to come to grips with the various social and economic problems which affect our people at this stage.  Otherwise we do a serious disservice to the democratic process and add to the sense of disillusionment which an increasing number of people appear to have in relation to the deliberations in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach said this morning that our country, in its people and in its resources, had greater potential for growth than any other country in the EEC.  I would agree completely with that optimistic statement.  But before such <Col N="388" /> potential growth can become a reality we need a great deal of investment and we need work for our people so that Irish goods can be produced in great quantity and sold at a competitive price on the world market.  It is a function of Government to fashion and guide the economy so that the potential may be achieved.  I see the budget as one of the instruments in the process of developing the economy towards that ultimate potential.</P>
    <P>The greatest single challenge facing us as a nation is that of unemployment.  I agree with the Minister that many parents are worried about employment prospects for their children.  People are ready to make sacrifices, or at least they can be motivated to make sacrifices so that jobs may be created for our expanding population of well-educated and ambitious young people.  I am in total agreement with the Minister that we must strive continuously to provide job opportunities for all our young people who want to work in their country.  I would go further and say that persons or organisations, be they unions or employers, pursuing policies that hinder job creation or that are not conducive to job creation should be condemned as being anti-national and lacking in real patriotism, something which we greatly need at present.</P>
    <P>We cannot isolate ourselves from the past but no social phenomenon here or throughout the EEC has hit as hard as the widespread unemployment we face. It is destroying individuals and hindering the development of family life.  Our first responsibility must be to combat unemployment and strive for a society in which everyone who can work, be they young or not so young, male or female, has an opportunity of so doing.  If this budget is a landmark on the road to creating such a society we will all rejoice irrespective of what political pigeon hole we place ourselves in.  I am not at all convinced that this budget does enough to keep people in employment or to create new employment.</P>
    <P>Job creation is a very costly business. In the course of the last 15 or 16 years successive Governments allocated substantial sums to the IDA for the creation of jobs in the manufacturing sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> Associated with IDA developments were large investments by local authorities in the provision of services such as roads, water, drainage and so on to such centres of employment.  It is discouraging to note that despite such investment employment figures are decreasing.  This is occuring at a time when public funds are curtailed. There must in future be a closer partnership between public and private sector investment if sufficient funds are to be made available for the creation of jobs on a scale never before achieved.  In this regard, there is much wealth which is not used productively.  In the circumstances of today it would be in the national interest to ensure such wealth is put to better use.</P>
    <P>There are strong arguments against the taxing of wealth and capital.  In the context of a free market economy such as we have, it is the accumulation of wealth which creates industries and commercial enterprises which generate jobs, income and more wealth.  If capital taxation eroded the nation's capital base without providing some alternative build-up of capital, such taxation would be counterproductive. However, a tax on non-productive accumulations of wealth would free capital for productive use rather than reduce the nation's store of wealth-creating assets.  Investment is essential if a vigorous programme of job creation is to be put underway.  There must be investment not only by the State and from overseas but by those Irish people whose wealth at present is not producing more wealth in the interests of the unemployed. I hope the confidence which the Minister for Finance expressed in his budget statement regarding employment prospects for this year is well founded and that his strategy will result in real jobs and not just jobs sanctioned on paper.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the budget I do not agree with is the support it gives for selective local government.  I refer to the £20 million being allocated to Dublin Corporation to enable them to maintain their level of services and employment in the present year.  I accept that Dublin has major problems in the sphere of urban decay and blight and that these are social <Col N="390" /> problems, but the £20 million referred to in the budget does nothing for inner city development.  It is essentially a rate subvention to the corporation which will increase its rate income by 45 per cent over last year's figure while Cork and other rating authorities must endeavour to survive on an increase of 15 per cent. All local authorities have experienced financial difficulties over the last few years but the problems of urban centres have been particularly severe.  In this regard, I am hopeful that the appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for urban affairs will result in a new awareness of the financial needs of all major urban centres.  Their problems have arisen from the fact that inflation from 1979 to 1981 exceeded 60 per cent while the increase in rates permitted, including the allowance for buoyancy, amounted in the same period to just over 47 per cent.  This has resulted in a financial crisis for local authorities.  I can understand the Minister's willingness to come to the aid of Dublin Corporation in their financial straits but Exchequer funds should be distributed in an equitable manner so that <i>pro rata</i> assistance would be available to all units of local government which are carrying progressively increasing deficits on their current accounts.</P>
    <P>Let us not lose sight of the fact that the once-off grant to meet the immediate needs of Dublin Corporation is not the solution to the endemic financial crisis which has descended on local government. It is easy to stand here and criticise but we must face the fact that the system of financing local authorities, pursued by the present and previous Governments which was introduced under the 1978 Act, has not been a success.  An answer must be found.  It may be unpopular but it lies in an independent, permanent and progressive source of revenue for local authorities.  Some Government, sooner rather than later, must face the problem of financing local authority units and restoring to them not only financial autonomy but also responsibility for their own actions.</P>
    <P>The budget contains £1 million to install facilities in sub-standard corporation <Col N="391" /> houses in Dublin.  In Cork there are well over 1,000 sub-standard houses and we would dearly love to bring them up to a standard in keeping with the other corporation houses.  We would need help from the Exchequer to do so.</P>
    <P>There is reference to decentralisation in the budget and the Taoiseach referred to it this morning.  I hope this concept will be pursued vigorously in the interests of balanced development across the country. There should be a national effort to decentralise the administrative functions of government and have every-day matters which affect the lives of people dealt with at local level.  For example, is it really necessary or desirable that all applications for house loan approvals, passports and so on should have to be made in Dublin?  Anyone in the House who is a member of a local authority could provide a list of services which are operated in Dublin but which could be provided at regional level with efficiency and greater satisfaction to the people. We have an under regard for centralism. It is something we inherited from the British and we should look at it again.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned this morning that he would take steps to ensure that the policy of decentralisation would get underway.  I wish to take this opportunity to inform him and the Minister that we have in Cork an ideal city centre location for office block development.  Furthermore, Cork has the environment which a decision-making sector needs, with its good communications, third level institutions of education and it is a centre of commerce.  Indeed, one major development on Merchant's Quay is being held up at the moment and if we could get a commitment that perhaps at some stage in the future a Department of State or semi-State body would move in that direction, we might see it take off very soon with resulting jobs for workers in the construction industry and eventually the transfer to Cork of a semi-State body.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his budget statement mentioned that extra taxation will be collected as equitably as possible with the greater burden imposed on those best able to pay.  I am not at all worried about <Col N="392" /> those in our society who are financially well off.  They are well able to look after themselves, as is evident from the fact that wealth is distributed so unevenly amongst our people.  However, I am worried about the imposition of this budget on the resources of middle-class people who are the backbone of this nation. Invariably they house themselves, carrying the burden of a large monthly mortgage repayment.  They pay their VHI and they qualify for few &mdash; if any &mdash; of the State handouts.  As a result of the changes in the income tax bands many middle-class people will find themselves paying more in direct taxation at the end of the day and the State will collect more from them in taxation than they would have paid if the much condemned VAT on clothing had been accepted.  This will result primarily from the reduction in the range of the 35p tax band and the resultant substantial increase in the number of people who will find themselves in the 45p tax band.  The middle classes are the new poor, and the Minister for Finance should recognise their courage, initiative and enterprise and help them in every possible way.  This budget does little for that section of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Waterford) Mr. Gallagher (Waterford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> As a Workers' Party Deputy representing the Waterford constituency I did not come into Dáil Éireann on election expecting a socialist budget from Deputy MacSharry, Minister for Finance, any more than I or my Party anticipated such a Budget from Deputy Bruton on 27 January last.  I would like to make clear at the outset the sort of budget we would consider acceptable to the vast mass of the working people of this country: it is a very far cry from what we have seen from both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and Labour Coalition.  Both budgets failed to face up to the constantly reiterated need for sweeping tax reform.  Both budgets shifted the tax base towards indirect taxation, a form of taxation that my party have opposed consistently and will oppose in the future.  Neither budget contained proposals to redress the scandalous neglect of capital and property taxation as a potential source of tax revenue. <Col N="393" /> Above all, neither budget offered any hope that the relentless rise in unemployment would be reversed in the foreseeable future.  Our stance in relation to these two budgets has been to salvage what we could for the working class, given that the two major conservative groupings in Dáil Éireann have resolved to place the burden of the economic crisis which undoubtedly we face at present on those who can least afford to pay.  Our stance has been to soften the blows struck against the living standards of the workers and the weaker sections of society in truly savage and unjust budgets that have been placed before the Dáil this year.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Sherlock, voted against the Coalition budget last January and in doing so made sure that the voices of PAYE taxpayers, PRSI payers and the economically weak were heard in this Chamber.  The subsequent budget introduced by Fianna Fáil, however, involved some minor steps towards alleviating the burden on ordinary working-class incomes.  Examples are the dropping of the reactionary proposals to raise the prices of some of the most staple food items such as butter and milk, the proposed 20 per cent tax on PRSI benefits of the recently unemployed and the 18 per cent VAT rate on clothes and shoes. Objectively speaking, that budget made a slight improvement in the prospects facing workers in the weaker sections in this year of recession, but we in our party are under no illusion whatsoever that it was a workers' budget, far from it.  Our subsequent stance in pressing for a reduction in the unjust Coalition-imposed PRSI levy on the PAYE taxpayers is indicative of our intention to go on fighting for a fair sharing of the burden imposed on the country at large by the present economic crisis.  We have pressed on with that fight in recent weeks and we will go on pressing for fairness in budgetary matters in the weeks and months to come, if this Government stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not surprise me to see the various attempts that have been made in recent weeks and months to distort and misrepresent the Workers' Party's stance on the budget.  Indeed, certain Labour <Col N="394" /> Party Deputies have attempted to peddle the ridiculous idea that my party were somehow responsible for the raising of PRSI levies, a ridiculous proposition when one considers that the Labour Party were one of the parties responsible for introducing this measure in the first instance.  Other spokespersons from the Coalition parties have attempted to portray our budgetary stance as being opportunist without any regard for the serious underlying problems which afflict the economy, such as the balance of payments deficit and the intolerable level of foreign debt which has been amassed in the past eight years.  Since the 1974 budget, introduced by the Coalition Government, successive administrations have attempted to maintain the illusion of prosperity under capitalism by more and more borrowing to pay for current account expenditure.  Both the Fianna Fáil and Coalition Governments have refused steadfastly and continued to refuse even to contemplate the policies necessary to lay the foundations for real prosperity through a thorough restructuring of the economy, to raise production to the levels necessary to maintain and improve our standards of living and to provide for the real job creation, housing and infrastructural needs of our rapidly growing labour force.</P>
    <P>In 1977 my party published proposals which showed in a practical and concrete way how the necessary levels of job creation could be achieved and how our output and living standards could be raised at the same time.  This was to be done through a socialist approach of planned expansion of State enterprises, of companies such as Bord na Móna, the ESB, Irish Shipping, Aer Lingus and the Sugar Company, as the engine of growth in the economy.  In out view, borrowing should have been contemplated to finance productive investment, indeed real investment, which would have produced a return to alleviate the burden on taxpayers.  Around 1974 the Fianna Fáil Party published their proposals.  To coin a phrase, &ldquo;planning&rdquo; was the &ldquo;in&rdquo; word in 1974.  It was in fashion.  However, these proposals differed fundamentally, completely and utterly from ours.  They relied <Col N="395" /> instead on the private sector as the engine of growth, despite the massive weight of evidence existing even at that time through numerous official reports testifying to the inefficiency of Irish gombeen private enterprise.</P>
    <P>This reliance essentially and the allocation of yet more public funds to this sickly sector of our society laid the basis for the enormous growth of foreign indebtedness that followed.  Incidentally, Fianna Fáil were only continuing a policy in regard to foreign borrowing which was started by the National Coalition in 1974. However, the unshakeable faith of the conservative parties in private enterprise as the engine of growth was completely misplaced.  Despite the so-called investment level and the size of Japan, the inefficient, ramshackle, private enterprise economy proved that it could not meet the challenge.  The engine in effect and in reality seized up.  As a result we are left with an economic crisis approaching the proportions of that of the fifties with unemployment rising towards 150,000, with economic stagnation and a huge foreign debt.</P>
    <P>Despite all this and despite the recent evidence from the Telesis report &mdash; which incidentally was also released by our party and suppressed by Fianna Fáil and this provided further testimony to the failure of the private enterprise economy &mdash; it seems that the Fianna Fáil Government have learned none of the lessons of the past eight years.  Indeed, within days of his appointment as Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy Reynolds was professing his faith in the ability of small industry entrepreneurs, aided and cossetted no doubt by more handouts from State agencies, to meet the daunting economic challenge that faces us now.</P>
    <P>For my party, full employment is and will continue to be the number one economic priority.  Well-paid, secure jobs can only be created for all our people by an economic plan that puts the needs of society before the greed of private enterprise, it is regrettable that the Taoiseach who before his election professed his first priority to be job creation did an about-turn within hours of his election by stating <Col N="396" /> that his first priority was the North.  Be that as it may, my party will submit their proposals for employment creation and real economic development to the Government for inclusion in their forthcoming economic plan, but in doing this we will be under no illusions.  From my experience during the past few days while the Dáil has been meeting, I have no doubt about the capitalist nature of this forthcoming plan, just as our party had no doubts about the capitalist nature of the budget last March.  My party entertain no starry-eyed hopes that the Fianna Fáil plan will provide the answer to the chronic balance of payments and debt difficulties in which we now find ourselves. These problems will only be solved in a manner acceptable to the working people through the alternative approach to planning that my party espouse.  The only other answer is the <i>non sequitur</i> of cutting the living standards of the old, the poor and the weak proposed by the Labour and Fine Gael Parties.</P>
    <P>Our budgetary position springs from our perception of the real solution that must be found to the economic crisis.  It is on the basis of this alternative that we have pledged ourselves to fight the monstrous attempts of the conservative parties in this Chamber to solve the economic crisis by making the working class pay through lower living standards and continually rising unemployment.  That was the message of our manifesto which we placed before the people in the recent general election, and the result has proved that our perception of the situation as it exists has not been misconstrued or misplaced.</P>
    <P>We accepted the aim of cutting the budget deficit, as did the other parties. But, contrary to the other parties, we showed with the aid of detailed costings from the Department of Finance, how this could be done in a fair and just way by the last resort to capital, property and wealth taxes totalling £230 million.  It is interesting to note that these detailed alternative budget proposals provoked no response whatever from any other party either during the general election or subsequently.  The deafening silence <Col N="397" /> of Deputies on these proposals would appear to indicate a unanimity across the floor of this House that the interests of land, capital and property are and must continue to remain sacrosanct within Irish society.  My party would welcome comments on these proposals during this debate, particularly from those Deputies who describe themselves as socialists.  In our budgetary stance during the coming months we fully intend to fight for the principles put forward in our election programme.</P>
    <P>We recognise that the Fianna Fáil budget, while softening slightly the blow against working-class living standards, has incorporated a temporary device of bringing forward money from 1983 in the form of accelerated corporation tax and VAT on imports at the point of entry, money that will have to be found again through new taxation measures in the 1983 budget.  We do not accept Fine Gael's attempts to convey the impression that these sums will not be raised in 1982. We fully realise, however, that Fianna Fáil's resort to this expedient of bringing forward money will mean that taxpayers will be left with a bill of the order of £170 million in the next budget.  The Workers' Party are serving due notice that we will be fighting to ensure that this money will not be taken from the pockets of workers and the economically weak.</P>
    <P>We will continue to campaign for the implementation of our budgetary proposals to ensure that those who can afford to pay will do so.  I am sceptical that this campaign will receive the support of Deputies but my party are confident that it will receive the support of workers outside this House and that, to us, is all important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of addressing the House during this important debate.  I congratulate the Minister for Finance on his appointment and wish him well in the extremely difficult task of administering the nation's finances.  I have no doubt that he brings to his new Department the same high degree of enthusiasm and capacity for hard work which has been the hallmark of his political career to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="398" /> The budget and its associated debate unquestionably represent one of the most important functions of this House, the effects of which have far-reaching consequences for our people and the future development of the nation.  In the preparation of the budget statement the Minister should endeavour to strike a reasonable balance between the short-term domestic needs of our people and the long-term capital proposals on which our future economic development depends. The Government of the day, and particularly the Minister for Finance who has the responsibility in this area, should have the capacity to get their proposals accepted in the House.  This is the primary function of Government and the fact that we are debating today a second budget in the course of a few months must create an awareness, not only in the House but outside as well, of the need to have a stable and secure Government capable of administering the nation's affairs and having their proposals for dealing with finances accepted.</P>
    <P>The fall of the previous Government on this very issue was the last fatal move of an administration which for seven months killed the spirit, the hope and the capacity of our people to recover from the present economic recession.  Their budget was unnecessarily defeated because the authors did not show even slight regard for the human needs and feelings of the people.  It was a budget which put book-keeping before people and, more serious still, it undermined public confidence, especially when the then Taoiseach saw fit after his defeat to barter some of its major proposals for political gain during the election campaign. I do not propose to dwell any further on the actions of that Government. That is now political history.</P>
    <P>In this his first budget the Minister for Finance has displayed considerable sensitivity to the short-term needs, particularly of the more deserving sections, while at the same time taking positive steps to deal with the serious and pressing needs of our economy.  He has recognised the needs of those who are genuinely dependent on State support &mdash; the old, the widows and the disabled.  He has <Col N="399" /> made provision for those who are genuinely unemployed, the real victims of this recession.  I wish he and the Government could do more to eliminate some of the abuses of those services.  I say to the people that Fianna Fáil recognise their needs and will legislate to maintain their living standards in so far as our resources allow us to do so.  We know there are two extremes in our society, the very wealthy and the extremely poor.  I am convinced that our actions in Government during the next four or five years in dealing with those pressing social problems will prove our capacity to create a just society.</P>
    <P>Many people fail to recognise that there is a new poor in this country.  I am referring to what is called the middle income group.  They carry the maximum taxation burdens but they receive little in return by way of State services.  I welcome the Government's decision to restructure the entire taxation system when the report from the Commission on Taxation becomes available in the near future.  I know that people outside this House will welcome whatever action may be taken by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Financial Statement we are discussing today identifies the urgent problems facing the economy and the efforts necessary to resolve them in the short-term. There can be no doubt that the major problem is unemployment.  This calls for the united effort of all Members of this House and it also demands the understanding and co-operation of our people in accepting what Government action may be necessary to deal with this very serious problem.</P>
    <P>While there is a genuine desire and commitment in this House to deal with the problem, I regret to say there is no great evidence on the part of the organised community to accept the disciplinary measures necessary for the success of the programme.  As legislators we have the duty to administer firmly the affairs of the nation, to ensure that through long-term planning our economy is developed and that in the process our great human resource, the men and women, the boys and girls of this country, are given the opportunity of contributing in that work <Col N="400" /> through gainful and productive employment.</P>
    <P>As politicians we have not, and are not, displaying sufficient courage in this area.  I believe we have failed so far to get the public to accept and recognise the basic simple economic fact that the only real way forward is through hard work, developing to the maximum our national resources and developing our industrial base through increased output.  Anyone who thinks otherwise is living in a fool's paradise.  We are the people who have created this artificial paradise and I do not blame those who seek refuge in it when we have failed to provide an alternative. We speak about abuses of the system but we have failed to take positive steps to eliminate those abuses.</P>
    <P>Recently I listened on the radio to a report of a seminar entitled &ldquo;The Alternative to Employment&rdquo;.  It is frightening to ponder on the title.  The fact that people are compelled to think along those lines is an indication of the seriousness and the extent of the problem we have at the moment.  It is true that Governments in the future will have to plan for healthy recreational opportunities for our people.  In this budget the Government have recognised the problem and have made provision for it.  It is also true that in a period of high unemployment we should accelerate this programme particularly for young people, but in my book that can never be a substitute for employment.</P>
    <P>The appointment by the Taoiseach of the Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, to this area of responsibility is to be welcomed.  She is following in the footsteps of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who made a tremendous contribution to the development of recreational facilities for young people. I do not know if it is in order to acknowledge the contribution of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle at this time but I should like to put on record our congratulations and thanks to him.  I am sure I am expressing the views of many thousands of people.  Properly developed, the scheme would be of immense benefit to young people from the point of view of health.  It should be viewed in the context <Col N="401" /> of the provision in the budget for the enforcement of law and order.  The entire question of law and order must be top priority for any Government and for any Minister for Justice.  The likely continuation for some time of high unemployment makes it all the more imperative for the Minister for Justice and his Department to take whatever steps are necessary to safeguard the interests and the property of our people.  I am very happy to acknowledge the contribution which the Minister, Deputy Doherty, is making in this area.  Since he came to office a short time ago he has taken the initiative in coping with this pressing problem.</P>
    <P>When it comes to discussing the budget proposals, the subject of taxation is given high priority.  There can be no doubt that there is a strong public demand for the reorganisation of the taxation code. The increasing burden on those who are working, the disincentive to work which is inherent in our welfare code, and the growing imbalance between those in productive and service employment calls for immediate and urgent action.  I urge the Minister to ensure that there is no avoidable delay in bringing forward those proposals to ensure that within the shortest time a fair and equitable taxation system is in operation, and is seen to be in operation.</P>
    <P>I believe the majority of taxpayers would condone even the present high level of taxation if they were satisfied that the State's effort in spending their money was getting a return by reducing unemployment or assisting in the economic development of the State.  While we all welcome the Minister's intention in this area, and I am satisfied he will leave no stone unturned to ensure the system is brought into operation at the earliest opportunity, I must say that he is embarking on an extremely difficult course because this is an area in which we have not seen very much progress to date.  I am satisfied and confident that the new Minister will introduce whatever legislation is necessary to tackle this very urgent problem.</P>
    <P>There is no acceptable or justifiable reason for allowing a continuation of a <Col N="402" /> situation in which it is more financially rewarding to be idle than to work in a productive job.  I have no hesitation in saying that the people who benefit from such an arrangement would prefer to be given the opportunity to work because they realise that in the long-term they and the taxpayers will have to meet the cost of this operation.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that we should concentrate our efforts on the creation of productive employment.  That leads me to our failure to develop in an organised way our greatest national asset, the land. Its potential both for the purpose of retaining the maximum number of people and farming families on the land and, of equal importance, its potential to create productive jobs in off-farm employment, in the processing industry, have not been fully exploited.  This area has been neglected over the years.  While I do not wish to apportion blame, I can never understand why we failed to develop our agricultural processing industry.</P>
    <P>We have the natural resource &mdash; land &mdash; and the expertise and knowledge to produce the goods.  Yet, for some strange reasons when we get to the factory floor we seem to be incapable of making a success of that end of the farming operation. This area deserves attention and close scrutiny from people at Government and semi-State levels to ensure that in the years immediately ahead it will be successfully tackled.</P>
    <P>In a previous contribution I said that as far as agriculture was concerned we should get back to the drawing board and make the agricultural industry the base from which all other developments would evolve, and I hope our proposed plan for future economic development will recognise this important economic fact.  I was disappointed that the previous Minister for Agriculture instead of providing incentives for the industry at a very critical stage of its development, reduced the level of grant assistance for land development and other essential services.  I am pleased this Minister has restored that situation and restored the level of grants but I ask him to ensure that the costings of those schemes will be updated and brought into line with current costs <Col N="403" /> because some of them are almost three years out of date.  This need for an updating of the costings has resulted in almost ceasing land reclamation and land development and has undoubtedly contributed further to unemployment as far as the agricultural service industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>I can quote a glaring example of the unemployment which can result from a recession in the agricultural industry.  In my constituency there is an industry which produces clay-ware pipes for drainage purposes, in the Swan area, run by the famous Fleming family.  Because of the cut-back in agricultural grants and the reduction in economic activity and reclamation works in that area, that factory had to close its doors for a considerable period over the past few months. That is why I make the point that agricultural development and progress in the agricultural industry should be of general interest to people outside farming because in a small economy such as ours we are interdependent and if there is a serious recession in the agricultural industry that reflects throughout the economy in job losses.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to note in the budget statement that the Minister reconfirmed the Government's proposals to decentralise Government Departments. While, regrettably, there is no immediate proposal to locate any Government Department in my county, Laois, I would ask that the situation in Laois be recognised by the Minister and the Government. It will come as a surprise to many people in this House to learn that in less than one hour's driving time from where we are sitting in the county of Laois you would drive through one of our most deprived counties.  That is not immediately obvious to the ordinary commuter driving through the county, but there are now sufficient facts and figures available to the Government and Government Departments to indicate that we have one of the lowest <i>per capita</i> incomes in the entire country.  Therefore, there is a need for Government action to redress that situation.  I propose to raise this matter <Col N="404" /> again under a different heading in the not too distant future, I hope.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that my close friend and colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Cowen, is present for this debate.  To the extent that he has responsibility for the disadvantaged areas and the designation of such areas, I do not have to tell him the position because I know that already he is fully aware of the situation in the Laois-Offaly constituency.  He recognises the extent of the problem in our constituency. I also recognise the difficulty of his task in ensuring that our area is designated for the higher rate of grant.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made to increase the productive base of the agricultural industry in our constituency and to maintain, and if possible improve, the incomes of the farmers in those disadvantaged areas.  We have all watched with dismay the disappearance of so many small family holdings.  This contributed in no small way to the serious imbalance between the rural and the urban communities. This imbalance has arisen because as legislators we have allowed it to happen.  It has created a demand for infrastructural development in the organised areas which we are not now capable of meeting.  We cannot redress that situation in the short-term.  The Minister has a strong and positive committment to rural development.  I urge him to ensure that Government action and Government policy in the future will arrest the decline in the rural population and redress the imbalance between the urban and the rural areas.</P>
    <P>For the past few minutes I have endeavoured to cover the areas of the Minister's statement which are relevant to the constituency I represent and to the people of Ireland.  I hope my contribution has helped to highlight some of the urgent and pressing problems which face us at present.  I hope my comments on public acceptance of Government legislation, perhaps unpleasant legislation, will be taken by the people as being in their best interest in the long-term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to preface my remarks on the Financial <Col N="405" /> Statement made by the Minister at the end of March by showing how we have arrived at the state of play in which we have had four budgets before the House in just over 12 months.  We had the budget at the beginning of 1981 which was to set the pattern for the year.  It was presented in the light of the 1981 June election and it had to be a popular type of budget, which it probably was.  It did not achieve anything as it catered for a nine month economic year.  When the previous Government took office last June they realised that our finances were due to run out towards the end of September or October and that the necessary finances would not be available to enable the various public services to be continued, and they had to bring in the July budget.</P>
      <P>At the time they recognised that it was absolutely necessary, and the people realised that what the Fianna Fáil administration had been doing since 1977, and in particular in their last 18 months in office, represented total economic mismanagement. The previous Government got the message across to a fair extent about the necessity for getting our financial affairs in order and we had the January budget.  Unfortunately for the country, it did not go through this House and we had a change of Government in late February.  We now have a fourth budget before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the budget before the House we have to make some comparisons with the January budget.  Various economic decisions were taken in that budget to which the present Minister has adhered.  There are some aspects of this budget which can be welcomed or recognised as making good economic sense which were in the previous budget.  There are also certain elements in this budget which were not in the previous budget and were put in to gain a more popular image for the budget.  There are certain things in the budget which lead one to wonder what the Government's intentions are in relation to sorting out the various problems which the country faces, namely, getting our finances into order, getting down our unemployment figures which unfortunately have <Col N="406" /> increased to a very great extent, providing more jobs for the various unemployed groups and ensuring that the economy is stable.  I hope to deal with several aspects of the budget statement.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that the Government were in office from 1977 to the middle of 1981.  With a 20 seat majority they failed to make the basic sensible economic decisions which should have been taken at various stages during that period, and in particular in the 18 month period prior to the June election of last year.  They knew there were problems. Many Deputies, particularly some of their back-benchers, recognised the fact that they could not continue in that way. But with elections forthcoming, bearing in mind that there was a Cabinet comprised of &mdash; it seemed at times &mdash; either incompetent or irresponsible individuals in relation to how public money was being spent, basic economic decisions were not taken.  They proceeded with a sort of &ldquo;spend and be damned&rdquo; image giving the impression there was plenty of money outside the country that had only to be tapped from time to time to keep various services going.  This is unfortunate because it puts off the day when we can avail of the expected upturn in economic growth.  This means also that we shall not be in the position we would have been in had those basic economic decisions been taken by the present Fianna Fáil Government or by them when in office prior to the June election last year.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the previous Government fell because to a large extent they had got across the message of the very serious economic problems confronting us.  There is no point in our fooling ourselves.  At times previous Government spokesmen were accused of being prophets of gloom and doom.  I put it to the House that they were telling the truth, merely informing the public of that basic fact, warning of the need for curtailment of public spending and that borrowing had got out of hand.  That is a simple statement of fact backed by most independent economists &mdash; that we must stop the rot and change our general direction. It is unfortunate that shortly after we had begun to get this message across, <Col N="407" /> getting the public to accept that a certain restraint was necessary for a short time &mdash; and it must be remembered that these problems developed over several years, some influenced from outside the country and for which neither the present nor previous Government are responsible &mdash; we were no longer in office.  But over the period to which I am referring certain matters were within the hands of the then Fianna Fáil Government and will be again during their present term of office if they will but grapple with them.  It is important that this be known.  It is important also that the manner in which they conduct Government business be changed.  Most people recognise the need for action, for basic economic decisions to be taken by the Government.  They look to this Government for leadership and expect them to take the basic economic decisions which hopefully will pull us back from the dangerous slippery slopes.</P>
    <P>To deal with the more specific points of the budget, I shall refer firstly to the social welfare payments included in the January budget and which this Government are implementing, something I very much welcome.  I suppose one could contend that the various social welfare payments were adequate because I do not believe in dwelling on whether this or the previous Government were over-generous in giving allowances to the various dependent groups.  A lot of such beneficiaries do not have the backing of lobbying groups.  They do not have people who can go on marches or who have much political muscle.  Many of them must depend on whatever it is we provide for them in this house.  Therefore they must depend entirely on what we decide is adequate from time to time in relation to inflation and hope that from time to time we shall be able to give them a double payment.  It is to be welcomed that the Minister has implemented what was proposed in the January budget.  I hope also that he will give a specific commitment in regard to what he said in relation to the setting up of a committee or a working party to examine the plight of people living alone.  In this day and <Col N="408" /> age we are subjected to various pressure groups, some of the more popular ones, perhaps to the exclusion of the aged and others dependent on various allowances, or other people who form a small minority, who may not have any backing.  We must examine their cause and provide them with as much as possible.</P>
    <P>In regard to the general taxation proposals of the Minister I hope that the Commission on Taxation in reporting will take several factors into account in arriving at a more equitable tax base.  It is generally recognised at present that the tax base is too narrow, that there are too few people in the net.  Some people are paying more than they should be, there are certainly many people paying less than they should be, with probably some paying very little at all.  Members on all sides of the house will welcome the commission's findings and will support the Minister in his bid to extend the tax base. In this respect obviously he must examine the various aspects of our taxation system. He must examine tax avoidance and evasion.  He must also examine what I believe is perhaps the kernel of the problem at present, the position of the PAYE worker in relation to his take-home pay. It must be remembered that whatever may be one's gross pay it is the take-home pay that matters, how far one can make that go and how far one can avail of benefits or tax incentives in other areas.</P>
    <P>I might mention pension schemes in this connection and the need to increase incentives for people subscribing to pension schemes.  They should be afforded every tax incentive possible.  For example, if we are considering the provision of more jobs, if we are thinking in terms of an earlier retirement age, we must then ensure that people would have their nest egg or golden handshake on which to fall back.  There is no point in asking people to retire in their early sixties, giving them a certain amount and then taxing it to the hilt.  That is not good enough for somebody who has worked 35 or 40 years, telling him that he is now being retired but yet will be subjected to very severe taxation.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to pay particular <Col N="409" /> attention also to taxation on savings. As far as I am aware the annual interest limit at present of £70 for a single person and £140 for a married couple has obtained for a long time.  This limit should be increased to encourage savings and make that exercise worthwhile in these days of rampant inflation.  The various tax-free saving schemes should be examined and their scope and benefits widened where possible.</P>
    <P>Those are a couple of proposals I hope the Minister will consider in his overall examination of the taxation system.  In regard to the jobs proposals of the budget I must say I found them singularly lacking in any commitment to providing employment particularly for our young people. In 1982 we have reached the stage where many of the old and traditional employments are very limited as regards vacancies. Anybody here who has had representations from constituents or friends seeking assistance in getting a son or daughter into employment will realise that competition is now extremely keen for any position, however menial and no matter how many vacancies there are. There are literally thousands applying for tens or at most hundreds of jobs. Whoever recommends, there are only so many positions in the case of these more traditional jobs.</P>
    <P>There is also a disturbing aspect of employment regarding people coming through the universities.  They come out with a degree but can find no job.  In some professions or trades there may be emigration possibilities, but unfortunately other countries face somewhat similar problems to ours and their doors are closed.  Avenues which were available some time ago are also closed and we must now look towards other trades and professions, and perhaps to jobs less popular up to this, in trying to provide so many people with work.</P>
    <P>We must also look at our educational system.  I hope the necessary money will be available to provide incentives, organisation, guidance and instruction.  I hope the necessary money will be provided to change some of the courses we have.  A person of 15 or 16 who may have struggled through some pass subjects in the <Col N="410" /> intermediate may be at a time when he or she should change over to a different course, a more useful course, perhaps a work experience course or training programme even on a part-time basis so that when that pupil comes out at 18 he or she will not have some sort of pass leaving certificate which will not be worth the paper it is written on or get them anywhere. However, in order that they may have done a couple of years exploring the possibilities of industrial, technical or computer type of job, it may be advisable to switch them on to getting some work at 15 or 16 rather than when they leave school at 17 or 18 as at present.  I urge the Minister for Education to have a radical re-think in regard to providing the many people leaving school now with jobs.  We must obviously provide jobs for such people and I trust the necessary money will be found.</P>
    <P>As regards the proposals for Dublin's inner-city, while the apparent millions are to be welcomed, perhaps helped along by Deputy Gregory &mdash; so far a fairly consistent supporter of the present Government &mdash; I would not begrudge the inner city any of this money for housing or house reconstruction or for derelict sites.  What I would question as regards spending public money is the equity of spending over the country in general.  It should not just be millions for Deputy Gregory in Dublin or for Deputy Blaney in Donegal.  In my constituency of Dún Laoghaire many serious problems have arisen.  There are difficulties regarding the provision of adequate housing for the many people still on the housing list, but we also have the added difficulty of a local authority keeping going on the block grant from central funds.  Certainly, the abolition of rates, which were done away with by Fianna Fáil with a stroke of a pen in 1977, was welcome; but I do not know if it was fully thought out at that time what the implications would be for local authorities, where they would get the extra millions for this and that when it is not in their power to provide this money themselves.</P>
    <P>This is a problem to which the Government and all Members of different parties in the House will have to give special <Col N="411" /> attention.  We now have a situation in Dún Laoghaire where, according to present estimates, Blackrock and Dún Laoghaire baths may not open.  This is not very satisfactory because the alternative to keeping them open may be to lay off so many men who have worked for years in Dún Laoghaire Corporation. That is certainly not acceptable to me.  I hope the relevant Minister and the Minister for Finance will see their way towards allocating sufficient funds to enable not just survival services but absolutely necessary services to carry on.  In the period since 1977 we have cut back on services saying: &ldquo;This year we will only clean the town so many times a week and in the following year we will cut out another bin collection.  We will cut out the opening of a swimming pool on certain days or cut out housing maintenance.&rdquo; To me this is entirely unacceptable and would be unacceptable to my constituents and to the Members of this House generally.  I hope that Dún Laoghaire will get the same treatment as anywhere else, the same treatment that inner Dublin and Donegal are getting.</P>
    <P>We have problems of housing maintenance and reconstruction.  If it costs more to build new houses, houses becoming free that just need basic repairs should have such repairs carried out and the necessary money should be provided. The more we allow houses to fall into disrepair the more problems we will have until eventually rebuilding is cheaper.  I appeal to the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government for a sense of fair play in the provision of public money for the various local authorities.  The Government and, I suppose, the Members of the House must look much more seriously at the means of financing the various services. There is no use in continuing with the attitude: &ldquo;There is your money; how you spend it is up to you but there is no more where that came from.  It is a matter of cutting back on services&rdquo;.  I understand that in Dún Laoghaire this year we are getting something like the extra money necessary for a set of traffic lights.  If it is a question of a set of traffic lights or keeping Blackrock baths open, I want to <Col N="412" /> keep the baths open because I think it would pay more dividends in enjoyment and in providing entertainment than perhaps traffic lights at some junction which, while they may be desirable, do not compare with the baths as an amenity.</P>
    <P>Although I do not represent an agricultural constituency, I recognise that there are problems in this area and that those problems affect all of us.  It is important that there is not a division between urban and agricultural people. There should be unity on this so that we get the best deal for the country.  I would like to refer to one aspect, which is very often ignored but it is an important aspect of agriculture.  I refer to the horse racing industry, breeding and the spin-offs from this industry.  There are thousands of people employed throughout the industry. Racing and horse breeding are going through a difficult time.  One of the reasons is the 1½ per cent levy imposed by Fianna Fáil a few years ago.  If things pick up I hope the Minister takes another look at that to see if it can be removed and that he ploughs money into the industry. If this is not done jobs in the industry will be lost.</P>
    <P>Money was provided in the budget for the Garda.  I hope this is only the first step by the Government in providing equipment for the Garda to make sure that people are able to live at peace in their homes.  I hope that this is only the first instalment of the Government's commitment to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>There are some aspects in relation to Deputy Gregory's money for the inner city which should be considered.  One of those is the Connacht Regional Airport, our old friend Knock Airport.  While we would all welcome an airport in any part of the country, I believe that the Connacht Regional Airport is a misnomer because, according to most statements that have been made, if there is a need for an airport in the west it is not at Knock.  I believe this money could be better utilised in encouraging factories to come to the west, in the provision of roads and a proper telephone service as well as other communications.  I hope the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will continue to honour the commitment of <Col N="413" /> the two previous Ministers in relation to the provision of telephones.  It is working telephones we want, because without communication to factories and warehouses in various parts of the country business will be lost.  I believe that providing money for an airport at Knock at the moment is a waste of money.  It will be a second miracle if this ever pays its way.</P>
    <P>There are a few things to be taken into account in relation to how this budget differs from the previous one and how Fianna Fáil are making up the difference. The one per cent insurance levy is one way Fianna Fáil are making up the difference. Who will pay for this?  Will it be the various insurance companies or the ever faithful public in relation to premiums? I believe this will fall back on the public because I do not believe the insurance companies will accept that they will have to pay their fair share.  I hope the Government will look at insurance, particularly in relation to the insurance of cars for young people.  Young people have heavy levies imposed on them when they try to obtain third party or comprehensive insurance on their motor bikes and cars.  I hope the Government will continue the commitment of the previous Government in relation to the provision of car insurance to the general public at a reasonable level.</P>
    <P>I welcome the money provided for the fire services and sanitary services.  I hope money will be provided for the new fire station due to be built in Dún Laoghaire. Deputy Murphy said there seems to be plenty of money about now for a fire station at Bray.  I hope there will be fair play from the Government and that Dún Laoghaire will get the new fire station we have been awaiting for a long time.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will have learned from their previous errors and mismanagement.  The people are looking for a commitment from them to solve our various problems.  The Government should take the necessary decisions, some of which may be unpopular and may cost them some unpopularity. Fianna Fáil must govern.  The country has lacked Government for a number of years with the exception of the seven <Col N="414" /> months from June 1981 to January this year.  Fianna Fáil have caused a lot of our problems.  The people want leadership and they want the Government to be seen to be acting in the best interests of everybody. They want to make sure that our financial affairs are brought into line and that there are jobs for our young people. I hope in the next few weeks, even allowing for the Dublin by-election, that the Government will take the necessary decisions and assure the people that they are a Government prepared to tackle our various problems.</P>
    <P>I have my doubts about any such commitment. It looks as if the Government will continue on their gamblers' throw image of governing from day to day with one eye on the opinion polls and the other on the cameras.  I hope that I am wrong in that but one cannot be very confident as to what action the Government might take when one considers that the Financial Statement, as well as not taking full cognisance of our economic problems, is bringing forward money from next year to pay this year's tax. What sort of situation will we be in as a consequence of that in facing into next year?  However, there is still time for the Government to make some changes in the budget and thereby to allow some of the objectives of the previous Government, objectives that were recognised and supported generally by the majority of the people, to be adhered to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Níl móran le rá agam i dtaobh an cáinaisnéis.  To say the least, it is unusual for two budgets to be introduced within the space of two months. While we all know the reasons for this situation, it is no harm to say that the bad advice from all those advisers who were appointed by the previous Government brought about the budget of January 27 and, consequently, the downfall of the then dithering Government after only a short term in office.  In the short time available to the new Government to introduce a budget many changes that they would have liked to have made could not be made.  However, any change promised by Fianna Fáil was made in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> In their reappraisal of the economic situation Fianna Fáil even at that time had initiated a plan for the development of the economy in the next four to five years.  That plan will incorporate the policies necessary to deal with such questions as unemployment, prices, balance of payments and Government borrowing. The central objective of the plan will be to establish the conditions necessary for sustained growth in employment.  The greatest problem facing us today is the problem of unemployment.  If we were to use the budget simply for the purpose of achieving financial targets without having regard to other consequences there would be a risk of serious damage to the economy.  In addition, given the structure of our tax system and the narrowness of the tax base, such measures can cause sharp increases in the consumer price index.  That type of situation in the past has created pressure for higher wage increases leading in turn to higher inflation rates.  The essence of successful budgetary policy is to find the balance between the need to keep borrowings as low as possible and the obligation to ensure that all opportunities for economic and social progress are exploited fully.  The Government are committed firmly to bringing the current deficit under control and gradually to eliminating it.  In the months before the introduction of the budget there was much emphasis on deficits and on borrowing but the attitude of the Government in their approach to these questions was to be flexible and, therefore, more in tune with underlying developments both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>Borrowing for capital investment is essential if we are to develop the economy fully and to meet the challenge of unemployment.  To quote something that was said here already, there is not much good in having well balanced ledgers in the Department of Finance while there are empty stomachs throughout the country.  The experienced gentleman who made that statement put the matter in a nutshell.  We are in the unique position in the European context of having a young and growing population.  That presents <Col N="416" /> us with both a challenge and an opportunity but more than anything else it imposes an obligation on us to create more employment for the additional numbers entering the labour market.  We must have a proper sense of priorities in terms of capital investment.  We must concentrate our resources on projects that will yield worthwhile returns.  This does not mean, however, that essential social investment should not proceed but it means that the social returns from such investment must be clear and substantial so as to justify the borrowing entailed.</P>
    <P>It is not a solution to our problems to be continually bemoaning the difficulties we face.  I include in that reference the hackneyed phrase of gloom and doom. We must approach the situation with confidence and with well-founded optimism if we are to make the progress that is necessary.  We must go forward in the confidence of having the capacity to fulfil our aspirations.  I should like to draw a comparison with the times in which we live and a similar state of affairs that existed in the early thirties.  That was before my time but I have read a lot about it.  I refer to the decision that was taken then not to pay land annuities to our big brother across the water.  That was in a situation known generally as the &ldquo;Economic War&rdquo;.  It was when our great former leader and statesman, Mr. de Valera, asked our people, both urban and rural, to face up to the situation and to accept sacrifices in the best interest of the country.  To the credit of the people who went before us they answered his call despite harassment from some sources which, out of charity, I will not mention today.  We are almost in that situation now.  Our adversaries are located in different places than before but nevertheless we are in a western world that is suffering from economic depression.</P>
    <P>The Government and Members of the House would do well to appeal to our people through honest leadership to repeat that dedication, that nationalist spirit and that pride in ourselves as a small nation struggling to survive.  If the appeal is made in an understanding manner to our people they will rally and <Col N="417" /> together we will pull through.  However, if we keep on a course of divisiveness &mdash; ní neart go cur le céile, mar a deirimid. The fact is that a nation's living standards can only be maintained and improved and employment safeguarded if we all make a contribution to achieving this objective.  The natural concern of parents is the welfare of their children and most are ready to make sacrifices in order to enhance their prospects.  Many parents are understandably concerned about the job prospects for their children.  I am sure that I, as a parent of a growing family, am echoing their concern when I say that those already in employment should not do anything to undermine their legitimate hopes.  Our principal aim should be to provide jobs for our young people who want to work in their own country.  Those who watch children leaving school any afternoon must ask where will we get jobs for them all.</P>
    <P>The improvement in the social welfare benefits and the increases in the social welfare contributions announced in the January budget were given full effect in the Social Welfare Bill, 1982.  We all agree about the necessity to have a proper social welfare code.  Allied to these we have our health services and our education. The Minister for Finance provided an additional £10 million to reduce the financial constraints on the health service. Those of us who are members of health boards are aware of the situation that was developing in regard to finance but now health services will benefit from a further £8 million additional buoyancy which has emerged in health contribution receipts.  It will be possible also to divert a futher £10 million to hospital services within the revised total allocation.  In effect, Exchequer grants to health agencies for health services will be £797 million in 1982.  That is a huge figure for such services and it suggests that there must be a lot of unhealthy people around, but I wonder if we are getting full value for that sort of expenditure.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot in recent weeks about local authorities being short of finance and I accept that they are.  Local authorities can use any money that is given to them.  I contend that many years <Col N="418" /> ago we should have borrowed money from abroad to develop local services. Roads are an essential part of our infrastructure and when dealing with them we must remember that there has been a huge increase in the number of vehicles here.  We must also bear in mind that the axle weight of vehicles has increased in a short space of time and those heavy vehicles are using roads that were constructed at a time when people were using a horse and cart.  The heavy vehicles are having a disastrous effect on our roads.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the decision of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1977 to remove domestic rates and abolish car tax saying that those decisions were not adequately considered.  As a member of a local authority I have heard it stated on many occasions that roads in Cork were not in a good condition as a result of the decision to remove car tax. I contend that that was a radical policy then.  In August 1977 it cost £84 to re-tax my car.  Instead of that I registered it for £5 because then I had £79 to spend, £5 here and £10 there.  This was the whole idea of the exercise, that rather than a once-off payment into a local authority office, transmitted to the Exchequer, the money would be spent in the economy and would be gaining and adding value to the economy.  It was a retrograde step by the Coalition Government last year to re-introduce car tax.  As a member of a local authority I was looking forward to seeing a big flow of money coming into Cork County Council and other local authorities by virtue of the restoration of car tax.  That did not happen.  People might ask why we did not discontinue it in our budget but it was said during the election that the basic structure of the budget introduced by the Coalition on 27 January would not be changed because of time constraints; the same budget would be re-introduced by us with a change of emphasis on some aspects of it and those aspects of the budget were honoured.</P>
    <P>On the question of local authorities, it is time that the statutory demands on local authorities were at least limited to the same increase allowable by direction of the Minister for the Environment in <Col N="419" /> each new rating year.  The local authorities are dealing with demands from committees and statutory bodies within their local authority area and their demands in the years since 1977 have been greater than the percentage increase allowed by the Department.  We had varying increases of 10 per cent, 11 per cent, 12 per cent and this year's increase was 15 per cent.  Is it not time for the Department of Agriculture to consider the work of the committees within the local authority area?  Is it not time for the Department of Justice to take over the maintenance of courthouses?  Is it not time for the Department of Education to make up the difference of the allowable increase in rates and the statutory demands because, as happened in County Cork in 1981, the element for county road maintenance upkeep, overhaul and improvement was about £8 in the £ of the total rate struck? Local authorities will have to get together and look at the financing structure within each local authority.  I am very concerned about the statutory demands exceeding the allowable percentage increase each year.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism about the removal of domestic rates by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1977.  If people wish to have rates on domestic properties re-introduced without any reference to ability or inability to pay, let them say so.  They are inclined to forget that it was a Coalition Government which meddled with the rates initially, a 25 per cent health contribution taken off one year, 50 per cent taken off the following year and so on.  Perhaps they encouraged Fianna Fáil to discontinue them.</P>
    <P>In October 1980 the Government announced a detailed programme for relocating Government offices.  Considerable progress had been made with site acquisition, design work and planning before we left office.  One of the areas concerned was in Cork city.  I am glad to see that the Minister for the Public Service, a Corkman, is now reviewing that programme with a view to getting it under way as soon as possible, in consultation with staff.  I am also glad to see that sufficient funds are already available in <Col N="420" /> the Estimates for the Office of Public Works to cover expenditure likely to arise this year.</P>
    <P>There are two Garda stations in the constituency which I represent, one at St. Luke's and the other at Shandon Street. I do not know how long they have been in existence but from St. Luke's in eastern, north-eastern and northern directions a huge town has grown with hundreds upon hundreds of houses. After many years of talking and buck-passing from one area to the other, that vast area is still without a Garda station. The same applies to the north-western side of Cork city where the little station in Shandon Street served its purpose well from when it was first occupied.  Northwest of it, and west, have grown into another large residential and well-populated area, including Farranree, Gurranabraher, Churchfield, and there is a recent addition of 600 houses in a place called Knocknaheeny.  Can the House imagine those two areas in Cork city in 1982 being without the services of a Garda station?  They are without the necessary protection they would have from the Garda if the Garda had a physical presence there, and what it would mean to the peace of mind of many citizens in those areas, some of them coming into middle age, contending with the exuberance of some of our youth.  When I speak of the Office of Public Works and so forth I would hope that positive steps would be taken this year to ensure that a Garda station will be built and staffed at Gurranabraher and Mayfield.</P>
    <P>Still on the Cork area and not wishing to be parochial, I hope the House will allow me to refer to another Cork matter, the agreement to purchase the Whitegate oil refinery for operation by the Irish National Petroleum Company.  I thank the Government and the Minister concerned for providing £10 million for its purchase, overhaul and the running and staffing costs during the period until the refinery begins to trade again.  By then the Government expect that the Irish National Petroleum Company will have been established by statute.  That was a tremendous boost to us in Cork because the taking of the refinery into national <Col N="421" /> control will ensure the maintenance of the jobs of which I spoke earlier.</P>
    <P>The previous Government decided to discontinue the IDA re-equipment grants.  Goodness knows why.  They continued the scheme in regard to the food processing sector only.  In normal circumstances it would be expected that firms would upgrade their technology out of existing profits, especially given the generous tax allowances which apply in the case of replacements.  However, in the economic environment in which firms are operating, this Government decided quite rightly to restore re-equipment grants with effect from 1 April last.  The existing provision for the IDA includes a substantial element for re-equipment commitments already undertaken and it is not expected that the restoration will require an increase to the IDA general allocation for 1982.</P>
    <P>Unlike the previous speaker, I have a small element of agriculture in my constituency and being of that agricultural stock I have always contended that despite the tremendous efforts that have been made &mdash; speaking in these terms we must always pay tribute to the late Seán Lemass, the architect of our industrial development &mdash; and the progress in industrial development, agriculture is still our single most important industry. It can be said truly that any setback agriculture has suffered in recent years has had adverse repercussions throughout the entire economy.  In the interest of national economic development this Government attach the greatest importance to ensuring that the stimulus to the farming community to develop and expand will not be lost.  Accordingly, if for nothing else but to show faith in that resolve, grants under the farm schemes are being restored to their pre-September 1981 level at a cost of £4 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>I am sure all of us will agree that when the agricultural community and industry are progressing the effect of it will be seen throughout the entire economy.  I have no doubt that the Minister for Agriculture, the Department and the Government will see to it that agriculture will be encouraged and given every assistance to develop.  It is a natural resource <Col N="422" /> and one can say it is only six inches under the ground.</P>
    <P>Ní mór dom a rá, de bharr go bhfuil cion agam don Ghaeilge, agus ainneoin nach bhfuil im Dháil ceantar aon cheantar Gaeltachta ach áit beag amháin i nGleann Mhaor, go molaim, an tAire de bharr gur thug sé do Údarás na Gaeltachta san cáinfhaisnéis ar a bhfuilimid ag caint milliún punt sa bhreis ná mar a bhí tugtha don Údarás nó mar a bhí geallta dóibh sa cháinfhaisnéis i Mí Eanáir.

Caithfimid a bheith an-bhuíoch do mhuintir na Gaeltachta de bharr gur choimeád siad ar dteanga dhúchais le seacht gcéad bliain anuas.  Molaim, faoi mar a dúirt mé, cabhair an Aire do Údarás na Gaeltachta agus do mhuintir na nGaeltachtaí.  Tagaim thar n-ais anois ó caithfidh mé aistriú go Béarla.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to full deepwater berthing facilities at Ringaskiddy in County Cork.  This development has been going on for some years and was in danger of being shelved, according to some statements being made by those in Government in the latter part of last year and in the early part of this year.  It is encouraging to find the Minister providing £2, million to begin this work.  The proposed development down there was the brainchild of Cork County Council, who encouraged the IDA to acquire about 1,000 acres of land which provided what is known as the city and county harbour water scheme with the services for industry to take off.  Money has been provided by Fianna Fáil Governments over the years for the ongoing development at Ringaskiddy and, more important, the provision of an adequate road out of Ringaskiddy to serve industrialists who provide employment there.</P>
    <P>The construction industry can provide the greatest number of jobs for the least cost in the shortest possible time.  To <Col N="423" /> make inroads as quickly as possible on the high level of unemployment the Minister is providing £50 million for the building industry.  Of this amount £21.7 million is included in expenditure already announced in respect of local authorities, including urban and rural schemes.  We have heard a lot about one particular urban renewal scheme.  There are urban renewal schemes in other places.  There was a fine urban renewal scheme in Cork city known as the Shandon renewal scheme.  This proposal, emanating from the Cork Corporation, is a credit to the elected members and the staff of the corporation. I am not going to make comparisons with other places, as seems to be the habit of many public representatives, but the proposals I refer to justify the moneys that were given to it.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to some of the press criticisms of the Minister for the Environment in regard to giving answers to the Cork delegation.  I am not a member of the Cork Corporation, but I was sitting in as an observer at the meeting in question and I heard the Minister for the Environment invite the delegation to name a date within a month of the day he met that deputation when his Minister of State, Deputy Brady, would go to Cork.  The deputation dithered and were unsure about giving a date.  Finally, they gave one and I am glad to say that the Minister is going there next week to see for himself what is required.  I know the corporation will make their case and I am sure they will get the extra money to sort out their difficulties.</P>
    <P>I notice that the net effect of all the proposed adjustments is to increase the 1982 Exchequer borrowing requirement for capital purposes by almost £58 million to £1,004 million.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to an element of the income tax proposal in the budget.  Fianna Fáil decided against changing the present structure of income tax in order to apply tax credits because a switch to tax credits for the next income tax year at this stage would give rise to enormous administrative confusion with little result to show for it.  I am tempted to refer to the infamous £9.60 tax credit <Col N="424" /> for stay-at-home wives.  Because of the way this was spelled out many stay-at-home wives could not but believe that they were going to benefit to the tune of £9.60 per week for staying at home, minding their children and looking after the house.  Of course they were not told that that £9.60 was to be taken out of the husband's pay packet.</P>
    <P>People might say that the £9.60 has been spoken about often enough.  However, I take this opportunity to refer to it again because it was the greatest con job that was ever done.  It was a hidden tax credit transfer.  All stay-at-home wives thought they would get £9.60.  Those who went around the various constituencies telling people about it did not have the honesty to say to those who did not pay income tax that they would not get it.  I know many people with large families and small incomes who would not be paying income tax.  They would need £9.60 but the perpetrators of that confidence trick did not allow for them.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the budget was the taxation of short-term social welfare benefits. I am glad our Government did not go ahead with that proposal.  Such a tax would impose an unfair burden on those who are so unfortunate as to be made redundant.  I contend that many people who are genuinely out of work and unable to get it would have been taxed by the previous Government's proposal. There are people who are abusing the social welfare code.  The existing provisions in some cases encourage absenteeism and reduce the incentive to work. Despite that, it does not warrant the general imposition of a tax on those in reduced circumstances who have no choice in the matter.  I am glad to note that the question of reforming the current arrangements will be pursued in other ways.  This is desirable because in some situations there was very little difference between the benefits accruing to people and their take home pay.  This is very annoying to those who are asked to pay an extra 1.75 per cent to help the unemployed and an extra 1 per cent for youth employment.  Many workers are unwilling to contribute any further moneys <Col N="425" /> because of abuses of the system.  I am glad that the matter is being examined.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for the two VAT changes he made in the budget.  As regards VAT on books, especially schoolbooks, the proposed rate of 18 per cent would have been very severe.  The Minister reduced this area to zero rating from 1 May.  I should also have mentioned this welcomed retention of food subsidies at a cost of £34.3 million.  At this time of economic struggling, food subsidies should be maintained.  However, they should not be retained <i>ad infinitum.</i></P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil budget will have a decidely favourable impact on employment. The removal of VAT from clothing and footwear, the imposition of VAT at the point of import and the retention of food subsidies will sustain purchasing power and protect our home industries. Increased capital allocations, particularly for the building industry and local authorities, will give a positive stimulus to employment.  This will be helped by the employment incentive scheme.  Employment must be central in the medium-term plan which is being prepared.</P>
    <P>The increase in prices as a result of this budget will be less than they would have been under the January budget.  The CPI effect is estimated at 2¾ per cent as compared with the 4¾ per cent which would have resulted under the January proposals. This will help to lessen inflation and encourage moderation in pay expectation. The balance of payments position will be improved through better export performance and all round competitiveness. The budget represents a fair balance between controlling the public finances and giving a stimulus to economic activity and employment.</P>
    <P>The extra taxation is distributed as equitably as possible, and in this matter we are all awaiting the proposals of the Commission on Taxation.  In the meantime the greater burden is being imposed on those best able to pay it.  The general social welfare changes provide considerable improvement for those who most need this help.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" /> The budget is a sensible response to the present difficult situation.  It will, I hope, create more confidence in the country both at home and abroad and will provide a strong impetus for greater progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is strange to hear Members of the Government party claiming credit for a budget which varies so little in detail from what the outgoing Government introduced in late January.  The outgoing Government introduced their budget with an air of seriousness and responsibility and the feeling that the contents of that budget were necessary to get this country out of a difficult situation which had been allowed to escalate to alarming proportions over the past four of five years.  That anybody should begin to take credit at this early stage of office for a budget which varies only in two or three respects from what the outgoing Government intended is indeed strange. I suggest that the Government wait. Hopes are one thing, aspirations are another.  But what is blatantly lacking in the Government is an objective and it is not only an objective of fiscal figures or of projects.  There is a lack of motivation behind this budget.  No matter what talking is done about it or what hopes are read into it, no matter what degree of confidence the Government Ministers try to instill into people regarding it, the basic problems are still there as they were before the budget of 27 January.  The only difference is that there is no motivation in this budget.  No procedure is set out in it whereby the basic problems can be overcome.  The financial constraints are still there, both on the Exchequer and on local authorities.  Financial constraint lies at the core of this nation's problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everywhere one goes today one comes up against the feeling that this country is going nowhere in a positive direction.  On the contrary, it is going more and more quickly down the drain.  In shops one meets shoppers who have little enough money to spend, and if money is not spent across the counter little goes into <Col N="427" /> production of purchasable items and that means reduction in employment.  In the business community one finds that the future is faced with fear and trepidation rather than with the confidence to which we have heard some Government spokesmen refer.  This budget in one of its elements &mdash; namely, the imposition of VAT at point of entry &mdash; contains not only a possibility but a probability of risks of unemployment and closures in the very near future.  We are now only four months away from the introduction of VAT at point of entry.  Business firms fear 1 September because they know that then a burden will be placed on them in regard to obtaining a cash flow situation which will enable them to get over the initial purchase of raw material problems and go into production straightaway. This could well result in their having to lay off people.  There is no justification for the imposition of VAT at point of entry.  It was introduced in this Government's budget for no reason other than to find a sum of money very quickly.  That sum of money can certainly be found in many ways, but this is the acquisition of capital in the short-term at the expense of long-term economic growth.</P>
    <P>The financial constraints are still as heavy on the Exchequer.  One could be facetious enough to say that they are even heavier than they were when the budget was introduced one month ago, because every week since then additional and by no means petty amounts have been promised for various schemes, institutions and projects around the country.  It is nothing to pick up a newspaper and read of a sum in the region of £30 million to £40 million being pledged.  This is really only paper money.  It must be obtained somewhere; yet we find no indication as to where it is to come from other than a mere reference from the Minister for Finance that it must be raised through cutbacks in expenditure or by additional taxation.  Indeed, this afternoon we find the Taoiseach facing up with perhaps the first sense of reality to the impending problems.  He referred to the possible need for further taxation measures.  This is inevitable.  We cannot go on creating more and more <Col N="428" /> production of purchasable items, and to additional projects and expenditure without referring to where that money is to come from.  This problem is extended into the local authority area where we find every county council, corporation and urban council faced with an ongoing, escalating difficult situation whereby they are unable to meet their monthly commitments. Not alone are they unable to face up to projects for the next 12 months or even indicate where they will be in six months' time on their balance sheets, but they are faced now with the problem of paying their employees within one or two months ahead.</P>
    <P>It is all so easy to say that there will be a reduction in taxation.  It is also easy to say that rates and car tax will be abolished.  As I said earlier, it is easy to say that nothing will happen in the short-term but it is the long-term position that has to be related to, not only by the Government but by the local authorities also.  A deplorable position has arisen.  Local Authorities have been coming to the Minister for Finance weekly now.  Those who have not humiliated themselves knocking on his door seeking further finance, having tried in a responsible fashion to face up to their responsibilities at local level, are writing letters to the Department of Finance setting out their difficult situation and asking for a subvention of some sort to tide them over this precarious time.  At local authority level this means that employees must be laid off and that services will deteriorate even further.  Nobody can say that the services at local authority level are at the same level as they were ten years ago; yet the amount of finance that has had to be pumped into provisional local services has gone out of all proportion to any increase in the level and quality of those services.  This means that people must provide more and more moneys to pay for fewer and fewer services.  Whatever Government are in office this dilemma must be faced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke last night about what I saw as the inadequacies in our legal system and the deficiencies it presents to the Garda.  I now wish to speak about the recruitment of gardaí. The picture presented yesterday by the Minister, while a rosy one, bore little relationship to reality and most certainly was not recognisable as the same picture as was drawn by Fianna Fáil in their advertisements before the last election. The House will recall with interest the glossy newspaper advertisements that promised 2,000 extra gardaí.  The public were led to believe that, given the arrival of the Fianna Fáil Government, they could expect these extra gardaí on the streets within a matter of weeks.  Instead we have seen simply the continuation of the course of action first set in motion by the Coalition but with the qualification <Col N="430" /> that in order to give the appearance of action they have set aside in-service training and the greater efficiency of the Garda is being impeded as a result.</P>
      <P>The problem will not be solved simply by recruiting more gardaí.  Their effectiveness depends not just on better equipment, more computers and more radios, but more than anything else on the degree of support they receive from the community.  Every Member knows that there are now areas of this city where gardaí no longer receive the respect that was once the norm.  If that is to be reversed I should like to see from the Minister and the Commissioner a commitment to a greater role in community policing by the Garda.</P>
      <P>Specifically, I should like the Minister to put at rest the fears of some senior Garda officers that there is within the Department of Justice a suggestion that the juvenile liaison officer scheme should be taken from the Garda and given to the probation service or somewhere else. There is a very strong feeling within the Garda that it is right and proper that they should be seen to be available to help young offenders instead of always having to bring people to court.  They are very concerned at rumours that they are to lose out on this.  The Minister could do himself and the force a favour by scotching that suggestion.</P>
      <P>I would also ask the Minister to look at the situation which now exists in some British cities where in trouble spots police officers run political-style clinics where designated members of the force are available on a one-to-one basis to discuss problems with the public in the hope of establishing a relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of crime in this city will not be solved simply by putting more people in uniform or in plain clothes, although of course that is necessary.  We must ensure that these people are as effective as possible.  This means greater in-force training and consideration of a cadet college and also seeing that the force is properly equipped.  I welcome the Minister's commitment that the proposals put forward by his predecessor will be honoured.  We must also do everything politically possible to ensure that the <Col N="431" /> Garda receive maximum support from the community in which they must work. I urge the Minister as strongly as possible to commit himself to that as a course of action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am so angry at the whole situation that I will be endeavouring to keep my language temperate.  I am fed up with so many of the excuses that have been provided for vandalism and mugging &mdash; the social conditions, the deprived areas.  I wish to make it clear that deprived people do not have a monopoly on crime.  The people who are committing crimes are coming from homes where there is plenty of food and in many instances a good income.  Most people in this country have come from deprived backgrounds but they have not turned to crime as a means of livelihood. Nowadays there is no financial hardship in unemployment as there was many years ago when we did not have the money to pay dole and a family often knew what hunger was.</P>
      <P>The Minister must strengthen the law and make the necessary changes to deal with some of these evil people who are daily murdering elderly people by degrees.  I have just read a report in today's <i>Evening Press</i> of two brothers in their late seventies who were terrorised by cudgel-wielding thugs who raided their farmhouse home last night and left them tied up in the dark.  There are many such instances.  I have received reports in my constituency of people who have died within six or eight weeks of being mugged or robbed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended a meeting of 500 or more residents in Rialto and heard an 85-year-old lady in tears saying that her grand-daughter had taken her as a birthday treat to see Maureen Potter at the Gaiety Theatre and on the way home her grand-daughter was robbed by two hoodlums and kicked while she called to her grand-mother to save her.  I am sick listening to the awful things that are happening on our streets day and night.  We are all sick when we hear of a 16-year-old girl being attacked in O'Connell Street while members of the public did nothing <Col N="432" /> to help.  They probably thought it was a fight between itinerant children and did not think that it might have been their son or daughter who was being attacked. I am told that women should not drive over Herberton Bridge after 7 o'clock because the chances are that someone with an iron bar will break the window of their car.</P>
    <P>I was seeking changes in the law long before the last Government came into office.  The first change I sought was in relation to bail and this was mentioned last night by both Deputy Mitchell and the Minister for Justice.  Successive sentences should be imposed on those committing crimes.  I want to see the age of criminal responsibility raised to 12, provided parents are held responsible for the crimes of their children.  If that parent is unemployed, let 10 per cent of his social welfare payments be deducted so that victims of crime can be compensated. Young hooligans must pay back the people against whom they have committed crimes.  Very often the Garda know who these people are but the difficulty is in gaining sufficient evidence to make an arrest.  When such a person is apprehended and found guilty he should be made to pay back the State, who have paid compensation for the malicious damage, at the rate of 10 per cent of his income, whether he is at work or in receipt of social welfare payments.  A person who burns down a building valued at £1 million should have 10 per cent of his income deducted for the rest of his life. This is the only way to produce a real effect.</P>
    <P>I received today a letter from Saint Peter's Road, Greenhills, Dublin 12 which states:</P>
    <P>I wish to draw your attention to the very grave problem we have with vandalism, crime, etc. in our area of Greenhills.  Especially on the St. Peters Road area around the shopping centre and the few blocks of houses either side of the shops, the three blocks of houses which is St. Peter's Tce. where we live and across the road opposite the shops &mdash; this is the worst hit areas.</P>
    <P>The teenagers here are out of their <Col N="433" /> minds altogether and destruction seems to be their main aim.  They are wild with drink and we suspect drugs.</P>
    <P>They smash cars.  Our own two cars have been damaged &mdash; one badly, which we sent in to Dublin Co. Council as a malicious damage claim.  They break householders windows for no reason except getting kicks from it or dares from friends.  Both our neighbours windows have been put through. The latest craze is cars travelling the road after 7 p.m.  They now throw bottles at them &mdash; some cars have been damaged and windows smashed.  Just as the drivers would get out the crowd would start to close in on them so they have to drive off frightened and scared. The road and pathways are strewn with glass.  They rob cars and drive them around the roads and back lanes into the early hours of the morning.</P>
    <P>The shop windows and shutters are pulled down and smashed and they break into shops, houses and garages. The latest was the Telephone box, ripped right out of the ground by hooligans driving around in a van, possibly stolen, and they were not satisfied until they had it completely demolished and used the bits as missiles to throw at passing cars.  This carry on starts most nights, dry or wet, from 7 p.m. to well after midnight especially at the weekends. They pull up trees and disconnect our lights on the road.</P>
    <P>Crumlin Garda cover this area and have to take in as far back as Harolds Cross &mdash; Crumlin and Walkinstown and Greenhills.  They have not got enough staff to give us the foot and car patrol we certainly need.  Could you please have a Guard Station fully staffed and complete with cars, van and motor bike and enough staff set up for us at Greenhills before its to late.</P>
    <P>Here is the most important sentence in the letter:</P>
    <P>The people up here are at the end of their wits and if something is not done quickly the law will be taken into our own hands.  In the meantime please <Col N="434" /> increase the manpower at Crumlin Station and give them more cars.</P>
    <P>The savings on the Government Dept. on malicious damage claims, Cleansing Dept. Lighting Dept. Trees Dept. etc. plus payments out of people's own pockets will more than cover that of a Garda Station and Guards here in the Greenhills area.</P>
    <P>The letter was signed by a few people.  In another part of Crumlin some nights ago a Garda car was rammed.  A resident of the area told me that on three occasions her husband had to jump over the railings to avoid being knocked down by a car that was driven at him.  Last evening Deputy Mitchell mentioned that many parents say they cannot control their children and that they do not know what to do with them.  I do not know where we should put them but I know that people are entitled to protection.</P>
    <P>Something else is happening and we do not seem to know much about it.  When old people in their seventies or eighties are attacked very often they go senile almost immediately afterwards.  A son may come home and find his mother or father talking gibberish and not knowing who he is.  This is due to delayed shock. A few days ago a girl telephoned me to tell me about two old friends of hers who were robbed while they sat in their house. The old lady and her invalid husband had to sit there while young, heartless hooligans robbed them.</P>
    <P>The newspaper <i>Southside Express</i> in its leading article referred to my ideas as being Victorian.  Is it Victorian to be compassionate? If I get upset or emotional it is because of the compassion I feel not just for the old but for the very young. Recently I was talking to a friend of mine, Paddy Cullen, the former goalkeeper for Dublin, who was training in the Phoenix Park.  He told me how a 12-year-old boy was cycling through the park quite innocently when he was set upon by 30 young thugs who beat the living daylights out of him.  If it were not for the fact that the boy was brought to hospital very quickly he might have died.  He was in a horrible mess.  Some of those thugs are like little savages.  What do we say?  We say, &ldquo;Its <Col N="435" /> the system, its the poverty&rdquo;.  We have probably one of the most homogeneous societies of any country.  We have not the kind of problems that exist in the United States or Britain where there are so many different nationalities and where there is the friction that can create race riots.  We have a nice little compact society and there is no excuse for that conduct here. The only reason why it is happening is that we have not the guts to stand up and face whatever hostile publicity we may get from some of the do-gooders who write articles in the newspapers until they are attacked themselves.  This happened some time ago to a journalist on one of the newspapers and, as she said in a subsequent article, all her liberal views were changed as a result of what happened to her.  Old people are afraid to go to sleep at night.  If they hear the slightest sound they become wide awake.  They are living in absolute terror.</P>
    <P>The type of crime I have been describing is referred to as &ldquo;petty&rdquo; crime although I do not consider it petty. Armed robbery is regarded as a serious crime.  I ask the Minister to consider bringing in a mandatory sentence of five years for anyone who is found with a gun in his possession and who has a criminal record, and I emphasise that.  That would make them think twice before going out with a gun.  The young hooligans I spoke about a few minutes ago are the gunmen of tomorrow.  Many of the gunmen in our city today were the young hooligans and thugs of yesterday.</P>
    <P>I have heard criticism of Loughan House and the fact that it costs £28,000 to keep a youngster there.  Do people who make this criticism realise that there is not one child there who has not caused a minimum of £100,000 damage?  The State is well on the credit side in this instance.</P>
    <P>We should have some kind of an arrangement to send those youngsters to farms.  When I was 12 years of age I went to a farm in Cavan.  I worked hard: I cut turf, helped with the harvest and did many jobs.  I brought in the hay single-handed when I was 12 years with the aid of the old hay shifter.  It was hard work <Col N="436" /> but I loved it.  I would put some of these young people doing this kind of work. Instead of having the reserve force that Deputy Mitchell spoke about, I would have 100 military type policemen who would arrest these fellows when they abscond and they would get an additional month's sentence.  They would work hard, get plenty of plain food but not televison in the evening.  It is not a holiday camp.  I would get them out into the fresh air because most of them are stunted from lack of nourishment.  Many of these hard core young criminals have parents who are also criminals.  It is a cycle which never seems to break, as I know because I have done a lot of research into this problem.</P>
    <P>About 70 per cent of the homes in the Crumlin area of my constituency have been broken into, some of them three, four and five times.  The provisional figures for 1981 given by the Minister cannot show the number of petty crimes that have not been reported because many people know that they are wasting their time reporting them.</P>
    <P>I was talking to a Garda inspector not long ago and he told me he had been congratulating himself because a well-known young gangster had been given three months.  After two weeks he saw him back on the streets.  He asked the young criminal why he was on the streets and he was told that there was not enough room for him in the prisons and he was freed.  I will give the Minister that person's name and I want to know why this chronic crook who caused misery to hundreds of people was released.  Many old people in my constituency are afraid to go out even to the community centre for fear their handbags would be snatched or that their homes might be robbed while they are out.  This is reality. If we do not do something to change the law the public will take the law into their own hands.  Once that happens we can forget about law and order.</P>
    <P>I am known as a law and order man.  I believe in law and order.  At present we have a lot of law but no order.  I want to see justice being done.  It is not being done at present.  There is too much emphasis on rehabilitation.  I am in <Col N="437" /> favour of rehabilitation if it comes right, but it can only come right through punishment. If any of our children gets out of hand most of us will give them a damn good hiding and that is the end of the problem.  But there are many parents who are too selfish and too wrapped up in their own lives.  They drink and smoke too much and then wonder why their children are going out night after night, ending up on drugs.</P>
    <P>I believe gardaí will be going into schools shortly to encourage children not to take drugs.  We must educate the teachers to be vigilant so that they will recognise signs of drug taking.  I was at a public meeting in Crumlin a couple of months ago and there were about 200 people there, including 60 or 70 schoolchildren. A gentleman from Coolmines was talking to a reformed drug addict.  He asked the children how many of them were aware of drug-taking in their schools.  About 80 per cent put up their hands.  Drug-taking in our schools is widespread and we have to do something about it.  Our teachers must be aware of what is going on.  There should be referral agencies where parents can go if there is a drug problem in their homes.  The Health Education Bureau said they were delighted when we first asked them to undertake this work last May or June.</P>

      <P>I have agreed to give Deputy De Rossa six minutes.  No area of Dublin has a monopoly on crime. Foxrock has its crime problem, as has Crumlin and the inner city.  Every part of Dublin and even the country has a crime problem, as can be seen from our newspapers. I want to see known drug-pushers apprehended.  We know who they are and we know all about them.  I asked the Minister to consider seriously the suggestion made by Deputy J. Mitchell last night about the majority jury verdict because this is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not just talk figures and recruitment. Every time a policeman makes an arrest that is another policeman off the street.  We must streamline the system so <Col N="438" /> that we can apprehend this small core of known hooligans.  It is the same small core who are committing these crimes &mdash; five or six in each area, and when they are added together they do not come to even 1 per cent of all the young people who are doing magnificent work.  There are many other things I would like to say but I will make way for Deputy De Rossa. I plead with the Minister to hammer some of these young hooligans who are making life miserable for so many people before the people take the law into their own hands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the Fine Gael motion nor the Government amendment makes any attempt to come to grips with the underlying causes of the crime and vandalism complained of in the motion. Simply calling for a greater number of police is not an answer, nor is the declaration of a crime emergency, which in my view is an over-reaction to a situation which is bad but does not require such drastic measures.  What is the purpose of declaring such an emergency?  Is it to allow the introduction of emergency legislation to provide the Garda with an arbitrary increase in police powers?  If not, then such a declaration is mere window dressing and an excuse for doing nothing.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the question of policing, police numbers and increased powers. Over the past ten years the number of gardaí has doubled and the gardaí have been provided with increased technical resources, such as the new forensic science laboratory.  But, despite this, there has been an overall increase in the volume of crime and, while there has been an increase in the number of convictions, the actual conviction rate has fallen.  This is not to argue against providing gardaí with the most up-to-date training and technical equipment, but I believe it shows that it is too simplistic to say that increased police numbers by themselves will automatically reduce the rate of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of police powers I would point out that the Garda have considerable powers of arrest at present. Indeed, in the Dublin area they have <Col N="439" /> greater powers than in any other part of the country under the Dublin Police Act, under which they have wide and sweeping powers of arrest without warrant.  The Garda can arrest for a breach of the peace or if they have reasonable suspicion of a felony being committed.  Under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act they can arrest and hold for up to 48 hours without a warrant for any offence under that Act.  They can arrest for an offence under the Firearms Act, for any offence under the Explosives Substances Act, under the Malicious Damages Act, and for any offence under the Conspiracies and Protection of Property Act which, incidentally, was brought in originally to deal with trade unionism.  They also have wide powers under the Misuse of Drugs Act and, of course, the Traffic Acts.  In my view, the powers of the Garda are quite adequate to arrest people of whom they have reasonable suspicion of having committed a crime.</P>
    <P>What the Garda seem to be looking for, and what both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil appear to want to give the Garda, is the power to arrest simply on suspicion &mdash; there is no mention whatsoever of a reasonable suspicion &mdash; and to allow the Garda to hold such persons for six hours and in some cases for up to 24 hours for questioning.  To my mind this is an attempt to abolish the rule which requires the Garda to bring arrested persons before a court without delay.  They are seeking these powers despite the fact that the great bulk of people appearing in court make self-incriminating statements and that the bulk of such convictions are on such confessions.</P>
    <P>This is not a satisfactory situation because, if further and greater powers are given to the Garda, there will be no incentive for the Garda to search for independent evidence to prove guilt and they will rely more and more on self-incriminatory statements made by suspects in custody.  If you combine the disincentive to find independent evidence with allowing the Garda to arrest on the merest suspicion, and not a reasonable suspicion, you have a recipe for a breakdown in confidence in the Garda which <Col N="440" /> the people have despite what I said about the over-reaction of the Fine Gael people in calling for an emergency.  You will also have a return to the 1976 situation when allegations of heavy gangs and brutality followed the then Coalition's emergency legislation providing for seven-day detention.</P>
    <P>There must be a balance of interest between the individual's right to liberty and freedom from arbitrary arrest and the interest of society to protect itself. The trend of the demand at present for greater police powers and changes in the law tips the balance against the citizen's right to liberty and could lead ultimately to a far greater breakdown in law enforcement than we are faced with now. I mentioned earlier that I felt that talk about changing the law and increasing police numbers was a simplistic approach to a very complex question.</P>
    <P>The increase in crime arises first from the fact that we have an increasing population and a very high number of young people in that population.  It is interesting to note that the bulk of convicted persons are under 21 years of age.  A second element is the fact that Irish society is undergoing severe and rapid change from a largely rural society to an urbanised society.  That brings all kinds of difficulties, stresses and strains.  It is also clear from studying those convicted of the bulk of crime that unemployment, denial of educational opportunities and our decaying cities are strong elements in the causes of crime.</P>
    <P>One expert who has observed the operation of our juvenile courts has stated that invariably there are three elements common to most persons who come before the court.  The three elements are: (1) they are generally functionally illiterate, (2), they are poorly educated and, (3), they themselves or their families are dependent on social welfare.  Therefore, the Government would be foolish to embark on a programme of simply strengthening the law and increasing the numbers of Garda without, at the same time, making a serious attempt to come to grips with the problems of job creation, the provision of leisure facilities and the provision of <Col N="441" /> adequate workers for the training and education of our youth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MyraBarry" hpid="Miss M. Barry Miss M. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer first to Deputy De Rossa's interpretation of the motion.  His speech was concerned mainly with the powers of the Garda. The motion does not refer in any way to the powers of the Garda.  It reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, recognising the appalling level of crime and vandalism, declares a crime emergency in the Dublin Metropolitan area, and calls for all reasonable steps to be taken urgently, to bring the situation under control, including the reform of the law and the expansion and re-organisation of the Gardaí as rapidly as possible including the consideration of establishing a Dublin Garda Reserve.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the general level of crime is upwards.  The evidence is in the statistics and in all our newspapers. When one reads the daily newspapers one can see clearly that the social fabric of our society is weakening and causing great anxiety and fear.  From one's own experience, and the experience of one's friends and neighbours, one can see that there is cause for alarm.  Yesterday as I walked from Leinster House to O'Connell Street I saw four smashed windows. Last weekend in my home town of Fermoy, which has a population of 4,000, the premises of three chemists were broken into on Saturday night.  I heard a story at the weekend about a man of 80 whose home was broken into and he was attacked by an unknown person.  This surely is a cause for alarm.</P>
      <P>The quality of life of our citizens can be seen in the crime rate.  If the crime rate is high, there is a pervading atmosphere of fear and anxiety.  We are right to be concerned about this important issue.  If one asks what has gone wrong and what is the solution, one gets many and varied solutions.  There is no simple solution because it is not a simple problem. The causes are complex and the solutions will have to be complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the many causes I number first the human factor resulting from the changing society in which we live.  We <Col N="442" /> have a materialistic society now.  The emphasis is on mé féin.  The question is: What is in it for me?  We have a much more pressurised society than we had in the past.  This has resulted in frustrations and tensions and increased pressures which have to be released in some way. If they are not released in healthy or sporting behaviour, they will be released in vandalism and crime.  There is an onus on us to provide more sporting facilities and amenities for our people.  Prevention is better than cure.  With so much aggression within one, if it cannot be released on a playing pitch, then it will be released on a window, a car or on a person.</P>
    <P>There is clear evidence also that social conditions in homes or in certain areas generally result in lots of young people being brought up as potential offenders. The solution we have at present is to lock them away, which is no solution at all. Locking people away in Loughan House, where there are at present 20 young criminals each costing £28,000 a year, does not constitute a solution because inevitably when they are released they are back to square one.  It is my honest belief that if one locks 16 or 17 fifteen-year-olds away together one is only breeding crime. What happens in a place such as Loughan House where there are 20 young people together, all of the same age group?  With the same interests, subject to peer pressures, they become even more expert at crime and its various methods.  I found there were two young boys there from Cork whose case history was this: one belonged to a family of 20 and his mother was alive.  The other boy belonged to a family of six and his father was alive.  The mother and father were cohabiting. Those two children are in Loughan House and there are two more expected in this family of 26 before too long.  If we do not do something about social conditions which are allowing the problem to fester then it can be contended that the people of this nation are not deserving of a solution.  The question of a just society or social justice is one that enters into every area, not just that of the Minister for Justice.  Until we seriously begin to tackle the problem, not merely in terms of providing money but by way of attitudes <Col N="443" /> and concern, then there can be no real solution found to the problem because we are only creating further problems for ourselves.</P>
    <P>I heard a story yesterday of five young children, aged five years, in O'Connell Street who had robbed a few handbags in a restaurant.  When gardaí caught the children and asked them what they were doing the children cried &ldquo;My mammy, my mammy&rdquo;.  When they asked &ldquo;Where is your mammy&rdquo; they replied.  &ldquo;My mammy has gone out&rdquo;.  When asked where was their daddy they replied &ldquo;He is in&rdquo;.  When the garda asked them &ldquo;In where&rdquo; they replied &ldquo;In jail&rdquo;.  These are the conditions these young children are subjected to.  The Garda cannot solve the problem alone.  Parents must be responsible for their own children.  Until discipline is enforced &mdash; which seems to be a dying art &mdash; what can one expect of such children?  At least the parents should be there to guide their children, oversee what they are doing or where they are. This attitude of allowing children to run around all over the place with nobody being responsible for them creates havoc.</P>
    <P>Another reason advanced for our present crime rate, I believe justifiably, is that of unemployment.  If people cannot get a job &mdash; there are now 148,000 such people in this country &mdash; naturally enough a lot of them become demoralised, frustrated and extremely bored.  If they are so utterly bored that they must look for a kick somewhere it would appear that a lot of them seek it through committing crime.  The way they look at it is that if they cannot get a job they might as well be employed as criminals, that will at least provide them with some little excitement in their lives.  Furthermore the problem is aggravated by having now something we have not experienced before, that is of having two generations of unemployed people in the one household.  Traditionally our safety valve was that of emigration, whenever our unemployment situation reached intolerable levels people emigrated, thereby saving us the experience of having a father and son unemployed in any one home.  Now with practically all emigration <Col N="444" /> outlets closed to us &mdash; no longer can we turn to England where they have a major unemployment problem; it is almost impossible to gain entry to Australia, and there is a chance for professional people in Canada &mdash; for the first time in the history of this State the problem is ours.  We must seek solutions to our unemployment problem.  If we cannot reach a solution, at which we all seem to be failing miserably, then the onus is on us to share the workload of the nation between all the people of the nation.  This might involve such considerations as a four-day week, for why should 90 per cent of the population be entitled to work with 10 per cent without any hope of ever getting a job?  We must accept the responsibility of seeing ourselves as all being equal and entitled to our fair share.</P>
    <P>The attitude to crime seems to have changed dramatically also in that people seem more sympathetic to the offender rather than the victim.  I say this particularly in the case of older people.  This is the Year of the Aged.  We have all heard of stories of old people being battered, their homes being broken into, being robbed and so on.  This creates enormous fears and feelings of insecurity in old people rendering their latter years hardly worth living.  On the other hand, the offender in many cases seems to get off rather lightly.  An offence such as that against an elderly person should be viewed and punished very severely indeed.  Indeed the general attitude of the Irish public to crime seems to be that the only fool in Irish society is the person who gets caught; once one does not get caught one is regarded as a hero, nobody takes any notice and one can do as one likes.  That is a very negative attitude and illustrates that our standards are ambiguous. There is one set of criteria for judging one person and another set for judging yet another person.  We must all stand up and take a more honest look at our attitude towards crime, whether it be robbery, car smashing, prostitution, whatever vandalism it may be we are talking about.  Then we must ask ourselves the big question: seeing that we have this major problem who is to blame?  We all like to blame somebody else, be it the <Col N="445" /> system, politicians, the Garda or whoever; it is always somebody else but never ourselves.  It would be very unfair of us to blame the Garda who have done an excellent job in this country over the years and have endeavoured at all times to combat and prevent crime and vandalism. Generally they care and are concerned about the level of crime and vandalism. But do we, as a people, really care about the level of crime and vandalism? For example, when one walks down a street and sees somebody being kicked does one take any notice or do anything about it?  The onus is on each and everyone of us not alone to be concerned about keeping the law but also to stand up and back up people when we see that law being broken.  Recently there was a child sniffing glue down in O'Connell Street. Somebody came along and bashed up that child.  Three or four passers-by walked past without even turning their heads.  If this is the general attitude towards crime there is little hope of finding any real solution.  So, when one is asked who is to blame one can say the three million people in the country.</P>
    <P>This is a complex problem and the solutions are complex but one of the solutions would be a change in our attitude towards the whole area of law and order.  Effective law enforcement depends on the community; the Garda on their own cannot do it.  I believe the task is too important to be left to the police alone.  This is why Deputy Mitchell has suggested a Garda reserve.  In the past you did not need a Garda reserve because you had a natural Garda reserve around you.  The people had confidence in and co-operated with the police.  The people are now blasé, lackadaisical and passive and to a large extent preoccupied with themselves.  If they will not do something on their own initiative then you must appeal to those who will do it on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>With such a small population of 3.5 million and with money so badly needed, while we know or hope that more gardaí will be recruited in the very near future we cannot invest the whole of the nation's money in the Department of Justice.  Last year every garda cost the State on average <Col N="446" /> £13,000.  When one considers this one sees the need for a voluntary group who would form a reserve and undertake such duties as traffic control or street patrolling with policemen or perhaps answer phones or perform some clerical work.  If this help is available to be tapped on a voluntary basis is there need for the State to put unnecessary money into providing it?  We tend to become a very State-dependent people; some think they must get everything from the State and that it must be free.  They do not like to have to pay for something with their own money. Any more encouragement towards dependence on the State would be a step in the wrong direction.  The State cannot afford it when its resources are consumed in providing services, handouts and so on.  Why not tap this resource that is available and get the community involved as they should be in upholding the law?</P>
    <P>In a city like Dublin, where almost one-third of the population reside, it has become in recent years almost as one sees on films and television, a concrete jungle. When you have a concrete jungle there is lack of space, of facilities and of amenities. There is little room to vent aggression and anger and other emotions safely. When people live in such a tight community you will have more crime than in a rural community.</P>
    <P>I remember attending a prisoners' rights meeting where one lad told me he had been in jail from the time he was 19 until he was 29.  He had been in and out during that period and he was then 30 and this was the longest period he had been out of jail &mdash; one year.  I asked what motivated him towards crime.  He said the reason was that he was brought up in Sean MacDermott Street where the people never had any property and never would have.  They hated property and resented other people having it and were bitter with them.  He said it was different with me, that I was brought up in a rural community in a small town and was taught to respect neighbours and neighbours' property.  His way of life was the result of the situation in which he found himself.  He said: &ldquo;I cannot tell you that I will not be up in Mountjoy again in six months' time &mdash; I hope not.&rdquo; It seemed <Col N="447" /> to me a disease like that of an alcoholic or a chronic smoker being dealt with one day at a time.  I felt that was a very sad situation.</P>
    <P>It seems that 90 per cent of crime is against property and 10 per cent against people.  There is a more tolerant attitude growing in our society towards crime against property &mdash; perhaps because we are more materialistic and have more material goods than ever before and we do not appreciate them so much.  If crime is to decrease our attitude to crime aginst property must become unequivoval.  We must decide whether crime against property is a serious crime or whether we need not worry so long as our own cars or houses or windows are not involved.</P>
    <P>Discipline in our society generally has been eroded over many years.  The Minister or the Department of Justice cannot be blamed for that; I blame all of us.  It is much easier to spoil a child than to discipline a child.  We like to think we are a liberal society and, if we are, that we must give the children what they want and let them do as they wish and never say no.  I thought this was a great idea when I was a teacher trainee, but when I became a teacher I found it was much easier to be lax with the children and let them do as they wished and learn if they would and much harder on the individual to discipline them.  The only reason you discipline anybody is for his own good in the long run.  We should bring the disciplinary code back into all sections of our society, not only for children but into the world of work where unpunctuality, absenteeism and so on have become major problems.  That should be the message to our whole society.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister for Justice to treat this as a serious problem.  Crime levels are important because safety on our streets and in our homes is a hallmark of the quality of life.  Let it not be said of the Minister that he was responsible for a deterioration in the quality of Irish life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedBrennan" hpid="Mr. N. Brennan Mr. N. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker is right in saying that this is a serious problem.  The committee set up by Dublin Corporation to study the level of <Col N="448" /> lawlessness and vandalism in the city showed that the cost of vandalism to the city in 1981 was £4 million.  Probably that only covered the claims that were put forward: we do not know of the others. That was a staggering sum of money for one year and and great use could have been made of it.  I heard some of the previous speakers talk about the causes of crime and vandalism.  It is a mistake to think that these are peculiar to deprived areas of the city.  That is not so.  The studies to which I refer proved that there is as much lawlessness and vandalism in Foxrock, Blackrock and elsewhere as in the centre city and the deprived areas.  It is well to kill that myth at the outset.  The whole swing of society in recent years seems to be in favour of those who commit crime rather than towards those against whom the crimes are committed. It is time that society considered the victim rather than the criminal.</P>
      <P>One of the failures in this matter which I see is that everybody seems to be rushing to the aid of the person who committed the crime rather than to the victim. We should think of the victim.  It is a sad state of affairs that in this city we have what is commonly known as &ldquo;no go&rdquo; areas and it is not safe even for the police to go into them.  There has been a lot of talk about a reserve police force but I believe the police force we have is adequate if the public give them the support they are entitled to.</P>
      <P>There has been a serious drop in recruitment to the Garda during the past year.  The level of recruitment during the past year was approximately 125 gardaí. That is not sufficient to cope with the normal everyday wastage in the force. The new Minister for Justice expects to have 600 to 800 gardaí on the beat within the next 12 months.  The answer to the problem is more gardaí and more foot patrols throughout the city and throughout the country.  I know what the problem is in Dublin.  There is no use saying that anybody has escaped it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The courts should be stiffer in their dealings with people who commit crimes. There are too many do-gooders going around talking about the background of <Col N="449" /> the people who commit crime.  Years ago people had the same problems as those people and they were not as affluent as people are today but those problems were not as common as they are today. I blame the judges for their leniency in regard to the people who commit those crimes.  The bail question should be looked into because people who are being let out on bail are committing the same crimes while they are on bail.  All those matters will have to be examined.</P>
    <P>People should have respect for the Garda.  This has been dwindling in recent years.  Squad cars are not the answer because they cover only a larger area every couple of hours and the police presence is missing.  There must be a police presence on our streets in our cities and suburban areas.  It is important that our police force work among the communities in the different areas in which they live.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about Loughan House.  I make no apology for saying that there is not a sufficient number of Loughan Houses into which to put those young people who commit crime. This would cut down the rate of crime. The public are waiting for the Government to be seen to act responsibly.  The law and order question was a very common issue during the recent election campaign. It was nearly as prominent as jobs and the economic situation.  I found in canvassing from door to door that people were very worried about law and order and some were terrified.  They locked their doors at night and were afraid to open them.  There are some elderly people in the city who have their windows barred and are afraid to open their doors. The situation is so bad that if something happens in them it is a great problem to get in to those people.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as cheap security. Money spent on the police force is money well spent.  There is no use talking about economic development and attracting foreign investment if there are not sufficient police and a low level of vandalism, because foreign investors will not invest here.  They look at those matters before they invest their money.  I am afraid that when foreign investors look at <Col N="450" /> the level of lawlessness throughout the country at the moment they will be very reluctant to invest their money here. There should be no running away from this problem.  If we need an extra 1,000 or 2,000 gardaí we should get them because it is the public who will pay at the end of the day.  They are already paying for damage to their property so they might as well pay for extra gardaí to protect that property.</P>
    <P>Many parents are running away from their responsibilities.  They do not care where their children are when they are out at night and they do not care what time they come in at.  Approximately £600 million a year is spent on alcohol so much of the problem must lie in that area. We are living in a society where law and order seem to be breaking down.  People do not seem to be afraid of the police any more.  I remember the time when a garda came along a street and a young lad was doing something he should not be doing he ran out of the way of the garda.  That does not happen any more.  Crime pays today.  The sooner we realise that the better.  As long as we keep our heads in the sand saying that crime does not pay the less we will do about it.  I hope that the Minister will spell out on television, radio and in the other news media to the parents and the public at large their responsibilities in relation to crime.  The parents do not seem to be living up to their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>It is also important to go into the secondary schools and talk to the pupils about crime.  The Minister has made a good start.  I do not accept that Templemore can hold only 300 gardaí at a particular time.  There are ample police barracks throughout the country where gardaí can be trained.  There are about six military barracks in and around this city where gardaí can be trained.  I hope this is the year of action when we will see more police in the streets and more sentences to fit the crimes so that this city will be safe for people to walk around and do their business unmolested, where elderly people will not be afraid to open their doors at night and where it will not be a city of muggings, rapes and robbings like Skid Row in America.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" /> I do not know if a reserve police force is the answer.  I do not believe the Garda would welcome a reserve police force.  I believe the Garda are able to do the job if they get the support of the public and the courts and sufficient back up services. I am satisfied that if the public support the Garda this problem will be controlled.</P>
    <P>I have heard much talk about extra police cars.  Anybody who keeps the law and respects it does not have to worry about extra powers for the Garda.  It is only the people who commit crimes who worry about extra powers for the Garda. I reject statements made about the Garda having too much power.  We must back up the Garda if we are to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on making a good start.  We want to get it into the heads of the public and the people who commit crimes that crime does not pay and that tougher sentences, jails, Loughan House and whatever other measures are necessary to be taken will be taken by the Government so that the crime problem will be solved urgently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBellew" hpid="Mr. Bellew Mr. Bellew">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bellew</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that Deputy Mitchell should table a motion of this nature.  I say this because, though Minister for Justice until quite recently, he did not during his time in office declare the emergency in relation to crime that he is seeking now.  I heard Deputy Mitchell speak on several occasions on radio and television programmes and far from wanting to take measures to curb crime, the course of action in which he was engaged was tantamount to encouraging the &ldquo;Bugsy Malones&rdquo; of this world to go out and commit more crime.  The whole attitude of the people opposite seemed to be to pander to the do-gooders who believe that crime is symptomatic of the society in which we live and that we should not be too hard on the criminal. I do not accept that philosophy.  The punishment should be made to fit the crime and I support those who call for the amendment of the law in the context of the granting of bail.  The situation in this <Col N="452" /> regard contributes enormously to the repeated commission of crime because irrespective of how many times the people concerned come before either the District Court or the Circuit Court they will be given a minimum sentence and that covers all the crimes they have committed. Therefore, so far as they are concerned the old motto that crime does not pay does not apply.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has moved an amendment proposing the deletion of certain aspects of this resolution, particularly to delete the reference to the consideration of establishing a Dublin Garda reserve.  There are echoes in the proposal to establish such a reserve of a similar episode during Deputy Cooney's tenure of office in a previous administration. He and the former Deputy Cosgrave embarked on a similar type of course in relation to other matters but that never saw the light of day because the people indicated their abhorrence of any such measure.</P>
      <P>The Garda are capable of dealing with the situation provided the necessary amendments are made in the law to allow them to make their inquiries and to ensure that, convictions having been secured, those who have committed the crimes will be put out of circulation and not be left in a position to commit further crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Conroy Report was produced quite some time ago but at the time of its introduction it led to a good deal of misgiving in relation to the Garda.  I am not suggesting that the force should be expected to work without receiving proper remuneration but they could carry out an examination in relation to their previous role as a role that was regarded as a vocation and one that was respected to a much greater extent then than now by the community.  An advance towards community policing by the Garda and the return to the old situation of the neighbourhood garda who was known by all the people in the area would go a long way towards eliminating many of the difficulties with which society must contend today.  As Deputy Brennan said, in the past people knew the names and the addresses of the gardaí and respected <Col N="453" /> them.  I doubt if that is the situation in many areas today.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to approach the Commissioner of the Garda on the basis that there should be a change from the approach of the Garda by way of greater involvement by them on an individual basis within the community rather than to be seen merely passing in squad cars.  In that way their jobs would be made easier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister considers it necessary to amend this motion.  Whether we declare a crime emergency in the Dublin metropolitan area is irrelevant because we all know that there is a crime emergency in this area.  It is time that we moved away from these public relations exercises, stopped burying our heads in the sand and faced up to the reality.  The sooner we do that the better.</P>
      <P>This emergency situation cannot be said to be totally the fault of Fianna Fáil, though they have contributed to it greatly down through the years mainly because of their attitudes towards the law, their scant regard for law and order and their own history in this connection.  I am talking about recent history as opposed to going back to civil war history.  However, leaving that aside, I am pleased to learn that the Taoiseach said recently that he will not interfere with the Garda.  That is a welcome innovation.</P>

      <P>The blame that can be apportioned to Fianna Fáil relates to the economic situation.  One of the main problems has been the failure to provide proper housing for what is the fastest-growing population in all of western Europe.  There has not been proper planning, and, consequently, not enough jobs created.  In many cases people find themselves in trouble with the law solely because of the environment in which they live.  These are people who fall easily into the hands of the criminal.  In the case of drug abuse people who are vulnerable are being roped in by the godfathers who have no morals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> When Fianna Fáil were returned to power in 1977 they had a golden opportunity of doing something about this whole area of crime.  Instead of borrowing money which they wasted they should have provided proper accommodation for the people and more jobs for them. Had this been done we would not have the degree of crime that we have today.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to turn this motion into a political issue but in my constituency during the election campaign the question of crime was singled out to be kicked about politically.  Perhaps the fact that I was related to the then Minister for Justice resulted in my being singled out as a TD and accused of not doing anything about the major problems of law and order despite the fact that our party had been in Government for only seven months.  Yet, those peopole said that within months of being elected to Government they would have many additional gardaí on the ground&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I regret Fianna Fáil are making a political football out of this serious issue.  The sooner we get down to dealing with it the better.  There is a good deal of merit in the second part of our motion.  As this is the first occasion I have had an opportunity in the House of meeting the Minister since his appointment I should like to wish him well.  The Minister should consider establishing a Dublin <Col N="455" /> Garda reserve force.  The system that operates in London should be given a trial run and if the Minister does not take that suggestion seriously he will find that there will be a big increase in the number of vigilante groups.  In my constituency many such groups have been established. A residents association in my constituency operate a vigilante group in an organised and proper way but I am nervous about the development of such groups.</P>

      <P>I would welcome any strengthening of the law, particularly in relation to bail.  When a former Minister for Justice, Mr. Ó Moráin, was closing down police stations and taking gardaí off foot patrols Fine Gael opposed that move as the record will show.  One of the problems we have is that in many instances gardaí within the community do not relate well to the community or, perhaps, the community do not relate well to the gardaí.  That is meant as a constructive comment and a non-political one.  In the course of a reply to a parliamentary question of mine the Minister stated that the average salary of gardaí last year was £13,000 and the figure goes up to the salary of the Commissioner at £28,700. That indicates that gardaí are in receipt of pay which is greater than the average industrial wage and means that gardaí are not likely to be living in some parts of the city such as the area I represent.  Consequently, they will not know very much about people living in those communities. I am not accusing anybody of not having sensitivity towards a particular community but that fact, coupled with the complaints which are made to public representatives from time to time, indicates that in areas where crime is high the <Col N="456" /> relationship between the Garda and the community is not what it should be.  It may be due to the fact that the Garda do not come from the same social background or because of historical factors.</P>
      <P>I would like to see a strengthening of the relationship between the community and the Garda.  The community should be made aware of the difficulties the Garda face and the Garda should have a greater understanding of the problems of the community they are protecting.  It is wonderful to think that a very high percentage of the Garda do an exceptional job.  They put their lives at risk on many occasions and I should like to pay tribute to them for that.  However, we cannot spend all our time patronising.  There is a problem and if a small percentage of the Garda have difficulty relating to the community they serve that could have the effect of creating a wrong impression. The Garda and the community should be brought together under a community council so that they can get to understand each other's role and difficulties.  I am not making that statement as a criticism of anybody because the same could be said of people from different professional backgrounds.  I do not wish to be misinterpreted because we all have the greatest respect for the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the election a development association in my constituency called a public meeting to deal with the problem of vandalism and it was attended by the biggest crowd I ever saw at a public meeting in my short few years in public life. The crowd was so big that a public address system had to be erected outside the hall.  I heard people tell the meeting that when they got off the bus coming from work they clutched their handbags and ran as fast as they could until they reached their hall door.  It is terrible to hear people making such a complaint.  I accept that all Members are concerned about this problem but it is time we did something about it.  Lip service is not enough.  There is a need for action.  If the Minister disagrees with the wording of the motion I suggest that he put his own suggestions for tackling the problem to the House.  We will give the Minister whatever support he needs to tackle this <Col N="457" /> problem but it is not good enough for him to say he will not accept part of our motion if he does not outline his proposals. The Minister should bring forward proposals at an early date.  It is not good enough to make a fine speech at a Garda conference.  Action is required and until there is action we will continue to raise this matter here.</P>
    <P>I note that The Workers Party at their Ard Fheis decided against giving the Garda any more powers.  We must have a balance in society but that balance is tilted the other way and criminals are far too much favoured as things stand.  I would welcome any change, particularly a change in the law in relation to bail and other rights such as the right to silence which suspects enjoy.  However, we must temper that change with balance to ensure that the democratic rights of individuals are not removed altogether.  I hope the Minister's inaction in this area in recent times is not purely political and because his Government must depend on the three The Workers Party Deputies. I hope he is not playing politics.</P>

The Minister can get his civil servants to write fine speeches for him but the problem will continue and we will continue to press for a solution to it.  We want more than mirror and public <Col N="458" /> relations exercises.  We want action of the sort we took when in Government.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I hope that because of the debate which has taken place here tonight and which is ongoing, those who have a role to play outside the law enforcement area and outside the elected representatives, particularly the Judiciary, will take note of the public concern, especially in relation to drug abuse.

      <P>The people of the town of Dungarvan and the surrounding district were deeply shocked by the announcemnt last week of this closure.  On last Wednesday, 28 April, the Pfizer Company announced their intention of closing, in July next, the magnesite plant at Ballynacourty, Dungarvan, County Waterford, with the loss of 140 jobs and a further loss of 17 jobs at their quarry in Bennettsbridge, County Kilkenny, together with as many as 40 jobs in CIE.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will continue.  The announcement came as an absolute shock to the work force, as well as to the inhabitants of the district.  The work force had no forewarning of the impending closure and feel deeply aggrieved that they were not consulted, although the Department of Industry and Energy and the IDA had, apparently, been told of the decision three weeks earlier.  There is utter dissatisfaction amongst the workers and their unions at the manner of the announcement. Most of the work force have been with the company since it commenced operations at Ballynacourty twelve years ago.  They feel they deserve better treatment, by way of consultation, for their service and loyalty, especially in view of the handsome profits reported to have been made by the company in that period.</P>
      <P>I would be extremely interested to know if the Minister will ascertain the profits made in those twelve years by the company.  We only hear about the losses, but are led to believe that there were substantial profits made.  It is only fair that the public, and especially the work force, should be made aware of those profits.  Will the Minister fully investigate the proposed closure to see if there is any possible manner in which the operation can be made viable in the foreseeable future?</P>
      <P>The company state that the rising fuel oil costs have made the plant's production of magnesite non-competitive.  It is just possible that the use of natural gas from the national grid&mdash;that is, from the Kinsale gas field &mdash; together with the quarrying of the dolomite which is known to be on the site, could reverse that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the plant cannot be made profitable, we ask for an alternative industry, possibly on the site.  A magnificent fresh water supply is available, of two million gallons per day, plus a special railway connection, and the site would be suitable for a variety of industries.  In this <Col N="460" /> regard, the company have an obligation to their employees to assist in setting up another industry.  It could well be that they could transfer some other section of their multinational operation to Dungarvan. We would also ask the IDA to press ahead with projects such as the Sterling Drug Company enterprise for Dungarvan which, hopefully, will give valuable alternative employment.</P>
    <P>Dungarvan have suffered heavily in the last few years, due to the reduction in the number of employees in Irish Leathers and also in the Waterford Co-operative Society.  We in Dungarvan and west Waterford are not satisfied that the IDA have made a sufficiently strong effort to attract new industry and provide new jobs.  There has been a lot of ballyhoo, many public announcements, press publicity, but very little creativeness where jobs are concerned, We want more action in this regard.</P>
    <P>Above all, if the plant cannot be kept open indefinitely, we want production to continue until at least the end of the year, to enable alternative employment to be found for the workforce.  That is not too much to ask.  The closure is due to take place in July.  We ask that the company continue operation of the plant until the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The loss of this factory to Dungarvan would be catastrophic.  Not only will 140 jobs be lost directly, but many more in service industries such as Radley Engineering, other local engineering metal works and electrical contractors, as well as general merchants.  A provincial town such as Dungarvan cannot sustain such a loss, hence the absolute necessity for a replacement industry.  The Quigley Magnesite industry paid out £1½ million annually in wages and salaries, plus another £3½ million in company contracts and purchases in the locality, while the operation is estimated at having been worth £1½ million to CIE per annum.</P>
    <P>Firstly, we want the Minister to make every possible effort to save the industry, and, failing this, to extend its life until a replacement industry can be found for the employees affected.  Even before this threatened closure was announced, unemployment in County Waterford had <Col N="461" /> doubled over the past two years.  More immediately, we ask the Minister to meet a deputation of workers and unions to discuss the problems involved.  I would ask him, if at all possible, to arrange such a meeting this week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Waterford) Mr. Gallagher (Waterford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> As my colleague, Deputy Deasy, has stated, the impact on the decision to close Quigley Magnesite at Bennettsbridge will have a serious effect on business in the Dungarvan area generally and in Waterford as a whole.  It has been stated in relation to Waterford that there appears to be a very blasé attitude of mind on the part of the Government where that city is concerned, in relation to jobs and the provision of industry.  The Quigley Magnesite has been a very profitable industry for the past 12 years and now, for reasons of recession or other reasons best known to the Pfizer multi-national company, they are pulling out and leaving a hole in the ground in Bennettsbridge.  They will be responsible for the closure of an industry which gives a substantial income to CIE, with a consequent loss of approximately 170 jobs, including the ancillary services affected by the closure of this plant.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to answer some questions.  One, in particular, is were the IDA in consultation with the company prior to the announcement of the closure and, if so, why did the IDA not contact the union?  The management had no consultation with the unions prior to the announcement of closure.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister clarify a statement made in relation to the Waterford Co-operative which was published in the local press to the effect that Waterford Co-operative were engaged in a substantial investment expansion programme which would provide in the region of 200 jobs?  It was not clarified whether these 200 jobs would apply to the Dungarvan area or to the operation of the Waterford Co-op, which ranges all over the south-east.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should meet the unions and public representatives to see if anything can be done to keep Quigley Magnesite <Col N="462" /> in business or to see whether a replacement could be found to operate in Dungarvan.  There is one factor which I am somewhat reluctant to bring up in the Dáil.  There is a suspicion among some people in the workforce in Dungarvan about the reasons for the closure being other than financial.  Was there some medical aspect to the question as to why, after 12 years' profit making, this company decided to pull out?  I would welcome answers to these questions.  There are an awful lot of rumours flying around Dungarvan and these rumours should be nailed once and for all.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of adding my voice to the appeal which has already been made to do something with regard to the situation in Dungarvan.  Quigley Magnesite commenced operations in Dungarvan 12 years ago.  At that time there was a tremendous welcome given to the company, which promised to give much greater employment than they actually gave.  We expected it was going to be of a permanent nature and the company got tremendous co-operation from the local authority and the State with regard to aid and from CIE in the provision of a railway line to operate between Bennettsbridge and their plant in Dungarvan.  Having got this tremendous co-operation from all concerned, we expected the company to treat their employees better than they have done on this occasion.  We realise they gave good employment during the years they were in operation, despite the fact that the job potential first announced was never realised.  However, I think it was very high-handed of the company to make a decision to close without having any consultation with the unions representing the workers.  This has left a very bad taste in the mouths of the workers of Quigley Magnesite which could create bad industrial relations with other industries as well.  The workers who have given such loyal service to the company over a period of 12 years deserve to be treated in a better manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also ask the company, and the Minister should use his influence with them, to show some recognition of the co-operation <Col N="463" /> they got in the setting up and running of the plant.  They owe it to the State, and to the Dungarvan area in particular, to see that this closure should not take place now.  It was mentioned that they had made a good profit over the years.  I do not know their situation with regard to profit and loss but I ask the Minister to investigate it.  The company should at least continue in operation until the end of the year in order of give everybody a chance to see what could be achieved during that time, whether there would be a chance for the industry to survive or to get a replacement industry for the area.  Unemployment in Waterford in general is at a very high level and, while we sincerely welcome the efforts of the IDA in the Waterford area, nevertheless their success is not as great as we would like it to be.  Due to the efforts of the IDA we got a number of new factories into Dungarvan and west Waterford but they have not given the employment we expected.  It is not just the 140 workers in Quigley Magnesite who are affected, there will be a loss in other firms which supply the needs and requirements of this company.  There is also the loss of Bennettsbridge and the loss within CIE. Therefore it is a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting in Dungarvan with my colleagues recently and I found grave unrest and dissatisfaction among the workers at the way in which they were being treated.  They are seeking information, to which they are entitled, with regard to the profit or loss-making situation of this company.  It is wrong that the workers have been treated as shabbily as they have been on this occasion.  I urge the Minister to use whatever influence he can to rectify the situation, even at this late stage, and to show some regard for all concerned by extending their operation at least to the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my voice to the appeal made here by the previous speakers that the Minister will do everything in his power to ensure that the hardships that have been caused by reason of the proposed closure of Quigley Magnesite will be alleviated.  It appears <Col N="464" /> that very little, if any, account has been taken of the social implications and upheavals of decisions of firms like this. Quigley Magnesite are part of the Pfizer Corporation, one of the biggest in the world, and it amazes me that they can make decisions such as this that have such devastating effects on an area.  As representing the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency, I know of the effects it will have in Bennettsbridge.  The 17 job losses there will have, proportionately, as heavy an effect on the community as the 140 jobs in Dungarvan.  Tyre remoulding firms, engineering industries and many others that service the plant in Bennettsbridge will suffer consequential job losses because of the lack of business.  I appeal to the Minister to do everything in his power to ensure there is a full investigation to see if this plant could be kept open.  The other disturbing factor is that the produce that was coming out of Dungarvan will now be substituted by imports.  That will create a serious impact on our balance of payments and will have a further serious effect on our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the comments which have been made by my colleagues from Waterford and Kilkenny. The most frightening aspect of this announcement is the manner in which the workers were treated.  These men have given loyal service to the plants at Dungarvan and Bennettsbridge, to a company we were led to believe made quite a sizeable profit in their operations during those years.  I appeal to the Minister to meet the deputation as soon as possible to discuss the future of this plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleagues in Waterford will forgive me if I dwell particularly on the plant in Kilkenny.  A very good case has been made for the Waterford plant and I do not wish to be divisive, but the effect of the Kilkenny closure has been disastrous for the work force and throughout the entire Bennettsbridge area.  In that area in recent times a number of firms have closed down, all small firms.  Therefore, nearly all the labour force in the area are unemployed.  When at work they were impeccable from the point of view of industrial relations &mdash; they had a magnificent <Col N="465" /> record down through the years. While the Bennettsbridge plant was in operation I do not think one day was lost because of industrial strife, something that cannot be said for other work forces throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister try to persuade the American company to postpone closure for at least 12 months so that the possibility of saving the company can be considered.  If that cannot be achieved, the postponement would give the IDA an opportunity to consider the establishment of alternative industries in both Bennettsbridge and Dungarvan.</P>
    <P>Seventeen jobs have been mentioned in connection with the Kilkenny plant. However, the material was transported to Dungarvan by CIE: the railway line to Dungarvan was opened specifically for this purpose.  Indeed a mile of new line was laid at a huge initial capital cost to CIE.  They will now be unable to recover that cost.  There are ten railway crossing gates on that line and when the line has been closed those jobs, too, will be lost if the plant cannot be kept in operation. I think the loss of revenue will be £1.5 million per annum to CIE.</P>
    <P>The work force at Bennettsbridge have been informed that they will be made redundant on 11 June although the work force in Dungarvan have been told they will be kept on until the end of July.  That is unfair discrimination against the Bennettsbridge workers and I ask the Minister at least to ensure that both groups of workers will be treated equally, that if redundancy cannot be avoided both groups will be paid off on the same day. At the very least, I hope the Minister will be able to persuade the company to keep the two plants in operation for 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time available to me I hope to cover all points made.  I have listened very carefully to what the Deputies have said.  Like them, I regret that Quigley Magnesite have found it necessary to discontinue their operations at Dungarvan and Bennettsbridge, making a total of 157 workers redundant.  I fully appreciate the social impact in any area when a sizeable number of workers <Col N="466" /> are let go.  I assure all Deputies that I will not spare any effort to do what I can, but first of all I should like to put the background of this affair into perspective so that Deputies will be made aware of what has happened.</P>
      <P>The press statement of the company referred to the closure of the operation. My understanding of the situation from those investigating the matter on behalf of my Department and the IDA is that the company are mothballing the plant to cover the remote possibility of an unexpected upturn in the market.  As we all know, the product produced by the company is low grade and its success depends on a healthy steel industry to use up the product.  I am reaffirming what I heard in Europe yesterday, when there was a full day's discussion on the steel industry and industrial strategy, when I say that the prospects for an upturn in the steel industry before the mid eighties, at the earliest, are very remote.</P>
      <P>In relation to unemployment, I share the concern of the Deputies here.  Every effort will be made by me and the IDA to try to create as many jobs as possible. We are going full stretch in relation to the retention of jobs.  Nobody should be under any illusion about the efforts being made in a very difficult situation.  A number of European Ministers for Industry around the table yesterday were faced with the problem of 11 million people unemployed in Europe without any immediate short-term solution.  I would be less than honest if I said otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should have been glad to hear of the extension when I opened it.  I am sure he would have been delighted about that.  Deputy Deasy would be glad if I could go down to Dungarvan next week to make a similar announcement.  However, the closure of the Dungarvan plant is being done in a phased basis in the next three months with only a minimal reduction in the work force during that period.  Quarrying <Col N="467" /> operations at Bennetsbridge have ceased already, I understand from Deputy Aylward, but I understand the employees will be retained for about six weeks during the run down operations.  A sister company at Tivoli in Cork which makes refractory equipment for the steel industry and which is part of this organisatin, will not be affected, I understand, by the closure of the Dungarvan plant.</P>
      <P>My Department and the IDA first became aware of the company's intention to discontinue operations in Dungarvan on 5 April last, when a senior representative of the company telephoned the managing director of the IDA to say that they planned to make an announcement in Cork on the following day, 6 April, that they proposed to close the plant.  I heard about it late in the afternoon of 5 April and immediately took steps to try to arrest the closure.  That was the only notice we got.  We were told that afternoon that market conditions were such that the company could buy their requirements of magnesite on the open market at a lower price than the cost of producing it in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Following strong representations from my Department and the IDA, involving a lengthy meeting on 6 April with senior management of the Quigley Corporation, the group reluctantly agreed on 7 April to postpone any announcement for three weeks in order to enable the IDA and my Department to have the position evaluated by reference to detailed studies which the company had made.  This evaluation was intended to establish if a reasonable basis could be found for continuing the operation.  It was recognised that if the evaluation showed that there was no realistic alternative to closure this would have to be accepted, and that the possibility of getting a new project for Dungarvan would be pursued vigorously. The evaluation by the IDA was undertaken with the assistance of one of my Department's professional officers, a chemical engineer who had experience in magnesite projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conclusions reached were as follows: One, the magnesite manufactured by the company was being sold to a <Col N="468" /> decreasing market as the use of refracttories in steel making had declined due to the very severe recession in the industry. Magnesite can be made elsewhere from superior ore bodies with lower energy input and plants responsible for their production have captured the market; two, the magnesite produced by the company has inherent manufacturing disadvantages and it is difficult to say how these could be overcome.</P>
    <P>The evaluation also found that the only solution to the company's problems is the finding of magnesite adjacent to the plant.  That would take several years to prove and to develop, even if it were found.  That is why we put forward the alternative of putting the plant into mothballs until such time as that possibility could be considered.  The removal of a good deal of the cost of the burden of energy &mdash; 60 per cent of the cost of this product is represented by energy &mdash; would mean supplying the company with natural gas at about 10p a therm which would require a subsidy of £10 million in a two-year period while arrangements were being made to supply them with gas.</P>
    <P>That is the size of the problem facing us in relation to Dungarvan: it would take a £10 million subsidy for two years to keep that plant open and then we would be trying to sell in a depressed market which is shrinking all the time.  I am satisfied that the competitive disadvantage under which the company has been operating for some time in such that there is not a realistic alternative to discontinuing manufacture.  I have asked the IDA in the circumstances to give special attention to the possibility of attracting a new project to Dungarvan to provide alternative employment for those affected.</P>
    <P>I have said that the steel industry is in serious decline and indications are that it will not be out of recession until the mid-eighties.  When we looked at the total evaluation, I regret to say there was not a serious alternative to closure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy asked me about the profits of the company.  As he knows, they are a private company and that information is not available to me.  I regret that the workers were not consulted <Col N="469" /> but if it had not been for the action of the IDA and my Department the whole undertaking would have been closed down immediately.  I will repeat to the management what I have already said to them, that the social implications for the work force are very serious.</P>
    <P>I was asked to receive a deputation.  I explained to Deputy Deasy that I am not flying away from deputations.  In the short time I have been in the Department I do not think any Minister has received more deputations: Deputy Pattison will be aware that even on a Saturday afternoon I received a deputation.  However, next week I am engaged in a promotion tour for the IDA in Europe, a very worthy exercise.  If I could be here next week I would receive the deputation.  I will do so at the first available opportunity.  I have lists of deputations lined up in the book.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" /> I repeat that we did not spare any effort to do what we could.  Deputy Gallagher made a point about the medical aspect. I am not aware of it but I will investigate it if the Deputy would fill me in on the details later.  I do not know about any rumours in circulation.  I will also consider the matter of the Waterford Co-op. I had no advance notice of it and therefore the information is not available to me.</P>
    <P>In relation to similar industries, there have been many closures in other areas. A lot of this product is used in Eastern bloc countries, but the free market for it has decreased rapidly.  All we could do in the circumstances was to defer the closure. We have asked the company if possible to put an alternative industry there.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 May 1982.</P>

As, however, the claimant's husband had been employed in the United Kingdom for 20 years up to 1975, the relevant papers have been forwarded to the Department of Health and Social Security, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, so that her title to a British widow's pension may be considered.  She requested, on 7 April <Col N="313" /> 1982 that her entitlement to non-contributory widow's pension from my Department be examined.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The control of urban land costs presents formidable legal and administrative difficulties.  The basic issue raised by proposals based on the Kenny Report is one of constitutionality &mdash; any attempt to acquire land at less than full market value runs the risk of infringing the property rights guaranteed by the Constitution.  I am asking the Attorney General to examine the general legal and constitutional issues which arise from the Kenny Report so that an up-to-date opinion, taking account of recent important judgments by the High Court and the Supreme Court on relevant aspects of the Constitution, will be available to me in assessing the options on this matter.  In the meantime the Government have acted to deal with exorbitant profits from dealings in building land and have ensured that a considerable amount of the windfall gains resulting from the provision of services by local authorities are returned to the community.  A capital gains tax rate of 50 per cent on gains from disposals of development land was announced in the recent budget.  This is 5 per cent higher than the rate proposed in the Coalition's budget.  In addition, gains within one year of acquisition will be liable at a new 60 per cent rate for such short-term gains and there will be restrictions on certain reliefs hitherto available.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that an increase in the supply of serviced land is a vital corrective element in regard to urban land prices.  To achieve this it is necessary to provide sufficient resources for the servicing of land.  This year I am allocating £87.4 million for public water and sewerage schemes &mdash; an increase of over 30 per cent on last year's provision of £66.98 million for public schemes and an increase of £7.4 million on what was proposed in the Coalition's budget.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will give the following information for the 12 months of 1981 for each local authority (a) the total allocation for capital account purposes based on the 1981 Estimates; (b) the amount paid for capital account purposes in 1981; and (c) the number of interim payments with the date of receipt and amount of each payment.</P>

      <P>With the permission of <Col N="318" /> the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 and 170 together.</P>
      <P>Allocations to local authorities are made in respect of capital for (i) local authority housing, (ii) house purchase, low-rise mortgage and reconstruction loans and supplementary grants and (iii) water and sewerage schemes.  Allocations are also made in respect of grants for (i) road works, (ii) environmental works and (iii) the local improvements scheme.  The 1981 allocations to local authorities for these services are set out in the form of a tabular statement which I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have circulated with the Official Report.  Advance allocations to local authorities are not made by my Department for any other service.</P>
      <P>While I am always anxious to facilitate Deputies in so far as I possibly can, the compilation of the information requested in parts (b) and (c) of the Deputy's questions would involve very considerable work.  It would entail the examination of every payment made in 1981 to over 100 local authorities for a large number of items including housing subsidy, water supply and sewerage subsidies, public water supply grants, environmental works grants, local improvements scheme grants, road works grants, malicious injuries recoupment, the grant in relief of rates, grants for the rehabilitation of travelling people, pollution control, grants for unfinished estates, fire services subsidy, recoupment of expenses in respect of the register of electors and the licensing and registration of motor vehicles, etc.  This could only be done by the redeployment for a significant period of time of staff from urgent work elsewhere in the Department which I feel could not be justified.  Following is the statement:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimates for my Department's Vote do not provide for separate allocations for individual local authorities.  The following are the sums provided in the Estimate for 1982 in respect of public water and sewerage schemes&mdash;</P>
      <P>Subhead F.1. Water supply and Sewerage, etc.  Subsidies £21,225,000.  Subhead F.3.  Public Water Supply Grants £4,000,000.  The latter figure was augmented by £1 million consequent on the provision of an additional £7.8 million capital for sanitary services in the recent budget.  In addition, in the public capital programme a global sum is provided for non-voted capital for sanitary services on the basis of which allocations may be made by my Department to local authorities during the year.  The provision for 1982, as augmented in the recent budget, is £82.4 million of which £76.4 million is for major public schemes and £4.5 million for small public schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 196 and 197 together.</P>
      <P>Before the building regulations can be brought into force it will be necessary to enact amending legislation to provide for a more flexible system of control to administer the regulations than that originally envisaged, also to enable the regulations to be used to promote energy conservation in building and to allow for the implementation of proposed EEC directives with implications for building control regulations.  The preparation of the necessary legislation is well advanced and will be introduced as soon as possible with a view to having building regulations in force by 1983.</P>
      <P>The proposed system of control to administer the regulations will be based on certification by approved certifiers, with certificates being lodged with local authorities for registration.  These local authorities will be empowered to carry out checks as they consider necessary to monitor satisfactorily the effectiveness of the control system.  They will also be empowered to order work to be stopped, altered or pulled down where they are satisfied that a contravention of the regulations will have implications for public health and safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A draft proposal for a system of control on these lines was circulated in September 1981 to interested bodies.  Discussions subsequently took place with a <Col N="330" /> number of these bodies.  Most of these discussions have been completed but some further bodies have only very recently requested meetings and these will be held in the near future.  The control system is being reviewed in the light of submissions received and a redraft is being finalised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 306 and 307 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is not possible at this stage to say exactly what additional staff and Justices may be required by the District Court consequent on the increased jurisdiction which is to be conferred on it by the Courts Act, 1981 as from 12 May <Col N="334" /> 1982, the position is that provision has been made in the Department of Justice Estimates for 1982 for the appointment of additional court staff and Justices and they will be recruited as required.  With regard to accommodation the position in Dublin is that arrangements have been made by the Office of Public Works to provide additional courtrooms and office accommodation in Dolphin House (the former Dolphin Hotel) which are expected to become available later this year.</P>
    <P>Outside Dublin the provision of accommodation is a matter for the local authorities and, if it transpires that additional office or court accommodation is needed at any court venues consequent on the introduction of the new jurisdictions, the matter will be taken up with the local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>It is not expected that the increased jurisdiction of the Circuit Court will have any great effect on its work-load because, while that Court will gain business from the High Court, it is anticipated that this will, most likely, be offset fully by a loss of business to the District Court. Arrangements are, however, being made to provide a Circuit Court Family Law Court and office accommodation in Dolphin House to cater for the new family law jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>This Government's policy and record is one of consistent commitment to the decentralisation of Government offices to provincial centres. It was announced in October 1980 that over 3,000 civil service staff would be relocated in new purpose-built office blocks in 12 provincial centres, including Galway.  Considerable progress was achieved between then and June 1981 on site acquisition, planning and design.  The incoming Government, however, placed the programme under review, and so it remained throughout their term of office. As I indicated in the House on 30 March, the present Government have reactivated the programme and arrangements are being made for its early implementation.</P>

The Clifden charge group, which includes Letterfrack exchange mentioned in the letter of 30 March to which the Deputy refers, is served by a co-axial cable to Galway.  As I indicated in reply to questions from Deputy Molloy (Official Report Vol. 333 No. 6, cols. 1053-1055), the Clifden-Galway route is served by overhead cable and much of it is over exposed country leaving the cable particularly liable to damage during bad weather.  There is, therefore, a high incidence of faults and the number of circuits in use can vary appreciable from time to time.

      <P>I propose to take Questions numbered 528 to 530 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no specific guidelines issued by my Department to health boards as regards the rates of allowances payable in respect of children placed in foster care.  The payment of such allowances is made in pursuance of Article 15 of the Boarding-Out of Children Regulations, 1954.  This article requires a health board to provide the funds necessary for the maintanance, clothing and education of any child boarded-out by it and for such <Col N="356" /> other assistance of the child as the board may consider reasonable.  Accordingly, health boards enjoy a degree of flexibility in relation to the level of support afforded to foster families.</P>
    <P>The rates of allowances paid by the respective health boards on 1 April 1981 and on 1 April 1982 are set out in the attached tabular statements.</P>
    <P>It is clear from these statements that the rates of allowances paid by the various health boards show significant variations and I agree that it would be preferable if a greater degree of uniformity in the rates were possible.  I therefore propose to ask each health board to review the position in their area towards achieving this objective to the extent that their budgetary allocations will allow.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit for the period 8 to 19 June 1981.  He was not entitled to payment however as, according to the records of my Department, he had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions, paid or credited, in 1979-80, the contribution year governing his claim. Investigations are being made as to whether the person concerned was employed during the year in question.</P>

Under statutory regulations the total of unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit and any tax refunds may not exceed 85 per cent of a claimant's average net weekly earnings in the period from 6 April up to the date of claim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit in respect of an accident at work on 21 January 1982. Following inquiries regarding the accident his claim for injury benefit was allowed from 22 January 1982.  In addition pay-related benefit was paid from 5 February 1982, thirteenth day of incapacity.</P>
      <P>The regulations governing the payment of pay-related benefit provide that when the total amount of flat-rate benefit and pay-related benefit exceed a claimant's reckonable weekly earnings in the relevant income tax year 1980-81 the rate payable shall be reduced by the amount of the excess.  The claimant's reckonable weekly earnings were £78.64.  He was therefore precluded from receiving more than this amount by way of combined payments for the period from 5 February 1982 to 3 April 1982.  The rates of flat rate injury benefit and pay-related benefit payable in this period were £75.75 and £2.89, making a combined weekly rate of £78.64.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As from 5 April 1982 the weekly flat <Col N="363" /> rate of injury benefit in this case would ordinarily be £93.85 a week but the claimant is also precluded by the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts from receiving more by way of injury benefit than the weekly amount of his pre-accident earnings from employment.  According to the information furnished by the employer and the claimant the pre-accident weekly wage was £86.48 a week.  The rate of injury benefit at present payable is therefore limited to that amount.  He is not entitled to pay-related benefit in this period.</P>

A cheque for the amount of disability benefit due for that period issued to her on 6 April 1982. She subsequently claimed and was paid maternity allowance from 16 February to 23 May 1981.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When the claim was originally being considered the available information indicated that the claimant had been employed only in this country during the relevant tax year governing his claim and his earnings from this employment were not sufficient to entitle him to pay-related benefit.  It was subsequently ascertained <Col N="365" /> that he had been employed in Britain during that year.  Under EEC regulations British earnings are regarded as reckonable for pay-related benefit purposes and may be aggregated with earnings in this country.  On this basis he qualified for payment and an adjusting cheque paying all arrears of pay-related benefit due from the commencement of the claim has now been issued to him.</P>

      <P>The claimant again claimed disability benefit from 30 November 1981 but payment was made in error to 7 January 1982.

      <P>I am not so aware.  I have made capital allocations of £1,200,000 and £1,000,000 available to Galway County Council and Galway Corporation, respectively, for major sanitary services schemes in 1982.  The allocations include appropriate provision for the financing of sewerage schemes.</P>

      <P>Since taking office I have taken steps which will ensure additional resources for local authorities, including Galway County Council.  My decision to reverse the previous Government's requirement that the full proceeds of house sales should be directed to capital purposes will have the effect of making £10,000 available to the council for general spending.  In addition, my decision to place a limit on increases in the demands made on the council in respect of arterial drainage and supplementary welfare allowances will save the council almost £354,000 this year.</P>
      <P>I have also recently made the following additional allocations of funds to Galway Councy Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Road Works &mdash; £360,000</P>
      <P>Environment Works (Youth Employment) Scheme &mdash; £220,000</P>
      <P>and I am awaiting a return from the council in relation to new housing schemes before making additional allocations for housing.  I also expect to be in a position to shortly make an additional capital allocation for sanitary services to the council.</P>

      <P>The detailed deployment of members of the Force is a matter to be decided primarily by the commissioner and the precise arrangements for policing particular local areas are made by or in consultation with the local Garda officers.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, in addition to the coverage afforded from Ballynacargy station, Legan receives attention from the district patrol car based at Granard and from the traffic corps at Longford and the task force at Mullingar.  They also state that they consider that the current strength at Ballynacargy station and the present arrangements for policing the village of Legan are adequate for the present needs of the area.  In the circumstances the allocation of a garda to Legan would not be warranted.</P>

      <P>The highest sum paid by way of overtime to a member of the Garda Síochána during the year ended 5 April 1982 was £11,589.51.  One member of the Force received overtime payments which amounted to within £500 of that sum during the same period.  Both of the members concerned were of garda rank.</P>
      <P>In both cases, it may be taken that the figures would include a sum in respect of overtime worked in the preceding year and, on the other hand, would not include a sum for overtime worked during the year but not paid for until the following year.  The amounts in question would be quite small and, roughly speaking, would cancel each other out.</P>
