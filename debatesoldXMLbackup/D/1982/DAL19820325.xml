      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to make a statement on my recent visit to the United States of America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to say that I do so solely pursuant to the offer I made yesterday favourably <Col N="464" /> to consider such a step, in order to resolve a situation which should never have arisen and, as Deputy Cluskey aptly put it, to restore some sanity to our proceedings.</P>
    <P>Accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I visited the United States from 15-17 March, in response to the kind invitation of President Reagan to meet and to join him for luncheon in the White House on St. Patrick's Day.</P>
    <P>I was glad to avail of the opportunity while in the United States to pay a visit to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Senor Perez de Cuellar, address the Economic Club of New York, hold separate discussions with Governor Carey, Senator Kennedy and other political leaders, and meet a representative group of the Friends of Ireland organisation in the United States Congress, headed by Speaker O'Neill and Congressman Foley.</P>
    <P>Accompanying the President at our meeting in the White House, were Vice-President Bush, Secretary of State Haig, the National Security Adviser, Judge Clark, and the newly designated Ambassador of the United States to Ireland, Mr. Peter Dailey.  During our discussions we had a useful exchange of views on a range of subjects, including the links between Ireland and the United States, the situation in Northern Ireland, United States investment in Ireland and aspects of international affairs.  I invited the President to pay a visit to Ireland and he indicated a keen desire to do so at a mutually convenient time.</P>
    <P>I saw my visit in the context of the intention, to which I referred here on 9 March, of seeking international backing for the Government's efforts to bring together all the parties involved in the tragedy of Northern Ireland, in an endeavour to bring about a durable settlement in a spirit of peace, reconciliation and accommodation for all the traditions in this country.  I wished to dispel any doubt or confusion that might exist on Irish Government policy and to set out clearly what that policy is.</P>
    <P>I indicated my belief that Britain should be encouraged to seek more positively and persuade more actively a <Col N="465" /> change in attitudes and outlooks which would pave the way for the unity so ardently desired by the vast majority of the Irish people.  I said that we had pledged ourselves to overcoming the obstacles to the further reconcilement of the two great traditions of our island and that, for our part, we would give, to that end, any pledge that may be sought, any guarantee that may be thought necessary and make unassailable constitutional arrangements for those in the northern part of Ireland who may feel a special need for such provisions.  I expressed the hope that the great fund of goodwill for Ireland that exists in America would enable the objectives I have mentioned to be reflected in American policy.</P>
    <P>The extent to which that ideal is already widely shared in the Congress of the United States may be seen from the St. Patrick's Day statement of the Friends of Ireland group.  I welcome the renewal of their commitment to the goal of Irish unity, through reconciliation and on the basis of consent.  Let me here welcome the declaration of support for the Friends of Ireland in America, included in the statement issued by President Reagan on the occasion of our meeting.</P>
    <P>The President's statement also contained a number of other elements that will be a source of encouragement.  I refer in particular to his words of support for the widening of Anglo-Irish co-operation instituted by my meeting with the British Prime Minister in December 1980.  The President viewed this as contributing to a process of reconciliation between the two traditions and between the two countries which he saw as the only basis for a lasting solution.  The President indicated the readiness of the United States Government to contribute in any way they can to such a solution.  He also reiterated his appeal to all Americans with Ireland's interest at heart to refrain from assisting those who perpetuate violence.  Finally, I welcome his strong and unequivocal support for American investment in Ireland &mdash; to the benefit of all our people.</P>
    <P>I know that this latter statement will be of great assistance to the Industrial Development Authority in the stepped-up campaign they are mounting to attract <Col N="466" /> industrial and services investment.  I was glad to have the opportunity, through my address to the Economic Club of New York, to inaugurate this fresh effort.  I am satisfied, and am happy to assure the House, that my speech on that occasion helped to correct the damage done by some unfortunate impressions conveyed on previous occasions and re-established Ireland as a country which offers a stable, welcoming and profitable environment for investment.</P>
    <P>My discussions with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in addition to touching on Northern Ireland, ranged over a wide range of current topics in international affairs, including the role of the United Nations generally and in peace-keeping, the Middle East, Namibia, Afghanistan, Cyprus, the hostilities between Iran and Iraq, the problems of South-East Asia, especially Kampuchea, the problems in Central America, with particular reference to El Salvador, and the Law of the Sea Conference. In the course of what was a valuable exchange, I reiterated Ireland's total commitment to the role of the United Nations in the resolution of international conflict and in the advancement of human welfare throughout the world and informed him of the Government's positive response to the request for additional Irish troops for the UNIFIL force in Lebanon.  The Secretary-General, for his part, paid tribute to the Irish commitment to the United Nations and its peace-keeping operations and to the work of Major General Callaghan, as Commander of UNIFIL.</P>
    <P>I should like to express to President Reagan and to all those I met in the United States, my deep and sincere gratitude for the warmth of the welcome, and the generosity of the hospitality extended to us in the United States.  I know that these are a token of the bonds of kinship that exist between Ireland and that great democracy.</P>
    <P>I have had copies of my speech to the Economic Club of New York, my address in the White House, the statement made by President Reagan on St. Patrick's Day and the Joint St. Patrick's Day Statement <Col N="467" /> of the Friends of Ireland laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, since I may be unable, because of the position in which I have been placed, to reply later, I will deal now with Deputy FitzGerald's comment on Tuesday last: that I did not during my visit to the United States call, in the particular manner he would have wished, on people there to refrain from support for violence or people involved in or associated with violence.  This attack is not alone without substance but was also unwise.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments here have upheld the attitude of the vast majority of our people in their opposition to violence as a means of solving the Northern or any other problem.  I made my position on the American dimension of this subject perfectly clear in a lengthy speech I made in Cork on 27 July 1980.  Each Government have enforced the necessary policies in their own way over a lengthy period.  No one can be in any doubt about our attitude and our policy.  Joint communiques issued following meetings between the Irish and British Heads of Government have almost invariably acknowledged satisfaction with the extent and effectiveness of security measures, including both occasions when I met the present Prime Minister during my previous period of office.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of judgment how often one should repeat a principle of this kind. Constant repetition may turn it into a sort of ritual cliche.  On the occasion of my visit to the United States, this time, such repetition would have been redundant, since both President Reagan and the Friends of Ireland group, on their side and as an integral part of my visit made appeals along the lines in question, in their statements: and I believe that law-abiding Americans would respond more favourably to their President and Congressional leaders than to anything I might say.</P>
    <P>Rather than repeat unprofitably something which has been clearly established already &mdash; what is purely defensive in our policy &mdash; my purpose was rather to offer a clear line of action as a positive alternative <Col N="468" /> to support for violence.  I believe that this approach will yield significant results.  Can we now get away from sterile point-scoring on this issue which may in fact do harm to the policy we all espouse by creating doubts about it in the minds of some who may not be all that familiar with our party political system?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel I must start by referring to the Taoiseach's statement that his speech to the Economics Club helped to correct the damage done by some unfortunate impressions conveyed on previous occasions &mdash; a smear by innuendo which adds nothing to his stature &mdash; and that he &ldquo;re-established Ireland as a country which offers a stable, welcoming and profitable environment for investment.&rdquo;  The suggestion that the efforts made by our Government to bring the public finances under control in some way damaged this country's reputation in the United States has been most effectively answered by an authoritative nonpolitical comment by the chairman of Allied Irish Banks reported in today's papers.  Mr. Niall Crowley said yesterday in reference to opinion in the United States, from which he returned on Tuesday, about our economy, that:</P>
      <P>Unless we can be seen to be tackling these problems, and winning, the confusion I have referred to will turn to an amazed certainty that this country is really determined to throw away all the progress we have made in the last quarter century, rather than accept the disciplines needed to conserve those gains and hold on to them when economic conditions improve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one can be in any doubt as to what these words mean.  The confusion that is disturbing confidence in our economy derives from the doubts raised by the present Taoiseach during and since the election campaign as to whether he now has the will, which he conspicuously lacked in 1980, to accept the disciplines needed to conserve the gains of the last 25 years &mdash; the disciplines which our Government were imposing, and which had already yielded concrete results in our improved standing in the eyes of financiers <Col N="469" /> and industrialists outside Ireland &mdash; until all this was cast in doubt by the Taoiseach within hours of the defeat of our January budget.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Taoiseach's visit to Washington.  I want to say at the outset how delighted I am that President Reagan in his statement, and the Friends of Ireland in theirs, condemned violence in the North and specifically asked Americans not to support violence, echoing the message brought to the United States from Ireland by elected politicians from both parts of this island throughout the past ten years.  I was very pleased also to see the emphasis given in both statements to the concept of reconciliation between the two communities in Ireland, which we, in opposition and in Government, have promoted.</P>
    <P>Let me quote briefly; first from President Reagan:</P>
    <P>Americans, who owe so much to their kinsmen of both Irish and British heritage, Protestant and Catholic alike, can never be indifferent to the problem of violence in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is why we seek to contribute in any way we can to a lasting, peaceful solution that will bring to an end years of conflict and violence.  We will continue to stand by our policy &mdash; to urge the parties in Northern Ireland to come together for a just solution and to condemn all acts of terrorism and violence. We believe a lasting solution can be found only through a process of reconciliation between the two traditions in Northern Ireland, and between Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>We stand unalterably opposed to the forces of violence and discord in Northern Ireland, which obstruct the process of reconciliation so necessary to peace. Those who advocate violence or engage in terrorism will have no welcome in the United States.</P>
    <P>Second, from the Friends of Ireland:</P>
    <P>Our special goal has been to work together in the Congress for an end to the violence in Northern Ireland and <Col N="470" /> for peace and reconciliation between the two parts of the community that has suffered so much from a decade of killing and destruction.</P>
    <P>As Friends of Ireland, we are also united in our condemnation of the violence on both sides in Northern Ireland. More than 2,100 men and women and children have died since the conflict began, and more than 23,000 have been injured.  We therefore renew our earnest appeal to our fellow Americans to support positive policies for peace, to reject the path of violence, and to refuse to participate by word or deed or dollar in any effort that supports or condones the violence.  No action in the daily life of any American should contribute in any way to the daily toll of death in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Finally, as Friends of Ireland, we renew our commitment to the goal of Irish unity as the most effective means to achieve a lasting peace.  The unity we favour is an Ireland united on the basis of reconciliation between the Irish Protestant tradition and the Irish Catholic tradition.  It is a unity to be achieved not by the bomb or by the bullet, nor by the official coercion of any section of the community, but by the consent, freely given, of a majority of all the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have to say on behalf of my party that we are less happy about the Taoiseach's contributions in Washington.  I recognise that the speech made by the Taoiseach at the luncheon given by President Reagan was, by common agreement, delivered effectively.  But I have some reservations about the content of this and other statements by the Taoiseach in Washington, some of them to the press, and also about the impact these statements have had there, and about which I have had information since.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects to my concern. The first relates to what was said.  The message of these statements appears from the reports published here, and from what I have heard from Washington, to have differed in tone from that which has been delivered in the United <Col N="471" /> States by successive Irish Taoiseachs and Ministers throughout the past decade, and from that which has been repeated on our behalf of those who have represented us at diplomatic level with such distinction and success in that country. In particular I note the reintroduction of that ambiguous phrase about &ldquo;securing self-determination for all the people of Ireland&rdquo;&mdash; a phrase used in the past to exclude the concept of reunion by consent, to which we had thought all parties were firmly committed.</P>
    <P>May I interpolate here that the extraordinary remark by the Taoiseach to the American press that he was not aware of any emphasis having been given by our diplomats in the United States to Irish unity was baseless and unworthy.  Seeking to promote Irish unity by consent, that is the policy of all Irish Governments since 1970, has been the unremitting task of the distinguished Irish diplomats who over the past decade have made such a tremendous impact in the United States &mdash; far beyond that of the much larger missions of many powerful countries.</P>
    <P>Their success is visible indeed in the considered and sophisticated approach of American political leaders today to the Northern Ireland problem, which a decade ago was simply not understood in Washington, then divided into a traditional anglophile camp &mdash; taking the Foreign Office line, whatever it might be at the time &mdash; and, as the sole alternative, straight IRA propaganda.</P>
    <P>What our diplomats have done, reinforcing the message of every Irish Government during this period, has been to displace these two propaganda forces from the Washington stage, and to replace them by a powerful body of opinion, reflected in what President Reagan and the Friends of Ireland have been saying, sympathetic to the aspiration of most Irish people to a peaceful resolution of our problem in this island by consent. This remarkable achievement, bringing to bear on Capitol Hill, on the State Department and on the White House itself, a kind of influence that this country has never previously had in those quarters, will be recorded in the history of our <Col N="472" /> diplomacy as one of its major achievements. The Taoiseach's public denigration of the work of these servants of our State in remarks addressed to the Press of that country, will be read as a petty footnote to this great achievement.</P>
    <P>The fact is that for ten years successive Irish Governments, starting with the Fianna Fáil Government in office earlier in the seventies continuing through the lifetime of the National Coalition Government, and on into the period of further Fianna Fáil Government after 1977, have consistently sought to disabuse both American political and public opinion of the illusion that the Northern Ireland problem is a simple residue of colonialism whose solution is impeded only by a determination by Britain to retain its hold on the area.  It has not been easy to tackle this simplistic sterotype of the Northern Ireland problem which at the outset of the period was deeply embedded in the American consciousness, and which accounted for the heavy flow of funds, and of arms, from that country to the IRA, as a result of which many hundreds have lost their lives in Northern Ireland, the vast majority of them fellow Irishmen, women and children, as we saw recently.</P>
    <P>Our task was not rendered easy during much of the period by recurrent bouts of propaganda fervour on the part of British Governments seeking to justify or to play down wrong acts by the security forces in Northern Ireland, or to pin blame on this State for failures of security within the territory under their jurisdiction.  For many years we fought a war of words in the United States on two fronts, and it is not too much to say that we won it.</P>
    <P>Informed American opinion, including opinion within the Irish American community, has, as we have seen from the statements I quoted earlier, swung away from the simplistic interpretation that ignored the reality of one million Protestants in Northern Ireland.  At the same time the reality of our efforts to tackle terrorism on our side of the border, to which all Governments have contributed, including as the Taoiseach said earlier, his previous Government, has come to be recognised, even by the most anglophile <Col N="473" /> of American opinion-makers, and policy-makers.</P>
    <P>Having participated in, and having for a period been involved in the direction of, our efforts to communicate a balanced picture of the Northern Ireland problem to American opinion, I am very conscious of the success this country achieved.  I should say that the honour of starting this process goes to Fianna Fáil, in the person of Deputy O'Malley, who was, if I recall correctly, the first to take up the issue head-on, and of the former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, who was physically assaulted by IRA supporters for what they saw as his challenge to their hitherto undisputed monopoly of influence with American opinion.  My own direct involvement dates back to 1973, and on every visit since then in Government, and later at least once a year in opposition on my own initiative, I have continued the work begun by Deputy O'Malley and Mr. Lynch.</P>
    <P>Looking back I believe the turning point came in 1976, with the remarkable bicentennial official visit to the United States by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, and his seminal address to the joint Houses of Congress.  For the first time since violence had begun, the whole American political establishment gathered to hear an Irish Taoiseach expound to them the realities of the problem.</P>
    <P>Thereafter our work, closely paralleled by that of the SDLP and notably by John Hume, became easier.  There followed first the remarkable statement by the `Four Horsemen', Speaker Tip O'Neill, Senator Ted Kennedy, Senator Pat Moynihan and Governor Carey on St. Patrick's Day 1977.  Next there was the visit to Britain, Northern Ireland and here, by Speaker Tip O'Neill, around the time of the last British general election, a visit from which I draw two abiding memories &mdash; first, the fatuity and uninformed character of some British media and political comment on this great man and on his constructive role in relation to Northern Ireland, and second his most moving speech in St. Patrick's Hall in Dublin Castle, in which he embraced the Protestants of the North with the rest of the people of this island as equal partners <Col N="474" /> in the task of reconciliation.  Finally, there was the establishment of the Friends of Ireland on an occasion marked by a visit by a special delegation of this Dáil, comprising the present Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Deputy Michael Woods, Deputy Frank Cluskey, then leader of the Labour Party, and myself as leader of Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>Throughout all this period the consistent message of every Irish Government and of every Irish Minister in the United States has been to preach reconciliation &mdash; to expound the belief, first, that our task is to bring together by agreement the people of this island on a basis of common interests and ideals, with no ambiguous phraseology about &ldquo;self-determination for all the Irish people&rdquo;, and, second, that Britain has a duty to play a leading role in this process &mdash; which, since last November's Anglo-Irish Summit, the British Government are now explicitly committed to undertaking.</P>
    <P>This message of reconciliation, of unity being achieved by consent, of the duty of both the British and Irish Governments to create the conditions necessary for the achievement of peace and political progress within Northern Ireland, had been received and accepted by public opinion in the United States.  We had effectively won the battle against prejudice, whether pro-IRA or anglophile prejudice, in the corridors of power in the media and amongst that broad section of public opinion that is concerned about this issue.  It is against this background that the Taoiseach's recent visit to Washington must be seen, and his words seeming to hark back to the old propaganda line of the sixties must be heard.</P>
    <P>There is however another and more disturbing aspect of the Taoiseach's speeches and statements in the United States which he attempted to defend here this morning.  As reproduced here, they do not contain any call on the people of the United States not to contribute financially or otherwise to support those who provide guns and ammunition to the IRA to murder at will in both parts of this island.  The fact is that his, no doubt, carefully chosen words &mdash; and it is clear from what he said this morning that they <Col N="475" /> were carefully chosen &mdash; to Congress fell short of such a call.  On this he merely said &ldquo;a small number of people in this country&rdquo;&mdash; the United States &mdash;&ldquo;have subscribed to activities which can only delay the achievement of that community&rdquo;. Has any Taoiseach or Minister ever referred to the campaign of murder in Northern Ireland in such anodyne terms, &ldquo;activities which can only delay the achievement of that unity&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Are those words sufficient to deal with the murder of hundreds of Irish people and members of the security forces in Northern Ireland?  Can the Taoiseach stand over that description of the IRA campaign?  Certainly no previous Taoiseach or Minister ever downgraded a campaign of murder with phraseology of that kind.  He went on to say that many people in the United States who subscribed to these activities were simply misguided.  He continued: &ldquo;I therefore commend your stated intention of helping to inform the American people of the real causes of the conflict in Northern Ireland&rdquo;, a campaign of information from which he, however, conspicuously absented himself for reasons given here which carry no conviction.  It has been the consistent view of every Irish Government, and their advisers, at home and abroad, that it is vital that this campaign be continued and that the authoritative voice of every Irish Government be raised in continuous refrain on this point, so that there will be no chink in our armour, so that no suspicion may arise that there is at any level, in any party in this country, at any time, any tolerance for the provision of aid or assistance to the IRA.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say to the Taoiseach that there are two clearly defined paths that can be followed in relation to Northern Ireland.  One is the beat-the-drum, rally-to the flag, blame-everything-on-the-Brits, atavistic nationalism that has created the present cycle of violence and which if revived or given any aura of respectability by people in the seats of power here can maintain that cycle indefinitely.</P>
    <P>As John Hume said on 2nd and 3rd of <Col N="476" /> this month, speaking first in St. Ann's Church of Ireland Cathedral in Belfast and secondly in the Servite Priory in Benburb, this older approach &ldquo;failed to grasp the fundamental dimensions of our problems. We failed to define our concept of unity in terms which would be meaningful and truly unthreatening to the other Irish tradition.  Because of this fatal omission &mdash; the original sin of the Nationalist tradition &mdash; our aspiration came by default to mean, and to be understood to mean, conquest.  But, he added, &ldquo;unity and unity by agreement should be, if these are to have any meaning synonymous....  Our failure in this matter &mdash; the result of misconceptions, weakness and delusion &mdash; has itself encouraged an extremism which perverts all the high principles of our tradition&rdquo;. These are noble and courageous words, spoken nobly and courageously.  Would that the Leader of this State would speak in that type of language on our behalf as John Hume has spoken within this very month on behalf of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  The second path which he describes is the getting away from that older tradition which came by default to be understood to mean conquest and which has worsened the division between the North and the South that we have such difficulty in bridging.</P>
    <P>The second path, the path of unity and unity by agreement being synonymous, involves seeking out that which is common ground between the two traditions in Ireland, an aim to which the British Government pledged themselves last November as an important development of the discussions which the Taoiseach had himself inaugurated 18 months earlier. This is the path to which all of us on this side of the House are pledged.  I hope that, whatever the pressure from Deputy Blaney &mdash; who, in this House, when it met a couple of weeks ago was quite open in claiming to have succeeded in influencing the Taoiseach back towards the former sterile path of verbal republicanism &mdash; the Taoiseach will think twice about turning away from all that was achieved by our predecessors in office, <Col N="477" /> Mr. Jack Lynch and Mr. Liam Cosgrave and by the members of successive Governments, and our American friends, in the past ten years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's visit to the US had both an economic and political aspect.  It was a very important visit in terms of both these aspects in the national interest.  I congratulate the Taoiseach on making this visit to the US at this time when he had many other pressing problems to deal with but it was his duty in the national interest to make the visit and to make a strong case for additional US investment in the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>On the political side one could sum up the purpose of his visit as the continuation of the authoritative exposition of Irish Government policies on Northern Ireland.  On the economic side there is this need that is recognised on all sides of the House to maintain the level of US investment in our industrial development. We know that about 34,000 jobs here depend on US investment while 42 per cent of all overseas manufacturing jobs are provided from that source and that when planned development by US firms is completed in the next two or three years, something like 64,000 Irish jobs will depend on US investment here.</P>
      <P>The importance of the Taoiseach's visit is highlighted when we realise that factors like continued recession in the US, increasing costs at home and higher inflation by comparison with other EEC states, are leading in combination to a difficult situation, a situation in which in this year and next year it will be difficult to maintain a satisfactory volume of US investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the Taoiseach's address to the Economic Club in New York was of great importance as were his further contacts with US business elements.  A continued sustained effort must be made in the lifetime of this Government and of future Governments to attract available US investment here.  Once this State selected the road of free trade, US investment and mobile capital investment from abroad became a vital part of our industrial development.  It is forgotten often in <Col N="478" /> this House and elsewhere in the country that this State is in competition with other EEC states.  It is often thought that our competition for US capital investment comes from outside the Community but that is not the case.  Stiff competition for that investment comes from regions within the EEC, from Scotland for example. While the range of grants available to the IDA are comparable the fact is that the development authority in Scotland are offering very stiff resistance to our efforts in the US.</P>
    <P>I note that the Taoiseach at one of his press meetings referred to the need for additional IDA personnel in the US. Undoubtedly the market in the US requires continued attention from our IDA personnel all over the US.  While that may be helpful the most important and attractive point in the context of potential US investment here must be US business estimation of the genuineness of our efforts at home to tackle budgetary and financial problems.  All of the additional IDA personnel that we could put to work in the field would make no change if the US investment and business community generally were not convinced of the seriousness of the Irish Government about this matter at home.  A two-pronged effort is required.  There must be vigorous promotion of the available market in the US allied to a strong brief of being able to say that here are the objective efforts of the Irish Government at home.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Taoiseach will agree on reflection that trying to insinuate that perhaps by Ministers of the previous Government explaining honestly some of the problems before us they were in some way downgrading or making less effective our appeal for US business was unnecessary and unworthy.  We can be sure that US business has very good intelligence in regard to the state of the Irish economy and that they will know what the facts are.  I think that the Taoiseach's visit was a success so far as the economic side is concerned.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week we were admonished about bringing in unnecessary differences between us.  I subscribe to that but I thought it unfortunate that during his <Col N="479" /> visit to the US the Taoiseach omitted to condemn those in the US who have been financing men of violence.  He explained that he did not consider repetition of such condemnation to be necessary.  I will leave it at that except to say that in the context of his own standing within Northern Ireland it is unfortunate that he did not make a statement condemning those who support the men of violence on what was his first visit to the US as Taoiseach. In his account of his visit this morning he tells us that in answer to a question from President Reagan he said that we had pledged ourselves to overcoming the obstacles to further reconcilement of the two great traditions of our island and that for our part we would give to that end any pledge that might be sought or any guarantee that might be thought necessary and that we would make unassailable constitutional arrangements for those in the northern part of our country who may feel a special need for such provisions.  I would have thought that any effort to gain greater support in the US in relation to the settlement of our political position would have been immensely strengthened if instead of having this kind of weak reaction to a question from the President the Taoiseach was able to say that his Government had on the table constitutional changes for implementation here and now.  How much stronger his case would have been in such circumstances and how much more convincing would have been his willingness to open up discussions with people of the other tradition in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>On many occasions the Taoiseach has indicated that he regards as a priority efforts to try to advance significantly towards settlement of the Northern Ireland problem but it was unfortunate that he was not able to say to the President and on TV channels that his Government have proposals for constitutional change, that while there may be marginal benefits to be extracted from these offers on constitutional change in relation to attitudes in Northern Ireland, the main reason we are pushing for constitutional changes is that they are necessary for social reasons in this State <Col N="480" /> because ours is a modern state requiring such changes.  It would be more impressive if on future visits by the Taoiseach to the US he was able to say that we are ready to go ahead with the changes that are necessary in our modern state.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party I wish to say that we are considerably perturbed at the tone of the various statements made on Northern Ireland by the Taoiseach since his election.  His most recent statement in Washington has heightened our fears because there was no indication that he recognised the great difficulties inherent in the current attempt towards a new political initiative in the North to end direct rule.</P>
      <P>We understood from our discussions with the Taoiseach some weeks ago that he would welcome and encourage any attempts to get agreement on a form of devolved government.  If this were so, we would expect him to show some sensitivity to the wide gulf between the aspirations of the two communities there.  It is definitely not helpful at this time to exclude the one-and-a-half million people of Northern Ireland from any say in their future by stating that the solution is a matter for the London and Dublin Governments. To try to enlist the support of Washington to force a solution is particularly dangerous, not only for the people of the North but for the people here in the South as well.  America would be only too glad to get involved in working out a solution which would be to her own advantage.  Such a solution would entail bartering our neutrality, which would not be acceptable to the majority of the Irish people.  I urge the Taoiseach to be more temporate and restrained in his statements on Northern Ireland, and to state publicly now what he stated to us privately, that he would welcome and encourage new political initiatives leading to devolved government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party welcome the Taoiseach's efforts to encourage American investment in industry to create new jobs but suggest that the recent closures of some of the brightest stars of the IDA-assisted industries give little hope of much success in that area.  Our industrial and job creation <Col N="481" /> programme must now be based on our own natural resources: processing our meat, fish and other foods; using our now mature forests for the creation of thousands of jobs in all forms of timber processing; using our lead, zinc and other metals for industrial production by establishing a smelter plant.  While doing that, we should continue to encourage other foreign industries to come here but they should be peripheral to our industrial economy, not dominating it as at present.</P>
    <P>We hope the Taoiseach also took the opportunity, while he was in Washington, to clarify for President Reagan what our foreign policy is.  Again from our discussions with the Taoiseach and five members of his front bench, it was made clear that Fianna Fáil in Government would pursue a policy of positive neutrality. The Taoiseach confirmed this further by saying he would pursue the policy initiated by Frank Aiken in the fifties. We reminded him that this entailed political initiatives on disarmament and on the spread of nuclear weapons, and he agreed that this was what he had in mind. This is precisely the type of neutrality and non-aligned policy the Irish people would like to see our Government pursuing at this time.  I hope the Taoiseach at his briefing session with our UN staff spelled this out quite clearly.</P>
    <P>One final matter which I must mention is the question of El Salvador.  Irish people are very concerned about the numerous well-documented reports on mass murder and torture by the Duarte Government of the people of El Salvador. They are horrified that an American President should be aiding and abetting this murder and torture.  I hope this feeling was conveyed to President Reagan or, if St. Patrick's Day was not the appropriate time to do so, that the first available opportunity will be taken to let him know where we stand on this most important issue.</P>

      <P>During the course of these statements my name was used, and not for the first time, by the Leader of the Opposition.  As a result I want to intervene when otherwise I would not have intervened.  I want to make it quite clear to the House that I represent people who believe as I do about the unity and the reunification of this country.  I am also a member of the European Parliament where I am well-known for my views in this regard.  I want to say to the Leader of the Opposition that I did not use pressures, undue or otherwise, on him or his predecessors in Government.  What I have to say and what I represent are openly known and without question.</P>
      <P>If we had a little more clarity and less gobbledy-gook, such as we have had for the past ten years from successive Governments, particularly when talking to our friends in America, there would have been a much better understanding before the present Taoiseach went there and cleared the air to some degree on what our views are and should be on this very vexed question of which I, as a Northerner, am more aware than most.</P>
      <P>Agreement by consent is not a policy. Agreement or unity by consent is not a policy.  We have been listening to that until I have become bloody well sick of it.  Unity by consent of the majority, a contrived majority in the Six Counties, is not a policy.  Agreement by the majority of the people of Ireland is, has been and should continue to be the policy of the Irish people and should be expressed by our leaders wherever they go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach on what he made clear in the United States: that that is what we are looking for, and that <Col N="483" /> we will not continue to be coerced by an occupational force of a foreign Government who created Partition and who wish to maintain Partition and want us to agree that, while there is a contrived majority who do not want reunification, parrot like, we will continue to proclaim to the world that that is our policy.  Reunification by the majority of the people of all of this island has always been our aspiration and will continue to be so.</P>

At that time there was, I thought, general assent that the practice was a rather archaic one that placed Deputies at a disability.  It is really not a matter for scoring points.  If it is an archaic practice that draws a distinction between the potential ability of Members who are ordinary Members and people who are former Cabinet Ministers to honour confidentiality, now is the time to change it.

      <P>Mar a dúirt mé inné ins an díospóireacht seo, ní haon rún é go bhfuil tionscal na hiascaireachta san am i láthair i ngéarchéim agus má dhéanaimíd scrudú ar an tionscal seo sílim gur féidir linn a fháil amach cén áit a bhfuil na deacrachtaí.  Sé mo bharúil féin go bhfuil na deacrachtaí a bhaineann le tionscal na hiascaireachta san am i láthair ag teacht ón barr agus ón bhun. Mar shampla, na costais a bhaineann le hiascaireacht, tá siad ag dul in airde, luach artola, luach arachais, trealamh agus mar sin de.  Ar an dtaobh eile den scéal, an luach atá na hiascairí ag fáil ar a gcuid éisc, de réir cosúlachta níl ardú ar bith air.  Má tá aon rud ag tarlú tá sé ag dul in ísle gach bliain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cad is féidir linn a dhéanamh faoi sin? Sílim féin go dtig leis an Aire agus leis an Rialtas rud éigin a dhéanamh chun cuidiú leis na hiascairí a bhfuil a gcuid costas ag dul in airde gach bliain.  Sílim go bhfuil <Col N="490" /> sé in am ag an Rialtas cuimhniú ar fhor-dheontas nó subsidy a thabhairt dos na hiascairí a gcosnaíonn a gcuid ola an oiread sin dóibh.  Ni shílim go bhfuil aon tír eile sa chomhargadh faoi láthair a gcosnaíonn a n-ola nios mó dóibh ná mar a chosnaíonn sé do na hiascairí anseo in Éirinn.  Is dóigh go ndéarfaidh an tAire agus an Rialtas agus b'fhéidir an Comhargadh nach ceadmhach é sin a dhéanamh, ach de réir mar a thuigim féin tá tíortha sa chomhargadh faoi láthair, an Fhrainc, an Ghearmáin agus an Iodáil agus tá siad sin ag tabhairt fordheontas i leith na hola.  Ní fheicim cén fáth nach bhfuilimidne ábalta a leithéid a dhéanamh chom maith maidir le luach an éisc.  Mar a dúirt mé is beag ardú ata ag teacht air.  Sílim, má scrudaimid an cheist, gur féidir linn déanamh amach cén fáth nach bhfuil ardú ag teacht air. Silim go bhfuil an t-eileamh céanna ar iasc anois agus a bhí sna blianta a chuaigh thart.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil an t-éileamh nios mó.  Nuair a bhí mé féin níos óige &mdash; agus is dócha go bhfuil cuimhneamh ag cuid eile agaibh air seo &mdash; ni raibh cead againn feoil a ithe Dé hAoine; caithimis iasc a ithe.  Is é mar a bhí an scéal san am nach n-íosfadh éinne iasc aon lá sa seachtain ach Dé hAoine.  Anois tá an scéal sin athruithe agus is féidir leat iasc a itheadh gach lá sa tseachtain.  Tá an t-éileamh ar an iasc agus níl an bua á chur leis, agus cen fáth?  Sílim gurb é an fáth ná an méid éisc atá ag teacht isteach ó thíortha eile &mdash; ó Chanada, ón Norbhuadh agus ón Ioslainn &mdash; go dtí tíortha an Chomhargaidh.</P>
    <P>Sílim go bhfuil fuascailt na ceiste le fáil sa Bhruiséal go gcaithfidh an tAire Iascaireachta agus Foraoiseachta, le tacaíocht an Rialtais, dul ansin agus cinnte a dhéanamh de go mbeidh cothrom na féinne le fáil ag iascairí na tíre seo ón gComhargadh.  Is é an polasaí, de réir cosúlachta, atá ag na tíortha mór le rá, An Ghéarmáin agus an Fhrainc agus na tiortha eile ná iasc saor a ligint isteach os na tíortha seo ar choinníoll go dtig leo a gcuid earraí tionsclaíochta féin a dhíol arais leo.  Is é an dream atá thíos leis agus an dream ata ag fulaingt ná iascairí na hÉireann anseo atá beagnach curtha faoi chois san am i láthair.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> Rinneadh tagairt anseo inné do thionscal na maicréal.  Le cúpla mí tá daoine ag triall ar chuanta san tír seo &mdash; Castletownbere agus áiteachta eile&mdash;120 lorraí sa lá agus iad ag easportáil lastaí maicréal go dti tíortha na hEorpa agus sílim, nuair a dheinimid sin gur ag easportáil jobanna a bhímid.  Anseo in Eirinn, do gach uile iascaire atá ag iascaireacht ar an fharraige tá duine amháin ar an talamh ag obair i dtionscail phroiseála.  Má chuirimd é sin i gcomparáid le rudaí mar atá san Eoraip do gach iascaire, cur i gcás san Ísiltír, atá ar an fharraige, tá seisear ag obair ar an Mhórthír.  Caithimid smaoineamh ar fhorbairt a dhéanamh i dtionscail na proiséala sa tír seo agus postanna a chur ar fáil, agus nuair a chuimhním ar cén áit a bhfuil an t-iasc le fáil, sílim gur fiú don Rialtas agus don Aire cuimhneamh ar an tionscal proiseála agus postanna a chur ar fáil in iarthar na tíre.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom chomh maith le sin tagairt a dhéanamh, má táimid ag dul ag cur tionscal próiseála ar fáil, go gcaithimid deiseanna agus áiseanna cearta a chur ar an mórthír dóibh sin, mar shampla, san am i láthair in iarthar na tíre agus go speisialta san dáilcheantar ina bhfuil mé féin, iardheisceart Thír Chonaill.  Mar a dúirt an Teachta Coughlan anseo tráthnóna inné sílim go bhfuil cuid des na bóithre is measa sa tír ann, agus nuair a bhímid ag taisteal ar fud an dáilcheantair seo agus feicimid lorraithe agus trucailí móra 40 throithe ar fad ag iarraidh dul thar na bóithre, sílim sula mbíonn tionscail chearta ins an áit go gcaitfear infheistiú ceart a dhéanamh sna bóithre; agus chomh maith le sin, i gcúrsaí téileachumarsáide cuir i gcás cúrsaí teileafóin.  Inniu féin bhí mise ag iarraidh dul tríd go dtí an Bhunbeg as an áit seo agus theip orm agus ní sin an chéad uair. Ach nuair a chuimhníonn tú ar na daoine atá ag plé le hiasc, ag ceannach éisc agus ag diol éisc, agus go gcaithfear an mhargaíocht a dhéanamh go gasta mar go rachadh lobhadh ar an iasc, ta sé fior-thábhachtach go mbeadh córas ceart cumarsáide teileafóin, telex agus ar uile ag na ceannaitheoiri agus na daoine ata páirteach sa tionscal sa dóigh go dtig leo teanghmáil a dhéanamh le ceannaitheorí <Col N="492" /> sa Bhreatain agus tíortha eile na hEorpa.</P>
    <P>Bhí deis agam le déanaí cuairt a thabhairt ar an chalaphort iascaireachta is mó sa tír, is é sin na Cealla Beaga.  Tá áthas orm a rá go bhfuil forbairt mhór déanta ar an cheantar sin agus ar an mbaile sin le roinnt blianta anuas.  Ceann de na rudaí is mó a chuir mé suim iontu nuair a bhí mé ansin ná an chuairt a thug mé ar an long-chlós sna Cealla Beaga, long-chlós a bhfuil oibrithe ag obair ann leis na blianta fada agus tradisiún breá long-thógála acu ins an am a chuaigh thart. Bhí siad ábalta báid iascaireachta a thógáil a bhí déanta de adhmad, ach tá áthas orm a rá anois go bhfuil deiseanna sa long-chlós sin agus go dtig leo na báid is nua-aimseartha a thógáil, báid déanta as crua atá os chionn 40 troigh.</P>
    <P>Tá eagla orm, mar sin féin, go bhfuil deacrachtaí acu i láthair na huaire agus ceann des na deacrachtaí atá acu ná an iomaíocht ghéar atá siad ag fáil ó thíortha na hEorpa.  Ní hé nach bhfuil na hoibrithe sna Cealla Beaga chomh maith lena macasamhail san Eoraip, ach tá buntáistí ag longchlósanna ins an Eoraip nach bhfuil ag na daoine atá i mbun an ghnó seo sna Cealla Beaga.  Ceann des na rudaí is mó a chuireann isteach orthu ná go bhfuil fordheontas le fáil i dtíortha na hEorpa ag na dreamanna a bhíonn ag tógáil longa agus bád agus nach bhfuil siad le fáil sna Cealla Beaga.  Bhí toscaireacht agam &mdash; níl sé chomh fada sin uilig &mdash; agus d'iarr siad orm iarraidh ar an Aire an bhféadfadh sé macasamhail den deontas sin a thabhairt do na daoine atá i mbun an ghnó seo sna Cealla Beaga.</P>
    <P>Le cúpla seachtain tá ráflaí ag dul thart trí na Cealla Beaga i dtaobh crann tógála speisialta a bhí beartaithe a chur ar fáil, go bhfuil an crann tógála sin curtha ar athló.  De réir cosúlachta tá sé déanta as iarann agus as crua.  Cuireadh in iúl dom &mdash; níl a fhios agam an fíor é nó nach fíor &mdash; go bhfuil an t-ordú curtha ar ceal &mdash; an t-ordú fá choinne an t-iarann a cheann-ach don chrann tógála seo.  Más fíor an ráfla sin, cuirfidh sé isteach go mór orain-ne in iar-dheisceart Thír Chonnaill.  Sílim go gcuirfidh sé cosc ar an fhorbairt atá beartaithe do na Cealla Beaga agus <Col N="493" /> b'fhéidir nuair a bhéas an tAire ag tabhairt freagra ar an díospóireacht seo go bhféadfaidh sé an scéal a shoiléiriú agus nach fíor na ráflaí atá ag dul thart go bhfuil polasaí i leith na gCealla Beaga ag athrú agus nach bhfuil an bhéim chéanna ar fhorbairt ansin, mar má chuirtear isteach ar fhorbairt na gCealla Beaga go ndéanfaidh sé dochar do thionscal na hiascaireachta ní amháin i dTír Chonaill ach ar fud na tíre.  Aon rud a dhéanann dochar do thionscal na hiascaireachta déanfaidh sé dochar do eacnamaíocht na tíre agus go speisialta do eacnamaíocht Thír Chonaill.</P>
    <P>An dara port ar mhaith liom tagairt ghearr a dhéanamh dó ná Ailt an Chorráin, Burtonport.  Mar a dúirt mé tráthnóna inné, bhí sé de phríbhléid agam freastal ar chruinniú a bhí eagraithe ag Comharchumann Iascairí Ailt an Chorráin cúpla seachtain ó shin agus chonaic mé féin agus na Teachtaí Dála eile a bhí i láthair ansin na deacrachtaí atá sa chalafort sin.  Mar shampla, tugadh geallúint dóibh bliain go leith ó shin go ndéanfaí forbairt ar Ailt an Chorráin. Dúirt an Taoiseach atá againn i láthair na huaire, an t-uasal Ó hEochaidh, nuair a bhí an fo-thoghchán i dTír Chonaill &mdash; is dócha go bhfuil cuimhne ag cuid agaibh air; tá cuimhne mhaith agam féin air &mdash; go raibh suim aige agus thug sé geallúint go gcuirfí céad troithe le cé Ailt an Chorráin agus chomh maith le sin go ndéanfaí an port a ghlanadh.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh an fhorbairt sin ag tarlúint gan mhoill agus b'fhéidir arís go bhféadfadh an tAire a insint dúinn go díreach cén uair a bhfuil sé ar intinn aige an fhorbairt sin á dhéanamh.  In mo pharóiste féin tá calafort eile, calafort a dhéanann freastal ar báid a bhíonn ag plé le hiascaireacht na mbradán níos mó ná aon iascaireacht eile.  Le cúpla bliain táthar ag déanamh forbartha ar an Bhunbeg.  Nuair a bhí Tomás Ó Domhnaill ina Aire Ghaeltachta i gcomhar leis an Aire Iascaireachta ag an am, tugadh deontas don Bhunbeg agus tá céim a dó den obair sin críochnaithe anois.  Ach níl an job déanta ar fad mar tá céim a trí le déanamh agus sílim, an lá atá ann inniu, go bhfuil na hoibrithe atá ansin ag Bord na nOibreacha Poiblí ag tarraingt amach as an <Col N="494" /> Bhunbeg inniu agus ag dul go dtí áit éigin eile.  Tá súil agam go gairid go mbeidh siad arais ansin agus go gcuirfidh siad críoch cheart leis an obair a tosaíodh ansin cúpla bliain ó shin.  Tá roinnt chalafort eile sa chontae agus ba mhaith liom iad a fheiceáil ag forbairt.  Tá Baile an Easaigh, Cloughaneely, Magheroarty a dhéanann freastal ar iascaireacht bhradáin agus a dhéanann freastal chomh maith ar Oileán Tory agus ar Inis Bofinne.</P>
    <P>Ó tharla mé ag caint ar Inis Bofinne, is é an t-aon teacht isteach taobh amuigh de liúntais leasa shóisialaigh atá ag na daoine ar an oileán sin na tionscail na hiascaireachta.  Sílim gur ceann de na hoileáin é atá dearmadaithe ar fad ar chósta Thír Chonaill.</P>
    <P>Mar shampla, níl fiú amháin solas aibhléise ar Inis Bofinne.  Sílim gur tugadh geallúint bliain nó cúpla bliain ó shin go gcuirfí ineallra ar fáil a chuirfeadh cumhacht aibhléise agus solais ar fáil don oileán seo agus go dtí seo níor tharla aon rud.  Tá pobal beo daoine ann.  Tá siad i mbun iascaireachta agus ba mhór an trua é mura ndéanfaí fóirthint orthu ar an dóigh sin.  Ní shílim go bhfuil morán oileán eile ar chósta na tíre anois a bhfuil daoine ina gcónaí orthu nach bhfuil cumhacht aibhléise acu.</P>
    <P>Sula dtagaim go dtí deireadh mo scéil, ba mhaith liom iarratas spesialta a chur ag an Aire anseo inniu.  Iarratas a bhaineann leis na daoine atá ag brath ar thionscal na mbradán.  Mar atá a fhios agaibh féin, anuraidh is beag airgead a rinneadh ar na bradáin.  Bhí an séasúr bradáin is measa againn is dóigh a bhí againne riamh.  De thoradh sin tá cáin le híoc ag na hiascairí bradáin &ldquo;the salmon levy&rdquo; agus ceann de na rudaí ba mhaith liomsa a chur i láthair an Aire inniu go gcuir-feadh sé deireadh leis an cháin sin fá choinne séasúr na bliana seo.  Ag an am seo nuair atá na hiascairí go dona, nuair atá siad ag fáil chomh beag sin airgead ar a gcuid tairgí, sílim gur droch rud é an cháin seo a chur ar na hiascairí agus ba mhaith liom a agairt ar an Aire agus ar an Rialtas go gcuirfí deireadh leis an cháin seo i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Sula dtagaim go dtí deireadh, duine ar bith againn as Tír Chonaill nó as chósta thiar na hÉireann a bhfuil suim againn <Col N="495" /> san iascaireacht, feicimid ó am go ham na taismí a tharlíonn ar an fharraige.  Tá eolas ar leith againn in iar-dheisceart Thír Chonaill ar na tubaistí agus ar na taismí uafásacha seo.  Tarlíonn siad anois is arís agus is beag a thig linn a dhéanamh mar gheall orthu.  Ba mhaith liom go bhféadfaí níos mó a dhéanamh, go bhféadfaí go mbeadh comhar naisiúnta tarrthála nó rud éigin dá mhacasamhail curtha ar fáil sa dóigh nuair a bheadh long nó bád nó foireann iascaireacht i gcontúirt go bhféadfaí tarrtháil a thabhairt orthu trí na daoine atá in a bhun i láthair na huaire, an Air Corps, an Garda agus na báid fóirthinte, agus atá siad ag déanamh sár-obair.  Tá siad ag déanamh a ndíchill ach silim gur chóir go mbeadh eagraíocht náisiúnta de chineál éigin agus chomh luath agus a théann an scéal amach go bhfuil long i gcontúirt nó i dtrioblóid ar an fharraige, go bhféadfaí tarrtháil a thabhairt orthu taobh istigh de uair a chloig.  Go minic tarlíonn cuid de na taismí seo le linn dorchadas na hoiche. Cuid de na rudaí a thug mé féin agus daoine eile faoi ndeara nach mbíonn deis ag an Air Corps lena gcuid helicopter dul amach san oíche.  B'fhéidir gurbh fhiú cuimhneamh ar helicopter a fháil do na paróistí agus áiseanna ar bord orthu gur feidir leo dul amach lá nó oiche.  Nuair a bhíonn long i dtrioblóid ar an fharraige is minic a dhéanann ceathrú uaire nó níos lú an difir idir beatha a shabháil agus beatha a chailleadh.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil súil agam go n-éiroidh leis an Aire san am atá roimhe agus go mbeidh sé ábalta tarrtháil a thabhairt ar thionscal na hiascaireachta sa tír seo.  Is fíor a rá nach raibh sé chomh holc riamh.  Tá súil agam nuair a bhéas a ré thart go mbeidh rudaí i bhfad níos fearr ná mar atá faoi láthair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy McGinley on his maiden speech.  Even though his Donegal Irish was a little difficult nevertheless it was not impossible to understand him.  I should also like to congratulate Deputy Bellew who had to make his maiden speech under some duress because of an <Col N="496" /> onslaught from the other side of the House.  While I am in a complimentary mood I should like to extend good wishes to Deputy Daly on his appointment as Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.  Some play was made yesterday about the fact that he was from the west of Ireland but I have no doubt that he will be a Minister for all fishermen.  I also extend best wishes to Deputy McEllistrim on his appointment as a Minister of State.  The fact that the Taoiseach has appointed a Minister of State to this Department is an indication of his concern for the fishing industry, a concern we all share.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, which increases the limit of advances to Bord Iascaigh Mhara to £40 million because of the extremely difficult period through which the fishing industry is going at present.  There is a growing lack of confidence in the industry. Many born-and-bred fishermen, so to speak, are getting out of the industry, going to new jobs or joining the lengthening dole queues because there is not a living in fishing any longer.  In my opinion, the industry is in peril and a new, sensible cohesive policy is very necessary. Improvements are needed in marketing and we need to create more fish processing plants.  Imports from non-EEC countries represent a massive contributory cause for the present state of the industry and these must be curbed.  The hardship facing prospective buyers of trawlers, with particular reference to EEC grants, is a deterrent to progress.  The lack of facilities in harbours around the country has a drastic effect on the growth of the industry.  I shall also comment on the life saving service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be clearly seen now that small Irish fishing villages are becoming ghost towns with an exodus every other week. The fisher folk cannot cope with the uncertainties of the industry and are moving away to softer options.  Those same villages were once hives of activity with contented populations and a thriving economy.  The tourist potential is now probably of greater economic significance than that of fishing because of the quaintness and the folklore.  This trend must be stopped and a situation created where young people will be encouraged <Col N="497" /> to take up fishing as a livelihood.  This suggestion must be attractive in the present economic climate with our disastrous unemployment figures.  We have the raw material in abundance, the tradition, the manpower and the expertise, but we have not the political will.</P>
    <P>We are constantly trying to attract new industries here, and rightly so.  The import content is sometimes crippling.  In the case of fisheries the raw material is on our door step.  With proper encouragement many extra jobs can be created at far less cost than the imported jobs. Many more fishermen could be at work full-time and part-time.  Fish processing is surely an area for expansion.  Harbour development and maintenance could take up many jobs as could boat building and boat maintenance and a fishery advisory service.  The industry needs new impetus, which can be provided in many ways such as better marketing arrangements so that we will not have a situation such as we had during the period of office of the previous Minister about last November when wholesale dumping of herring took place.  Herring from the big boats were fetching up to £20 per unit while on the same day and from the same harbour the small boats were lucky to receive £5 per unit for the same type of fish.  There must be consistency in the market.</P>
    <P>Importation of fish, particularly herring from Canada and other countries outside the EEC, must be halted in order to protect the industry here.  Surely it was not part of the EEC regulations that Irish fishermen should dump their fish while Canadian fish were being imported into the EEC.  I ask the Minister to ensure that all boats being purchased by fishermen can acquire the grants on offer, both national and European.  I am led to believe that boats of 40 feet or less are not getting EEC grants even though they fulfil all necessary qualifications.  I speak particularly in regard to the south-east where I know of at least four cases recently that were turned down for the EEC grant they were promised.  Often the difference between a person buying a boat and not buying it is the grant.  I ask the Minister to take up this as a <Col N="498" /> matter of great urgency at whatever level is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also ensure that all moneys under the control of Bord Iascaigh Mhara should as far as possible stay within the country, that when Bord Iascaigh Mhara are commissioning the building of trawlers the contract for such trawlers be given to Irish yards.  While it is well known that we have this expertise Irish yards such as Ross Company in New Ross, now in receivership with a loss of about 170 jobs, might not be in this position if BIM had spent their money at home.  The Ross Company proved that it was capable of building such trawlers but the contract for such trawlers went to Dutch yards.  Let the Minister and the Department of Fisheries set an example here for the Buy Irish Campaign.</P>
    <P>The harbours from which our fishermen are expected to operate must be updated to accommodate modern fishing boats.  Many of the smaller harbours have no major work done on them for a considerable period, possibly since their construction over 100 years ago.  This creates a situation that limits fishing time.  Local authorities provide barely sufficient money for maintenance.  We have harbours such as Duncannon, County Wexford, which are not nearly able to cope with the demand at present.  A call has been made for the upgrading of this port and I ask the Minister, as other speakers have done, to visit all those fishing ports and to respond to any calls to improve the industry.</P>
    <P>I also call on the Minister to examine the life saving service for fishermen. Many lives have been lost at sea in the past two years. While it might have been difficult or impossible to save some of them, in my opinion it would certainly have been possible to save others.  I wish to compliment the crews of the present life saving service on their efforts but their equipment is seriously out of date. Imagine the length of time it takes for a wagon carrying the equipment to be hauled by tractor whose maximum speed is 20 miles an hour to a location where a tragedy is imminent or has already occurred, when every minute is vital.  The <Col N="499" /> Naval Service, which is often called out on such occasions, should also have proper equipment necessary for such hazardous tasks.  This applies particularly in the case of sub-aqua teams.  The greatest disaster recently in this country was at Tacumshin Lake in County Wexford where five lives were lost, and two wives were left without husbands and two mothers without sons.  The services provided on that occasion left much to be desired.  Four days passed before the Naval Service arrived, allegedly because of the snow.  Helicopters should have been put at the disposal of the services. Any such tragedy, or suspected tragedy, should be given the fullest and most urgent attention.  Commercial divers on the spot said that they would not dive using the Mickey Mouse equipment which the Naval Service were using.  I shall finish, as I began, by saying that the fishing industry is in trouble but that wise spending of the increased limit of allocation to Bord Iascaigh Mhara and a commonsense approach from our new Minister can put it back on the road to recovery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his election to the position which he now occupies and also welcome the appointment of Deputy Daly in his capacity as Minister for Fisheries and Forestry and the Minister of State to that Department, Deputy McEllistrim. I wish them every success in their respective positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to be cynical or offensive when I say, at the outset, that I wonder are the appointments really necessary or, for that matter, is the Department of Fisheries, as distinct from Forestry, really necessary.  Those of us observing fishery matters in recent years have got the distinct impression that fisheries is a subject to be treated with contempt here, an industry which has been and is being treated with virtually total disregard, which has been subject to wilful neglect by successive Governments and to public indifference generally.  There is a distinct lack of will to do anything to rescue the fishing industry, to put it on a proper <Col N="500" /> businesslike footing.  This stems, no doubt, originally from a lack of knowledge on the part of our politicians and from what should be informed sources in the general public.  If one has not the knowledge it is very hard to have the will. We have seen a most disgraceful dereliction of our fishing industry.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have to the best of their ability tried to rectify this disgraceful state of affairs but their resources are so limited that their task is essentially hopeless. It is about time we tackled the problem and made amends for the shortcomings which we have all witnessed over the years.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go into personalities, but the contempt meted out to the fishing industry in recent years can be gleaned from the fact that the previous three Ministers for Fisheries came from inland counties, which is an insult to our fishermen. It shows that the Governments who appointed these Ministers &mdash; the men themselves are fine men and I am not criticising their ability at all &mdash; did so because they regarded fisheries as a hot political issue, something which is better swept under the carpet than left visible and dealt with in a proper and positive manner.  The last Minister for Fisheries came from County Cavan, the previous Minister from County Kildare and the Minister before that from County Roscommon. I have nothing against any of those counties, the individuals concerned or the natives of those counties, but it is obvious that a person from an inland county cannot hope to grasp the details and problems within the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I come from a maritime county and, not being modest, my knowledge of the fishing industry is as considerable as any Deputy's in this House; but I know that my knowledge is very incomplete.  How can we expect to run a Department of Fisheries and expect to develop our fishing industry if people appointed to that position have virtually no knowledge of the industry?  Having said that, we can look back and see that the best Ministers for Health are not doctors and the best Ministers for Education not teachers. However, if one is to be able to handle a subject and deal with a brief in a proper <Col N="501" /> manner, one should have knowledge of the intricacies of that topic.  As a result of this dereliction of our fishing industry, we have what Deputy Higgins yesterday described as chaos in our fishing industry. Chaos could be due to a number of reasons &mdash; quite often ignorance or uninformed opinion.  This is not just that type of ignorance; it is wilful neglect.</P>
    <P>When the Department of Fisheries were resurrected in the mid-seventies, we all thought that it was a major step forward and that there would be a vast development of our fishing industry.  We assumed that we would get what was then known as the 50-mile limit.  By that we meant a clear, unilateral 50-mile limit, as a result of which we would have a vast fishing industry, having sole rights to the fish within that limit.  Events proved that not to be the case.  Instead of a 50-mile limit we were reduced to a six-mile limit over most of our coastline and a 12-mile limit on the remainder.  If we do not have a common fishery policy finalised by the end of 1982, we shall have no limits whatsoever. All the other member states of the EEC will then be entitled to fish right up to our shores.  It is quite possible that that may be the case, because for the past seven or eight years we have been endeavouring to find a solution to the common fisheries policy and have failed absolutely. We have only seven or eight months left and it is conceivable, and indeed likely, that a solution will not be found by the end of 1982.</P>
    <P>I do not know the exact structures within the Department of Fisheries, or if Minister Daly does, because he is relatively new to the post, but I suspect that it is the most undermanned, understaffed Department in the whole Government system.  It is only a facade, a Department in name only.  A realistic attempt to put it on a departmental footing has never been made.  When I ask parliamentary questions on fisheries the answers I receive are so incomplete that one can only deduce that the information is not available because we do not have the facilities to obtain it.  The French, Spanish, Dutch, British and probably the Russians and East Europeans know more about the fishing grounds within our <Col N="502" /> 200-mile fishing limit than we do.  We have not got the facilities to carry out research in depth.  We had a research boat for that purpose, the <i>Cú Feasa,</i> but it has been laid up for the last two or three years.  At present our fishery research facilities are nil.  We depend on hiring a few trawlers here and there now and then by Bord Iascaigh Mhara to try to find out where the fish are, the species and in what quantities they are to be obtained.</P>
    <P>The countries which I have mentioned have a very thorough knowledge of what fish exist within our 200-mile fishery zone and they are working that zone accordingly. Each year the EEC and the international council, ISIS, which controls quotas and fishing effort all round the world, come together to decide how much of each species can be caught without seriously damaging the future of that fishing stock.  Those quotas are a joke. They are not being adhered to and, unless we have a Department of Fisheries with staff and facilities to oversee the fishing effort, then those quotas will continue to be a joke and the people who come after us will never forgive us for the manner in which we are allowing our fishing industry and fishing stocks to be destroyed. They will be right because this job has been bungled and there has not been an honest admission of that fact.</P>
    <P>This is the place where it should be spelled out and I regret that so few Deputies involve themselves in fishery debates because the fishing industry should, logically, be our second greatest industry.  It should be competing with the agricultural sector as being our main source of employment and wealth.  That is not the case.  Because of our indifference and neglect, the fishing industry is a matter of little or no concern, not just to the general public but also to many politicians.  Having said that, we must all compliment the Deputies who have spoken in this debate so far.  It is obvious that Donegal is the primary fishing county and Deputy Gallagher, Deputy Coughlan and Deputy McGinley by their contributions have shown their concern for that area.  By naming people I do not wish to omit or to cast any aspersions on <Col N="503" /> other Deputies who have spoken.  I know Deputy Begley and Deputy Higgins are also very concerned but overall the fault lies largely in the fact that we have a Department which is not geared to meet the needs of what should be a thriving industry.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to see that the three Members of Sinn Féin the Workers' Party have not seen fit to contribute to the debate. If we were talking about the export of cattle on the hoof they would be here asking that a certain number of cattle should be diverted to the meat factories here to secure employment which has been dropping off considerably because of lack of supplies of cattle.  The fact that we are exporting fish in an unprocessed form on an alarming scale is just as serious as exporting live cattle.  I do not see any difference in the theory that we should endeavour to retain a major portion of our fish catch for processing because that is essential.  I made the comparison in a previous debate that in Ireland the ratio of fishermen and shore workers in the shore-based fishing industry is less than one to one.  For every fisherman there is not the equivalent of one person working on shore, whereas on the Continent the ratio is in the order of one to six.  For every man fishing at sea you have six working in shore-based industries, largely in processing but also in ancillary industries such as boat building. That statistic alone illustrates the alarming position of our fishing industry generally.  We must back up our fishing effort by industrial development at the quayside.  That type of development is widespread in Donegal, principally at Killybegs, where we have at least seven fish processing industries on the quayside or surrounding the harbour but that is an isolated instance and the same type of industrial development is not found at the other ports.</P>
    <P>We must take a serious look at the position because we have vast quantities of fish, particularly mackerel, being exported unprocessed.  Those mackerel are being caught mainly off the north-west and south-west coasts and are being exported principally to Russia and other <Col N="504" /> eastern bloc countries.  Only a tiny proportion is being processed here.  That position must be rectified.</P>
    <P>It may be all very well to catch large quantities of mackerel and herring but there should be supervision of those catches.  At present I do not believe there is such supervision.  I have already stated that the quota system is a not very pleasant joke.  That is so because catches are not being supervised.  Our Naval Service have been given the task of supervising the quota system.  That is not their job.  That service was not set up to adopt the role of fishery protectors: it is an entity in its own right.  If we were to operate a fishery protection service properly we should do so through a section in the Department of Fisheries whose job it would be to do the monitoring.  Obviously we do not have the staff there, and we do not have a single boat with which to do that work.</P>
    <P>About three years ago the IFO suggested that, if any fishing boats from another country were to fish within our 200-mile limit, an observer from the Department should be put on board once the ship came into our waters and before fishing was begun.  In that way the entire operation would be supervised.  I agree that that is the only realistic way in which we will control catches, and if we do not control them there will be over-fishing and the quota amounts will be exceeded. Outside fishermen land their catches in out-of-the-way ports on the Continent without supervision.  Therefore, it is a pity the IFO suggestion was not pursued.</P>
    <P>Until there is proper supervision of catches we are in distinct danger of destroying completely our fish stocks.  At the moment catches of mackerel off the south-west and north-west coasts are not being monitored and I hope the Minister will tell me what steps are being taken to rectify that situation.  If catches are not monitored properly our mackerel stocks will be eliminated, just as our herring stocks were destroyed in the Celtic Sea in the late sixties and early seventies.  We will finish up with only white fish and a poor industry because it will not pay our fishermen to go out in boats worth a million pounds each looking for white fish only.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="505" /> The Bill emphasises the need to increase the size of fishing boats and their catching ability.  That may seem lovely but it is not as happy a picture as it might appear.  I have asked the Minister to restrict the catching potential of our fishing fleet, particularly the larger boats. We are one of the few countries to allow what is known as purse seining.  That method is absolutely effective but also massively destructive.  It entails the surrounding of shoals of fish and collecting those shoals as if you were collecting water from a pool in a bucket.  If it is allowed to continue unrestricted there will not be any mackerel stocks left within a few years, but so far we have not seen fit to restrict that form of fishing which has been outlawed in most other countries because it is so destructive of stocks. I suggest that the Minister immediately alter the position before our entire mackerel stocks are exhausted in the same way as our herrings were decimated.</P>
    <P>We must impose a strict limit on third country and EEC member catches off the south-west and north-west coasts.  At present such fishermen catch far more mackerel than the Department admit, and if restriction is not imposed immediately there will not be anything left for Irish fishermen.  That is the most crucial issue facing fishermen at the moment.  If quotas were properly implemented there would be a reasonably good future for our fishermen in large boats, but I will never condone the use of the purse seine net.  We have shown lack of knowledge, interest and concern in this matter with consequent danger to our mackerel stocks.</P>
    <P>Last January I referred to fish dumping. Unfortunately, it is a fact.  It is pathetic to see film on television of top quality herring, which is one of the most valuable species of fish, being dumped in places like Killybegs and Galway because there is no market, because we have not got adequate processing facilities to deal with the glut that might occur for a day or two or a week.  It is disgraceful that this fish has to be dumped and that fishermen are going out knowing that what they catch is to be brought back into port merely to be dumped and sprayed with a <Col N="506" /> dye so that it cannot be resold in any way. That type of dumping is sinful; it is disgraceful and we should endeavour to have a structure whereby that does not have to occur.  It has been stated that it has to be dumped because there is no market for it.  But recently the Polish Aid Organisation &mdash; and we know there is a great food shortage in Poland &mdash; were seeking supplies of such fish resulting from gluts and did not have much success in getting any.  So I would ask the Minister to ask BIM to bear in mind at all times of oversupply countries where there is a grave food shortage and, if at all possible, see to it that the surplus fish is given to those countries.</P>
    <P>I cannot think of any more worthy cause.  An alternative would be to give it to charitable organisations.  The point is made that these people do not have the transport but I understand that the Polish Aid Organisation had a cargo ship on hand to transport any fish that would be available here and I know that there are a lot of charitable organisations which would avail of this surplus fish and if they knew in time that it was available they could also make arrangements to have transport laid on.  It is imperative that the Minister set up some system to let organisations know where fish is being caught in excess and will have to be dumped unless it can be given away.  Such fish should be given away.</P>
    <P>One may ask why should such valuable species of fish as herring have to be dumped here.  The answer is very simple. We are not being tough enough at the EEC Council of Fishery Ministers to see that imports from third countries are restricted.  It is common knowledge that the major fishery countries in the northern hemisphere all now have a 200-mile fishing limit, namely, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, The Faroe Islands and Norway.  The result is that they have far more fish than they need for their own domestic consumption and they are only too prepared to sell off vast quantities of this fish to the affluent countries of the western world, the EEC in particular. That is what they have been doing.  It has been to the detriment of our fishing industry and it has cost our fishermen <Col N="507" /> dearly.  It is a common occurrence nowadays that if fishermen here are able to sell their fish they get less than they got five years ago.  That is because of an over-supply situation due to huge imports from third countries.  Fuel oil and every other item used in the fishing industry have doubled or trebled in price.  We need only look at the Dublin fish market report in the paper to see that fish in most cases is fetching the same or less than it did five years ago.</P>
    <P>They should be available at reasonable distances, and that is not the case at present. I would like the Minister to do something which has not been done for many years in this country: to make an impact at Cabinet level and at EEC level to see that our fishing industry is put on the level to which it is entitled.  We will all be proud of his performance if he can do that.  We welcome this Bill and hope that it is the beginning of better things to come.</P>
    <P>We need people out in Brussels.  We need a Minister for Fisheries who will go out and see to it that the Germans, the French or the Dutch will not allow this fish into the EEC in excess.  It is a disgrace that the Canadians can export thousands of tonnes of herring to the EEC while our own fishermen are forced to dump top quality herring.  As Deputy Hugh Byrne of Wexford stated earlier today, if they do send the fish into the market the price they get for a box of herring could be as low as £5.  That was the price frequently quoted to fishermen in the south-east over the past winter.  Six or seven years ago that same box of herring would have fetched £15 or £20.</P>
    <P>Therefore can one wonder why our fishermen feel that they are getting a raw deal?  They have every justification for feeling this way.  These third country imports must be stopped or seriously restricted.  They are destroying the Irish fishing industry.  As a public representative, I know it.  I see more and more fishermen, men who have fished for 15, 20 or 30 years leaving the fishing industry and looking for shore jobs or going on the dole, because it is not worthwhile to go out and fish all night and perhaps get <Col N="508" /> one or two boxes or none at all.  With that type of price structure they are better off financially if they do not fish and stay on the dole.  The price structure has been shattered by the import of fish from third countries.  It behoves the Minister to go to Brussels to see that this attitude of &ldquo;I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine&rdquo; stops.</P>
    <P>We know that the Germans and the other developed countries are allowing these imports on the basis that their consumer goods are being accepted by Canadians or Norwegians or whatever.  It is a case of swapping commodities, but we are the people who are caught in the middle of that arrangement and it cannot be allowed to continue.  We have failed in the past to restrict the imports from third countries.  I was told here six months ago that a 15 per cent levy was now to be imposed on imports of fish from third countries.  That is no good.  If the Canadians or Norwegians or Icelanders are catching enormous quantities of fish it pays them to sell at extremely low cost. It is a price war and that is what they are doing.  A levy of 15 per cent means nothing. The amount of duties should not enter the matter.  It must be a restriction, a total restriction or a very major restriction to ensure that the market at home is buoyant and to ensure that our fishermen get a fair price.  They have not been getting it.</P>
    <P>Going a little further I see that the inhabitants of Greenland voted last month to opt out of the EEC and that now they are going to seek associate membership of the EEC.  One of the reasons they are seeking associate membership is to allow them to continue to sell their fish on European markets.  Greenland is a large country with a small population. It is almost totally dependent on fishing.  The catches of fish they obtain are enormous.  If they are allowed special concessions in regard to importing fish into the EEC it will gravely damage our fishing industry.  I ask the Minister to bear this in mind when any agreement is being drawn up.  If nations such as Greenland have associate membership of the EEC, this should not be an open door to our fish market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> I referred to the salmon catches by the people of Greenland.  I might also refer to the salmon catches by fishermen from the Faroe Islands.  I was under the impression that the Faroe Islands were part of the State of Denmark but apparently it is a separate entity and they are not members of the EEC.  The Faroe Islands have a tiny community of about 35,000 people and the whole economy is based on the fishing industry.  Having a 200-mile limit around a small group of islands means that the quantity of fish in their possession is enormous.</P>
    <P>One disturbing factor has come to public notice in recent times which can be attributed to the very difficult situation confronting Irish salmon fishermen at present.  Apparently the Faroese have discovered the North Atlantic run of salmon.  They net the salmon out at sea at great depths.  They have been causing havoc with the salmon fishing industry here.  The 1981 salmon fishing season here was the worst on record for over 20 years.  However, there was not much of a fishing effort in that regard other than in rivers and estuaries.  Nowadays the major part of the salmon industry is at sea.  Figures quoted in public statements in the press were that in 1981 Faroe fishermen caught 1,600 tons of salmon.  That might not seem a great amount and, indeed, if it were mackerel or herring, it would not be a great amount but a commodity like salmon is a fairly rare species and 1,600 tons of salmon is a very sizeable quantity.  This was the figure given by the Faroese themselves.  However, there is no certainty that this is the amount they caught because invariably fishermen understate their catch.  It could be that it was a multiple of 1,600 tons.  In any event the salmon fishing industry here took a beating last year.</P>
    <P>I know of many fishermen who had to give up fishing in June to July because it did not pay them to fish.  I know of fishermen whose catch in 1981 did not cover the cost of their outlay on nets and fuel. The EEC have recognised that the problem is mainly caused by the deep sea fishing for salmon by the Faroese and the people of Greenland.  What will the Minister do about this?  If the Faroese cannot <Col N="510" /> be restricted in their excessive catches of salmon we should put an embargo on the import of fish from the Faroe Islands and do the same with Greenland and Canada. Even if salmon fishermen get a decent catch the price is deflated because of oversupply and imports from third countries. Importers can retain the salmon in cold storage.  They get a uniform price and do not have ups and downs.  That may be good for the consumer but not for the fishermen.  The Minister should say we will not allow any importation of fish unless they control their execessive fishing.  He has a duty to do that.</P>
    <P>I am sorry if I have spoken at too great a length but I hope the points I made have been assimilated by the Minister and that he will take some cognisance of them.  At the Cabinet table, when people are putting forward views about how we can create new jobs, whether in the building, electronic or agriculture industries, the Minister should remember that there is no area where there are greater opportunities for the creation of jobs than in the fishing industry.  Of course that is on the basis that the EEC acts in a responsible manner, restricts these imports and gives Irish fishermen a chance to get a fair price and living.  There is no better sector for the creation of new jobs than the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The way to do that is to improve the quality of harbours and provide more shore-based industries.  We must increase the ratio of people working on the shore from less than one for each fisherman at sea to five or six.  There is a classic example of a small harbour in my constituency, Helvick in the Ring Gaeltacht.  At present there are 20 or 30 boats fishing from that harbour, but that number could be increased to 50 or 60 if proper facilities were available.  It would not take a lot of money to improve.  It would be a better proposition for investment to do that than to grant-aid some firm which will fold up after 12 months.  We would have more jobs if we had better quality harbours.</P>
    <P>It does not make sense, if fishermen are to make a living, that they should have to travel 100 miles to get to an all-weather fishery harbour.</P>
    <Col N="511" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because some previous speakers have gone on for longer than anticipated.  My main reason for adding to the contributions already made is that, while I am a Dublin County Dáil Deputy, I come from a coastal constituency, that of Dún Laoghaire, which has, particularly in the centre and about the area of the harbour, a deep-seated tradition of seafaring.  Many families in the area have this tradition of going down to the sea in ships.  By reason of it being a coastal constituency one has an obligation to ensure that speculators or developers keep their hands off Dublin Bay and we, in common with other constituencies fronting on Dublin Bay, have an interest in ensuring that Dublin Bay does not fall into the hands of people who would not have its best interests at heart. These are some of our obligations as public representatives in these coastal constituencies.</P>
      <P>From an ecological and environmental point of view we have, fortunately, some important bird sanctuaries.  The people in the Dublin city and county area may not be aware that we have a large number of such sanctuaries, probably one of the most important being no further away than a mile-and-a-half from the back entrance of this House.  I refer to Booterstown marshes which have been protected by the local people who act as custodians of the marshes.  In addition to Booterstown, Dalkey Island also acts as a bird sanctuary which is easily accessible to the human species, and the fact that it is an island ensures its own protection against marauders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am speaking now on what could be described as a lost resource, because the sea is becoming a lost resource so far as its great possibilities for this nation are concerned.  We are an island nation surrounded by the seas and this opportunity presents itself for those of us who have an interest in this matter and who come from coastal constituencies to participate in this important debate.  As Deputy Deasy has said, aquaculture and sea fisheries are probably second in importance only to agriculture.  They have an important role to play in the development of <Col N="512" /> the nation and of its people.  Their potential has been recognised by some people but I do not think it has been realised.</P>
    <P>In making a plea to the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry in relation to a research station which I believe to be under threat I speak as a Dáil Deputy for the country as a whole.  If we as public representatives have something to say on behalf of our own constituencies, very well, but we are national representatives and as such I speak now in regard to the shellfish research fishery in Carna, in the Galway Gaeltacht.  I had the experience recently of visiting this wonderful centre, which is staffed by dedicated idealists, people of the highest quality and qualifications who are engaged in the research of shellfish.  Not so long ago I was given to understand that this research centre might be closed down.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that, as part of the on-going development of the fisheries and all that that means, that shellfish research laboratory be retained.  He will have the gratitude of future generations. This shellfish research laboratory in Carna in the county of Galway is under the aegis of the Department of Marine Biology, UCG, and part of the National Board of Science and Technology who, I understand, have funded it and have an interest in it.  I urge the Minister as a matter of national importance not only to maintain the laboratory but to develop it and also to open other types of laboratories in other parts of this island. The work being done in that laboratory is immeasurable.  It is not showing immediate results, but if we are talking about what Deputy Higgins mentioned in his exceptional speech, aquaculture and mariculture as being for the present and for the future, this is the sort of development which must be maintained as a matter of national urgency and importance. I know that the Minister, who has distinguished himself in another Department, will distinguish himself in that regard by acting as the custodian of this research laboratory.  If the threat to this laboratory still exists I hope that it will cease and that the rumours of the possibility of closure will be stopped now.  The <Col N="513" /> Minister might deal with that point during his reply.</P>
    <P>It is easy to stand up here and feed off other people's speeches, but it is not my intention to do so.  However, Deputy Higgins made a point with which I do not agree.  He suggested that the Naval Service should be retained as a naval service <i>simpliciter</i> and that its functions should not include fishery protection.  I disagree totally with that.  I think that the Naval Service has been underrated and, if I may use the expression, undermined to some degree by successive Governments.  I do not accept for one moment that the Naval Service has been properly expanded or developed, although it is a tremendous outlet for young people who have a desire to go to sea not necessarily to fish but to become seafarers, sailors.  It is indicative of the lack of interest in our seas that the Naval Service has not been developed. Successive Governments have not given proper recognition to the importance of this matter.  Something must now be done about it.</P>
    <P>BIM have been doing a good job and we are now providing more money for the development of our sea fisheries fleet. Whilst this is laudable, it is not enough. I see the Naval Service as a protector of the Irish seas, playing a part in the research which is so necessary.  They should act as research vessels during the course of fishery protection.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service should be developed by the induction of many hundreds of young people and more ships should be provided.  It should be seen as an attractive option.  In speaking recently on road safety I suggested that the problem should be brought to the attention of young people in schools.  By the same means we could promote among our young people the concept of Ireland as a sea-going nation.  Every coastal community should have a sea scout unit drawn from local schools, and teachers should be urged to bring to the attention of young people the attractions of the sea, whether in the Naval Service or in the sea fisheries industry.  This is not being done at present and an indoctrination programme is needed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="514" /> I was attracted by the views expressed by Deputy Higgins regarding a change in the title of the Department of Fisheries and the Minister might consider including the word &ldquo;sea&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Marine aquaculture or mariculture has been practised in the Far East for ever 2,000 years.  In 1975 China and Japan together produced 3.5 million tonnes of aquaculture products and during the past 20 years significant developments have been taking place in Europe.  The fish farming industry in Norway which started in the early sixties produced 7,000 tonnes of salmon and trout in 1980.  Where does this country fit into the picture?  Where is our development or research?  Comparisons may be invidious and unfair and we as a nation are inclined to engage in self-flagellation.  I would hope to make a positive contribution to this debate and I am not engaging in Celtic self-criticism which appears to be something of a national pastime.  However, by comparison with other European countries Ireland has many natural advantages which favour the development of aquaculture. These include high water quality, suitable and under-developed coastline, absence of important diseases and the presence of natural wild stock.  Those of us who were members of the former Inland Fisheries Trust and who engage in trout fishing know the tremendous coastline we have for this development.  We could also benefit from the technology developed in other countries.  Techniques which are being rapidly developed include the cage culture of salmon and hatchery production of bivalve shellfish.</P>
    <P>The development of suitable sites for aquaculture is of prime importance and this country has many such places.  The technology has already been developed and made available by other countries but putting it into practice is another matter and we must hasten slowly in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is also important in relation to mariculture to select the most suitable species. At present mariculture is based primarily on extensive culture of mussels and oysters.  Intensive culture methods have been established in Ireland only during the last two years, and the relatively <Col N="515" /> small production of 232 tonnes of oysters, mussels, sea trout and salmon realised a value of approximately £300,000.  Those figures are an absolute disgrace.  It is projected that given suitable circumstances production from aquaculture could reach over 13,000 tonnes worth £15 million by 1990.  We should be thinking in terms of 1985 and not 1990 and we need a crash programme of development.</P>
    <P>The figures I have given are a shame for an island nation.  I know the Minister takes an interest in this matter.  I hope during his tenure in this Department he will distinguish himself in the development of this activity.  I agree that a number of constraints on the development of the aquaculture industry have been identified in relation to the technical and development aspects.  Despite the advantages of gleaning technological education from other countries a number of technical constraints, which are specific to Ireland need to be identified.  I am sure the Minister knows about these particular problems.</P>
    <P>As a corollary to all that I suggest to the Minister that consideration should be given as a matter of urgency to the establishment of a marine research institute. All the scientific data and all the scientific literature available in Ireland on this subject state that a marine research institute should be set up as soon as possible.  If one wishes to study an extremely well produced and important study on the whole area of aquaculture one should read a production called &ldquo;Science and Technology for Aquaculture Development&rdquo; which was produced by the National Board for Science and Technology. This only came to my attention through the good offices of one of my colleagues yesterday.  It is available in the Library for those people who may be interested in the subject.  On page 107 of this publication it states:</P>
    <P>Besides the species which have already been discussed, there are a number of fin fish, crustacean, shellfish and marine plant species which offer <Col N="516" /> potential for aquaculture development.</P>
    <P>They go on to mention the type of species which could make contributions to the Irish aquaculture industry in the future. They include scallops, clams, eels, flatfish, sea bass, sea urchins, freshwater cray fish, lobster, abalone, shrimp and certain marine algae.  Some of these species can expect to benefit from the development of technologies that will allow commercial cultivation within ten years.</P>
    <P>The opportunities have been stated in this publication produced by the National Board for Science and Technology.  The people who are interested can refer to the immense opportunities set out in it for the future development of aquaculture. This matter can be seen as a developing industry.  I hope the IDA will take a very close look at the opportunities available to the country for mariculture and aquaculture generally.  The opportunities are immense and I do not believe that up to now they have been properly exploited.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the threat to our salmon fishing.  I know that fishermen have to fish to make a living within certain times of the year.  Nevertheless, some of the fishing methods being adopted are dangerous to the survival of salmon.  I do not intend getting into a controversy over this matter.  I am speaking not so much on behalf of the industrial salmon fishermen as the sporting and tourist salmon fishermen.  A large amount of money is spent by tourists visiting this country specifically to fish salmon, sea trout and brown trout as well as pike and other types of fish.  The amount of money spent 15 and 20 years ago in catching even one salmon was of great benefit to the hotel industry in the areas surrounding the rivers where salmon were fished.</P>
    <P>There are very few salmon left in our rivers.  It is a great tragedy that more has not been done to protect salmon fishing, which is part of our heritage.  I have only had the opportunity of catching a salmon on one occasion.  I am a sea trout fly fisherman but catching that salmon was one of my greatest thrills.  I can imagine the attraction salmon fishing has for fishermen <Col N="517" /> who visit this country.  That attraction is almost non-existent because of the greed of people in pursuit of salmon.  We are probably asking too much of the Minister during this debate but it is part of his brief to ensure the survival of salmon fishing.  The Minister will be helping our tourist industry if he ensures that salmon fishing remains an attaction.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the work done by some people in relation to the survival of salmon fishing, particularly Mr. John A.  Mulcahy from Waterford, who has done immeasurable good work in that regard.  He has done much to ensure the survival of salmon fishing and I do not believe he has received sufficient credit for the work he has done in that regard as well as for the country generally.  I should like to put on record my appreciation of what he has done and is continuing to do.  It is not fashionable to give that sort of praise to individuals like Mr. Mulcahy but I cannot be described as a fashionable Dáil Deputy.</P>
    <P>With regard to home consumption of fish, the fishing industry has not concentrated sufficiently on the home market. Why cannot housewives have fresh fish daily?  What distance is the centre of Ireland from each coastline?  Perhaps 75 miles.  It is crazy to think we cannot have fresh fish on our tables regularly.  Why this does not happen remains a mystery especially when one remembers that we are a very small country and we have the advantage of being surrounded by the seas.  Does the fault lie in communication?</P>
    <P>We are not a fish eating nation.  Why not?  It could be said that it is because we do not eat fish, but that is not the kind of answer I am looking for.  I want to know why we have not become a fish eating nation when we have such a valuable resource around our coastline.  We have a new Government and the Minister will have an opportunity to distinguish himself by doing something about the points I have raised in what was meant to be a brief contribution but has now run over its time.</P>
    <P>Although this is not the relevant time to mention this, I want to pay tribute to the lifeboat service.  These men have performed <Col N="518" /> courageous acts of heroism by rescuing fellow seamen in the most dangerous circumstances.  In my view they should be supported in every way possible, for example, financially by supporting their flag days.  May I pay tribute to one of the men who made me aware of the sea and its advantages, Dr. John de Courcy Ireland.  I know it is not normal to mention names in a debate of this nature but credit must be given where it is due.  This man has done immeasurable good to make people aware of the advantages of the sea.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well.  I have respect for him and for his abilities.  I also wish Deputy McEllistrim, his Minister of State, well in his new Department.  I ask the Minister to approach his new role in an enthusiastic way and to realise the limitless opportunities to do good which exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Chair on his appointment; Deputy Daly on his appointment as Minister and Deputy McEllistrim on his appointment as Minister of State.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the conservation of the salmon species, particularly as it affects my constituency.  The ESB and the Parteen Hatchery have done considerable work to promote the conservation of salmon.  However, in recent years there has been a rape of the Shannon Estuary by sea fishermen who put three mile nets across the mouth of the Shannon and denied the inland waters these salmon.  I support the Minister in any measure he takes to prevent the continuation of this practice.  If one goes to Loop Head and looks at the river one will see these massive lengths of net.  They are not Claremen who are fishing there. It must be acknowledged that the fishery protection vessels, in conjunction with the Limerick Board of Conservators, have tried on several occasions to apprehend the people who abuse the law and who will eliminate salmon in the Shannon area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Failure to protect the salmon has led to differences of opinion about the role of the salmon licences being issued at present.  Inland and sea fishermen pay <Col N="519" /> the same fee for these licences.  We in the inland fisheries believe there is discrimination in this area.  The financial reserves for conservation included in these licence fees are not adequate.  The sea fishermen should pay a licence fee in proportion to the size of their catch.  The previous Minister imposed a 10 per cent levy.  I agree with the application of that tax on fish caught at sea but I do not see why that levy should apply to inland fishing.  When the Minister is looking at the area of fees I hope he will be fair to all.</P>
    <P>There has not been enough emphasis on conservation work and the work being done by the people at Parteen Hatchery. Their statistics show that the number of salmon running is decreasing rapidly year by year.  When allocating funds the Minister might consider a special injection of money for these people because they will have to go to other lands to get other species to restock our rivers.  Apparently the sea fishermen are the ones who will benefit from the restocking and with the Department of Fisheries, those who benefit most from the industry should also contribute to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all those Deputies who have contributed to the debate and I appreciate very much the good wishes that have been extended to me and also to the Minister of State on our appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is encouraging for me at this early stage in my Ministry to have so much valuable comment and expert advice from Deputies on all sides of the House. The contributions have been enlightening and the confidence that has been expressed is encouraging for the fishing industry.  However, there were some suggestions that the industry is in a chaotic state, but I would not accept that from anyone.  It is very important that we instil confidence in the industry.  Having heard the encouraging comments from Deputies from all parts of the country it would be my hope to go out from this debate and to succeed in instilling in the industry the confidence that has been expressed here.  I am confident that our fishing <Col N="520" /> industry can meet the challenges of the future and can expand and develop in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Cuireann sé áthas orm an méid Gaeilge a úsáideadh i rith na díospóireachta seo. Rud tábhachtach í sin de bharr an méid iascaireachta ins an Ghaeltacht.  Faoi mar is eol daoibh, luadhadh a lán gnéithe den tionscal iascaireachta ins na horáidí atá i gceist agam.</P>
    <P>Is mór an buntáiste dom díospóireacht chomh lán agus chomh fairsing agus a bhí againn ar an mBille seo.  Is comhartha é don méid suime atá san tionscal iascaireachta agus tá súil agam go mbeidh dul ar aghaidh buan san tionscal i rith mo réime mar Aire.</P>
    <P>There was a slight misunderstanding at the start of the debate regarding circulation of copies of my speech.  When the official speech was made available on Tuesday I arranged to have copies supplied to Deputy Fitzpatrick, but so far as the remainder of my speech was concerned, my remarks were off the cuff so that there was no prepared script for them.  I trust that the matter is clarified now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick and many other Deputies also spoke at length about the volume of fish imports.  I agree that imports of fish into the EEC are not to the advantage of our fishing industry.  The Community as a whole has been always a net importer of fish.  Many of the other member states rely heavily on imports for their processing industries.  Successive Irish Ministers for Fisheries have consistently resisted these imports, and with some success.  I assure the House that I will continue that policy.</P>
    <P>There were many references during the debate to fishing limits and the question of a 50-mile limit was raised.  In my opinion we would never have been able to obtain agreement on a 50-mile limit.  That is accepted now by almost everybody in the industry and I am sure Deputy Fitzpatrick realises this after his period in office.</P>
    <P>Regarding the boat building industry I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that any BIM decision on an application for finance should be considered on its merits and not in terms of orders to the boatyards. <Col N="521" /> I have not had the opportunity yet of examining in depth the problems of the boatyards.  Reference has been made to vessels being built abroad.  I should like to make it clear that BIM are not the people who place the orders for fishing boats.  The board provide the grants but the decision as to where a vessel is purchased rests only with the skipper.  This has been the position always and it would be undesirable for the board to dictate to the fishermen on this issue.  However, I must point out that the board encourage fishermen to the maximum to have vessels built in Ireland and these efforts have been largely successful.  A very limited number of vessels have been purchased abroad.  The figures may help to put the matter in perspective.  In the past seven years BIM helped to finance a total of 396 vessels of which 380, or 96 per cent, were built at home, with the remaining 16, or 4 per cent, being built abroad. Nevertheless, it is undesirable that boats for Irish fishermen should be built abroad when the boatyards at home are experiencing difficulties.  I shall be having a close look at the whole boat building situation and, as a first step in that direction, I shall be visiting Killybegs on Monday next to discuss the situation with the various interests in the boatyards there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley seemed to have been alone in criticising BIM.  I consider his criticism to have been unjustified.  It is accepted generally that the board are reasonable in their treatment of fishermen whose repayments are in arrears.  Proof of this should be the fact that the board last year granted a two-year moratorium on arrears.  Recourse to court proceedings is a last resort.  The cases referred to by the Deputy were exceptional.  I assure him that there is no mystery whatever about the employment of consultants by BIM.  These consultants are from the Irish Productivity Centre who are engaged in examining the staff structure of the board and nothing else.  The needs of the Irish industry have changed and BIM need to be considered in that light. The study that is being conducted has the agreement of the unions and it will be completed shortly.  There is nothing sinister <Col N="522" /> about it, but it is important that such a study be carried out at this time.</P>
    <P>The £40 million which this Bill will authorise BIM to borrow will be used to finance new boats of 65 feet and less and for the provision of loans to fishermen for the improvement and engine replacement of existing boats in the next few years.  It has nothing to do with office accommodation or with harbour development. I am not aware of any offer to sell the boatyards back to BIM.  While I was not a member of the Government at the time I am satisfied that the right decision was taken on the sale of boatyards to the private sector.  The operation of the yards by BIM was costing the State approximately £1 million a year and the workforce were faced with redundancies. The jobs of a majority of the workers were saved as a result of the sale.  That in itself shows that the right decision was taken.</P>
    <P>The Deputy need not worry that BIM propose to import second-hand foreign vessels.  What the board's chief executive had in mind was the improvement and refurbishing of the existing fleet.  Deputy Begley also referred to the representation of fishermen on the board.  Fishermen have two representatives on board, including a former chairman of the IFO. Deputy Fitzpatrick will be fully aware of that.</P>
    <P>We had a very valuable contribution from Deputy Gallagher.  It is invaluable for me, starting off in this Department, to have the advice not only of a Deputy who has the feel of a constituency but also has expertise in this industry.  I will be pleased to hear suggestions from both sides of the House during my time, whether it be long or short, in the Department. He also referred to seine netting and suggested that fishermen should be encouraged to switch to seine netting which was very popular here some years ago.  Because of the cost involved some fishermen turned to trawling.</P>
    <P>I agree with him that it is a less expensive method than trawling where white fishing is concerned, because of the lower power needed.  Grants and loans are available from BIM for the conversion and improvement of fishing vessels, 25 <Col N="523" /> per cent of cost by way of grants and up to 65 per cent by way of loan.  At present grants are not available for gear except for the first issue.  Loans are available for gear in certain circumstances.  He suggested that I should study the matter and I will certainly do so and, if we can make any improvements in that regard, we will make them.</P>
    <P>He referred at length to the salmon levy.  The first issue he raised with me on my appointment was the vexed question of the salmon levy.  A number of other Deputies referred to this as well and advocated the abolition of the salmon levy.  Provision for the collection of the levy was included in the Fisheries Act, 1980.  Its purpose was to raise funds to supplement State grants to help in the development of our valuable inland fisheries. It was, perhaps, unfortunate that the introduction of the levy coincided with a fall in salmon catches and a reduction in price.  It is generally accepted that those who benefit from the development of our inland fisheries should contribute to their costs.  I am reviewing the situation with a view, if possible, to finding an alternative to the levy.  We have to augment the funds of £3.8 million which are available from the Exchequer for inland fisheries development this year.  I am having a very close examination of the levy carried out and a decision will be made shortly.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies spoke at length and very sincerely about safety at sea.  Like other Deputies I too am very concerned about safety at sea.  The legal responsibility in this area falls on the Minister for Transport.  An inter-departmental committee, including representatives of my Department, are considering this very important matter at present.  An EEC working group have also been set up, on which my Department are represented, to consider accidents on board fishing boats.  I look forward with interest to the results of the deliberations of these groups.</P>
    <P>In the short time while I was Minister of State at the Department of Labour I had responsibility for dealing with industrial accidents and putting through the <Col N="524" /> 1980 Industrial Safety Act.  I set up a commission of inquiry into industrial accidents which is sitting at present.  I am not sure whether the members of that committee have any responsibility in this regard, or whether it might be possible for us to ask them to look at this area.  I will await the outcome of the discussions with interest.  All I can hope to do at this early stage is to impress upon everybody involved the dangers of the sea, and the dangers of not using the equipment available for the safety and protection of fishermen.</P>
    <P>We must encourage the people involved to recognise that they cannot tamper with the sea.  They must be cautious and take care, and use the protective and safety facilities which are available. Sometimes fishermen are not conscious of the dangers because of their everyday activities involving the sea, and sometimes they take it for granted.  We must guard against that and encourage fishermen to use any facilities which might avert the type of tragedies we have had over the years.</P>
    <P>There were some complaints about the failure of small boats to get FEOGA grants from the EEC.  It is true that only a limited number of small boat applications have been successful in recent years.  The basic problem is that sufficient money is not available to allow grants to be approved for all eligible applicants. On many occasions my Department have made representations to the Commission on this issue.  I must stress that the final decision rests with the Commission and not with my Department.  I will have a look at the situation in relation to all the applications pending.  If there is any action I can usefully take, I will take it to try to get this matter rectified.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy has wide experience of our fisheries industry.  There has scarcely been a debate on fisheries in this House since I was elected in which Deputy Deasy has not given the House the benefit of his thorough knowledge of and expertise in this area.  I should like to thank him for that.  The danger of over-fishing of the western mackerel stocks has been brought to my attention and I share the concern expressed by Deputies and <Col N="525" /> people outside the House.  The basic problem arises because of lack of EEC agreement on TACs and quotas in recent years.</P>
    <P>If agreement can be reached this year and in future years on the TACs recommended by the EEC scientific advisers, and these TACs are not exceeded, these valuable stocks will be safeguarded.  The continuation of the present situation could have serious consequences, but one member state is powerless to act without the agreement of the others.  We can only hope that good sense will prevail in 1982 and that agreement can be reached in good time on this year's TACs and quotas, not only for mackerel but for other species as well.  I understand that the Commission will be submitting proposals in these areas shortly for 1982.</P>
    <P>I have seen some reports of the outrageous over-fishing of TACs and quotas by other member states.  It is an area we are watching very closely.  There is a limit on what we can achieve on our own.  It is a matter which will have to be taken up vigorously with the Community, and I will certainly do that.</P>
    <P>Freezer trawlers have a role to play in the marketing of our mackerel catches until such time as shore facilities are adequate to process them.  Foreign freezer trawlers should be subject to licence or other such control.  My Department are examining this possibility, in consultation with the Commission whose approval is necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy highlighted the question of the quotas and the observance of the quotas.  I fully agree that the fishing quotas in themselves are not sufficient: they have to be monitored, lived within and observed.  The position is that agreement has not been reached on quotas within the EEC in recent years.  We have had virtually a free-for-all situation develop. This cannot be tolerated any longer and is one of the reasons we must reach early agreement on this matter.  Additionally we must ensure that any agreement reached is enforced and that the quotas laid down will be those implemented, nothing more.  Of course there are problems for ourselves also.  We must ensure <Col N="526" /> that we take our quotas because this agreement works in both directions.  We cannot complain about activities of other member states of the Community if we do not abide by the regulations ourselves. This is an area to which I shall be devoting special attention on my next visit to the EEC and I hope to achieve some satisfactory results in 1982.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies spoke about research on mariculture, aquaculture and fisheries generally.  Arrangements are being made at present to build a new all-weather fisheries research vessel of improved modern design in the Verolme Cork Dockyard. Of course the decision to build this vessel was taken by the last Fianna Fáil Government in 1980.  The vessel will complement the modern fisheries research centre staffed by the Department's scientific staff which was opened in 1978.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews referred this morning to the Shell Fish Research Centre at Carna, which is affiliated to University College, Galway.  This centre is funded by the National Board for Science and Technology, not by my Department. Apparently they have had their funds severely restricted by the previous Government. Consequently they have had to cut back on their research laboratory. Deputy Higgins spoke very eloquently here yesterday about the necessity to develop aquacultural and maricultural activities.  I must point out that he was involved in the Government which allowed the grants to be cut back on this very research centre in his constituency. Therefore there are contradictions there which are difficult to understand.  On the one hand he spoke very strongly yesterday in favour of the need for research and development.  Yet when the research was taking place funds were not provided by his administration.  I feel it necessary that I, as a new Minister, in a Department for a few days only should engage in some research for my own benefit in order to clear my mind as to what should be my policy in various areas.  I value Deputy Higgin's contribution.  I know there is tremendous potential here but I do feel that in recent months Deputy Higgins should have practised what he preaches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is definite scope for the development of mariculture particularly in shellfish and also for the development of natural shellfish beds.  My Department are actively engaged in this development and other research activities. An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are also actively involved by way of their capital grants scheme and technical advisory services.  Despite what has been said, reasonable progress has been made on maricultural developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins referred yesterday to the need for planning and that mariculture is one area in which proper planning is essential.  This has been the official approach.  I have noted very carefully the points made by Deputy Higgins about the number of agencies involved and possible legal difficulties.  Anybody who promotes any project involving structures on the foreshore is liable to the provisions of the Foreshore Act.  This applies to semi-State bodies also.  Similarly such promoters are bound by the provisions of the Planning Acts.  The Deputy appeared to be suggesting that maricultural projects should be exempt from these requirements. He may have one or two specific projects in mind in regard to which certain difficulties may have arisen.  If that is the case I should like to discuss them with him.  Certainly my staff will be available to talk about any difficulties the Deputy may have encountered in his constituency. We are having consultations with the Attorney General's Office about certain aspects of the maricultural legislation. These consultations should be concluded fairly soon.  In the meantime <Col N="528" /> if there are individual cases in which individual Deputies have encountered problems of one kind or another we shall be available to talk to them and ascertain whether such problems can be eliminated.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies were concerned, and correctly so, about harbour improvements.  Deputy Coughlan spoke at length about various harbours.  Other Deputies also spoke about harbour developments and improvements. Again, as part of the visit I announced yesterday to the major fishing centres and other areas, I shall have a look at all the places in respect of which applications are outstanding in an effort to see how they can be expedited within the limits of the present financial resources.  A sum of £4 million has been provided in the Estimate for this purpose, a major part of which is to be spent at Howth and Killybegs. But Cladagh na gCaorach&mdash;which sounds more like a place dealing with sheep than with fish&mdash;referred to by Deputy Coughlan will be given high priority.</P>
    <P>The previous Fianna Fáil Government made a commitment to grant-aid a dredging scheme for Burtonport and this commitment will be honoured.  I gladly accept Deputy Bellew's invitation to visit Clogher Head.  It is my intention to visit all of these places, commencing at Killybegs on Monday.  I hope to visit them all as soon as possible, meeting the various organisations there and to reap the benefit of their expertise and views.  From my experience in fisheries&mdash;and I was involved as an executive for a short time on the Fisheries Board and as a member of a conservation board for a long number of years&mdash;I feel the best advice always is that proffered by the fishermen themselves.  Therefore I hope that during my term in office I shall have the closest possible co-operation from them and benefit from their expertise which is gleaned from their practical, day-to-day operations.  That is the best advice anybody can receive.  I hope to benefit fully from such exchange of views between myself, the fishermen and their representatives.</P>
    <P>I spoke briefly yesterday about the <Col N="529" /> dumping of fish which was raised this morning by Deputy Deasy.  This is most undesirable and must cease.  I am personally concerned about this problem and have directed that every possible step be taken to ensure that dumping of withdrawn fish should not take place except where it is absolutely unavoidable.  Perhaps it would be appropriate to put this into historical perspective.  I might point out that in times of glut historically the way fishermen disposed of their surplus fish was at sea.  That was understandable because of the product's perishable nature and the tendency of fish landings to occur in gluts.  However, now that there is an intervention system in operation my aim is to reduce the dumping of fish at sea to an absolute minimum and, if at all possible, to eliminate it.  It must be within the capacity of all of us involved &mdash;and voluntary organisations and others were mentioned earlier&mdash;within the intervention system to devise a way of completely eliminating the dumping of fish and have the maximum number caught.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey spoke about the conservation and protection of the Shannon.  I have had a long association with the Shannon Fisheries on the conservation and protection of the Shannon.  There have been difficulties encountered at the mouth of the Shannon for many years because of the illegal usage of nets there. This constitutes a difficult task for the Limerick Regional Board and the Shannon Regional Board who have always been concerned and are fully commited to eliminating as far as possible, within the limits of their resources, this illegal fishing at the mouth of the Shannon which is damaging to the Shannon fisheries.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the Shannon Board and the ESB.  By their work in the fisheries at Parteen and their enlightened approach during the years since the Shannon fisheries were vested in the ESB they have helped considerably in the development of the Shannon salmon fisheries. Were it not for the fact that the ESB, through their fisheries manager and <Col N="530" /> their fisheries division, were so alive to the problems and so active in ensuring that proper steps were taken to conserve salmon stocks and to promote re-stocking in the Shannon, there would not be any salmon in the Shannon now.  From the taggings carried out by the ESB there has been evidence in recent years that the main bulk of stocks of salmon in the Shannon are hatchery stocks.  This is a cause of concern because the traditional Shannon salmon appears to be very scarce.  We are relying almost totally on the work of the hatcheries and the development work carried out by the ESB.</P>
    <P>One of the areas that will need to be looked at more closely is the involvement of the Fisheries Division in fish hatcheries and in the production of more stocks for rivers and catchments.  The Department will have to consider this matter carefully. We cannot have the ESB dealing totally with it.  I will direct more attention to this matter to see how we can help further with the development of hatcheries and restocking of the Shannon.  Yesterday I announced meetings with the new Central Fisheries Board and with the regional boards, I shall be having discussions with them immediately.  I will give high priority to the area of development which will be even more important in the future.  In the past we have tended to look more at conservation to protect existing stocks rather than the development of salmon and trout fisheries.  If action is needed in this area it will be taken.</P>
    <P>Deputies from all sides spoke about difficulties with regard to infrastructural developments which are impeding work on harbours.  Mention was made of bad roads and poor telephone communications. These and other factors in isolated western areas have been damaging not only to the development of fisheries but also to developments in other areas.  One of the major differences in policy between this Government and previous Coalition Governments has been that we have always had a very strong commitment to regional development.  The previous Government's treatment of our plans for decentralisation was a scandalous disregard for regional development. <Col N="531" /> The plans were at an advanced stage but they were scrapped by the Coalition Government. However, I will not dwell on that matter now as we are discussing a Bill dealing with sea fisheries.  Telecommunications, good roads, and the provision of water and lighting at piers and harbours are vital.  Under Fianna Fáil we will have a far better deal in these matters than was obtained during the term of office of the previous Government.  It is our intention to see that the strong regional policy we have always had will be developed further.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank Deputies for their good wishes on my appointment and to assure them that I am deeply committed to resolving the major problems that face the fishing industry now.  No effort will be spared by me to see that problems are dealt with.  I will do this to the best of my ability and the ultimate limit of my capacity.</P>

    <Title>Statute Law Revision Bill, 1981: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Doherty) Sean (Longford-Roscommon) Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill continues the process of removing from the Statute Book enactments which have become obsolete, irrelevant or unnecessary for one reason or another.  The repeal of archaic enactments is no mere academic exercise.  Its essential importance lies in easing the labours of all who have occasion to consult the law, whether as legal practitioners, administrators, businessmen or private <Col N="532" /> citizens.  It facilitates the compilation of an up-to-date index of the statutes in force and this, I trust, will be one of the chief results of the present Bill.  It would also facilitate the production of a new set of revised statutes, a long-term operation which one would hope, nonetheless, to set in train in the reasonable future.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the result of much patient research into the whole surviving body of statute law down to 1922.  In this sense it is unique in our jurisdiction.  An earlier statute, the Statute Law Revision (Pre-Union Irish Statutes) Act, 1962, revised &mdash;as its title implies&mdash;statutes of Irish Parliaments down to the Act of Union of 1800.  The Bill now before the House undertakes a further review of such statutes, but this is only a small part of its scope.  In the main, it is concerned with the repeal of unnecessary English and British statutes.</P>
    <P>Before going further, perhaps I should explain the use of the terms &ldquo;English&rdquo; and &ldquo;British&rdquo; as applied to the statute law.  The term &ldquo;English Statute&rdquo; refers to the statutes of the Parliament of England passed in the period 1226 to 1707. The term &ldquo;British Statute&rdquo; has commonly been used to describe statutes passed since the Union of England with Scotland in 1707, and that description is followed in the heading to Part III of the present Bill.  Our Interpretation Act, 1937, gives the term the narrower meaning of &ldquo;an Act of the Parliament of the late United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,&rdquo; and, of course, all the statutes in Part IV of the Schedule fall within this category.</P>
    <P>The italicised notes in the second column of the Schedule, which do not form part of the Bill, explain the reasons for the repeal of the enactments concerned. Terms used in these notes to indicate why a given enactment is being repealed are explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill.  In the great majority of cases the reasons for the repeal will be self-evident even on a cursory view of the statute.  Where further explanation seemed desireable it is added.  May I, at this point, assure any Deputy who is interested in any particular matter in the Bill that I will be happy <Col N="533" /> to arrange that an official from my office or from the Statute Law Reform and Consolidation Office will be available to give him a full explanation or supply him with such information as he may require?</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill gives life to the Schedule by providing for the repeal of the listed enactments, to the extent set out in the third column of the Schedule. It will be noted that, in Parts I and II, the enactments for repeal are termed &ldquo;statutes&rdquo; whereas in Parts III and IV they are referred to as &ldquo;Acts&rdquo;.  The reason is historical.  The term &ldquo;statute&rdquo;, which is nowadays used as equivalent to &ldquo;Act&rdquo;, was at one time taken as meaning all the enactments of one Session of Parliament, each enactment being referred to as a Chapter of the Statute, because the royal assent was given to them collectively. However, &ldquo;Act&rdquo; has long since been used to refer to each enactment separately and, when old statutes have been given short titles by modern enactments, the title always used the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As a further historical aside, may I recall one instance in our recent statute law in which the word &ldquo;Statute&rdquo;&mdash;and not &ldquo;Act&rdquo;&mdash;has been used in a Short Title, namely, the Statute of Limitations, 1957.  The practical, if possibly pedantic, explanation is that the expression &ldquo;statutes of limitation&rdquo; has always been in common, as well as legal, currency.</P>
    <P>Section 2 sets out limitations on the effect of the repeals.  The section is a form common to statute law revision Acts and may possibly be thought to be excessively cautious, in view of the explicit terms of section 21 of the Interpretation Act, 1937, subsection (1) of which states:</P>
    <P>(1)  Where an Act of the Oireachtas repeals the whole or a portion of a previous statute, then unless the contrary intention appears, such repeal shall not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  revive anything not in force or not existing immediately before such repeal takes effect, or</P>
    <P>(b)  affect the previous operation of the statute or portion of a statute <Col N="534" /> so repealed or anything duly done or suffered thereunder, or</P>
    <P>(c)  affect any right, privilege, obligation, or liability acquired, accrued, or incurred under the stattute or portion of a statute so repealed, or</P>
    <P>(d)  affect any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment incurred in respect of any offence against or contravention of the statute or portion of a statute so repealed which was committed before such repeal, or</P>
    <P>(e)  prejudice or affect any legal proceedings, civil or criminal, pending at the time of such repeal in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability, offence, or contravention as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, the section is a useful reminder of some important safeguards, notably that existing rules of law and equity and established practices and procedures, which may have derived from, or been confirmed by, any repealed enactment are not affected by the repeal.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Schedule is the result of a further revision of the pre-Union Irish Statutes which, as I have said, were the subject of the Statute Law Revision Act of 1962.  This was made necessary by the proposed repeal of pre-Union English statutes which were ordered to be observed in Ireland by royal writ or ordinance, that is, orders of the King in Council, or afterwards applied to Ireland by a statute of an Irish Parliament, such as Poynings' Act, 1495.  Where, therefore, an English statute is listed for repeal in Part II of the Schedule, its &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; counterpart is listed in Part I.</P>
    <P>The supposedly exhaustive <i>Irish Statutes at Large</i> (1310 to 1800) published by authority in 20 volumes omits all pre-1310 writs and ordinances and a considerable amount of post-1310 legislation as well.  Recourse has therefore been had to the Irish Record Office Series of Early Irish Statutes published in four volumes, the first three edited by Henry Berry and the fourth by James Morrissey in 1939.  A footnote at the bottom of the first page of the Schedule gives the references.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="535" /> Part III of the Schedule deals with statutes extended to Ireland by Irish statutes after the comprehensive Poynings' Act, 1495.  Those still enforceable are the Maintenance and Champerty Act, 1634, which relates to the illegal involvement in other persons' litigation for the sake of monetary gain and similar abuses, and Yelverton's Act, 1781, which applied a number of English statutes of which only those relating to the calendar now remain.</P>
    <P>The only statute in this group which calls for mention is the Act of Union. This Act was passed by both the Irish and the British Parliaments, although I am informed that only the British version was signed by the Crown.  Be that as it may, the Irish version was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act of 1962. The present Bill finally strikes the British version from the statute roll of this state. I trust that nobody&mdash;here or in any other place&mdash;will misunderstand our purpose: it is merely to expunge dead wood from the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with British statutes since the Union which applied to Ireland.  A word of explanation may be helpful in regard to one class of those statutes: namely, those concerned with the former United Kingdom Parliament. The Electoral Act, 1963, repealed most of the statutes relating to that parliament, although on a strict view it should be said that few of them applied to the Oireachtas of 1922 or the present Oireachtas established by the Constitution of 1937. They could not apply except by express adaptation, since the Oireachtas was in each case, a new institution.  However, by way of abundance of caution most of them were repealed, and for consistency others&mdash;relating in the main to eligibility of holders of certain offices for membership of the House of Commons&mdash;are now proposed for repeal.  They were all recommended for repeal by the Final Report of the Joint Committee on the Electoral Law, 12 July 1961.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, I feel sure, agree that this Bill, being a purely technical measure, is entirely non-controversial, though, as I hope I have indicated, a <Col N="536" /> highly desirable piece of proposed legislation. It is as such that I commend it to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>

      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to the Department of Justice and wish him every success in this onerous job which I have had experience of.  I promise him my consideration and my understanding while he is in charge of that very difficult office.  As the Minister stated, this is a non-controversial Bill but, nonetheless, it is highly desirable.  It raises questions as to future statute law revision and whether there should be a time limit, say 30 or 40 years, on Acts unless they are expressly renewed.  That suggestion might be worthy of consideration.  It would be remiss of me not to express loud words of praise of the officials of the Department who have worked so well over a long period to bring this important Bill before the Dáil.  They deserve great credit for their hard work.  Indeed, the work required some scholarship as well as legal knowledge. As this was a Bill I had intended promoting I do not think it would be reasonable of me to delay its passage through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister on his appointment and wish him the best of luck in carrying out the onerous tasks that lie ahead of him.  I welcome the introduction of the Bill which highlights the difficulties under which the legal practitioners here operate compared to their counterparts in the United Kingdom and other countries.  In those countries legal practitioners have available to them comprehensive and up-to-date textbooks which are issued regularly and are a key factor in the efficient and speedy disposition of the practice of the law.  Arising from the fact that we have a small population, relatively speaking, we have always had a difficulty in this regard because it was a costly operation to produce up-to-date legal textbooks that would put on hand readily to practitioners, business people and members of the <Col N="537" /> public a comprehensive and up-to-date statement of the law in a particular field.</P>
      <P>This measure will not in any way help to make up the lack that has been felt by practitioners here for quite a long time. Although welcome in its effect, nonetheless it is negative in its operation in the sense that it is directed towards cutting out dead wood in the system rather than introducing a codification that would be necessary if we were to reach a situation where summaries of the Irish law would be available to practitioners and members of the public.  We inherited the basis of Irish law in 1922 from the old English legislation and to a very large extent that forms the basis on which we operate here as amended by legal decision and Acts of the Oireachtas.  The number of textbooks forthcoming has been few and they are far between.  I would urge the Minister to take an interest in this matter in the time ahead and to ensure that funds are made available as far as possible to enable textbooks to be produced giving the up to date position of Irish law, a statement of Irish law.</P>
      <P>The key encyclopaedic work that is relied on in England is of course Halsbury's Encyclopaedia of English Law and practitioners here have perforce to have recourse to that.  It is not very satisfactory because English law has taken off in one direction since 1922 and in many respects our own law has taken off in a different direction although in many ways the two have operated in parallel.  I do not know if it would be possible to establish a commission that would lead to the publication of a comprehensive encyclopaedia of Irish law at present.  I realise it would be a costly operation but it would be a once-off operation and if the funds could be found to do that it would be well worth while.  Meantime, as an interim measure I would say that facilities at least should be given for the preparation of coda of law in each particular field so as to provide a simple and up-to-date statement of the position in the various branches of the law.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Taylor for their kind words of <Col N="538" /> welcome and for the recognition by Deputy Mitchell that it is a difficult Department.  I shall certainly endeavour to do what is best in the national interest and what is required in particular areas of responsibility in that Department.  This is legislation which was prepared for the House in Deputy Mitchell's term of office.  There is no conflict about the matter; it is a very technical piece of legislation. Individual Deputies may be interested in examining particular features of the Bill and the particular statutes that have been repealed.  If they wish to do that officials of my Department and from the law office will be made available to them.</P>
      <P>I note what Deputy Taylor has said and I shall certainly take his comments into consideration in any examination I make of the position.  I may add that this Bill is intended to go some distance along the line of thought the Deputy is pursuing. He was not present for the beginning of my Second Stage speech when I mentioned that this Bill first of all repeals archaic enactments and will facilitate the compilation of an up to date index of statutes in force.  Apart from the fact that statutes may be archaic it will remove many obsolete and irrelevant statutes from our law books.  That must be in the interests of the student of law and the practitioner and the general public.  In that respect&mdash;and I am sure Deputy Mitchell by his acquiesence today agrees with me&mdash;it is a very positive start at this time.  We had a 1962 Act which did much the same thing and 170 enactments were repealed at that time.  I was interested in the Deputy's remarks and will certainly bear them in mind in any further consideration being given along the lines the Deputy suggested particularly where the codification of law is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to enable part of the funds of suitors vested in the Accountant of the Courts of Justice to be withdrawn and applied towards the cost of carrying out repair and renovation work which is essential for the preservation of the Kings Inns building in Henrietta Street, Dublin.</P>
      <P>The funds of suitors are the cash and securities belonging to suitors and other persons which have been transferred to or paid into or deposited with the High Court.  These funds include the unclaimed dividends and balances to the credit of suitors and estates carried down for at least two centuries.  In the ordinary way these funds may be used only for the benefit of those entitled to them.  However, part of the funds is represented by unclaimed dividends and balances which have been accumulating over a long period.  These are known as dormant funds and may be defined more precisely as balances in accounts in the funds of suitors which have not been active for 15 years or more.  The funds of suitors are under the control of the High Court and subject to that control, are managed by and stand in the name of, the Accountant of the Courts of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total liability of the Accountant in respect of funds of suitors on 30 September 1980&mdash;the latest date for which there are published figures&mdash;was just over £49,505,000.  Assets held by the Accountant, consisting of cash and securities, amounted to £48,227,000 on that date. The difference between the amount of liabilities and assets on hands on 30 September 1980 &mdash; £1,278,000 &mdash; represents the aggregate of the moneys which have been withdrawn from the funds of suitors over the past 200 years under the authority <Col N="540" /> of various Acts of the Parliament of Ireland, the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Oireachtas.  All these Acts indemnified suitors for any loss which they might sustain by reason of the withdrawals, and these indemnities are backed by the Central Fund.  Another way of saying this is that a portion of the funds of suitors, at present amounting to £1,278,180, is not represented by cash or securities held by the Accountant, but simply by the liability of the Central Fund to indemnify suitors against any loss up to that amount.</P>
    <P>Moneys withdrawn from the funds of suitors under Acts passed before the establishment of the Oireachtas, were applied for such purposes as building and improving the Courts of Justice and enlarging the Law Library.  Coming up to modern times, withdrawals from the funds were authorised by the Oireachtas in 1959, 1963 and in 1966 as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;The Funds of Suitors Act, 1959 enabled a total of £323,000 to be withdrawn for three purposes, namely, to provide assistance towards the rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre, to finance repair and renovation of the buildings of the society of Kings Inns and to provide for the creation of a fund for the maintenance of the Society's Library.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The Funds of Suitors Act, 1963 authorised the release of a sum of £50,000 to help finance the rebuilding of the Cork Opera House.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The Funds of Suitors Act, 1966 authorised the release of £450,000 to help finance the cost of rebuilding the Abbey Theatre and the completion of the Cork Opera House.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, the total of the sums withdrawn to date from the funds of suitors is £1,278,000.  There remained, on 31 December 1981 in the dormant accounts assets consisting of £864,000 cash and securities nominally valued at £1,583,000 &mdash; market value £1,363,000. The yield from the securities is adding to the cash balances in the dormant <Col N="541" /> accounts at a rate of about £184,000 per annum at present.</P>

The world market for hops is extremely competitive with a tendency to oversupply and under EEC rules hops may be freely imported into the Community.

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the money owed to this country by the United Nations for services rendered by our troops; and the steps being taken to recoup this money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In replying to the Deputy I should like to distinguish between the costs arising out of Ireland's participation in the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and those resulting from Ireland's participation in other UN peacekeeping forces.</P>
      <P>The amount owed by the UN to Ireland for its participation in peacekeeping operations other than UNIFIL amounts to approximately £570,000.  The Deputy will be aware from replies to previous questions on this topic that the greater part of this amount has to do with certain pension awards which in many cases do not arise until some time after participation in a particular operation has ceased. The rest of the amount refers to claims for extra and extraordinary costs.  We are continually in contact with the United Nations about these claims which often take some time to be processed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards UNIFIL, the actual extra cost incurred by the State arising out of Ireland's participation in UNIFIL for the period May 1978, when Ireland joined UNIFIL to February 1982 is estimated at £12.80 million.  Payments from the UN to date total £10.30 million.  Thus the <Col N="553" /> amount outstanding at present would come to £2.50 million.</P>
    <P>It is estimated, however, on the basis of present reimbursements that £12.5 million will eventually be received by Ireland for the period May 1978 to February 1982.  Thus the net extra cost to the State for participation in UNIFIL to date would come to £300,000.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the estimated cost to the State arising out of Ireland's participation in UNIFIL has been reduced from £1.3 million in December 1980 to £300,000 at February this year.  This is principally due to the increase in the amount which troop-contributors are scheduled to be paid by the UN per man per month.  As mentioned in the reply to the Deputy in April 1981, this amount was increased from $680 to $950 at the 1980 General Assembly.  Ireland played a major part in the negotiations to bring about this increase.</P>
    <P>It is estimated, on the basis of present costs and reimbursements, that the overall extra cost to the State for participation in UNIFIL would continue to be reduced in the coming months and should in fact be eliminated in the near future.  I should like also to point out that the decision to increase our participation in UNIFIL by 70 troops should not have a deleterious effect on the elimination of the net extra cost to the State.</P>
    <P>As I have said, these estimates are based on present costs.  I would, however, assure the Deputy that I am keeping the matter under review to ensure as far as possible that the level of reimbursements keeps pace with any rising costs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister's statement that the deficit has been reduced.  When I put down the question the amount outstanding was more than £2 million, solely because the USSR and other Eastern bloc countries had failed to pay their proper proportions of the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The deficit has been reduced but I understand there is still difficulty in getting money due from all member states.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

      <P>Where no other channel is feasible or possible, our embassies can communicate with the family or relations of distressed Irish citizens abroad with a view either to conveying a very urgent message or to arranging for the transfer of funds to enable the individual concerned to return home.  In cases where financial assistance is required, my Department endeavour to obtain a lodgement of funds from relations or other sources nominated by the destitute person. Where, after full inquiry, funds cannot be obtained and where also the case is a genuine one of a person completely destitute and the circumstances are of an exceptional nature, payment can then be made by our embassies strictly on a temporary loan basis to enable the distressed person to return home immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the reason for the delay in deciding the ownership of Rockall and the surrounfing sea-bed; and whether negotiations with Britain on the matter have yet started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall from previous replies to questions on this matter that the Irish and British Government have agreed to refer the delimitation of the Continental Shelf to an independent settlement of disputes procedure in the form of <i>ad hoc</i> arbitration. Division of the Continental Shelf between the two countries has been the subject of negotiations since 1964.  When it became clear that agreement was not possible by way of negotiation the Government decided that the matter should be submitted to some form of third party settlement of a judicial nature.  In February, 1980 the British side finally agreed to submit the matter to <i>ad hoc</i> arbitration, a proposal first put forward by the Irish side in 1976, subject to agreement between the two parties on such matters as the location of the arbitration tribunal, its terms of reference and the regime to apply to the disputed area pending the final decision of the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then negotiations have been continuing at official level with a view to setting up the arbitration tribunal.  Of the different options open to the two sides, <i>ad hoc</i> arbitration offers the most appropriate form of procedure for settlement of this issue.  However, <i>ad hoc</i> arbitration by its nature means that there is no existing <Col N="556" /> institutional or procedural machinery which the parties can have recourse to, consequently a vast amount of work must be done before the arbitration proper commences.</P>
    <P>In addition it must be stressed that the delimitation covers the entire extent of the Continental Shelf contiguous to Britain and Ireland.  It is not concerned solely with the delimitation of the Rockall Plateau or exclusively with any single feature in isolation, such as Rockall, but involves the whole shelf in the north-west and in the Irish and Celtic Sea areas insofar as it is the natural prolongation of the landmass of two neighbouring states.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that this matter is progressing as rapidly as is prudent given its complexity and importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>The Government have made known their deep concern at events in Poland on a number of occasions.  On 23 December 1981 shortly after the imposition of martial law in Poland the Irish Ambassador in The Hague made a <i>démarche</i> on the instructions of the Government to the Polish Ambassador to Ireland who is resident in The Hague.  This <i>démarche</i> made clear the Government's concern at developments in Poland and specifically referred to the need for respect for trade union rights.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that my predecessor, Senator James Dooge, spoke in Seanad Éireann on 18 December to express the Government's deep concern at events in Poland and to call for restraint on the part of the Polish authorities and respect for basic human rights and freedoms.  The views expressed in this statement were repeated that same day by the head of the Irish delegation to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe meeting in Madrid.  On 5 January the Government issued a statement taking note of the position agreed by the Foreign Ministers of the Ten at their meeting on 4 January and condemning the repression of human rights in Poland.  The Government reiterated their position in a statement on 30 January to mark the Day of Solidarity with the Polish people.</P>
      <P>On 12 February Senator Dooge addressed the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe meeting in Madrid to outline the Government's position on Poland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="562" /> It is my intention to make my views on Poland known to the Polish authorities at every suitable opportunity.</P>
    <P>At their meeting on 4 January the Foreign Ministers of the Ten issued a statement noting &ldquo;with concern and disapproval the serious external pressure and the campaign directed by the USSR and other Eastern European countries against the efforts for renewal in Poland&rdquo;.  The Community has decided to take measures to restrict certain Soviet imports as a sign of its disapproval of that country's role in events in Poland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;made an individual protest because I thought it was a collective one on behalf of the EEC.  That was on 3 December.  In view of the fact that martial law has not been lifted as was promised at that time, will the Government renew their protest to the Polish Government and to the Russian authorities who seem to have a substantial say in the affairs of the Polish state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On 22 December the British Ambassador in Warsaw in his capacity as Presidency representative of the Ten and acting on the instructions of the Governments of the Ten made a <i>démarche</i> to the Polish authorities expressing the great concern of the Governments of the Ten at the situation in Poland.  Ireland does not have a resident ambassador in Warsaw and therefore the opportunity has not arisen to make representations there.  The Government are concerned that there should be an early end to martial law in Poland and call on the Polish authorities to release all those interned and resume a genuine dialogue with the Church and with Solidarity.  The Government are deeply disappointed by the absence of progress towards a return to a reform in Poland and a respect for human rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the form of membership or associate membership, if any, which the following islands have with the EEC: (a) Greenland, (b) the Faroe Islands, (c) the Isle of Man, (d) Cyprus, (e) Malta and (f) the Channel Islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding Greenland, the Faroe Islands, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands is governed by the Act concerning the conditions of accession and the adjustments to the treaties, which was adopted at the time of <Col N="566" /> accession to the European Communities of Ireland, Denmark and the United Kingdom.  Cyprus and Malta have no form of membership or associate membership with the Community but their relationship with the Community is governed by &ldquo;association agreements&rdquo;, which are largely concerned with trade.</P>
      <P>The details of all these cases are as follows: Greenland is part of Denmark and as such is part of the European Economic Community.  A Protocol &mdash; Protocol No. 4 &mdash; to the Treaty of Accession deals with matters of interest to Greenland. In 1979, Greenland was granted a form of home rule and it decided to hold a consultative referendum on 23 February 1982 on whether it should remain with the Community.  The result of that referendum showed a small majority in favour of withdrawal.  While this must be confirmed by the Greenland Parliament it now appears more than likely that Greenland will leave the Community.</P>
      <P>The Faroe Islands were granted a form of home rule by Denmark before that State joined the Community.  The EEC Treaty is not applicable in the islands and they have no formal relationship with the Community.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Act of Accession and Protocol No. 3 to that Act, the EEC Treaty is applicable to a limited extent in the Isle of Man.  In particular the EEC Common Customs Tariff and levies applicable in the United Kingdom in respect of agricultural produce from third countries must be applied.  Persons from the Isle of Man do not, however, benefit from the right to freedom of movement of persons and services within the Community.  The position of the Channel Islands is similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Relations between the EEC and Cyprus are governed by the 1972 association agreement which provides for two successive stages of association, the first providing for development projects and tariff concessions was to last until July 1977.  In view of the political situation on the island in the mid-seventies it was not possible to introduce the second stage of the agreement providing for transition to a customs union and consequently the first stage was extended by protocols, first <Col N="567" /> until 31 December 1979 and then until 1980 and 1981.  In November 1980 the EEC-Cyprus Association Council, as a result of improvements in the political situation on the islands, adopted a decision &ldquo;on the process into the second stage of the Association Agreement&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In 1982 both parties will begin negotiations on the conditions and procedures leading to the customs union.  Negotiations are now taking place to work out the trade arrangements to apply from July 1982 up to and including 1983.</P>
    <P>Relations between the EEC and Malta are governed by the 1970 Association Agreement which provides for the gradual introduction of a customs union in two stages.  The first stage for reduced duty is 70 per cent of the full rate for Malta's exports and 35 per cent for its imports.  In 1976 two protocols were signed with a threefold purpose: (1) to adapt the agreement to take into account the Community's enlargement, (2)  to extend the old agreement to include co-operation in the field of agriculture; and (3)  to provide financial assistance of 25 million EUA for Malta's economic and social development.  In 1977 another protocol extended the first stage of the agreement until 1980 and gave improvements in tariff concessions to Maltese industrial goods covered by the agreement.  In December 1980 the Council decided unilaterally to extend the first stage of the agreement until June 1981.  The Community is presently suggesting a three year extension of the first stage of the agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will consider an embargo on trade with South Africa in view of the United Nations' declaration of 1982 as the International Year of Mobilisation for Sanctions against South Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland supported the designation of 1982 as the International Year of Mobilisation for Sanctions against South Africa when the United Nations General Assembly considered a resolution on this last year.  In conformity with this attitude the Government will continue to press, both in the UN General Assembly and in the Security <Col N="572" /> Council, for co-ordinated international action which will provide effective pressure on South Africa to abandon apartheid.</P>
      <P>At the national level it is already Government policy not to promote trade or other economic relations with South Africa.  The Government do not consider that a unilateral ban on Ireland's trade with South Africa would be appropriate at present, or that it would be likely to achieve its objective of influencing the South African Government to end apartheid.</P>
      <P>The Government's view remains that, if such pressure is to be effective, it is important that there should be international agreement on the nature, scope and implementation of such measures. The Government have therefore supported, at the United Nations, calls for the adoption of selective measures, such as the strengthening of the existing arms embargo, the introduction of an oil embargo, and a ban on new investment in South Africa.  They will continue in their efforts to secure international agreement on the adoption of effective measures.  They will consider further, in the context of the International Year of the Mobilisation for Sanctions against South Africa, the possibilities of other action that may be needed to ensure that Ireland's opposition to apartheid is both as widely known and as effective as possible.</P>

      <P>On the point which has been raised, I have broken with tradition and elaborated enormously on it.  I will be taking up the matter later with the Ceann Comhairle and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      <P>It is unusual, to say the least, for two budgets to be introduced in Dáil Éireann within two months of each other.  This fact alone makes it inescapable that this budget will, in many respects, be similar to that which was presented on 27 January last.  In the fortnight available to me, however, I have tried to ensure that while the principal objectives of that budget &mdash;to reduce the current budget deficit and the overall Exchequer borrowing requirement&mdash;will be met, my budget will help those least able to bear hardship and will achieve its aims in a far less disruptive way.  Some of my excise taxation proposals have already been implemented and I shall be asking the Dáil to confirm these today.</P>
      <P Just="Center">MEDIUM-TERM PLANNING</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government's reappraisal of our economic and financial situation does not, of course, end today.  We have already initiated preparation of a plan for the management of the economy over the next four to five years.  It will incorporate <Col N="588" /> the policies considered necessary to deal with unemployment, prices, the balance of payments and Government borrowing. Its central objective will be to establish the conditions necessary for sustained growth in employment and I hope to have it completed by June 1982.</P>
    <P Just="Center">BUDGET POLICY</P>
    <P>The greatest problem facing this country today is unemployment and policy must have regard to this.  If we use the budget simply to achieve financial targets without regard to other consequences, there is a risk of serious damage to the economy.  Moreover, given the structure of our tax system and the narrowness of the tax base, such measures can cause sharp increases in the Consumer Price Index.  However inescapable this effect, it has in the past created pressure for higher wage increases, leading in turn to still higher inflation.  The essence of a successful budgetary policy is to find a balance between the need to keep borrowing as low as possible and the obligation to ensure that all opportunities for economic and social progress are fully exploited.</P>
    <P>The Government are, nevertheless, firmly committed to bringing the current deficit under control and gradually eliminating it, but our approach to that objective must be flexible and in tune with underlying developments at home and abroad.  Borrowing for capital investment is essential if we are fully to develop the economy and meet the challenge of unemployment.  We must provide more and more jobs.  We are in the unique position in the European context of having a young and growing population.  This is both a challenge and an opportunity. Above all else it imposes an obligation on us to create more employment for the additional numbers entering the labour market.</P>
    <P>A proper sense of priorities for capital investment must be established and resources concentrated on projects which will yield a worthwhile return.  This does not mean that essential social investment should not proceed, but it does mean that the social returns from such investment <Col N="589" /> must be clear and substantial in order to justify the burden of borrowing that it entails.</P>
    <P>Our problems in relation to the public finances are formidable, but not insurmountable. A sustained and businesslike approach across the broad sweep of public policies will, I believe, solve these problems without disruption of the economic and social life of the community and the Government intend to proceed in this fashion.</P>
    <P>It is no solution to our problems continually to bemoan the difficulties we face.  We must approach the situation in a spirit of confidence and well-founded realistic optimism.  If we are to make the progress that is necessary, we must go forward believing that we have the capacity to meet our aspirations.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS</P>
    <P>Before I turn to the details of today's budget, I should like to comment briefly on the economic outlook.  Prospects for a modest improvement internationally are good.  World oil prices have weakened recently.  In the EEC as a whole, inflation has fallen and business expectations have been gradually improving. The EEC Commission believes that an economic recovery is under way in Europe and it should gain momentum as the year progresses.</P>
    <P>In Ireland manufacturing output began to recover in August, 1981 and in December was almost 11 per cent higher than a year earlier.  Industrial exports in February were up 13 per cent in volume on February 1981.  In contast, imports in February showed little volume change over the position a year earlier &mdash; indeed, the volume of imports of consumer goods fell.  The seasonaly-corrected live register figure for February showed its first fall since last May.</P>
    <P>The international upturn should benefit growth and the balance of payments, provided our output is competitive and both the current budget deficit and over-all Government borrowing can be contained.</P>
    <P>I will be announcing specific measures to relieve unemployment later.  These <Col N="590" /> relate in particular to the building industry, where a significant part of the problem lies and where activity has the added attraction of a relatively low import content. The Government cannot, however, resolve the unemployment problem unaided.  Indeed, the benefits of this budget will be eroded if we continue to lose competitiveness.  I am, by acting directly on food subsidies, taking action to contain prices.  In turn we must look for moderation in pay settlements in all sectors.  There are some major settlements yet to be made in the present pay round and it is vital that these are not excessive.  It is simply not acceptable that even though the Government moderate price increases by subsidies and impose lower indirect taxes than in the January Budget workers should at the same time insist on obtaining the maximum possible income increases.  Unless those who are in employment acknowledge that pressing excessive demands simply means pricing new job-seekers out of employment, we shall make little progress.  The fact is that as a nation living standards can only be maintained and improved and employment safeguarded if we all make a contribution to achieving this objective.</P>
    <P>The natural concern of parents is the welfare of their children and most are ready to make sacrifices in order to enhance their prospects.  At the present time, many parents are understandably concerned about job prospects for their children and I am sure I am echoing their concern in saying that those of us who are already in jobs should do nothing to undermine their legitimate hopes.  Our principal aim should be to provide jobs for all our young people who want to work in their own country.</P>
    <P Just="Center">OPENING CURRENT BUDGET POSITION</P>
    <P>The opening deficit faced by my predecessor on 27 January was £933 million and he aimed to reduce this to £175 million. Apart from the delays in implementing the budget, the arithmetic must now be adjusted to take account of changes in both expenditure and taxation which I am proposing today.  The full <Col N="591" /> details of today's budget are listed in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.  I would now like to detail the adjustments which are being made to the earlier package.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REVISED EXPENDITURE ALLOCATIONS</P>
    <P Just="Center">SOCIAL WELFARE </P>
    <P>The improvements in welfare payments and increases in social insurance contributions announced in January are being given full effect in the Social Welfare Bill 1982, which has already been passed by this House.  As a result total welfare payments will increase by, for example, up to</P>
    <P>&mdash;£16.61 a week for a married couple with three children on disability or unemployment benefit, giving a total weekly flat-rate payment of £82.80,</P>
    <P>&mdash;£15.06 a week for a widow under 66 years with three children on contributory widow's pension, giving a total weekly figure of £75.10, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;£14.05 a week for a married couple, under 80 years, on contributory old age pension, giving a total weekly figure of £70.30.</P>
    <P>While these improvements are generous in the context of our present financial difficulties, the Government are satisfied that further action is required to address some of the more severe social problems to be found in the community.  Briefly, the main additional provisions I am making are as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Double Payment</i>
    </P>
    <P>While I will be detailing my tax proposals at a later stage, I may say at this point that the Government have decided not to proceed with the tax credit proposals in the 27 January budget.  The £4 million from the family income supplement <Col N="592" /> thus released will now be re-allocated to provide a double week's payment in September and December for the child dependants of weekly social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Separated wives and unemployment assistance</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am providing £200,000 in 1982 for the removal of the anomaly whereby married women who are separated from their husbands cannot qualify for unemployment assistance unless they have dependent children.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Accommodation of old people living alone</i>
    </P>
    <P>A special task force will undertake an emergency programme on a national basis to improve the living conditions of old people living alone in insanitary or unfit accommodation.  This programme will be financed from a special fund of £1 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National Community Development Agency</i>
    </P>
    <P>It has already been announced that the Government have decided to establish a national community development agency.  Two million pounds will be provided for this purpose in 1982.  As the published Estimates already provide £250,000 for an &ldquo;Anti-poverty agency&rdquo; the additional Exchequer cost is £1.75 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Medical Cards for Social Welfare old age pensioners</i>
    </P>
    <P>As a further contribution towards those in greater need, the Government have decided that all recipients of social welfare contributory and non-contributory old age pensions will be entitled to medical cards from 1 July next.  This concession is estimated to cost £2.2 million in a full year and £1 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Local Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>Support for the level of public services and the implementation of other improvements at local level are seen by <Col N="593" /> the Government to warrant additional allocations under a number of headings. There will be special emphasis on the Dublin area because of the severity of the social problems there.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Health Services and Education Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am providing additional Exchequer finance of £10 million in order to ease the financial constraints on the health services. These services will benefit further from £8 million additional buoyancy which has emerged recently in health contribution receipts and it will be possible to divert a further £10 million to hospital services within the revised total allocation.  The Exchequer grants to health agencies for health services will thus total £797 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on education services in the educational priority areas of urban centres will be increased by £200,000 to offset the particular disadvantages suffered by children in these areas.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Local Authorities' Non-Capital Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>Local authorities will be allowed to allocate 40 per cent of the proceeds of sale of local authority houses to housing maintenance this year.  This will produce an extra £6.6 million for this purpose. Prospective savings of the SDA loans scheme will offset any adverse effects on that scheme.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will also have available £2.9 million hitherto required as local contributions towards the cost of supplementary welfare allowances and arterial drainage.  This will help relieve pressure on local authority finances.  Of this sum, £2.3 million will be financed from central funds, the remainder being secured by a marginal reduction in drainage services provided by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Local Authorities' Capital Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>A sum of £1.5 million is being provided for a revolving fund which will enable local authorities to acquire, rehabilitate and sell currently run-down residential properties.  The proceeds of sales will be available for the purpose of further acquisitions <Col N="594" /> and renovations and this process will continue indefinitely.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Dublin Corporation Non-Capital Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>Because of particular housing maintenance problems in Dublin city, the Government have decided that the corporation should be enabled to spend a further £750,000 for this purpose.  An additional £2.5 million is being made available to the Corporation to increase its workforce from 150 to 500 under the Environmental Improvement Scheme and a special allocation of £20 million is being made to supplement the Corporation's resources for their normal services in 1982.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Dublin Corporation Capital Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>An additional £14 million will be made available to Dublin corporation for house construction, especially for urban renewal purposes.  This will bring the corporation's allocation to £76 million for 1982.  If additional work this year warrants it, a further allocation up to a maximum of £91 million may be made.</P>
    <P>The corporation will also be given £1 million to instal facilities in substandard corporation dwellings which at present lack bathroom facilities.  The corporation will be enabled to purchase Shandon Park for general amenity purposes and a sum of £200,000 is being set aside for this.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Dublin Inner City Development Authority</i>
    </P>
    <P>The need for urban renewal is particularly acute in Dublin because of its scale. The Government have decided that a development authority will be established for the inner city with wide-ranging responsibility and a budget of £2 million. There is already a provision of £0.3 million for this general purpose in the Estimates and the balance of £1.7 million will be provided as capital funds.  It is envisaged that the lessons learned in Dublin will serve as guidelines for urban renewal programmes in other towns and cities.</P>

      <i>Derelict Sites</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>As a disincentive to dereliction, the Government have decided to introduce a special charge on derelict sites.  The precise details of the new charge have yet to be worked out but it will be designed to discourage both the hoarding of property for profit and the resulting urban blight.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Office Developments</i>
      </P>
      <P>I also propose to introduce a special levy on office developments, the proceeds of which would be used directly to finance urban renewal.  The accumulation of sites for this kind of development &mdash; much of which is let at high rents &mdash; is itself a contributory cause of urban blight and it is, therefore, only reasonable that these projects should bear extra taxation which will contribute to maintainance and restoration of the urban environment.</P>
      <P>DECENTRALISATION</P>
      <P>In October 1980, the Government announced a detailed programme for relocating Government offices.  Considerable progress had been made with site acquisition, design-work and planning before we left office.  The Minister for the Public Service is now reviewing that programme with a view to getting it under way as soon as possible, in consultation with the staff interests.  Sufficient funds are already available in the Estimate for the Office of Public Works to cover expenditure likely to arise this year.</P>
      <P>OTHER CURRENT EXPENDITURES</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the foregoing, I am providing for other current expenditure items not in the January budget.  Details of these will be found in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.  Some discharge specific undertakings which this Government gave before assuming office.  I might mention in particular a provision of £34.3 million to maintain food subsidies at their existing levels, the restoration of the £3,000 mortgage subsidy for single people at a cost of £1 million in 1982, the <Col N="596" /> provision of £400,000 for improvements in the disadvantaged areas scheme and the provision of an extra £2.5 million for the recruitment and equipment of extra gardaí.</P>
    <P>Other expenditures arise from decisions which the Government have taken since assuming office.  Among these are some £16 million I am providing for CIE, the bulk of which arises because of the decision to freeze fares for the rest of 1982.</P>
    <P>I am also making available £4 million for improvements in the employment incentive scheme.  The terms of the scheme, which has been in operation since 1977, are being made more attractive by increasing the rates of premia and lengthening the period for which they may be paid.  The weekly premium for adults is being increased from £20 to £30 and the premium for young persons is to increase from £14 to £25.  The maximum period during which premia may be paid is being more than doubled, from 24 weeks to 52 weeks.  I am consulting the Minister for Labour to see if further improvements to this scheme can be devised which will place in gainful employment more of those who are now unemployed.</P>
    <P>A final amendment of current expenditure provisions which I should mention relates to the reduced interest rate scheme for farmers in severe financial difficulties, which will come into operation on 1 April.  The State contribution to this scheme will be made mainly through the tax code but some direct Exchequer payments are required.  The original provison for these payments was £4 million. This can now be reduced to £1.5 million for this year because of the later starting date.</P>
    <P>The net additional non-capital expenditures which I am providing for today bring the total estimate of current spending for the year to £5,949 million.  This is 24 per cent above what was actually spent on current services in 1981 and represents a substantial real increase.  I am determined that this total will not be exceeded during the course of the year and I will be bringing proposals before the Government to ensure this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> CAPITAL EXPENDITURE</P>
    <P>In addition to the capital provisions for local services I have already mentioned, the Government propose to make a number of further changes in the allocations for capital expenditure proposed by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National Enterprise Agency</i>
    </P>
    <P>As already announced, the Government do not intend to proceed with the establishment of the National Development Corporation.  Instead, the National Enterprise Agency, which was set up in June 1981, will be developed.  The objective of the agency is to provide sustainable employment through the commercial exploitation of new opportunities, especially in advanced technology and native resources.  I am providing allocations of £5 million capital and £0.25 million current for the agency in 1982.  Ministerial responsibility will rest with the Minister for Industry and Energy.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Whitegate Oil Refinery</i>
    </P>
    <P>Following the agreement to purchase Whitegate Oil Refinery for operation by the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, I am providing £10 million for its purchase, overhaul and start-up costs and for operating costs during the period until the refinery begins trading again.  By then the Government expect that the INPC will have been established by statute.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Restoration of SDA loans to single persons</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have already indicated that the £3,000 mortgage subsidy for single people is being restored.  I am also restoring their eligibility for SDA loans, at a cost of £2 million this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Prisons</i>

    <P>The IDA, in collaboration with Fóir Teoranta, are making every effort to organise a restructuring of Clondalkin Paper Mills and discussions are taking place at present with interested parties. Pending developments, it is not possible to make any further disposition, but the question of budgetary provision does not arise at this stage as the IDA and Fóir Teoranta can operate within the overall allocations set for them.</P>

      <i>Restoration of IDA re-equipment grants</i>
    </P>
    <P>The previous Government decided to discontinue the IDA's scheme of re-equipment grants, except in so far as the food-processing sector is concerned.  In the normal course I would expect firms to upgrade their technology out of existing profits, especially given the generous tax allowances which apply to the replacement investment.  In view of the difficult economic environment in which many firms are operating at the moment, however, the Government have decided to restore the re-equipment grants regime with effect from 1 April.  The existing provision for the IDA includes a substantial element for re-equipment commitments already undertaken and it is not expected that the restoration will require an increase in the IDA allocation for 1982.</P>

      <i>Agriculture</i>
    </P>
    <P>Agriculture is still our single most important industry and the setbacks which it has suffered in recent years have had adverse repercussions throughout <Col N="599" /> the economy.  In the interests of national economic development the Government attach the greatest importance to ensuring that the stimulus to the farming community to develop and expand is not lost. Accordingly grants under the farm modernisation scheme are being restored from a current date to their pre-September 1981 levels at a cost of £4.0 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>The EEC Agricultural Price Review for 1982 has not yet been completed.  The Government will continue their best endeavours to ensure that it is completed quickly and with satisfactory results.</P>

      <i>Connacht Regional Airport</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have already indicated that the Connacht regional airport is to be completed.  Work on the construction of the airport will continue as planned by the company, which has indicated that it will not require any increase this year in the Exchequer allocation of £4.35 million already provided.  The project is being carried out under the technical supervision of a steering committee on which Aer Rianta is represented and is expected to be completed in 1984.</P>

      <i>Development of full deep-water berthing facilities at Ringaskiddy, Co. Cork</i>
    </P>
    <P>In recent years there has been heavy State investment in developing Cork Harbour as a location for heavy industry. One facility which has not yet been provided is a new deep-water harbour down-river. I am providing £2 million to enable work to begin on this project in 1982.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Provision for building and construction</i>
    </P>
    <P>In order to make inroads as quickly as possible on the high level of unemployment, I am providing an overall boost to <Col N="600" /> building activity of £50 million.  Of this amount £21.7 million is included in expenditure I have already announced in respect of local authorities, including urban renewal schemes, the special fund for accommodation for old people and prison building.  I propose to allocate the balance of £28.3 million as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;An extra £7.8 million is being made available for sanitary services. The main object of this will be the release of a number of urgent major schemes which up to now have been held up for lack of funds.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The provision of an extra £1 million for the fire services has also been approved, enabling the current programme of improvements to continue.</P>
    <P>&mdash;An additional £10 million is being provided for road improvements to supplement the existing provision of £70 million.  Priority in the allocation of the extra £10 million will be given to the intensification of the existing programme of major improvements to national roads.</P>
    <P>&mdash;An allocation of £2 million is being made for widening the house improvement grants scheme to provide for repairs to the basic fabric of the house, a provision which should be part of any worthwhile house improvement scheme.</P>
    <P>&mdash;An allocation of £4.5 million is being made for local authority housing over and above the special allocation of £14 million to Dublin Corporation.  The combined effect of these allocations will be to boost considerably the local authority housing programme and give much-needed employment in that sector.</P>
    <P>&mdash;An addition of £3 million to the capital allocation for Education will allow an acceleration of the second-level school building programme. New projects will <Col N="601" /> include secondary, vocational and community schools.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that these allocations should have an immediate effect on building activity and consequently on employment levels in the building sector. The net effect of all of these adjustments is to increase the 1982 Exchequer borrowing requirement for capital purposes by almost £58 million to £1,004 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TAXATION</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question of taxation. I propose to implement the tax proposals put forward in January, subject to certain changes which I will shortly outline.  It would not be practicable at this stage to prepare an alternative tax package for 1982.  Before indicating the details of the tax measures, however, I think it necessary to emphasise that our present taxation structure places severe constraints on the freedom of manoeuvre of any Minister for Finance.  Our heavy reliance on indirect taxation for revenue purposes, for example, can cause problems for the industries affected because of its impact on the volume of sales.  From the Exchequer's viewpoint, if higher taxes lead to diminishing returns, then they simply defeat the purpose for which they are introduced.</P>
    <P>This reliance on indirect taxation is, however, the result of past policies which have deliberately exempted or relieved whole sectors of the economy&mdash;and many individuals&mdash;from the rates of taxation normal in other countries, in the interests of economic development.  The limits of this policy are now being approached and it must be accepted that in future the tax net will have to be widened significantly and a higher proportion of tax revenue will have to come from direct taxation.  It follows that we must also reassess critically the generous reliefs and allowances which are available at present.  The Government are looking forward to the views of the Commission on Taxation on these matters; I understand that a report will be available shortly.</P>
    <P>The corollary of widening the tax base is the obligation to develop a more equitable <Col N="602" /> tax system.  There is considerable public dissatisfaction with present arrangements and there is general agreement that we need to achieve a fairer distribution of the burden of taxation.  A commitment to equity also demands further progress in combatting tax avoidance and tax evasion.  There is still a considerable loss of revenue because of these practices and the result is that the honest taxpayer has to contribute substantially more than his fair share.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Income Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have decided against changing the present structure of income tax in order to apply tax credits.  A switch to tax credits for the next income tax year at this stage would merely give rise to enormous administrative confusion, with little result to show for it.</P>
    <P>It is intended, therefore, to continue with the present structure of tax bands and allowances, but changes are being made in order to achieve broadly the same effect for individual taxpayers as under the earlier proposals.  As the House is aware the Social Welfare Bill provides for the implementation in full of the improved social welfare children's allowances.  The £9.60 weekly payment for spouses who work in the home will not, however, be implemented.  The response to this scheme has illustrated clearly that the general public saw no merit in a cumbersome and complex scheme which merely transferred money from one spouse, via the Revenue Commissioners, to the other.</P>
    <P>That scheme included a family income supplement estimated to cost £4 million this year.  This supplement cannot be operated outside a tax credit system and, as I have already mentioned, I am allocating the money instead to social welfare. Thus, the whole amount set aside in January for income tax improvements is being provided again in this budget and is being applied to achieve substantially the same redistributive effects for lower and middle income groups.</P>
    <P>While continuing the present income tax structure, I propose to increase the personal allowance from £1,115 to £1,450 <Col N="603" /> for single persons and from £2,230 to £2,900 in the case of married couples. This represents an increase of 30 per cent. The bands of income taxable at 35 per cent will be reduced to £3,000 in the case of single and widowed persons and to £6,000 in the case of married couples. With these changes, it is possible to achieve substantially the same effect as the tax credit proposals of 27 January, but without any of the complexity which they would have entailed.</P>
    <P>The allowance for widowed persons will be increased to £1,950.  An additional allowance for one-parent families was introduced in 1979 and now stands at £650.  While this allowance has provided valuable relief to these families, I believe that further assistance is necessary.  I am, therefore, providing an increase of £300 in the case of a widowed person and an increase of £800 for other single parents. As a result of these changes, widowed parents and single parents will now be in receipt of allowances equivalent to the married allowance.  Widows will continue to qualify for the married allowance in the year of bereavement.</P>
    <P>I am also improving the exemption limits for those on low incomes.  The limit for single and widowed persons will be increased from £2,000 to £2,200 and from £4,000 to £4,400 for married couples Marginal relief will continue for those whose income does not greatly exceed these amounts.  These changes will remove about 24,000 low-income taxpayers from liability.</P>
    <P>The elderly are a specially-deserving section of the community and I propose to provide income tax relief for them in several ways.  In addition to the increase in the age allowance and the tax allowance for rent on private tenancies proposed on 27 January, I am also improving the age exemption limits by £200 for single and widowed persons and by £400 for married couples.</P>
    <P>The changes in allowances, exemption limits and rate bands will cost £39 million in 1982 and £61 million in a full year.  As a consequence of the change in the income tax reliefs for personal loan interest announced on 27 January, some <Col N="604" /> amendments may also be necessary in the provisions relating to tax relief for preferential loan interest.  I am looking at this matter in the context of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Taxation of Short-Term Social Welfare Benefits</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government will not go ahead with the earlier proposal to tax short-term social welfare benefits.  Such a tax would impose an unfair burden on many who are unfortunate enough to fall ill or to be made redundant and in any event it would be extremely difficult to administer the tax properly.  I have no doubt that there are many cases where the existing provisions encourage absenteeism and reduce the incentive to work, but this does not warrant the general imposition of a tax on those who are in reduced circumstances and have no choice in the matter.  The question of reforming the current arrangements will, however, be pursued in other ways.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Private use of a motor-car</i>
    </P>
    <P>A number of changes were proposed on 27 January designed to bring about a more rational approach to the taxation and use of motor-cars.  One of these concerned the arrangement under which a director or employee has the private use of a company car.  At present, this benefit is completely undervalued for income tax so that what is, in effect, substantial additional remuneration escapes taxation. The exploitation of this tax advantage had become widespread among employees who have little, if any, business travel to do and it is an observable fact that the cars so supplied are bigger and more expensive than the average. Every car, every spare part and every drop of fuel has to be imported and I see no justification for providing unnecessary encouragement to his form of motoring at a time when our balance of payments deficit is giving much cause for concern.</P>
    <P>It was proposed in the January budget, as an interim measure, to increase the annual valuation of the use of a motorcar from 12½ per cent to 20 per cent of the cost of the car to the employer.  I have taken a fresh look at the problem and I <Col N="605" /> am satisfied that a new approach, based on the value of the benefit of the car to the employee, should be taken.  In future, the taxable benefit will be based on a sliding scale related directly to the original market value of the car and varying according to whether the costs involved are borne partially or totally by the employer.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that it might be unduly disruptive to make this change in a single step.  I propose, therefore, to move in two stages to this new basis.  For 1982-83, the taxable benefit will be calculated at half the full rates proposed, while the full rates will come into operation in 1983-84. Since most of these cars are replaced at two or three-year intervals this gives ample time to those concerned to decide their own priorities in the matter.  The details of the scales of charge are set out in the &ldquo;principal Features&rdquo;.  These are designed to ensure that those with a substantial business mileage will be fairly treated.  In particular, those with a very high business mileage, such as commercial travellers, will be given further relief, which will in effect exempt them from this charge.  The yield from this change is expected to be about £2 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Road Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am proposing that the changes in road tax announced in the January Budget will be implemented with effect from 1 May 1982.  The details are set out in the &ldquo;Principal Features&rdquo;.  The extra yield is estimated at £10.5 million in 1982 and £15.9 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Insurance Levy</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is proposed also to impose a levy on certain insurance transactions with effect from 1 August.  The levy will be at a rate equivalent to 1 per cent and will be imposed on premium income from domestic business excluding medical insurance.  It is intended that the levy will be collected as a stamp duty on the basis of quarterly returns from the insurance companies.  The yield in 1982 will be £2.25 million and the full year yield will be about £9 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" />
      <i>Banks' Levy</i>
    </P>
    <P>The levy on the banking sector for 1982 will be £20 million.  The details will be published later.  I see these levies as a temporary arrangement and I will be considering in due course proposals for the introduction of a new permanent system of taxation of financial institutions when the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation become available.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Payment Dates for Corporation Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>The due dates for payment of both first and second instalments of corporation tax will be brought forward by three months.  In addition, the grace period before interest is charged on tax overdue will be reduced from two months to one. The combined effect will be that the first instalment will be payable not later than seven months after the end of the accounting period and the second instalment seven to 16, rather than the present 11 to 20, months after the end of the accounting period.  These changes will bring an additional revenue of £36 million into 1982.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have looked at the proposals for capital taxation made on 27 January and I have decided to make some changes. First, the commencement date for all the capital gains tax proposals will be 26 March, instead of 28 January.  Second, the tax treatment of all short-term capital gains will be altered.  These gains are akin to income and should be taxed at higher rates than gains made in the longer term. I am proposing, therefore, that gains realised within one year of acquisition will be charged at 60 per cent and gains realised within two or three years of acquisition at 50 per cent.  Third, I am increasing the rate of taxation on gains from disposals of development land.  In January, it was proposed that such gains, including gains made by companies, would be liable to a special capital gains tax at a rate of 45 per cent, with certain restrictions on the application of indexation relief, roll-over relief and the right to set off losses.  I intend to implement <Col N="607" /> these proposals but I will provide that the normal rate will now be 50 per cent instead of 45 per cent.  Gains within one year of acquisition will be liable at the new 60 per cent rate for such short-term gains.  There will be no change in the proposed 40 per cent rate for compulsory acquisition cases save where the new proposals for taxing short-term gains apply.</P>
    <P>The 27 January budget also proposed a special capital acquisitions tax on discretionary trusts.  I have considered this approach and have concluded that this would be an insensitive and over-simplified approach to the problem.  I am, therefore, asking the Commission on Taxation to make a special examination of this area and to recommend measures.</P>
    <P>The delay in implementation of the new capital gains tax proposals together with the deferral of the proposed tax on discretionary trusts will reduce the additional yield from capital taxation for this year from £6.5 million to £2.7 million. This new package, however, will bring in over £11 million extra next year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Excise Duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>A number of excise duty changes were introduced from 13 March 1982 by Government Orders under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, as amended.  This mechanism was used to minimise the revenue lost by the delay in implementing the budget and its use was entirely consistent with legislation passed without opposition by the Oireachtas.  The main duties involved are alcoholic drinks, tobacco and cars over 16 horsepower. The yield from these changes is estimated at £51.4 million in 1982 and £71.3 million in a full year.  The House will today have the opportunity to debate a motion noting these changes.</P>
    <P>I propose also to implement the other excise duty changes which were put before the House on 27 January, including a duty-based tax increase of 8p per gallon on petrol, road diesel and liquid petroleum gas used in road vehicles. Which will have immediate effect.  These changes will yield £21.1 million in 1982 and £24.7 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="608" /> The excise duty increase on petrol, road diesel and LPG will take effect from midnight tonight, but increases in the price of petrol must await a new maximum prices order.  This will be made by the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism who will determine the implementation date.  However, if oil prices decline further during this year, it is my intention to look again at the whole question of the appropriate level or taxation on petrol and other hydrocarbon products.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Value-Added Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>There will be no VAT imposed on clothing and footwear.  The other VAT changes in the 27 January proposals will be implemented, though the date of implementation of the new 18 per cent and 30 per cent VAT rates will now be 1 May 1982 and the extension of VAT to certain services which are at present exempt will now take place on 1 September 1982.  Certain professional services provided to farmers and fees on the sale of agricultural land will, however, attract the special low effective VAT rate of 3 per cent.  These changes will yield additional revenue of £71.3 million in 1982 and £147.7 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>There are, however, two additional changes which I propose.  I have been concerned for some time about the application of VAT to books, especially school books.  The proposed new rate of 18 per cent would be particularly severe in this area, so I propose to move all books to the zero rate of VAT from 1 May 1982. This will cost £2.5 million in 1982 and £4.9 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>VAT on Imports</i>
    </P>
    <P>As was stated in our policy document, VAT is to be imposed on imports at the point of entry.  VAT-registered firms may at present, in general, import goods without payment of VAT and account for it subsequently in their normal VAT returns.  I propose to change this system to require VAT to be paid at the end of the normal customs duty deferment period, that is on the 15th day of the month following importation.  This <Col N="609" /> change will remove the advantage which imports are seen to have over purchases of domestically-produced goods.  The change will take effect from 1 September 1982.  Details of how it will operate will be included in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>This change will result in a gain of about £140 million for the Exchequer in 1982, since it will involve earlier payment of VAT.  This includes some extra revenue from reducing evasion of VAT on imports and reducing tax losses arising from taxes unpaid in insolvencies.  There will also be some gain from a reduction in arrears of VAT.  If the change in relation to VAT on imports gives rise to financing difficulties for some firms, then I will look at the possibility of arranging that the Industrial Credit Company could make loan finance available.</P>
    <P>Given the desirability of reducing the current budget deficit, the Government had little option but to apply this VAT charge to all imports.  Taxation on the &ldquo;old reliables&rdquo; has been pushed to the limit and the two main VAT rates are already being increased substantially. The only alternative source of substantial immediate revenue would be income tax increases, which would have borne heavily on the PAYE worker and would be unacceptable to this Government at this time.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Foreign Travel Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>The proposal by the previous Government to impose a £20 charge on each person leaving the State on a chartered aircraft will not be implemented.  This would have discriminated against one form of foreign travel and, in particular, would have had a significant effect on certain disadvantaged groups.  It is proposed instead to spread the tax over all travellers, by applying a charge, at the rate of £3 per passenger for air and international sea routes and £2 for cross-channel sea routes, on all air and sea passengers who purchase their ticket in Ireland. Accordingly the tax will not apply to most foreign tourists and business persons visiting the State.  The tax will apply from 1 September 1982 and is estimated to yield some £1 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="610" />
      <i>Dating of Budget Changes</i>
    </P>
    <P>A number of the income and capital taxation measures announced on 27 January were to take immediate effect. Where these measures are incorporated in today's Budget, they will now take effect from a current date.  It would be inappropriate to backdate their introduction as this would, in effect, correspond to retrospective taxation.  The delay in bringing these measures into effect will result in a revenue loss of approximately £2½ million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NON-TAX REVENUE</P>
    <P>
      <i>Bord Gáis Éireann Surplus Profits</i>
    </P>
    <P>An Bord Gáis Éireann have begun to generate substantial surplus profits.  In line with enabling provisions in the Gas Act 1976, arrangements are being made for the transfer to the Exchequer from Bord Gáis in 1982 of £28 million, which will be treated as non-tax revenue.  This will in no way inhibit the board's ability to finance adequately their investment programme, including the construction of the Cork-Dublin pipeline.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Other Non-Tax Revenue</i>
    </P>
    <P>As already announced, the increases in Post Office charges included in the January budget are being implemented from 1 April next and will yield £38 million in revenue to the Exchequer in 1982.  The decision to maintain a 12 per cent interest rate on Exchequer advances for SDA loans will, however, cost £0.85 million in 1982.</P>
    <P Just="Center">INCREASED TAX BUOYANCY</P>
    <P>Arising partly from the delay in implementing the budget, but principally because of the different pattern of taxation involved in today's budget as compared with the original proposals, increased tax buoyancy is estimated at £45 million.  The bringing forward of the date of payment of corporation tax, the imposition of VAT on imports at point of entry and the transfer of surplus profits <Col N="611" /> from Bord Gáis Éireann will not materially affect purchasing power in the economy, whereas the removal of food subsidies and the imposition of VAT on clothing and footwear would have had a negative impact on tax buoyancy.  Much of the increased expenditure which I have announced will also generate increased taxation.  Accordingly the estimate of £45 million for increased tax buoyancy is soundly based.</P>
    <P Just="Center">DEFICIT AND BORROWING REQUIREMENT</P>
    <P>The current budget deficit planned in the 27 January budget was £715 million. I have today added £110 million to the expenditure side of the budget.  On the revenue side of the budget, the net increase is £146 million which, taking account of the net increase in expenditure of £110 million, results in a current budget deficit of £679 million or 5.6 per cent of GNP.  This compares with an outturn for 1981 of £802 million, or 7.9 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>The overall Exchequer borrowing requirement emerges at £1,683 million as compared with £1,661 million planned in January.  This marginal increase in the borrowing requirement is more than justified by the impact on the economy of the additional expenditure involved.  At £1,683 million, or 13.9 per cent of GNP, this requirement compares more than favourably with the 1981 outturn of £1,722 million or 16.9 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>The planned current budget deficit and borrowing requirement represent a significant real improvement on the 1981 outturn and are an earnest of this Government's commitment to bring the public finances under control on a phased basis having regard to the needs of the economy.  The improvements in the economy which the budget will allow should generate a sound basis for further progress in this area in the years ahead. The maintenance of progress will, however, require a sustained, businesslike approach across the broad sweep of public policies and the Government intend to apply this.  I should like to emphasise <Col N="612" /> that the Government will have to take an extremely restrictive line on all requests for additional expenditure or for further taxation reliefs.  The scope for any relaxation of financial discipline simply does not exist.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONCLUSION</P>
    <P>As compared with the proposals of 27 January, today's budget will have a decidedly favourable impact on employment. The removal of VAT from clothing and footwear, the imposition of VAT at the point of import and the maintenance of food subsidies will sustain purchasing power and protect the position of home industries.  The increased capital allocations, particularly those for the building industry and local authorities, will give a positive stimulus to employment which will also be helped by the Employment Incentive Scheme.  Employment will be a central element in the medium-term plan which is being prepared.</P>
    <P>The increases in prices as a result of today's budget will be considerably less than those planned in the January budget.  The CPI effect is estimated at 2¾ per cent compared with the 4¾ per cent increase in prices which would have resulted from the January proposals.  This will help to lessen inflation and encourage moderation in pay expectations.  The balance of payments will also be improved through better export performance and all-round competitiveness.  I estimate that, taking into account the budget changes, GDP growth this year will be higher than last year.</P>
    <P>This Budget represents a fair balance between controlling the public finances and giving a stimulus to economic activity and employment.  The extra taxation is distributed as equitably as possible, with the greater burden being imposed on those who are best able to pay.  The generous social welfare changes provide considerable improvements for those who need help most.  The budget is, therefore, a sensible response to the present difficult situation.  It will create more confidence in this country, both at home and abroad, and it will provide a strong impetus for <Col N="613" /> greater and more stable economic progress.</P>
    <P>The immediate task facing the Government is to nurse the economy through the present difficult economic period.  While we cannot expect dramatic improvements in the short term, we have every reason to feel confident about the future. Our economy is fundamentally sound and it has the capacity to grow steadily. We have assets such as a young, growing and educated labour force which are the envy of many other countries.  We must, <Col N="614" /> however, go forward prudently and we must acknowledge that the correction of our public finances has to be a high priority in the immediate future whether we like it or not.  This will require acceptance of the fact that we cannot sustain continuing increases in living standards, irrespective or our national output or productivity. It is on this basis, and not either on false hopes or on exaggerated pessimism, that we can advance with justified confidence in our own abilities to secure a better future for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this budget will be to increase pressure for higher interest rates and for the maintenance of higher interest rates by increasing the working capital demands of industry necessitated by industry having to pay extra money this year in the form of advance value-added tax payments and advance corporation profits tax payments.  These extra demands are being made in what is wholly an artificial transaction to bring down this year's deficit without taking any account of the effects that will be felt next year when as a result of these measures the deficit will be greater than it is now.  This will force additional demands on our banking system and will put at a disadvantage ordinary borrowers who need working capital to expand their industry, who need money for investment or even, perhaps, for building a house.</P>
      <P>In addition, this budget renders much worse the situation of low-income people at work.  It proposes to abolish one of the most progressive measures introduced in our tax system in recent times.  I refer to the family income supplement which provided additional money for people at work.  Unfortunately, in the past this State has concerned itself with additional benefits to those out of work while neglecting those at work but who are on low incomes.  By withdrawing the family income supplement the Government are taking a step that will hit hard the low-income person at work.  This is the most socially regressive piece of tax change that we have had in recent times.  It is a step that we will condemn in this House not only today but at every available opportunity in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget does not address the basic problem of our economy which is the problem of our public finances being out of control.  There is no projection in the budget as to how or when the Government intend to eliminate the current budget deficit.  In the budget we introduced we stated clearly that we would eliminate this deficit within a four-year period.  That clear statement not only gave confidence to our own people but showed the world at large that we meant business about putting our finances under <Col N="626" /> control.  In this budget the Government have simply forgotten about any plan in so far as the deficit is concerned.  Indeed, by bringing forward into this year revenue that should be available next year they are taking steps that will increase the current budget deficit this year.  There may be some who will ask if that matters to those who have to live from day to day but it is vitally important that people abroad who are lending us money can be confident that we are taking steps to reduce the deficit, not just this year but on a planned basis during a four-to-five year period.  If those people see that the deficit is being reduced this year by artificial means they cannot be expected to have the confidence in us that they would have had when there was a clear plan to eliminate the deficit, a plan that fell with the change of Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the attention of the House also to the loss that will result so far as low-income families are concerned because of the withdrawal of the family income supplement.  A family on an income of £2,000 per year will be £500 per year worse off as a result of this budget while the loss for a family on a £3,000 per year income will be £208 and for a £4,000 income family it will be £83. People at work should be encouraged to stay at work but by withdrawing this income supplement the Government are discouraging people from working.  Consistent with this approach the Government have decided to abandon the plans for the taxation of short-term social welfare benefits.  Some people may say that this was a measure that was unnecessary but I considered it to have been extremely necessary.  I say this because under the present system there are many people who are better off to be out of work than to be at work.  It was to tackle that situation and to ensure that everyone in every situation would be better off going out to work that we proposed to introduce a tax on social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> I should like to quote a particular example to illustrate this point.  A married man with two children and working in the Office of Public Works who is in receipt of gross pay of £94.68 per week takes home £81.11p but if he were to go on sick leave he would be in receipt of benefits totalling about £30 more than that take home pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.  There is the 85 per cent clause.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know that the 85 per cent rule does not work.  This is because the Revenue Commissioners do not find it possible to make the calculation in time to operate it.  That is not a satisfactory situation.  In adopting what I regard as an anti-work budget the Government are taking a step that will do lasting damage to our social and economic structures.  That is why the situation must be remedied at the earliest opportunity possible.</P>
      <P>It is extremely difficult to find out what the budget is all about.  I say this because there are measures here which are concealed by measures in respect of which there is no statement as to whether they are being effected.  For instance, if one looks at the table at the back of the budget one finds that under item 3 in the January budget there was a total provision for additional expenditure of £149.8 million.  However, in item 3 of this budget which is supposed to cover the expenditure items that have been taken forward into this budget from the January budget, there appears a figure of merely £52.3 million or in other words a disappearance of almost £100 million from the provision for expenditure in the January budget. There is no explanation for this.  There may well be an explanation but it would have been no more than courtesy to the House for the Minister to have explained the discrepancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, one is left to speculate as to what may have been cut out on the expenditure side.  I look forward to receiving some explanation for such a wide discrepancy but I should not have to look forward to receiving that explanation <Col N="628" /> in the form of the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.  The document in that regard was not made available to me before I began speaking.  The Minister should have given information of that sort to the House in his budget statement at a time when it would have been possible for me to digest it and, consequently, be prepared to deal with it in response to the budget speech.  In the circumstances I have been put unfairly at a disadvantage and I have no way of knowing whether my question is answered in the statement giving the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget.&rdquo;  It would appear to me that a number of important items provided for in the January budget have been abandoned in this budget.  First of all there was &mdash; if the Minister did not give me the information before I stood up he could hardly expect me to have it in my head when it has not been made available&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to refer in particular to an item in the table explanatory <Col N="630" /> of the budget for non-tax revenue. The figure appears as £817 million.  This contains revenue from the Post Office, including additional telephone charges. The Government announced in an advertisement on 16 March increases in telephone charges to take effect from 1 April. It would appear to me that there is some doubt as to whether the Government are capable of introducing these increases from 1 April.  In the contract which people sign when they obtain a telephone there is a clause which says that at least one month's notice expiring on the last day of the calendar month following that on which the notice is given will be given to the subscriber of any alteration in the charges for calls made from the apparatus rented by him or in the rental for the apparatus.  It would appear to me that to announce on 16 March increases in charges to take effect on 1 April, which is less than a full month in advance of their taking effect, would be a breach of the terms of the contract signed by the telephone subscriber.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to give the Minister for Finance an adequate opportunity to get an answer for me to my query.  I will not insist, as he seems to do in my case, that he should make instant calculations about what he intends since he did not state it in his speech.</P>
      <P>I regret the fact that the Government have decided to abandon the provision of £20 million in our budget for the National Development Corporation, and the substitution for it of a much truncated body, namely, a National Enterprise Agency with provision for a mere £5 million.  The National Development Corporation had the capacity to do a considerable amount of work in developing new employment opportunities for our people in a manner which private enterprise could not, concerned as it is with a narrower resource base and with not undertaking higher risks which a State-financed body with a wider resource base could undertake.</P>
      <P>Many risk ventures at the frontiers of technology would have been undertaken by the National Development Corporation as conceived by the outgoing Government. The abandonment of the National Development Corporation is important this year in that job opportunities which could have been created this year will be lost, and more important still is its symbolic value.  It indicates that the Government do not intend to proceed in this general direction to get State enterprise involved in profit-making enterprises on the frontiers of technology to create employment.  I very much regret the decision not to make provision for the National Development Corporation. At an early opportunity when positions change in this House, it will be possible to reverse that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret also that a number of items in this budget although good in themselves &mdash; and they are not matters I should wish to criticise on their merits &mdash; such as matters concerning the inner city were introduced into this budget, not as a result of consultations with the responsible authorities such as the health boards, or the corporation, or other local authorities to who this House delegates <Col N="632" /> responsibility for policy-making, but as a result of conversations between one Deputy and another.  That by-passes proper local authority channels.  We have local authorities such as Dublin Corporation, and we have health boards such as the Eastern Health Board, whose job it is to decide priorities within their own area of competence, priorities in the matters of roads, education, vocational education committees and social services.</P>
    <P>To by-pass the local authority structure &mdash; local authorities we established in this House to make policies and to allocate budgets within their own areas &mdash; is demoralising and in a sense short-circuits proper democratic processes.  I do not believe it is good practice for deals of that sort to be implemented in this way.  It is far more appropriate that all the people involved on those local authorities should be consulted.  They were elected by the public to decide on priorities and they should have the opportunity to decide what should be done within broad allocations given to them by the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not believe policy should be made in the name of this House by two Deputies out of the total number in this House. No deal made between them should become a policy which overrides the proper processes which have been established for the making of policy through local authorities such as the health boards and Dublin Corporation.  That is not a satisfactory way in which to proceed, and I very much regret it.</P>
    <P>We face many problems in this economy.  I mentioned one already: the problem of the maintenance of incentives to work.  We need to encourage people to work more.  I regret certain aspects of the budget which seem to move away from the maintenance of that important incentive.  I do not wish to add to what I have already said and which stands on its own.</P>
    <P>This was highlighted by the European Community in their recent report on the economies of member countries.  We need a massive boost to investment in the re-equipment of our industry, in developing new technologies to ensure that plant in our industries does not <Col N="633" /> become obsolescent and does not place us in a situation in which we lose jobs as a result.  I believe this budget, in forcing many of these firms to pay advance value-added-tax this year &mdash; and it must be remembered that most our our progressive manufacturing firms are firms which import their raw materials &mdash; will push up the cost of these raw materials. At least in the short term it will dramatically increase their cost as a result of the insistence of this Government on charging value-added-tax at an earlier stage than has been the practice heretofore. Furthermore the bringing forward of corporation profits tax payments will put pressure on the working capital requirements of many firms in industry in this country at this time.</P>
    <P>The combination of these two measures this year will suck away funds that should be available this year to these firms to invest in increasing their capacity to compete abroad and to create new jobs.  These moneys, which should be available for that purpose to protect jobs and to expand job opportunities, instead will have to be used to prop up an artificial current budget deficit in an artificial transaction for one year only in order to give the present Government the opportunity of saying that they brought down the budget deficit to our target.  I believe that is a very bad use of national funds. If we have national funds available they should not be used to finance this sort of artificial transaction.  Instead they should be used to ensure that our industry is modernised so that jobs can be created. I believe that in that sense, in sucking away funds that should be available for investment, this Budget is anti-investment and hence anti-jobs.</P>
    <P>Deputies might like to cast their eye over the explanatory table of the budget in regard to capital taxation and compare the capital taxation provisions in the 1982 Budget of January where there was provision for £6.5 million for capital taxation, with the provision in this Budget where there is only £2.7 million for capital taxation.  This is something that perhaps some Deputies who at least supported the nomination of the Taoiseach might cause themselves to ponder upon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> Of course the reason for the difference is the fact that the Government have decided not to proceed with the tax on discretionary trusts which the outgoing Government had proposed.  A tax of this type is wholly new and its details will require to be worked out in such a way that it would affect only genuine tax avoidance devices, the genuine tax avoidance use of discretionary trusts.  There was no intention, and would be no intention, to impose taxation on discretionary trusts set up for particular family circumstances to which discretionary trusts would normally be approptriate regardless of circumstances.  Our intention there solely was to deal with a situation in which discretionary trusts were being used solely for the purpose of avoiding capital acquisitions tax, for no other purpose. Naturally that is something on which we could have elaborated in detail in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>However, the present Government have abandoned the exercise entirely. They have decided they will kick discretionary trusts out of court altogether into that great escape hatch, the Commission on Taxation.  I believe they have lacked courage in so doing.  I believe that the area of tax avoidance is not one that should be put on the long finger.  There are too many people who have access to expert advice who, as a result, are able to ensure that they do not pay the same taxation on the same transactions as other people who, for lack of means, are unable to obtain the same advice.  I believe that this is inequitable.  I believe we should do everything we can, within our powers and ingenuity, to stamp out tax evasion of that sort.  I believe that the tax on discretionary trusts was dealing with a particularly difficult form of tax avoidance and that the abandonment by the Government of that certainly difficult attempt to deal with a difficult problem is something which shows that they are not serious in tackling this area.  Let it be said that we have in this country, and are losing very substantial sums of money as a result, a very large black economy. Some people have estimated the value of the black economy, wherein some people are engaging in activities of which the <Col N="635" /> Revenue Commissioners know nothing, as between £200 million and £500 million.</P>
    <P>The result of this tax avoidance or evasion is that other people have to pay very substantial amounts of additional taxation to pay for the people who are avoiding their due share, or who are claiming benefits to which they are not entitled because they are working as well as drawing benefits.  As I said in my budget speech I believe it will never be possible to wholly stamp out this practice by legislative means.  Ultimately one must depend on moral suasion, on encouraging people by example.  I believe the action of the Government on this occasion &mdash; in abandoning the attempt to deal with tax avoidance by means of discretionary trusts by people who are quite well off &mdash; is very bad example to other people whom we should be trying to persuade not to engage in tax evasion or claim benefits to which they are not entitled. I believe it gives precisely the wrong type of moral lead to this community at this time.  It is something which I would be surprised if all of the Deputies who supported Deputy Haughey for Taoiseach would find themselves happy in supporting in this budget.</P>
    <P>In summary, my biggest worry about this budget would be as follows: first of all I believe it is a budget which does damage to the incentive to work by abolishing the family income supplement for low-income people at work and by abolishing the proposal to tax social welfare benefits.  Secondly, I believe it is a budget that hits investment and will push up interest rates by sucking out money which should be available for investment and for lending to finance artificial transactions in the form of advanced payment of corporation profits tax and value-added tax.  Thirdly, it is a budget which does not address the basic problem of getting our finances under control on a phased, planned basis, for two reasons, firstly, because by drawing forward money from next year into this year it actually increases the opening budget deficit for next year and, secondly, because it has abandoned the clear commitment we had in our budget of getting rid of the budget <Col N="636" /> deficity over a stated period of four years; there is in this budget no period, no plan, no future indication of what will happen about the current budget deficit.  I believe that does damage to our economy by removing a discipline, removing a sense of leadership by the Government on a planned basis.  I regret that that has been done.  I hope that the Minister for Finance will avail of an early opportunity to say clearly what are his plans over the next four years for the current budget deficit.</P>
    <P>We have heard from the Taoiseach that he intends that an economic plan will be published.  I would have thought that one of the items that would be contained in an economic plan would be an indication of what were one's plans, which are matters directly within the control of Government itself.  It is all very well for Government planners to be planning other people's affairs.  The place where Government planners should start is with their own affairs.  One of the prime affairs which is the concern of Government is the size of the current budget deficit and the size of the total Exchequer borrowing requirement.  Whereas the previous Government had a clear plan over a four-year period for the elimination of the deficit, there is no plan whatever in this budget for the elimination of the deficit.</P>
    <P>These are the measures that cause me the greatest worry in this budget.  Regretably I will have to reserve my position on many of the other items because I did not have the opportunity of seeing matters that are in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo; before I commenced my speech. However, if other opportunities arise, I will avail of them to deal with these matters.</P>

      <P>A good budget is one that is part of overall economic and social planning.  A good budget is one that is supposed to legislate for a more equitable system of taxation.  Another characteristic of a good budget is one that allocates scarce resources for those in greatest need and which eliminates waste and inefficiency in public expenditure programmes. I am sure all would agree that <Col N="637" /> these are the general characteristics of a good budget.  Above all, a good budget would have one outstanding characteristic in that it should not shirk from raising by way of taxation essential revenue to pay for public services.  On all of these scores the budget of the Taoiseach &mdash; again, we see the hand of the Taoiseach behind this budget &mdash; fails dismally.  Once again we have the perpetual double counting and the perpetual double money in a budget: in other words, now you see it and now you do not.</P>
      <P>Let us look at what precisely the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have done in relation to the budget.  At the end of this document they have postulated a current budget deficit of £679 million.  The Minister for Finance on a once-off basis has brought forward £140 million of that into 1982, and not being satisfied with that he has brought forward £36 million of corporation profits tax into 1982.  Lo and behold, we emerge with a closing budget deficit for the year of £679 million.  Needless to remark as Deputy Haughey well knows, it is virtually a carbon copy of the budget which he wrote for Deputy Gene Fitzgerald in January of last year when Deputy Fitzgerald prognosticated that the estimated current budget deficit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In the alternative budget put forward by Fianna Fáil in the 1982 General Election &mdash; the O'Donoghue budget &mdash; buoyancy of revenue was then prognosticated at £20 million. Lo and behold, three or four months later it has become £45 million.  In charity I will accept the one prognosticated by the Minister for Education and I will deduct £20 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spent seven months in the Department of Finance and I have analysed much of the data put forward in the alternative budget.  I submit that the current budget deficit for this year will be at least £870 million. Obviously the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance were not happy with creating once again a carbon copy of their misguided economic strategy with regard to the handling of public finances.  What did they do?  They looked after their friends.  We all know who are the friends of the Taoiseach.  We all know who are the discretionary trust occupiers.  What has he done for them?  He has come into this House today and has handed over to them £3 million of tax relief.  He eliminated <Col N="639" /> the deliberate procedures we brought in.  He has given a post-election handout to his friends who approached him in Galway and in various other parts of the country.  In one statement in Galway an assurance was given that the discretionary trust provisions proposed by our Government would be withdrawn by him.</P>
      <P>We are back on the old merry-goround. I hope that Sinn Féin, the Workers' Party &mdash; if they are still here &mdash; will decide what way they are going to vote and I hope that Deputy Gregory is fully aware of what is in the budget.  This Deputy had his contract signed by the general secretary of a trade union because he could not trust the Taoiseach. I hope he appreciates who will benefit by the £3 million handout.  It is for the developers of inner city properties, for the land speculators, for people in County Dublin and in the inner city who can buy agricultural land at £3,000 per acre and flog it overnight on a re-zoning decision at £35,000 per acre as development land and then put the money into a family-controlled discretionary trust.  When we introduced discretionary trusts, personally I felt we should have taken a yield of £7 million or £8 million, but the 3 per cent rate was agreed.  There were many other exemption segments within that discretionary trust acquisition but we put it in and it should have stayed.  It is a public scandal that in this statement brought forward by an allegedly caring Government, a Government who care about food subsidies, who care about children's clothes and footwear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that in a few moments.  It is ironic that instead we knock off about £6½ million of capital taxation and effectively make the whole situation totally derisory in terms of an effective budget strategy.  What do we have instead?  There are three lines relating to the famous economic and social plan which we are to see within the next <Col N="640" /> three months to deal with employment. It is mentioned in the first page of the Minister's speech but it is contained in one sentence: &ldquo;We have already initiated preparation of a plan for the management of the economy over the next four to five years&rdquo;.  That is the Government's economic and social planning, their social commitment and what the country will face in the lifetime of this Dáil.  I do not believe I am being discourteous to the Taoiseach or disclosing undue confidences but when we met the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, who was accompanied by Deputies Tunney and Woods &mdash; The Labour Party was represented by Deputies O'Leary and Higgins and myself &mdash; we expressed our interest in setting up a stable Government and asked him what he had in mind in terms of an economic and social plan.  We did not seek the meeting.  We got a quizzical lifting of the eyebrows and a presidential reaction which said: the plan will be brought in; we will be availing of the ERSI, we will have some documents from the NESC and then produce a plan. Perhaps, of course, there would be an input from the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>We are not going to see any economic and social plan because there is not any intention, desire or impetus, as the Minister for Education knows well having had his Department of Economic Planning and Development emasculated, destroyed and thrown up to Earlsfort Terrace, staff and all.  We all know that there is not any intention of producing such a plan.  At least in the seven months we were in office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In our short time in office we attempted to set up a basic planning structure here.  I must confess that I am wholly derisory in terms of any serious economic intent on the part of <Col N="641" /> Fianna Fáil to introduce a plan.  We have great potential here.  We have a young and skilled population and potential to develop many sectors of our economy. Agriculture is undeveloped in many areas.  Our food processing industry and our export of live cattle are a disgrace, particularly when one considers that 300,000 live cattle went out of the country in the last 17 months.  Our semi-State sector, if properly organised, could produce far greater wealth.  We also have the relative advantages of the seas of Ireland in terms of mariculture and other future development.</P>
      <P>I am not pessimistic about our potential in terms of employment but there is no desire to plan four or five years ahead. So endemic is the short-term expediency of the leader of the Government that I despair, having seen the Summerhill document of massive proposals of expenditure with no relationship to taxation to meet it and when I see the mendacity indulged in in relation to the Irish Commissioner in the EEC in the last 24 hours at a time when we should be building up the common agricultural policy.  It is little wonder that politicians here are held in such abject and desperately low esteem by the people.</P>

We must ensure that there is development in that direction.

      <P>I will willingly continue. In mentioning the Whitegate oil refinery I said I had no objection to the State having a refinery and storage capacity in terms of our strategic needs but it is incumbent on all governments to spell out the cost involved.  When we talk about such matters we should be aware that it is not just the £10 million referred to in the budget that is involved.  A statement has been made available to me that the capital cost in terms of refurbishing will be anything from £45 million to £70 million.  A statement has been made to me on good authority that the annual losses could be £20 million.</P>
      <P>There has been a further statement made to me that the cost for petrol in addition to the 1p announced by the Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy Reynolds, would be 10p or alternatively 6p on fuel oil.  I have no objection to taking decisions provided we are prepared to be honest about the cost.  There is reference in this budget to Clondalkin Paper Mills.  It is clouded and deliberately shrouded but the Taoiseach knows and we all know that Clondalkin before it closed was losing and costing the company concerned no less than £210,000 per month, actual loss.  There is provision in the budget in relation to Knock Airport which is not supposed to cost any money this year but we know now from the Department of Finance without question that at this point of time the projected end cost in 1984 is £12.68 million.  That, I can assure you, is for starters.  We must remember that Deputy Haughey made statements that it would not be more than £6 million and that was in January &mdash; February 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could go on, be it either the Tuam factory or Údarás na Gaeltachta promises relating to £5 million of which £1 million is in here; I could go on to the decentralisation proposals in this budget which superficially are to cost nothing in 1982 but which we know if carried through will be not less than &mdash; in the finance statements available to the Taoiseach <Col N="645" />&mdash; £7 million.  We all know what happened privatisation, the famous £200 million and the fact that ultimately it amounted to £20 million.  Taking all the promises made by the Fianna Fáil Party from Ballinfad, to Arigna, to recruitment of additional gardaí there is a massive cloaking of future already committed costs in this budget which makes a mockery of it.  We are back to the credibility gap&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am quite willing to do so if the Taoiseach ceases to interrupt me.  We finish up with a budget today where for current purposes in 1982 the post-March budget, £679 million is to be borrowed and a new historic fact &mdash; it is the first time in our history that we have reached the four figure mark &mdash; £1,004 <Col N="646" /> million for capital purposes, giving a total of £1,683 million for Exchequer borrowing requirements for this year or 13.9 per cent of GNP.  I submit that figure is frightfully incorrect; it is underestimated quite deliberately.  I submit that the £140 million in that is over-estimated and there are three or four factors mentioned in the Minister's speech which clearly indicate why it is over-estimated.  I further submit in regard to the £36 million for CPT not only is the Minister bringing it forward but I suggest it is also over-estimated on the basis of papers I had available to me up to about three or four weeks ago in the Department of Finance.

      <P>I wish to make a brief final point in relation to employment.  It is a tragedy that at a particular point in our political history when, politicians, Front Bench spokesmen, backbenchers <Col N="647" /> in some cases, are held in such general lack of esteem that this morning for every six workers who went out to work in industry and services another one worker had no job to go to.  They deserve more than a £30 million cut in the public capital allocation to State-sponsored bodies. They deserve more in terms of hope than the abandonment of Public Capital Programme provision for the NDC, the slashing by £15 million of public capital moneys in that regard.  It is perhaps arguable that these moneys should be retained and if not given to an NDC they should be totally retained in terms of employment.</P>
      <P>I can only conclude that we are back to the situation where in 1978 in the manufacturing industries 207,000 were employed and in June 1981 there were precisely 207,000 people employed. There was a growth in employment; an extra 30,000 public servants were employed &mdash; 27,600 to be exact.  There was no provision in taxation at that point. We borrowed and borrowed and we are now reaching the stage where this year in terms of interest alone, due to foreign banks, as a result of the policy and development of the Fianna Fáil Party in 1980 and 1981, we have to pay out £500 million to the bankers of Germany, Japan and America in repayments.  Our Exchequer borrowing requirement has reached that appalling situation.  These moneys which we will pay from our own resources this year will create jobs in these other countries, not at home, because neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Finance had the guts in this written document to say to the Irish people: &ldquo;We must pay for job creation out of our own resources, our own taxation, our own contributions and sacrifices in the interests of not putting around the necks of our own children a limitless debt in the decade of 1980.&rdquo; The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have much to answer for in coming forward with carbon copy, cuckoo number two, in 1982 of what they did in January 1981.</P>

      <P>I shall speak very briefly but consider it desirable that I should speak.  At the outset, on behalf of my party, we see this as a reasonable, well balanced budget.  All we want to do is to give the reasons for that decision.</P>
      <P>On 27 January last before the then Minister had concluded his address to the Dáil, it was quite easy for me, as the only Deputy for Sinn Féin the Workers' Party then, to make up my mind.  The Minister stated on that occasion that VAT would be imposed on clothing and footwear, that the food subsidies would be removed and that there would be taxation of social welfare payments.  For a start, these are now out of the way, which is one great improvement in these budget proposals. Firstly, the commitment of £50 million to the building industry is something which will give a real incentive to the working class people.</P>

We all know that that would have meant the end of local authority activity in providing services for the people.  I am glad that this situation has now changed and that 40 per cent can be retained by the local authority.</P>
      <P>I would like to have seen some reference to the meat and timber industries but, on the question of social welfare, we have increases in social welfare payments. Something which has been a very contentious matter for a long time is eligibility for health services.  Contributory and non-contributory pensioners will now have full eligibility for health services, which must be welcomed.</P>

      <P>We know well that the <Col N="649" /> previous system was totally unjust in assessing the means of an old age pensioner on the basis of the little pension that he or she got from the place of employment.</P>
      <P>On the issue of roads, the Minister is increasing by £10 million the amount of capital and has promised major improvements in national roads.  I remind the Minister, through the Chair, that there are such things as county roads, our byroads. I am sorry that no reference has been made to changing the system so that the local authority could divert the capital which it receives from the Department to whatever work it sees fit and not to have a situation where the capital allocation for roads must be spent wherever the Department wills.  There is a need for change and I sincerely hope this change will be brought about because of the present condition of the county roads.  They are dangerous.</P>
      <P>On the issue of taxation, we welcome any increase in tax allowances.  This is something which comes a little unexpectedly. The proposal to increase the revenue accruing on capital gains, must be welcomed.  It does not go far enough, but we accept that there is a commitment to shift the position from indirect taxation to capital gains under the many headings into which I will not now specifically go.</P>
      <P>I welcome, also, the commitment to a permanent system of taxation for financial institutions.  The ordinary people of this country have been waiting for a shift in the position from indirect taxation to capital, property and wealth taxation. The ordinary people have seen quite clearly that these sections have got away with it while the burden was carried by the ordinary PAYE sector.  Another thing which comes unexpectedly again, but is very welcome, knowing well what effect it had, is the removal of the payment of VAT on school books for ordinary working class people.</P>

      <P>On the other side, the Minister states that the increased tax buoyancy will bring in £40 million and the bringing forward of the date of payment of corporation tax and the surplus profits of An Bord Gáis &mdash; one of our own natural resources for once having revenue accruing from it &mdash; are welcome.  Not sufficient revenue accrued to the State from Kinsale gas. Nevertheless, it is a very welcome change in the situation.  The benefits accruing under this budget will result in a deficit of £679 million and we will be looking at this very carefully.  The immediate reaction however, is that it is a reasonably well presented budget and an effort has been made to bring some balance into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1)  That in this Resolution&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  &ldquo;development land&rdquo; means land of the kind described in section 4 (3) (a) (i) of the Capital Gains Tax (Amendment) Act, 1978 (No. 33 of 1978);</P>
      <P>&ldquo;shares&rdquo; has the same meaning as in section 4 (8) of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975 (No. 20 of 1975), and</P>
      <P>(b) references to the disposal of development land include references to the disposal of shares deriving their value or the greater part of their value directly or indirectly from that land, other than shares quoted on a stock exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="651" /> (2) That paragraph 11 of Schedule 4 to the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, shall have effect, as respects any disposal of development land made on or after the 26th day of March, 1982, and before the 26th day of July, 1982, as if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in subparagraph (2), &ldquo;equal to 30 per cent. of the said payment&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;on one-half of the said payment at the rate of such tax in force at the time the payment is made&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>(b)  in subparagraph (3), &ldquo;the amount of the payment at the rate of 30 per cent.&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;an amount equal to one-half of the payment at the rate specified in section 3 (3).&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>(c)  in subparagraph (4), &ldquo;the amount so estimated at the rate of 30 per cent.&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;an amount equal to one-half of the amount so estimated at the rate specified in section 3 (3).&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>(d)  in subparagraph (5), &ldquo;on or after the 26th day of July, 1982,&rdquo; were inserted after &ldquo;be given&rdquo;, and</P>
    <P>(e)  after subparagraph (6), the following subparagraph were inserted:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(6A)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (6), a certificate under that subparagraph in relation to a disposal shall not be issued unless an amount of capital gains tax equal to 30 per cent. of the consideration for the disposal has been paid.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(3)  It is hereby declared that it is expendient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> The principal effect of this resolution will be to tax profits on the sale of development lands at a rate of 50 per cent.  I am sure that this resolution will recommend itself to all sides of the House.  The previous Minister for Finance intended to tax these profits at the rate of 45 per cent.  We felt it appropriate to increase that to 50 per cent.  Everybody knows that there is considerable public disquiet about the profits being made on the sale of development lands or lands for development purposes and I think a tax of 50 per cent on these profits is not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>While the full provisions of this very complicated measure can only be outlined in the Finance Act, the tax will become operative as and from today.  It is a very complicated area but I think the explanation I have given covers its salient features.  From 12 o'clock tonight profits made from the sale of development lands will be taxed at 50 per cent as distinct from the normal capital gains rate which is now 40 per cent in most other areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My first reaction to this resolution is that the very fact the present Government voted against a proposition along these lines when they voted against the budget as a whole in January&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not vote against it as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget was described as a disgraceful document by Deputy O'Donoghue who no longer holds an economic portfolio for Fianna Fáil.  As we now know, the present Government have adopted most of that budget, including this item.  What worries me slightly about it is that by voting against that budget and bringing the Government down they have allowed a number of people who were engaged in development land transactions and who would have had to pay this additional taxation if that budget had gone ahead to accelerate those transactions in the period between the defeat of that budget and the introduction of this one.  Many transactions which would have borne taxation have been rushed through in the intervening <Col N="653" /> period as a result of the defeat of the previous budget.  It is something to which attention needs to be drawn.  The additional rate of taxation being charged here only compensates in this year for the lost revenue from the fact that not only were two months' transactions exempted entirely but also during that time so as to avoid paying taxation people were able to rush through transactions which might have taken place in the first six months of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also worth drawing the attention of the House to the fact that, notwithstanding that this proposal increases the level of capital gains tax on a particular type of transaction, the overall yield of capital taxation this year is being substantially reduced, more than halved, from that which obtained in the January budget.  The provision for tax on discretionary trusts is now to be the subject of an inquiry by the Commission on Taxation. I will not repeat the arguments I made in my initial reaction to the budget where I pointed out that we believe the use of discretionary trusts, not as a genuine family instrument of dealing with family problems but as a pure avoidance device, is something which should be stamped out now and should not require a Commission on Taxation.  The increase in the rate on development land transactions is purely a cover for the fact that substantially less revenue will be raised from capital taxation this year because of the abandonment of any attempt to deal with the use of discretionary trusts as an avoidance device.  As I pointed out in my earlier contribution, I do not believe that this measure should fall, nor would it have fallen, on using discretionary trusts for genuine family purposes but merely on their continued use for tax avoidance purposes.  The fact that the present Government have entirely abandoned dealing with that problem by referring it to the Commission on Taxation, and thereby significantly reducing the yield from capital taxation, is a regressive measure and gives bad example in that it shows an unwillingness to tackle a form of tax avoidance by people who are financially well advised and expensively advised as to how to form these trusts so <Col N="654" /> as to avoid capital acquisition tax which other people in the same situation would have to pay if they had not got the benefit of this artificial device of a discretionary trust.  Failure to face that issue has thrown a shadow over the Government's approach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recollect that when he was on the other side of the House, during the discussion on the Financial Resolutions I was careful to remind the House that this is a debate of a quasi-Committee Stage character in which one is expected to present specific questions in order to elucidate what is proposed or to look for additional information.  The general debate is reserved for a later date.  I would ask the Deputy and other Deputies to realise that is the nature and the form of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect what you have said, and it has been well said.  I just wanted to make that point because it is germane to the overall impression I have got.  Strictly speaking, it does not come within the ambit of this resolution.  I hope that this tax will not have the effect of discouraging necessary development of land for housing.  Obviously the development of land for housing is something that gives significant employment.  It must also be borne in mind that people are free not to sell land for housing development if they choose not to do so. Clearly, when imposing taxation on a particular transaction one must bear in mind the danger that if it is taxed too heavily the transaction will not take place at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course if transactions in regard to land for development do not occur, there will not be development and if there is not development there will not be housing. Therefore, it is necessary that we should continue to monitor this measure, monitor its effect over the coming years so as to ensure that it will not inhibit necessary development.  It is important that we should have a sufficient land bank available for housing.  We have very great pressure for new houses because we have a much younger population than most <Col N="655" /> other countries.  We have more people of the age at which they are getting married and setting up homes and therefore there is more pressure on housing land here than elsewhere.  The planning authorities also have had a tradition or a regulation in regard to relatively low density of housing by comparison with other European countries and this also results in a greater demand for more and more land for the same number of housing units than would occur in countries which have as a norm a higher density of houses.</P>
    <P>I do not say we should try to change the traditional view of the Irish people which requires a lower density of houses, but one cannot ignore this matter in terms of demand for areas of serviced land. This means we have to be careful to ensure there will be a steady flow of land into the market and for that reason we must be careful, when we are framing legislation such as this, to ensure that the tax will be drawn in in a way that will ensure that the State and the community will get a fair contribution from those who are making substantial windfall gains as a result of services provided on their land at the expense of the State.</P>
    <P>That is what this measure is broadly designed to do.  Apart from the rate, it is almost exactly the same measure I would have been proposing here.  One cannot object to it.  In the way I drafted it, it will have the effect of getting a fair share of the profits from these transactions without inhibiting the flow of transactions in such a way as to create scarcity of land for housing.  At the same time one is entering an area which is new, into which no previous Government had endeavoured to go.  I am proud I was the Minister for Finance who introduced this concept of a special tax on development land.  I am glad I tackled this problem which has been avoided by Governments even though it was known to be a problem since the sixties.  It had to wait until the budget of January 1982 for someone to attempt to tackle it.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his endeavour to obtain revenue from this source. However, he must be careful to monitor this to ensure that an adequate supply of <Col N="656" /> land will come into the market for development. My biggest regret is that the Government have reduced the estimated yield from capital taxation from that which we proposed in the January budget.  It is a surprise to me.  It is something the Government must explain.  This is a time when everyone else in the community is being asked to make tremendous sacrifices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just one query.  We are told that there will be a new high rate of capital gains tax in the case of gains within one year, and the following year. Then we are told those new high rates will apply to disposal of development land within three years of acquisition.  It is not clear if the special reduced rate in the case of compulsory acquisition within one, two or three years will apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two different things involved.  I admit it is confusing. The new provision in regard to short-term capital gains will now apply at 60 per cent for one year in the case of normal development profits from development land.  Apart from short-term gains, the rate will be 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on page 34 of the budget statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is compulsorily purchased within one year the rate of capital gains tax is 60 per cent but if it is compulsorily purchased within two or three years the rate is 40 per cent.  The additional short-term tax does apply in the case of compulsory purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to see the rationale behind that distinction.  If a person is unlucky enough to have his land compulsorily acquired within one year of <Col N="657" /> acquiring it he pays tax at 60 per cent but if it is acquired in the second year after acquisition the tax bill falls to 40 per cent. There seems to be an unjust anomaly in that.  If a person falls to lose his land through compulsory purchase at any time, even months after he has acquired it, who is to say whether he bought it in anticipation of its being compulsorily acquired?  He should get the benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It could leave the thing open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>But in trying to close that loophole we are leaving an anomaly in that if a person can manage to avoid the compulsory purchase for 13 months he has a substantial tax saving.  I would suggest that where compulsory acquisition is concerned it should be 40 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point.  But there is the other aspect that if we do not have this provision it could leave a loophole there.  Somebody who was aware that a piece of property was going to be compulsorily acquired could buy that in advance of the compulsory acquisition and have the profit they made at the rate of 40 per cent.  But I do accept that there is the appearance of an anomaly there at any rate.  Perhaps it is something we could argue more about when we come to the Finance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make one observation and that is that in the situation where the local authority will need to acquire land for housing there would be a tendency&mdash;it is there already&mdash;for the vendor to increase the price by the amount he would pay in capital gains tax. I would like to have this situation looked at.  Perhaps some legislation could be introduced to counter that, because if the price is put up by the amount that would be paid in capital gains tax the State would have to pay anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too clear on Deputy Sherlock's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>This could happen in cases other than compulsory purchases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="658" /> If the local authority move to acquire land for housing I can see a situation where the vendor would put the price up by the amount of capital gains tax to get his pound of flesh.  There are indications that this is happening already.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not arise in the case of compulsory purchases because in such cases the valuer should value the land at its market value apart from any element of capital gains.  There should not be a problem there.  I could see, however, that in the case of a willing, free sale the vendor might add on the capital gains element to the price he is charging to the local authority.  The only safeguard there is that the local authority would not pay that inflated price and in the event of agreement not being reached on a proper price they would compulsorily acquire the land.  However, I see the point and perhaps it is something we can look at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I would like to deal with the question of capital gains tax.  Since the system of PAYE was introduced several years ago it became incumbent that equity be introduced into the system of taxation so that everybody would pay their fair share, because under the system of PAYE the wage earner or income earner who is paid a salary or wage has no escape; he must pay through the nose because his tax is deducted from his pay packet.  Until PAYE was introduced there was a system whereby capital gains were not taxable at all so that while a man on a wage or salary had to pay the last penny, there were vast sums of money being made by dealing in land, in house property and shares, and these were not taxable at all.  The result was that an individual could have a tax-free income of £50,000 a year by way of capital gains but another man might have an income of about £2,000 a year and pay the full income tax.  That was remedied during the 1973-77 period when the national Coalition Government were in office.  We introduced a system of capital gains tax which was a means of getting at the speculator, the land dealer, the house dealer and the dealer in shares, and as a <Col N="659" /> result he was made to pay his fair share of taxation.  But on Fianna Fáil returning to office in 1977 they proceeded to amend our Act and they pulled its teeth and rendered it harmless.  They introduced a tapering system whereby the tax varied from 30 per cent down to as low as 3 per cent and rendered it meaningless.  They did that because they were under pressure from wealthy supporters and people of that sort.</P>

I am glad that following the proposal of Deputy Bruton in the January budget to restore capital gains tax in a meaningful way the present Minister for Finance has followed his example.  They have restored more or less in the same form the capital gains tax which was introduced in 1974 and virtually abolished in 1978.  We have a situation now where a dealer or speculator will have to pay his share and that is good.  It is, as Deputy Bruton said, a great pity that the amount of capital taxation provided for in the January budget has been drastically reduced in this budget. It is an injustice to the ordinary wage or salary earner.  When we speak of PAYE&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is usual that the changes in the capital gains tax are put forward in the Finance Bill.  Why is it necessary to put through a financial resolution tonight on this one area relating to development land?  There were other changes in the capital gains tax regarding disposals and so on.  This resolution just deals with the disposal of development land.  Why is it necessary to put it through in this way as a Financial Resolution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" /> Does that mean that this area of change in the capital gains law is not to be incorporated in the forthcoming Bill?  This is a very complicated area, as the Taoiseach knows.  Will that effect any change in any way whatever in the Finance Bill?  Will we have an opportunity of discussing this area again?</P>
    <P>Secondly, I would like to know the significance of paragraph (2)(a).  My understanding is that where development land is sold after tonight 30 per cent of the price of the land will have to be paid before the relevant certificate is issued. I would like some clarification as to the significance there.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could enlighten me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new and much more severe imposition of tax than would normally be covered by an increase in existing tax.  Therefore, it is felt desirable that there should be a Financial Resolution making it effective on and from tonight.  Of course, that does not prevent any changes we wish to make being made in the Finance Bill and they can as we wish be made operative from tonight or not, as the Finance Bill provides.  This at least gives us the authority to make everything operative at and from midnight tonight.  The answer to the Deputy's question is yes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In pursuing a little further the point raised on the other side of the House, could the Taoiseach explain how this resolution operates to achieve the effect of giving a general power, as he seemed to indicate just now?  As I read <Col N="665" /> it&mdash;it is not a very readable resolution &mdash;the operative paragraph is (2) and that paragraph does nothing except amend certain parts of paragraph 11 of Schedule 4 of the 1975 Act.  The first amendment substitutes for saying that a sum shall be deducted representing</P>
      <P>on one-half of the said payment at the rate of such tax in force at the time the payment is made</P>
      <P>an amount of capital gains tax</P>
      <P>equal to 30 per cent of the said payment.</P>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach explain how that achieves the objectives stated in the budget speech and how it has this general effect of giving overall power in this area which he says is necessary and is achieved by this phraseology?  The effect of this appears to be very limited.  It affects only paragraph 11 of Schedule 4 of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, in a very limited way.  I am in genuine difficulty in understanding the operative effect of this.  I have a number of other questions but I do not want to confuse the issue and I would like the Taoiseach to clarify that point first.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way I can help the Deputy is to outline for him what the resolution achieves.  The resolution simply deals with the position that as and from midnight tonight profit from sales of development land will attract taxation at a rate of 50 per cent.  This is the upshot of all the legal phraseology which is in front of the Deputy and myself.  If the Deputy wishes to ask me any question about the specific operation of that tax I will endeavour to answer it.  All that gobbledegook in Resolution No. 1 secures the simple purpose that as and from tonight at 12 o'clock the sales of development land will attract capital gains tax at 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach will explain.  The wording of the Act as now amended will read as follows and on the face of it is not self-explanatory that it will achieve the effect of the 50 per cent tax.  It says: &ldquo;Upon payment of the consideration <Col N="666" /> for acquiring an asset to which this paragraph applies, the person by or through whom any such payment is paid shall deduct thereout a sum equal to 30 per cent of the said payment and the person to whom the payment is made shall allow such deduction upon receipt of the residue of the payment&rdquo; and there are other ancillary clauses.  On the face of it, it charges a 30 per cent tax, not a 50 per cent tax.  I am sure it has in some mysterious way the effect the Taoiseach says it has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>30 per cent is only payment on account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The only figure mentioned anywhere in this is 30 per cent.  If all his resolution does is give the power to withhold the figure, how does that have the general effect stated by the Taoiseach of bringing within the grasp of this tax all transactions at the 50 per cent rate?  I am sure this is a very clever way of doing it, but it is not a very obvious way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This House is here to legislate and we must know what we are legislating.  The Taoiseach has twice failed to answer my question as to how a requirement to be able to deduct or withhold a sum equal to 30 per cent of the payment has the necessary effect, as a result of that, of imposing a tax of 50 per <Col N="667" /> cent.  If something else somewhere in the Act adds on the 20 per cent, perhaps that is the answer.  But the Taoiseach should answer the question and not tell me simply that I must trust the Parliamentary Draftsmen and the Revenue Commissioners. It is not the job of this House to take things on trust.  Our job is to legislate and to know what we are doing.  I do not know what we are doing at this moment and it is fairly obvious that the Taoiseach does not know either.</P>

The resolution will, in addition, during the period in which it has statutory effect limit the right to obtain a clearance certificate by imposing a condition that such a certificate may not issue in respect of disposals of development land made after today unless a tax payment of 30 per cent of the consideration for the disposal is made to the Revenue.  The Finance Bill will make adequate provision for giving relief in cases where the tax paid at the rate of 30 per cent is found to exceed the tax payable under the proposed new regime for disposals of development land.</P>

      <P>The only effect of this resolution is that 30 per cent of the sale price of development land will be withheld after tonight.  Prior to this there were different regulations.

      <P>I am a member of Dublin County Council and during recent weeks we have rezoned 1,436 acres in our <Col N="670" /> development plan.  One would want to be a very poor speculator in development land not to appreciate the identity of the original resolution put forward by the previous Government with an operative date of 28 January and the resolution now put forward with an operative date of 26 March.  One would have completed all one's transactions long before tonight and I have no doubt this has happened.  That is why I strongly query the anticipated yield from this measure in 1982.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy raised that because Deputy Fitzpatrick and others have been suggesting that there will be lesser returns from capital taxes under our budget than would have been the case under the January budget. That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The overall return from capital taxation in the full year as a result of our budget will be £11.7 million as against £11 million in the January budget.  That would be in a full year but naturally we have lost because one does not know what transactions took place between January and today.  I would be reasonably confident that increasing a tax on development land from 45 per cent to 50 per cent would more than compensate for any transactions which might have taken place since January, particularly when one adds in the new provision for a 60 per cent rate of tax on capital gains within 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the point was pressed by Deputy McCreevy and myself because the Taoiseach had unintentionally misled the House and subsequently sought to prevent us from pursuing the matter further by saying we should take it on trust that what he had said was true. It turned out that what he had said was unintentionally incorrect.  It shows the importance of probing these matters.  I would now inquire in what way withholding 30 per cent of the money ensures that a non-resident who carries through a transaction, winds it up and gets out, pays <Col N="671" /> 50 per cent or 60 per cent?  I do not understand the logic of this.  I can see that if one insists that 30 per cent rather than 15 per cent be withheld one is better off but it does not achieve the objective of 40, 50 or 60 per cent if the man gets out in time.</P>

      <P>It was said that the effect of this resolution was to ensure that the tax would be paid in the case of a non-resident who wound up his affairs and left the country.  It does not ensure anything of the kind because only 30 per cent would be paid instead of 15 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be 30 per cent of the consideration.  Profit is a different thing.  It would be an extraordinary transaction if 30 per cent of the price did not more than cover 50 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That being the case, if there is no indexation land could well have been purchased at a tiny fraction of today's price and sold for a figure many times over the value of the land.  In that case 30 per cent of the value of the land would not represent a capital gains tax of 50 per cent or 60 per cent.  It does not follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 15 per cent and that was regarded as adequate when the rate of tax was 30 per cent; therefore 30 per cent should be adequate when the rate of tax is 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because we are now introducing a tax in which there is no indexation.  Once you remove indexation in respect of the value of the land over the agricultural value, the capital gain in money terms can become many <Col N="672" /> times greater through inflation and therefore the amount involved for capital gains tax to be paid even at the same rate&mdash; never mind increasing the rate&mdash;would be many times greater by virtue of that alone.  Increasing the rate from 15 per cent to 30 per cent does not in any way keep up with the impact of the increase in the tax following from the abolition of indexation and the increase in the rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to suggest that the rate of 30 per cent would not be adequate.  It would be very draconian to go beyond 30 per cent of the consideration in the case of these transactions. If the Revenue Commissioners suggest that it is not enough it can be changed in the Finance Act.</P>

      <P>We have moved a long way from the situation in which we started.  It now transpires that this is a minor measure which will withhold part of the payment to ensure that someone does not disappear with the money, but it will be a smaller proportion of the capital gain, in view of the abolition of indexation.  The first half hour of the debate has been based on a misconception.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance in his statement today said that this will be applicable as from tonight.  As the Deputy knows, that is now regarded as sufficient to get you out of the retrospective legislation trap.  The statement by the Minister for Finance and this resolution make it possible.  The 50 per cent tax will be applicable as from tonight on profits from development land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing in this resolution has any impact on the retrospectiveness of the legislation.  That part of the Taoiseach's statement is incorrect. Taking him on his first point, that the Minister's statement enables the tax deductions to be retrospective, I must ask the Taoiseach because of the likelihood of a number of transactions in the interval, why the date in the resolution is not 28 January in view of the number of transactions that have occured since that <Col N="673" /> date?  By making it 26 March instead of 28 January, anybody who has known of this has had an opportunity to defeat this. The failure to maintain that date in this resolution has enabled people to get away with it by closing transactions in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if that would stand up.  The January budget did not go through.  Apart from that there is the fact that we are increasing the rate to 50 per cent from the January budget figure of 45 per cent.  That is to make up for possible losses in the interval.</P>

      <P>I did not say that.  I referred to the combination of the Minister's announcement and this resolution. I said that would get over the matter of retrospection.  It will enable the Revenue Commissioners from tonight to give effect to this punitive provision about depositing 30 per cent of the purchase price.  That gives it legislative effect straight away.</P>

I am not complaining about that, but this provision does not enable the Revenue Commissioners to collect in every case amounts necessarily equal to the 50 per cent. Because it does not give that power, in what way does it save the Finance Act becoming retrospective?</P>

I have asked repeatedly in what way this resolution will produce the effect of making nonretrospective legislation retrospective in respect of a tax of 60 per cent when the amount being withheld could be very much more.  Will the Taoiseach please explain in what way the resolution will have that effect?  It is no good going on asserting it.  It must be explained to the House before the House passes it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This resolution is quite clear to me.  It states clearly and sensibly that the deposit to be paid is based on the consideration of the sale of land.  No matter what the price of the land, 30 per cent of the price will be <Col N="675" /> immediately whipped away to the State. I would imagine that 30 per cent of the sale price of land would almost certainly be enough to cover 50 per cent or 60 per cent of the profit on the sale of land.  It appears to me to be crystal clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brennan may not have been here earlier.  We are talking about a capital gains tax without indexation.  The land could have been bought 30 or 40 years ago for some hundreds of pounds an acre and sold now for tens of thousands of pounds per acre. The profit on that could represent 95 per cent of the amount, and 30 per cent of that would not yield a general rate of tax of 60 per cent.  I may misunderstand matters of legality in this respect but perhaps the Taoiseach would explain it to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding of this resolution is that indexation tapering relief is being done away with.  That relief allowed that if a person had an asset for longer than 21 years he did not have to pay tax and if he had it between zero and 21 years he paid on a sliding scale.  Indexation tapering relief is applying the inflation index to the price of land.  Under this resolution indexation relief will be continued for the existing use of land.</P>
      <P>Let us take an extraordinary situation. If land was sold for £100,000, this resolution would enable the solicitors to hold £30,000 and after tonight that money would be held as a deposit on foot of final liability of the capital gains tax.  When the computations are made the capital gains tax may be far less.  For the full sum of £30,000 to be paid as tax the profit on the land would have to be greater than £60,000.  That still would not relieve the taxpayer of his liability to pay capital gains tax.  This resolution enables solicitors to hold money in case the sellers abscond without paying tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I can see, the question of 28 January and 16 March does not arise.  It is only from tonight that money will be withheld.  Money which has been paid out during the last two months cannot be withheld.  The date in the Finance Bill will be the relevant date for the disposal <Col N="676" /> of the land.  We seem to be talking at cross-purposes.  It is possible that the finance legislation could say that all disposals paid after last November should be brought in.  It is the date in the Finance Bill which will determine what disposals will come within the ambit of this new capital gains tax legislation.</P>
    <P>In years past the Revenue Commissioners went back to the date the tax was originally announced because to do otherwise could give some people an unfair advantage.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could assure me that my understanding of this resolution is correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy finally demolished the Taoiseach's argument very effectively when he said that this resolution has nothing to do with the question of retrospectiveness.  As he pointed out, it is irrelevant.  This resolution relates to the withholding of money from now on and to safeguard&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, this resolution is exactly the same as that brought in by Deputy FitzGerald when he was Taoiseach and by Deputy Bruton as Minister for Finance.  The only change is the date and the amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach would listen to my argument.  He is not very receptive.  I will take my argument stage by stage, carefully and slowly because it does not seem to have sunk into the minds of the Deputies on the other side of the House.  First, I want to tell Deputy McCreevy he is wrong in saying that indexation relief is to apply and only tapering relief is abolished.  That is true of capital gains tax generally but in our budget we did not allow indexation in respect of the appreciation in the then existing use value on the date on which the gain was computed.  I want an assurance that this will apply also to the tax now being introduced.  Therefore there is not indexation in respect of the existing use value, only its agricultural value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know what Deputy FitzGerald is attributing to me. Indexation applies to the current use <Col N="677" /> value of development land, as was in his resolution and is in our resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously I have to use words of one syllable.  Deputy McCreevy suggested that indexation relief applies fully and only tapering relief was being abolished.  I want to point out that he is confusing two things.  In this case indexation relief applies only to existing use value, that is agricultural value.  Consequently the whole of the increases in the value of land arising from urbanisation, which could be 90 per cent or 95 per cent, becomes liable for taxation at 60 per cent.  Therefore the 30 per cent withholding does not give a guarantee that one can achieve the 60 per cent amount in respect of somebody who completes a transaction and is now out of the country.</P>
      <P>As Deputy McCreevy properly argued, this resolution has nothing to do with retrospectiveness.  Having got that out of the way&mdash;that the resolution is irrelevant &mdash; the question is, from what date should this tax apply?  What I have been proposing here for the last half hour is that it should apply from 28 January. If it does not, as Deputy Desmond pointed out, many people &mdash; given notice by our budget of the intention to impose this tax and nothing said by Fianna Fáil during the election suggested a contrary intention in this respect &mdash; will have carried through transactions and by virtue of being given notice and the budget being defeated they will have prevented the State from acquiring revenue which it is entitled to and would have acquired if the budget had not been defeated.  I propose that the effective date should be 28 January to cover the problem of avoidance arising from the defeat of the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This resolution has nothing to do with the question of retrospectiveness, as the Taoiseach said, the mere announcement by the Minister of his intention is sufficient to get over that problem, and as the previous Minister announced his intention at the time, it is clear that constitutionally, on the basis of what the Taoiseach said, if we insert 28 January there is no constitutional problem in respect at <Col N="678" /> least of the amount of taxation we then sought to impose.  I suggest that the taxation be imposed from 28 January to 26 March at the rates we proposed and from 28 March at the proposed by the Taoiseach.  In that way we will get over the problem of avoidance which Deputy Desmond pinpointed nearly an hour ago and which I have been trying to get at since.  I think we have now disposed of all the arguments and I ask the Taoiseach to accept my suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy FitzGerald is unnecessarily complicating this matter.  It is clear from the resolution that the 30 per cent of the sale price in normal circumstances would cover the profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brennan is not following the discussion and he is not helping us.  Only the agricultural value is indexed and that is only a tiny part of the total.  The rest is no longer indexed for the purpose of this tax.  In the case of urbanisation, land development or sales in areas of, say, County Dublin, the bulk of the capital gain made on a transaction by somebody who has held land for several decades will now be liable for tax.  At 60 per cent that would be a sum far in excess of 30 per cent of value.  That is the fourth time I have said that and I hope it is clear.</P>
      <P>I am saying this because this resolution has no necessary relationship to the question of retrospectiveness.  Therefore we come back to the Taoiseach's statement that the announcement by the Minister for Finance of his intention to impose the tax of itself gets over the constitutional obstacle.  I propose that the tax should be imposed from 28 January at the rate we proposed and from 26 March at the rate he proposes, so that nobody would have got away with anything because of the accident of the budget being defeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any prospect of the Taoiseach giving an assurance to the House that the Finance Bill will contain the necessary retrospective date &mdash; 28 January?  We are dealing with the tax treatment of development land.  I am speaking as one who was last year's chairman <Col N="679" /> of Dublin County Council and in the knowledge that in the course of the draft development plan we have rezoned 1,453 acres from agricultural use to industrial, commercial and residential use.  Tomorrow there will be before use at a meeting of the county council proposals which would bring in from agricultural use to development land purposes 1,000 acres of land in the south Dublin fringes and also 2,500 acres stretching from Poppin-tree to Kilbarrack.  I have got to know County Dublin during the past 20 years or more and I know what people who own agricultural land stand to gain from such rezoning.  I have estimated that on the treatment proposed from 28 March to 26 July the yield to the Exchequer will be about £600,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Plus 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and that as the Taoiseach knows is the equivalent of the value of about 20 acres of development land.  This is the sort of farce that we are talking about in the context of the legislation that we are trying to introduce tonight.</P>
      <P>On 27 January Deputy Bruton presented a very careful statement to the House.  He estimated that on the treatment proposed then the yield to the Exchequer would be £1.5 million in 1982. He gave instances relating to indexation relief being allowed.  All I am saying here is that while the motions are similar the change of date is a very important factor. The people we are talking about, that wide spectrum who have invested money, are very active and know the difference between one date and another.  They know exactly what to do.  The only way of containing that situation is for the Taoiseach to agree to what we are proposing and on that basis we would be happy with the resolution though we have grave reservations about the discretionary trust aspects that are not in the Resolution but which will be in the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to this tax applying to development land between January and now.  It may well be <Col N="680" /> though that it has to apply only at 45 per cent.  Therefore, we would have to have two rates, one rate between January and March and another from March onwards but that is all subject to legal advice regarding how such provision would stand up in the Finance Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It was worthwhile having the discussion from the point of view of getting that assurance.  I would merely suggest that we amend the date here to read 28 January.  The Taoiseach has said that this resolution is identical with the one tabled in January.  I do not have the January resolution before me but if both resolutions are identical there can hardly be any problem about retrospection. Since the resolution was before the House then people have been on notice.</P>

      <P>My understanding of the constitutional position is that we cannot create retrospectively a criminal offence. In other words, if something that I do today is subsequently declared by the Oireachtas to be a criminal offence I cannot be charged retrospectively with such offence but I am not aware of anything in the Constitution which prevents retrospective taxation.</P>

      <P>I wish to make just one point for the record.  I am concerned with the decision in respect of discretionary trusts.  I hope it will be understood fully by all Members of the House that the anti-avoidance legislation that was introduced was for the purpose of dealing with cases in which people abused discretionary trusts by way of putting money into a trust so that when a death occurred, despite all the children being adult, no capital acquisitions tax was paid.  There is avoidance on a large scale, a scale which can be seen from the figures given in the budget proposed in January and by the loss of capital taxation by way of the dropping of discretionary trusts.  I hope Deputies are clear that, in voting for this budget, they are voting for the dropping of an anti-avoidance measure which would bring in substantial sums of money, would bring in three-fifths of the total amount this year that would have come in capital taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What is now proposed in dropping it is to get rid of most of the additional capital taxation brought in in January in our progressive budget.  I hope Deputies are clear that in voting for this budget they are voting for the abolition of the bulk of the capital taxation we <Col N="683" /> brought in.  When Deputy Sherlock was speaking I had the impression that he thought this budget was having the opposite effect.  This is a budget of remission of capital taxation.  It is a budget to help the tax avoiders, to help the people who have put money into discretionary trusts, not for legimate reasons because there is a question of infant children whose interests have to be protected, but in order to avoid capital acquisitions tax being paid on death and when all the survivors are adults, so that they will never pay capital acquisitions tax.</P>

This resolution will increase the price of petrol. I believe it is possible for the Government to reduce the price of petrol, if they insist, by means of maximum price order, that all the oil companies, some of whom are already doing so, should reduce the prices they are charging at retail levels for petrol in line with the fall which has occurred in oil prices internationally.  The imposition upon the people that will derive from this resolution could be mitigated if the Government had the courage to take this action.  The amendment I am proposing which requires them to do so is completely germane to the thrust of the resolution before the House.  I regret that so far you have not seen your way to allow it.  I hope that on reconsideration, and in view of what I have just said, you will allow it.</P>

      <P>The effect of the tax is to increase the price of petrol so there is no valid distinction between the two.  To the man in the street the effect of the resolution before the House is to increase the price of petrol.  In order to help them I am suggesting to the Government a means by which they could reduce the price of petrol by insisting that the oil companies pass on to the Irish consumer reductions in prices that they are passing on to the British consumer.  I see no reason why the British consumer should benefit from reduced oil prices on the stock markets of the world while the Irish consumer is not allowed to do so, and an Irish Government have not got the courage to take them on.</P>

      <P>I want to make this point of order to you, a Cheann Comhairle. Deputy Bruton is making certain statements about Government action or inaction in regard to the price of petrol. I am in a position to reply very fully to the point he is making but, if the case he is making is not in order, order prevents me from replying to him.  I wish you to protect me in this difficulty in which I find myself.  I can speak at some length about the price of petrol and reductions and so on, but I am prevented from doing so.  I cannot accept a situation where Deputy Bruton can make these accusations without any right of reply on my part.</P>

      <P>My view of this resolution quite clearly is that it is introduced now in a different context, although it is almost identical to the resolution introduced in January.  In January the resolution introduced here did not involve an increase in the price of petrol which was being imposed by means of taxation.  But at that time the position was that no oil company had a proposal to reduce the price of petrol and there was no possibility open to the Government to negative the effect of any tax increase by insisting on a reduction in the price charged by the oil companies.  At that time the conditions did not exist in which the companies had the capacity to reduce the price.</P>
      <P>However, on this occasion, that is possible to the Government because two oil companies have reduced their price in the past 24 hours.  In looking at this resolution the House must take cognisance of the fact that it is doing so now in a very different climate as far as petrol prices are concerned than it would have done were it looking at it in January.  I believe therefore that the House must take note, in its attitude to this resolution&mdash;and I believe Deputies on all sides should do so &mdash;of the fact that the Government, at least so far, have not been prepared to take any action to force the oil companies to reduce their retail prices.</P>

      <P>I have given the Deputy a lot of time.  I am very surprised at Deputy Bruton that he should now make statements like that and question me or say that I did not examine his resolution.  The control of the price of petrol is outside the scope of this and outside the scope of the tax code.  Deputy Bruton knows it and I am very surprised at him persisting in this when it is not relevant to this resolution.</P>

      <P>In seven months in this House this is my third budget.  But on the two previous occasions we scrutinised very carefully the impact on the consumer price index of every proposed tax increase.  We considered it in terms of fractions of a penny and fractions of a percentage point.  It is quite impossible to consider the implications of this resolution without regard to what is happening overall.  Overall there is potential for a reduction in the price of petrol.

However, I am now speaking to the resolution and, as Deputy Birmingham has correctly pointed out, one of the germane factors in deciding whether or not this resolution should be allowed is its impact on the consumer price index. One can only know its impact on the consumer price index if one knows the attitude the Government are taking or are not taking&mdash;and this evening it seems to be a case of not taking at the moment anyway&mdash;in regard to the possibility of reducing the price to compensate for the increase in the taxation on the price of petrol.</P>

If the Opposition spokesman is entitled to go into the price of petrol to the consumer then I assume, by way of reply, I will be entitled to go into that, deal with the arguments he makes and indicate to the House that we will be making a Maximum Prices Order dealing with the price of petrol later on and all that is involved in the actual price of petrol to the consumer at the pumps.

He is a Deputy of long standing in this House and he should be ashamed of concealing such information.  I have sought to get it from him in the best of good spirits, not seeking to adopt anything other than such an approach, but he has declined to give that information.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In the table to subsection (I) (a) to delete &ldquo;The first £1,000&rdquo; and &ldquo;The first £2,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;The first £2,000&rdquo; and &ldquo;The first £4,000&rdquo; respectively therefor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment increases the 25 per cent and 35 per cent bands for income tax and my reason for tabling it is twofold.  I wish to establish, by means of proposing increases in the bands applying to the low paid, the fact that the budget, in particular this resolution, by abolishing the concept of tax credits and the family income supplement &mdash; both provisions of the January budget &mdash; is taking from the people most directly affected by this relief benefits that would have gone to them under the January budget.  The low paid were to benefit from the family income supplement and from tax credits. The decision of the Government to retain the unfair allowance system and not to provide for tax credits is abandoning a <Col N="703" /> possibility which existed for the reforming of our tax system in order to help the low paid in a very constructive and direct fashion.</P>
    <P>It is very important that people at work who are on the margin between social welfare and work, whose income at work is not appreciably greater then their income would be under social welfare, should be given an added incentive to work because it is work that makes a country strong and creates prosperity for everybody.  The family income supplement and the general reform of the tax system in favour of substituting tax credits for tax allowances had the effect of helping the low paid at work and giving them benefits they could never get from social welfare because they are not on social welfare.  I regret that the Government have decided not to introduce the tax credits or the family income supplement. It is a very pale and insufficient substitute for this lack on their part that I am moving this amendment.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it is not possible for me within the rules of order to move an amendment which would provide for tax credits because that would represent a charge on the Exchequer.  It is not possible for me for the same reason to move an amendment which would reinsert the family income supplement because again that would represent a charge on the Exchequer.  It would be ruled out of order by the Chair.  However, it is possible for me to move this amendment, inadequate though it is.  It is an insufficient surrogate for tax credits and the family income supplement.  I am moving the amendment in order to help, as far as it is possible to do so within the very inadequate tax allowance system, the low paid. The fact that everybody up to the 60p band will benefit from the widening of the 25 per cent and 35 per cent band and the fact that those on the higher rate will benefit more than those on the lower rate because it will be worth more to them indicates clearly the defects of the allowance system as against the tax credits system.  The tax credits system would give an equal benefit to everybody and not a <Col N="704" /> disproportionate benefit to those at a high pay level.</P>
    <P>I want to bring to the attention of the House that, from the point of view of social equity, the greatest defect in the budget is the abandonment of tax credits and the family income supplement.  I hope all Members on this side of the House will see their way to supporting my amendment so that we can show that we believe in a progressive income tax system, that we believe in tax credits and in the principle represented by the family income supplement which would give direct help to the least well off people at work in our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is unacceptable for the very simple reason that it would cost about £100 million in the year.  One does not need to be a very skilled mathematician to appreciate that that would throw the whole budgetary arithmetic out of order.  Apart from that the effect of the amendment would be to benefit those with large incomes.  The case Deputy Bruton has made for his amendment is not valid because the benefit of these changes would go almost entirely to people with large incomes some of whom would benefit from this proposal by up to £700 per year.  With regard to the general case made by Deputy Bruton, I should like to put the record straight.  The first thing I should like to deal with is the question of tax credits.  When we came to office we found a situation in which it was virtually impossible to proceed with that tax credits scheme because the administrative machinery was not there to do the job.  It almost certainly could not have been created in time so that the production of that tax credit scheme was impracticable this year and in the circumstances of this year. Therefore, we said to the Revenue Commissioners: &ldquo;Please devise for us a scheme within the existing structure which would, in so far as the income taxpayer is concerned, grant him the same measure of relief at least&rdquo;.  The proposal in this resolution is to give effect to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we propose in the budget will effect the same improvement in the situation <Col N="705" /> of the PAYE taxpayer as the tax credit scheme would have done but it has the advantage that it does it in a far simpler way and in a way which can be effectively and efficiently administered in the year ahead.  The argument about the tax credits put forward by Deputy Bruton in favour of his amendment does not stand up.  With regard to the question of the family income supplement&mdash;Deputy Bruton referred to this on a number of occasions today &mdash; the situation there is that without the introduction of the £9.60 scheme that scheme could not have been introduced, the two were inextricably bound up together.  Again, we said to the appropriate administrative officials: &ldquo;Devise for us a scheme which will use the same amount of money as would have been involved in the family income supplement scheme, namely, £4 million, which will go to the same type of families and in the same amount&rdquo;.  The Minister for Finance has already outlined that that £4 million which would have been absorbed by the family income supplement scheme will now be distributed to the same sort of families through the child allowance scheme announced today.  On the income tax credits scheme and the family income supplement scheme the provisions announced by Deputy MacSharry achieve almost identical results for the same sort of people as the other schemes would have brought about.  On that basis we recommend the resolution which brings considerable relief to PAYE taxpayers.</P>
    <P>We are also asking that the amendment put forward by Deputy Bruton be rejected, first because it could not be accommodated within the budget figures, and Deputy Bruton and the Fine Gael Party in particular have been adamant that we must reduce the current budget deficit.  At the same time they now bring forward an amendment which would add £100 million to that current budget deficit. Further, I want to remind Deputy Bruton in regard to this amendment that when he came to put his budget before the House last January he had to run away from his proposal about reducing the 35 per cent tax band to 25 per cent. It is a bit insincere and hollow of him in <Col N="706" /> view of his own approach to the January 27 budget now to come in with this amendment which would cost the Exchequer at least £100 million in the coming year when we are achieving by our proposals very considerable relief both for PAYE taxpayers and the category of families in the £2,000-£4,000 income bracket who would have been covered by the family income supplement.</P>

      <P>I am never quite sure; I have to watch my back.  Congress regards this a progressive step which will improve the equity of the system.  As far as I know the general secretary of my trade union fully supports the introduction of a system of tax credits.  So far as I know the general president of my union, who is also on the executive of Congress, fully supports the introduction of tax credits.  I do not know what personal rates of tax Members of the front bench opposite pay but I assume they pay rates which would vary from 35 per cent to 60 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may take my own simple case.  I earn a Dáil Deputy's salary of £13,890 a year of which 50 per cent is tax free.  The tax liability on general income is half of that. <Col N="707" /> I get a married allowance of £2,230; I get allowances for three children &mdash; I have four but one is working.  I tend to have a liability of 35 per cent.  The £2,230 married allowance that I have is worth to me precisely £780.  There are other Deputies who are paying tax at 60 per cent.  I do not necessarily envy them but I am aware that they have much higher incomes. They have a married allowance equally of £2,230 but because they are on the 60 per cent tax rate it is worth to them £1,338 on the marginal rate.  That is what the tax credit is all about.  I repeat the figures.  A tax credit of £2,230, which is the current married allowance to somebody on the 35 per cent rate, is worth £780 but it is worth a great deal more to somebody on the 60 per cent marginal rate &mdash; it is worth £1,338.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was very careful when he said that it would produce almost identical results.  Of course one always has to qualify the very careful generalities of the Taoiseach.  The reply is &ldquo;not quite almost&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach says it is virtually impossible to implement the tax system. In my very short sojourn with Deputy Bruton in the Department of Finance I received in seven months no submission from the Revenue Commissioners.  I have had many contacts, questions and answers but I know of no computer breakdown and, as far as I understand, the system would be ready for operation almost immediately as they were fully aware of the previous Government's commitment in that direction.  The Taoiseach said the administrative machinery would not be able to cope.  I have not heard of principal officers or assistant secretaries, HEOs or tax officers having traumatic nights trying to implement tax credits.  I have no reports of industrial disputes, go-slows or prospects of stoppages. The system is quite capable of being introduced, as the Taoiseach well knows.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I do not accept the preposterous argument advanced tonight or the very weak argument of the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, that a switch to tax credits for the next income tax year at this stage would merely give <Col N="708" /> rise to enormous administrative confusion. The Irish people, when it comes to income taxation are, I can assure the Taoiseach, well aware of their rights.  I am quite certain that a tax credit system which we were proposing of £1,000 for all married couples irrespective of their tax liability was an entirely new and progressive approach to taxation.</P>

      <P>I feel that those who took part in the PAYE marches in Dublin <Col N="709" /> will be very disappointed with the budget proposals before us here today.  If there is anything missing from this budget it is an attempt to reform the PAYE system. In fact this resolution indicates that not only is there no proposal to reform the PAYE system, but in fact a retrograde step is being taken even by comparison with the reforms in the January budget. This, together with the proposed changes in the allowances for mortgage interest against tax, will hit more those on slightly above average taxable incomes. It is very clear that those who call this budget a good one have very little knowledge of the tax system.  Those who are on £5,500 taxable income, if they exceed that income, will have their rate of tax increased by one-third.</P>
      <P>It is a very significant change which is being imposed here.  It works against the average income earner.  It is not anything that one who represents a working class constituency, as I do, could support.  It is a very backward step, which I resent very much.  This point should be highlighted and I propose to do so whenever I get an opportunity.  Very simply, for those who do not know the tax credit system, £1,000 tax allowance for a man in the 60 per cent tax band is worth £600, whereas it is worth only £250 to a man on the 25 per cent band.  Tax credit proposes to change that and give the same allowance to both these people.  The steps being taken to depart from the tax credit system and further narrow the tax bands will hit very hard individuals with the £5,500 taxable incomes.  The Taoiseach has indicated that the cost of this change will be in excess of £100 million.  It is obvious that this £100 million is taken from the lower paid workers to be used in subsidising those who are not paying capital gains tax, although these will have their capital gains tax liability, as proposed in the January budget, further reduced.  I do not see how anybody who represents a constituency similar to mine could support this resolution.  I support very strongly the amendment put down by Deputy John Bruton.</P>

      <P>In rejecting the amendment, as the Taoiseach did, his substantial ground for so doing was that if Deputy Bruton's proposals were to find favour with the House, those on the upper income levels would benefit disproportionately, that they would be the people who would benefit most from the widening of the tax band, as proposed by Deputy Bruton.  If that objection is valid <Col N="712" /> for the widening suggested by Deputy Bruton, then it is an objection which is equally a substantial argument against the resolution as introduced by the Taoiseach. In fact, it is a valid objection both to the amendment and to the resolution. It is an objection to any tax system which is based on tax allowances.  The Taoiseach told us that he had decided that the tax credits were administratively impossible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes.  He said that he looked to the Revenue Commissioners to produce a formula which would achieve almost the same result.  With respect to the Taoiseach, it is an abuse of language to suggest that to replace a system which provided flat relief across the board by a relief which is regressive and which gives relief disproportionately to those on the upper end of the scale&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not valid to suggest that has almost the same effect. Of course, it gives disproportionate relief.  Any system based on a widening of tax allowances, as distinct from tax credits, must have that effect.  If that was a strange use of the words &ldquo;almost exactly the same&rdquo;, even stranger was the ground on which the Taoiseach rejected any suggestion of a need for the family income supplement.  The Taoiseach, in opposing the amendment, said that it was an integral part of the tax credit system, that it could not stand on its own without it, but that they had come forward with a scheme which would help the same sort of families.  Do I quote the Taoiseach correctly in saying that when he found he could not go ahead with the family income supplement he looked for a device which would help the same sort of families?</P>

      <P>The family income supplement, by definition, was designed to help people, not in the social welfare net but who are working and are on low incomes.  The Taoiseach has told us that he is taking £4 million which was originally available for people working but on low incomes and giving it to social welfare beneficiaries and says that he is giving it to the same families.  It is a matter for the House to decide where the £4 million should be spent, but to suggest that one is giving it to the same families when, by definition, not one single family which would have been a beneficiary of the family income supplement could now be a beneficiary under the Taoiseach's proposal and to suggest that that is more or less the same, is to turn logic on its head.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In the previous budget proposals a tax credit of £1,000 was the equivalent of an allowance of £4,000.  At the appropriate bands, if one's marginal rate was 60p in the £ it was a net saving of £2,400 but, if one was paying the standard rate of tax, it was a net saving of £1,400.  The difference between working on tax credits and bands favours somebody on the 60p tax band to the tune of £1,000.  There is obviously no attempt to reform income tax payments in these tables.  Does the PAYE allowance remain?</P>

I want to confirm the relevant levels of income on which a single person proceeds to the tax bands.  On my calculations a single person goes on to a 45p band at £6,050, a 55p band at £8,750 and to a 60p band at £10,050.  We have all seen payslips and P.60s belonging to people who are applying for loans from local authorities or building societies. These are extraordinarily low levels of income on which to be moving to very high tax bands.  A single person earning over £10,000 a year is on to the maximum tax band rate.  This resolution, as presented, and the financial provisions for income tax in the budget, make no attempt to remove the heavy burden on PAYE workers.  The increases in wages which have been granted will be reduced substantially because people will move so quickly to high levels of taxation that the net effect will be a substantial reduction in living standards.</P>

A married person, with a spouse, earning from £4,400 per annum to, say, £8,000 per annum, which is probably the bulk of PAYE workers, makes a saving of £234.50 between the coming year and last year.  There is a saving between what we are now proposing in Financial Resolution No. 3 and what would have obtained under the tax credit system.  What we are proposing comes out a winner, whether you compare the situation in 1982-83 with 1981-82, or whether you compare what we propose and what was proposed in the January budget.</P>

      <P>Some moments ago the Taoiseach referred to the fact that what is being done in the context of redistribution of wealth by way of social welfare payments would have the same effect as the family income supplement.  Possibly I am naive but I am confused about this. The income supplement proposed in the previous budget would have provided assistance for those in employment but with low pay, whereas the proposal the Minister for Finance put before the House today is concerned with a transfer of money to those in receipt of social welfare who, by definition, would be unemployed.  I am not suggesting that those in receipt of social welfare benefits should not receive additional assistance. But this budget, by retaining the allowance and by not providing a family income supplement, has not provided additional assistance for those on low incomes.  The amendment would provide that extra assistance to the extent that those in receipt of low pay in employment would be left with a larger sum of money in their pockets than they will be left with <Col N="717" /> under the resolution.  I fail to understand how it can be suggested that what the Government now propose to do is in any way a substitute for or equivalent to the the family income supplement.</P>

      <P>Under the family supplement scheme the income would have to be below £4,000.  Anybody is entitled to claim allowances against gross income. Quite clearly the Taoiseach has been quoting gross income figures which apparently do not take any account&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He would benefit only if his income was less than £4,000 a year. I would point out that the amendments I have tabled, as the Taoiseach has claimed, would cost £100 million, but only because it is not possible to give a benefit to low income people within the tax allowance system without giving unintended <Col N="718" /> benefits to people on higher incomes.  It is that sort of thing that contributes to the cost.  Unfortunately, because of the rules of order, it is not possible for me to introduce an amendment to provide for tax credits or a family income supplement scheme because they would represent a charge.  Oddly enough, I am able to introduce an amendment which would represent a loss of revenue of £250,000.  I have been forced into the position of introducing the amendment. As I have said, I introduced the amendment to provide an inadequate substitute for the family supplement and the tax credits.  I hope I will be able to get a decision in this House accepting this, inadequate though it is.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Bruton is proposing to us seriously is that we should benefit a large number of reasonably well-off people, high income people, some of them to the extent of £700 a year in tax benefits.  To do that he would add £100 million, at least, to the current budget deficit.  The effect of his amendment would be to add £100 million to the current deficit in order to give relief to very well-off people, some of them to the extent of £700 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the point.  The effect of the amendment shows up the absurdity and the inequity of the decision to retain the tax allowance system as against the credit system.  The Government's decision to do that is a move away from the first real attempt to get equity into the taxation system, so that allowances which benefit the well-off much more than the less well-off would be replaced by a system of credits of equal value to people, regardless of income.  The fact that that has been turned down by the Government means that any step taken to help those at the bottom of the scale would have a disproportionate effect on those higher up.  Out of his own mouth the Taoiseach has condemned his own decision to stick to the allowance system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will try to illustrate the effect of his <Col N="719" /> decision.  First of all, his statement about a person with 393 acres of land is nonsense. Only a person whose taxable income did not exceed £4,000 would have benefited.  That was defined in the January budget statement.  I do not know what kind of system has been thought up to produce the effect the Taoiseach has spoken of.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Had we gone ahead with that the effect would have been that a family man with £2,500 a year would have his tax liability reduced to £65 whereas this budget will mean that figure will be £112.  A person with £3,000 a year whose tax liability would have been £240 will now pay £287.  They are single people at the bottom of the scale.  It is the Government's proposal to tax such people more heavily.  That is what we will be voting on, more taxation of the less well-off because they earn their incomes. There are some people who earn as little as £2,000 a year.  In their cases there will be £500 of a difference &mdash; £500 in benefit they would have got under our scheme. People with £4,000 a year will now have to pay £125 a year in tax whereas under our scheme they would have got £280. We come to people with six children.  At £2,000 a year they would have got a benefit of £500.  They will get nothing now. At £5,000 a year people with six children would have paid £32 tax but now they will pay £225, £4 per week extra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government have not been prepared to introduce an equitable system of taxation and have rejected our system for no other reason than that we proposed it.  The equity of our system is self-evident.  There can be no justification for turning away from it and the Taoiseach's statement during the campaign that it could not be implemented on time was incorrect and did not derive from consultations with the Department of Finance, who informed us subsequently that there was no problem because all preparations were made.  It was sabotage by the incoming Government because it <Col N="720" /> was something we had thought up to help the less well-off people in the community, and it is because we thought it up that they are to suffer under this Government. That is what this debate is about and that is what we are discussing here.  Putting down this amendment was the only way within the rules of order of this House that we could illustrate the absurdity and inequity of the decision of the Government to abolish this major tax reform, both in the form of the tax credit itself and in the form of the additional family income supplement, which was introduced as a joint measure by Fine Gael and Labour according to their proposal before the election of 1981.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I most regret the change of Government is that, as a result, these less well-off people will be deprived of the benefits which we had arranged &mdash;and for no reason.  Not because it cannot be done, because we were told firmly that there was no problem and that it could be done and arrangements had been made; not because there was something wrong with the system; but simply because we had thought it up.  It was because of sheer desire to sabotage what we had proposed that people on low incomes are deprived.  Of course, if one happens to be somebody with a discretionary trust and passing on money from one generation to the next by that means, then one is all right under Fianna Fáil. But if one has an income of £5,000 a year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The point that I wanted to make &mdash; and I want to prove that it is in order &mdash; was that Deputy Bruton's amendment would add £100 million to the current budget deficit and that party over there stumped this country on the basis that the current budget deficit had to be reduced or the country would go bust.

      <P>Let me conclude on the amendment.  This amendment is designed to help the low paid.  It is embedded in the allowance system, which is the only system we can use as a basis for amendments on this because of the unwise decision of the Government to abandon tax credits.  However it is our intention, at the earliest available opportunity, in Government with a majority, to get rid of this allowance system and introduce credits.  In this way changes like this designed to help the low paid will help the low paid and no one else and will not be wasting money, as will happen so long as we retain the allowance system.  This Government are asking this House to vote to give costly benefits to people who do not need them.</P>

      <P>This resolution proposes a package of VAT amendments which involve changes both in the level and coverage of the different rates of VAT.  These are as follows.</P>
      <P>First, it increases the present low rate from 15 per cent to 18 per cent, excluding books.  Second, it increases to 30 per cent the charge on goods and services&mdash; excluding furniture, joinery, floor coverings, bed linen and household furnishings which are being transferred to the low rate &mdash; which are at present liable at 25 per cent.  Thirdly, it reduces the rate of VAT on furniture, floor coverings, bedding and bed linen and household furnishings from the present 25 per cent rate to the new 18 per cent rate.  It reduces the rate of VAT on books from the present 15 per cent rate to zero.</P>
      <P>Arising from the increase in the main VAT rates it raises from 1.5 per cent to 1.8 per cent the level of the flat-rate percentage paid to farmers as an addition to the price of their produce in compensation for the tax borne by them on their purchases of taxable goods and services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It makes provision to ensure that despite the increase in the general VAT rates the existing 3 per cent effective rate on buildings will be preserved, and it makes similar provision in respect of the services of agricultural contractors to <Col N="731" /> which the 3 per cent rate was extended in the July budget.</P>

      <P>I understand that the reason the amendment was ruled out of order is that it is not included in the resolution before the House and that the matter of the imposition of VAT at point of entry on imports will be dealt with in the Finance Bill.  Between now and then the precise details of it will be worked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the decision to impose VAT at point of entry on raw materials is very damaging to Irish industry because it will force industry to borrow money to pay tax in advance of when it would normally pay it.  It should be able to borrow this money to expand its productive base.  It will draw money out of the banking system into the financing of this advance tax payment and this money should be available either to keep interest rates down or to help general productive investment rather than for this artificial advance tax payment.  I accept that there is a case for advance VAT payment in respect of consumer goods, because imported consumer goods should be discouraged to the extent that one can discourage them by requiring an earlier payment of VAT; but one should not discourage in the same way raw material for processing by industry. Industry gives jobs and anything that increases, even temporarily, the cost of industry is bad for employment.  That is why I was very anxious to raise this matter by means of the amendment I am proposing here.  The Chair has ruled that this is out of order, although he gave the wrong explanation for his ruling.</P>

      <P>This provision in regard to advance payment will damage industry. I have made the point and will do so again on another occasion.  Unfortunately I cannot pursue my amendment.</P>
      <P>I welcome the reduction in VAT on furniture and furnishings.  This is a very valuable proposal and will assist those setting up home by reducing the cost of furnishing a house.  It must be recognised that furniture, beds, carpets and chairs should not bear the luxury rate of VAT and I am glad the Minister has accepted the proposal made in my budget to reduce the level of VAT applied to these commodities.</P>
      <P>I am glad it has been possible to reduce to zero the level of VAT on books and I recognise the help this will be to the propagation of knowledge in our community and to the book industry.  It is a welcome measure but I would inquire as to the procedures which must be adopted to obtain permission, if such permission is necessary, for the introduction of a new zero-rate of VAT.  I understand that under EEC rules it is not possible &mdash; at least I was so advised &mdash; to introduce any new zero-rates into our VAT system. Perhaps the Minister would say what advice he has received on the matter and whether he has the consent of the Community for this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not reply to the first point since it would be out of order. The EEC laws allow for marginal changes in the coverage of existing zero-rates. This is a significant change but rather small in the context of our VAT system as a whole and given that I am bringing a large number of exempt services into the system, I believe we will be able to get EEC sanction for the package as a <Col N="734" /> whole.  We are being consistent with EEC objectives in this.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister taken any steps to ensure that he will get EEC agreement on this?  As I understand it, he has just said it would be his intention to put this package into the EEC system.  Is he not sure that he will get agreement and has he already taken steps to get that agreement?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Minister has a publicly stated proclivity for breaking rules but there is an EEC directive governing these matters and as a member of the Community we are obliged to apply that directive.  In the normal course of events I do not think the application of the directive would leave us the freedom to go ahead and do something which might be contrary to the terms of the directive and have to catch up with it afterwards.  It would have been wise to clear the decks and see what the situation was before taking action of this kind so that we would not have to undo it in the event of its being unacceptable.  I again ask the Minister whether he has received clearance for this matter and, if not, whether he intends to take up the matter with the Community authorities before the date on which this change would become effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The concept of zero-rating on books is one which we certainly support.  If the Minister can give us an assurance that it is compatible with EEC directives and that there is no danger of its being brought down, we will certainly support it wholeheartedly.  If he is in any doubt, however, and cannot give that assurance, I wonder whether it would be wiser for us to impose a nominal rate of tax rather than a zero-rate.  We are working together on this problem.  Might it not be wiser to impose, say, 1 per cent rather than a zero rate?  If the Minister can give us an assurance that there is no problem then we will accept it, although the words &ldquo;no problem&rdquo; from him might carry different weight than they might from another Minister.  If he cannot give an assurance that it will not be struck down under an EEC directive I suggest that he insert a nominal figure such as 1 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I really understand what the Minister has said. Earlier he seemed to indicate that he was not entirely clear whether this was compatible. Now he has given an assurance that it is compatible.  Earlier he spoke of a possible need to clear this with the EEC authorities.  I again ask whether he has taken any advice on this matter?  My understanding is that when the relevant EEC directive was passed it was clear that existing zero-rates were confirmed and could be continued but that there was a serious limitation on the ability of member states to introduce new zero-rates.</P>
      <P>I submit that the measure the Minister proposed and which we support can be presented as being a marginal change in the application of the VAT rates.  If it were a marginal change it would have been done a long time ago and we should not have had the difficulties which have arisen on the definition and the financial impact of the measures.</P>
      <P>Again I ask the Minister if he proposes to clear this matter because there is a wide measure of doubt, even in his own mind, about whether he can proceed in the way he proposes and which we agree would be desirable.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's views on many of these issues. Every public representative has been very concerned about VAT on school books.  There is great difficulty in making a distinction between school books and other books.  There is not as great a difficulty in making a distinction between school books, books and then periodicals, magazines and newspapers.  Taking into account that in this case I was covering school books, I was satisfied to zero-rate books as such.</P>

      <P>In the context of differentiating between booklets and periodicals, I respectfully suggest it is a matter for more precise definition than this.  It is proposed to leave it to the authorities to determine when matter is coming into the State.  There are booklets and periodicals which may be printed three or four times a year and which at the moment are used in relation to education and in the professions.  I will give an illustration of this.  There are law reports, some of which are published and produced weekly and there are other legal reports which are only produced two or <Col N="741" /> three times a year.  There are books of a similar nature which are only produced two or three times a year.  Could the Minister indicate what the difference is and how it can be determined which are booklets and which are periodicals? There is a very fine distinction to be made.</P>

      <P>That is an extraordinary statement.  The Minister is suggesting that we should pass a Financial Resolution determining zero-rating on some printed works and 18 per cent VAT rate on other printed works without our knowing exactly what works it extends to.  I suggest, having regard to the function of this House, that if a definition, as the Minister now tells us, is to be made available, it should be defined within the terms of the resolution before the House. I fail to understand how Members of the House can vote on a matter without knowing exactly what publications are to be zero-rated and what publications are to be rated at 18 per cent VAT.  I suggest to the Minister that, if this definition is available, he propose an amendment to this resolution including the definitions, stating clearly what is a booklet and what is a periodical within the terms of the resolution before the House tonight.</P>

Magazines, newspapers, periodicals, including missalettes and comics, will be liable to the 18 per cent rate.  Maps and globes will be liable to the 18 per cent rate.

      <P>That still does not clarify the difference between a booklet and a periodical.  It merely indicates certain items which will be rated at 18 per cent. I respectfully suggest to the Minister that that still leaves a grey area in which it will not be known what is zero-rated and what is rated at 18 per cent.  I would like also to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that if he intends that periodicals retain a VAT rating of 18 per cent there are a number of periodicals produced by charitable and religious organisations to raise funds and they are as worthy of being zero-rated as other items?</P>
      <P>The Minister might reconsider, within the context of this Resolution, two additional items which affect families with children, especially those with a large number of children, on which the Minister intends retaining 18 per cent VAT rate.  In the context of paragraph (4) of this Resolution, the Minister seems to have some vindictive approach to comics which I do not understand.  Possibly he might consider that children's comics like children's books should not be VAT-rated at 18 per cent.  Could the Minister indicate his particular thinking in this regard?  Not only does he intend retaining 18 per cent VAT on comics but for some reason, if one looks at subsection (3) (b) of this Resolution, whilst reducing the VAT rating from 25 per cent to 18 per cent for beds, including cots and cradles, he wants to retain 25 per cent rating for baby carriages.  Could the Minister explain the thinking behind that?</P>

I suggest to the Minister, in the context of the problem concerning zero-rating on books, that it is not clear to what it applies.  For some reason the Minister seems to believe that all books, including children's books, should be zero-rated, and for some very odd reason comics should have an 18 per cent VAT rate.  I suggest this is very inconsistent.  I also suggest it is relevant to the resolution before the House.  The Minister feels that he must retain the 25 per cent VAT rate on baby carriages when clearly within the context of this resolution baby carriages could be reduced to 18 per cent VAT rate.  I propose an amendment to this resolution to the Minister to reduce the VAT rate on baby carriages from 25 per cent to 18 per cent and I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>

How could we put down an amendment in relation to the subtle distinction between missals, which are free of VAT, and missalettes handed out in churches on Sunday, which are 18 per cent VAT rated, and the Minister had not told us about this distinction until a few minutes ago?

      <P>The subject of law reports has been mentioned already in this debate.  I might explain to the Minister the options that exist for someone who subscribes to a particular series of law reports.  These reports are published from time to time but not always at regular intervals in booklet form and they can be taken up on that basis.  Alternatively, <Col N="747" /> a person has the option of waiting until the end of the year when the reports arrive in the form of a bound volume.  It seems extraordinary that if they come on an irregular basis throughout the year in booklet form one runs the risk of having them deemed to be periodicals whereas if one decides to be out of date and to wait until the end of the year one will find himself free of 18 per cent VAT.  How would the Minister seek to justify that situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that situation would arise.  I have given the list of items that would be excluded but perhaps it would be appropriate for me to state how the Revenue Commissioners have listed the definition of requirements that would be necessary for zero-rating. These are that the cover of the book must be distinctive, that at least the outside of the front cover must be devoid of the text, must comprise not fewer than four leaves, that is eight pages exclusive of the cover, and must be bound loosely or otherwise or stitched or stapled.  The example given by the Deputy would be a zero-rated item.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The vast majority of periodicals would come within that context so that we could create the situation in which if in one month a periodical had on its front page half a dozen sentences it would have to be VAT rated at 18 per cent while in the following months if it carried a pleasant picture on the front with just the title, it would be zero-rated. That would be a difficult and illogical distinction to have to make.  Retail outlets who will have to operate the legislation will find themselves in total chaos.  In <Col N="748" /> the light of the anomalies that he has highlighted concerning zero-rating books but not periodicals, would he now consider withdrawing the resolution and resubmitting it next week in a form that is acceptable to the House?</P>
      <P>In the context of the possibility of amending the resolution at this stage, I would point out that it is only as a result of the debate this evening that we have some form of definition as to what is meant by books and booklets and periodicals. This was not referred to in the budget statement and is not defined in the resolution before us.  If the Members of this House wish to know what they are voting on, these terms should be fully defined within the resolution.  That is why I suggest that the resolution be resubmitted. This would also give the Minister an opportunity to consider zero-rating both newspapers and periodicals and of reducing the VAT rating on baby carriages from 25 to 18 per cent.  I see no <i>rationale</i> in retaining a 25 per cent rate on baby carriages while reducing the rate on cots. There are many families for whom the baby carriage acts as the cot so that there is very little distinction there.  Are we to have a situation in which a cot from which the wheels are detachable is to be VAT rated at 18 per cent while one from which the wheels are detachable is to be VAT rated at 25 per cent.  With respect, I suggest to the Minister that by failing to deal with these matters in the context of the resolution he is reducing the resolution to absurdity and he should reconsider it and resubmit it to the House next week.</P>

In view of the fact that the majority of books and booklets sold here are produced abroad and imported, it appears to be eminently reasonable that if a device has been found whereby zero-rating can be introduced for part of the printed word it should also apply to home produced newspapers and periodicals.  I am sure there are people on the Government side of the House who appreciate that point.</P>

      <P>I have already explained to Deputy FitzGerald, and he accepts it, that there is no precedent for entering an amendment after the discussion had commenced on a Financial Resolution.  Therefore, it is not in order to talk about an amendment which is not before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in order to talk about the content of the resolution which seeks to continue and increase the rate of VAT on newspapers and periodicals.  Had it been in order to do so, I am sure Deputy <Col N="752" /> FitzGerald would have introduced an amendment to zero-rate newspapers and periodicals because books and booklets are now to be zero-rated.  However, since the Chair ruled that the amendment he sought to introduce was not in order he was not able to introduce it.  That does not prevent the House from discussing the question as to whether newspapers and periodicals which are home produced should not be zero-rated.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the books and booklets sold here are imported from abroad.  That now seems particularly unfair bearing in mind the consistent advice given by various Ministers for Finance that it was not possible to zero-rate any printed item.  If a device has now been found to allow zero-rating of books and booklets, it appears to be eminently fair that that zero-rating should also be extended to newspapers and periodicals.</P>
      <P>We all know that the answer given consistently to the publishers of newspapers at national and provincial level was that they could not be exempted from value-added tax because the State was precluded from doing so by EEC regulations. Apparently a device has now been found to allow imported books and publications to be zero-rated, while home produced periodicals and national and provincial newspapers are to have their rate of VAT increased by 3 per cent.  That appears to us to be extremely unfair.  If a loophole has been found then it should be availed of to bring some relief to the Irish publishing and newspaper industry. I should like the Minister to explain to us his reference to the question of it being possibly all right to zero-rate books and booklets but potentially not possible to introduce a zero-rating on newspapers and periodicals.  The Minister referred to that about 20 minutes ago.  I wonder if he could expand on his remarks in relation to that.</P>

      <P>One matter to which I should like to respond immediately is the Deputy's remark that there was discrimination against home-produced matter as against imports.  That is not the case.  Books and booklets, whether printed at home or imported will be zero-rated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the bulk of books sold in this country are imported it appears to be discriminating against the national and provincial newspaper trade, an entirely home-based industry.  They will now be discriminated against because other printed word material will be sold without any value-added tax being imposed while they will continue to carry value-added tax, and at an increased rate. The question I addressed to the Minister was in relation to a remark he made some 20 minutes ago suggesting that, were he to extend the zero-rating to newspapers and periodicals, it might then create difficulties for him in relation to strictures from the European Community whereas in his opinion zero-rating on books and booklets would not.  Could the Minister explain to the House the reason he might find difficulty in zero-rating newspapers which are home-produced and not in zero-rating books or booklets?</P>

If there is some suggestion that it is possible but perhaps is not financially feasible in any particular year to do so, then that is news indeed.

      <P>The point the Deputy is making is valid and refers to the earlier replies I have given on the same question. This is where the difference arises between what might be described by them as a marginal extension and a major extension.  Again that is apart altogether from what I said in an earlier reply in relation to the money, £4.9 million for books and booklets, as against £27 million more for covering the other items under their amendment.</P>

      <P>Apart from the financial aspect, which I can accept, you can get away with £4.9 million for books and booklets in one year as a marginal extension, but not with £27 million for newspapers. Perhaps there might even be some hope for the publishing industry on the basis that in a subsequent year, if newspapers under a certain number of pages and size were to be excluded, that might constitute only a further marginal extension; and in a subsequent year newspapers below a certain further number of pages and size could be excluded as a further marginal extension.  Is the Minister now telling us that if this is done in a creeping way it is possible, whereas if done in one fell swoop it might attract the attention of the eagle eyes of the Berlaymont?</P>

      <P>We have been discussing this matter now for some time.  It is genuinely difficult to take seriously the pleadings of the Opposition in regard to removing value-added tax from newspapers. I find it difficult that they do not remember that it is just six short weeks ago since they had an opportunity to do something about this.  Not only did they not tackle it but they did not even tackle the removal of value-added tax from books.  Therefore, I find it rather hollow that we should spend so long on this item when they in fact had the pen in their hands a very short time ago.  I do not doubt that they would like to remove VAT from newspapers &mdash; I suppose we all would if the cash were available &mdash; but frankly I find it rather hollow and shabby, to say the least, that they were not able to find the wherewithal to tackle the school books issue.</P>

      <P>This resolution provides for, first, increases in the road tax on private cars of £1 per unit of horse power for cars not exceeding 8 horse power, £2 per unit of horse power on the present rates for cars in the range 9 to 20 <Col N="760" /> horse power and £3 per unit of horse power for cars exceeding 20 horse power; secondly, the doubling of the rates of road tax on motor cycles; thirdly, increases in the maximum rates of road tax for taxis and hackneys from £16.50 and £30 respectively to £30 and £50 respectively, with corresponding changes in the other rates for these vehicles; an increase from £20 to £30 on the limit below which annual licences only can be taken out.  These changes are to apply in respect of licence tax discs taken out in respect of periods commencing on or after 1 May next.  The extra yield, as I have already said, from these measures is estimated at £10.5 million in 1982 and £15.9 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>I want to elicit this information. May we take it that the Fianna Fáil Party represented here tonight by Deputy MacSharry no longer believe in the abolition of road tax and that they are now willing to admit having turned their back on the promise that was signalled by natty little pseudo tax discs that were used as election literature in 1977 saying, &ldquo;After 1 August no road tax&rdquo;.  I have no doubt that in the barns and out-houses <Col N="761" /> of rural Ireland there are still clapped out Cortinas and Escorts, with chickens roosting in the dashboard and mushrooms growing in the clutch, and on the windscreens of the cars those discs may still be seen.  May we take it that those promises will not now be kept? These were the years of the philosophers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of excise duty increases imposed by the Imposition of Duties (No. 259) (Excise Duties) Order, 1982 and the Imposition of Duties (No. 260) (Excise Duty on Video Players) Order, 1982, copies of which orders were laid before Dáil Éireann on 12 March, 1982.</P>
      <P>The effect of these Imposition of Duties Orders is to increase the tax element in certain goods liable to excise duty with effect from 13 March.</P>
      <P>The list of tax increases, including VAT at 15 per cent where appropriate, is as follows:</P>
      <P>4p per pint of beer;</P>
      <P>6p per glass of spirits, or 3p on the normal half-glass measure;</P>
      <P>30p per bottle of table wine, with <i>pro rata</i> increases for stronger wines;</P>
      <P>6p per gallon excise on cider and perry, with <i>pro rata</i> increases for stronger cider and perry;</P>
      <P>10p per packet of 20 cigarettes in the most popular price category, with <i>pro rata</i> increases for cigars and tobacco;</P>
      <P>excise duty increased from 50 per cent to 60 per cent for cars over 16 hp;</P>
      <P>£17 excise duty on large colour television sets, <i>pro rata</i> increase for other sets;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> the full rate of duty on gaming machines increased to £150 per machine, with the weekend rate increased to £100 per machine;</P>
    <P>the rate of duty for special exemption orders, club extensions etc. was increased to £50 for orders issued in respect of functions on or after 1 July 1982;</P>
    <P>a new excise duty of £20 per player was introduced on video players.</P>
    <P>These tax changes formed part of the budget proposals which were put forward during the election campaign.  In the interest of minimising the revenue lost by the delay in implementing the budget, the Government, on taking office, decided that these changes should be brought into effect as soon as possible, rather than waiting until today.  The extra tax yield in 1982 resulting from this course of action is estimated at about £2½ million.</P>
    <P>The taxes were imposed by means of orders under the Imposition of Duties Act.  This Act was passed unanimously by this House in 1957 and it gave clear powers to the Government to act in this way, subject to confirmation of the changes in legislation by the end of the following year.  In fact, we propose to include the excise duty changes in the forthcoming Finance Bill rather than wait for the period which the Act allows.</P>
    <P>The Imposition of Duties Act does not provide for a debate in the House for orders of this type.  However, since increases of this nature would normally come before the House on budget day by way of financial resolutions, the Government considered it desirable that the House should be given the opportunity to debate the increases today.</P>
    <P>I might contrast the procedure which we have followed with that followed by the Coalition Government in December 1974, when they used the provisions of this Act to increase petrol prices by 30 per cent, involving an increase of almost two-thirds in the tax content of a gallon of petrol.  This increase, you will note, was far greater than any of the measures included in our orders.  Yet the Government <Col N="765" /> at that time did not offer a debate and a vote on the measure in this House at all.  A statement was made to the House by the then Minister for Finance and no debate was allowed.  It was only when we put down a motion demanding the withdrawal of the increases that time for a debate was given.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to dwell on the reasons for these tax increases.  There is agreement on both sides of the House that the level of Government borrowing must be reduced and it is appropriate in these circumstances that less essential expenditures such as alcoholic drinks, tobacco, televisions and videos should be asked to make a greater contribution.  I am aware of the difficulties being faced at present by the drinks industry in particular. The level of tax increase imposed in this area was kept to the minimum for this reason.  I will be glad to give the House any further information sought on the increases and to reply to any points raised in the debate.</P>

      <P>The excise duty increases being proposed appear to be those that are necessary in order to achieve the budgetary objectives which we set out in January and which the Minister claims now he shares.  In fact, he has made that claim since January.  However, the increases proposed in the excise duty on beer, spirits and cigarettes are considerably greater in this proposal than those proposed in January.  Last January we proposed an increase of 2p on the pint of beer but this evening the Minister is proposing an increase of 4p.  The Minister has said that the proposed increases are necessary in order to achieve the objectives of the budget.  He also said that the increase proposed is being kept to the minimum possible that is consistent with that.  I should like to remind the Minister that on 27 January he voted against an increase of 2p on the pint of beer.  He did so in company with other Fianna Fáil Members and a number of others.  This evening I want Deputies on the Government side, and other members on this side, to bear this in mind.  I also want the general public to bear that in mind.</P>

      <P>Today it is proposed to replace the proposed increase of 2p on beer by an increase of 4p, replace the 4p on the glass of spirits by 6p and replace the 8p by 10p on cigarettes.  Those increases come within the category of what was described by the Minister and his colleagues on 27 January, and since, as being increases beyond what could be borne by the ordinary person, the man in the street, the man who wanted his pint in the evening, one of the few pleasures in life that he could still afford.  Deputies on the Government side spent a great deal of time in January castigating us for the other measure we took to alleviate the rate of duty on beer, spirits and cigarettes among other things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The kind of excercise we are withnessing now shows the fallacy of the position adopted by Fianna Fáil on 27 January and since.  It is clear that the position they took up on 27 January and since is one which they have gradually had to change.  It was said on 28 January that we did not need to achieve the kind of targets which the Minister has patted himself on the back for including in his budget.  Earlier he prided himself on the claim that he would turn out with a current <Col N="767" /> budget deficit less than the one we proposed in our January budget.  He said he considered it a matter of some importance that he should do that.  I am not convinced by his argument because his provision for tax buoyancy outlined to us this afternoon is greater than the difference between the £715 million current deficit we proposed in January and the deficit he has said he would come out with at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The fact is that we can now see how little foundation there was for what the Minister and his colleagues said on 27 January.  They rapidly came to accept the basic aim of what we were proposing. They also had to accept that what we had been doing since last July was the kind of course that was necessary to achieve the objective the Minister has put before us today as the one which should properly be achieved by our budget strategy.  I am anxious to make sure that all Members, and the general public, know that instead of voting against a 2p excise duty increase in January as they did they are now asking us to accept an increase of double that amount.  The Minister is not doing that simply because he thinks he took the wrong course on 27 January.  It is because he, and his colleagues, have now come to accept that the course we laid out since last July is the one they are forced to accept.</P>

      <P>Including myself.  I do not think the Deputy was so glad to have left Finance.  Our brewing industry in the Ceann Comhairle's own constituency is in very serious trouble.  The work force there has already been halved and it will be more than halved again.  There are about 2,500 there and half of those have been told they will be going in another development plan because of the penal taxation that is inhibiting sales both in this country and abroad.  The situation is so serious that the likelihood is that our brewing industry will lose the very substantial export market it enjoys especially in the UK.  I am absolutely amazed that this Government, that so hypocritically repeated its dedication to full employment and to reducing unemployment, by their very first action make it more likely that even more jobs will be lost in the brewing industry.  Has the Minister given this matter the slightest consideration? Has he considered what sort of redundancy he is creating in the brewing industry, what share of the export market we shall lose because of the problems created in that industry?  I think that not the slightest consideration has been given to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why the previous budget which was defeated had a proposal for a much lower rate of increase in excise duty.  It <Col N="769" /> was that particular proposal that was defeated and precipitated the general election which brought this Government into power.  As Deputy Dukes said, they are back here doubling it or trebling it because the total effect of all this will be to increase the price of the pint by 10½p in the pubs.  The Minister, Deputy MacSharry, has introduced the punt pint and will lose hundreds and hundreds of jobs and he will add to our balance of payment difficulties.</P>
    <P>I want to address my remarks to some of the people in the opposite benches. They are the people who brought down the Government on this very issue only six weeks ago.  The voted against a lower rate.</P>

We know for months back that in Guinness's Brewery in Dublin &mdash; in which I must declare my interest because I have a long connection with that company &mdash; 1,200 jobs are threatened already.

I cannot help but say, even at this late hour, that one of the reasons we are on the third budget in eight months and the prime reason as to why this House and this country are in their present state is because of the previous record of the last speaker.  For a man to come in here and seek to justify the additional increases placed now on beer and cigarettes over and above what he and his colleagues voted against on 27 January is just preposterous. For a man to come in here and say that there are so many hospital beds to be closed, so many hospital units which cannot be opened, so many different aspects of the Department for Health and the Department of Social Welfare underfinanced is totally to misrepresent the situation.</P>

      <P>The measures which were necessary last July in the supplementary budget, and again in the proposed budget at the beginning of this year were, in such large measure, occasioned by the perambulations of the Minister for Health and Social Welfare around the country, spending, promising, committing funds over and above his committed Book of Estimates to the extent that more than £70 million over and above that provided for his Department last year had been spent by the middle of July last.  All of that £70 million was spent and committed, not on the basis of moneys voted by this House, not on the basis of moneys provided for in the Book of Estimates provided for his Department, but on the basis of his individual promises made during his election forays throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now late at night and I have been here for some hours.  The debate up to that point had been conducted with some modicum of responsibility and people attempted to address themselves to the resolutions before the House.  This is the man who during his previous tenure there was so largely the author of the problems now in the Custom House &mdash; or indeed, more especially during whichever occasions he got himself released from the Custom House to go on his irresponsible spending sprees throughout the country, committing money left, right and centre which was not provided for either by <Col N="778" /> vote of this House or in the Book of Estimates.</P>

It is totally unacceptable that, of all of the previous office holders, this man, above all others, should come in here in this sanctimonious way and attempt to justify his reason for voting for increases in the cost of the pint of beer, double what he voted against six weeks ago.</P>

Before the last budget I was inundated with deputations from publicans in Border areas pointing out to me in the aftermath of Christmas that many public houses had not sold a bottle of whiskey as is traditional for Christmas presents, because they were buying it north of the Border where it is cheaper.  They were imploring me to point this out to Deputy Bruton, the then <Col N="779" /> Minister for Finance, because we are losing trade, not only from people from Northern Ireland who no longer come across on a Sunday evening but people from the Republic are now going to Northern Ireland to buy drink.  Even by paying duty, it is still cheaper to buy spirits and beer in Northern Ireland. Deputy MacSharry should have some knowledge of this.  Publicans in Border areas may put up the shutters and close down.</P>
      <P>When I rose to say these things, Deputy Woods also got to his feet but a moment earlier than I had and the Ceann Comhairle had called on me, I gave way to Deputy Woods and I am sure he will confirm that that is what happened.  I have not told a lie, I have put on record exactly what happened&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are very few people in your party to whom I would pay compliment. You are one of the gentlemen of the party.  There are a few more but they are hard to find.  On the evening of the last budget a visitor to the House, an Irish born person but living abroad, could not understand how there could be a General Election on the result of a vote on beer and spirits, particularly when the Government that were proposing these items in that budget had attempted to redistribute wealth in a manner in which it had never been done before.  No other Government had tried to redistribute wealth in the manner in which Deputy Bruton as Minister for Finance, Deputy FitzGerald, as Taoiseach, and Deputy O'Leary, as Tánaiste had tried to guide the former administration.</P>

      <P>I know people who whistle going past graveyards too.  The only difference is that they whistle and members of Fianna Fáil laugh.  Hyenas also laugh, although they do not know why.  In the redistribution of wealth as proposed in the January budget which was brought down on this very issue, there was an increase on beer and spirits.  In that budget the poorer sections of our community were being catered for and it is utter hypocrisy for Deputy Woods to say the money is needed to restore those services when he voted against the measure that was to continue those services in January.  There is no consistency in what he said and I think the House should take note of that.</P>
      <P>My point is that in the few weeks leading up to the previous budget, people came to me in groups and as individuals, representing the vintners of Donegal and Monaghan, asking me to petition the Minister for Finance to take into consideration the price at which drink was being charged for already.  That was only a couple of weeks after Christmas and they were able to tell from their Christmas takings that the cost of beer and spirits in the Republic of Ireland was far in excess of the cost in Northern Ireland.  Not only had the people of Northern Ireland ceased to come across to buy here but our people were going over there. Deputy Wilson knows that, and Deputy Lenihan knows it.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has told us <Col N="782" /> that Northern Ireland was not an issue in the general election.  He has made it an issue since the election.  I live along the Border.  I have made my contribution to efforts to bring both sides together but I did so in the realisation that you cannot talk about Irish unity and at the same time put divisions between the Irish people, whether they are political, economic or social.  That is what Fianna Fáil have been doing since the foundation of the State.  They have set up economic, political, social and other divisions, even a monetary division when they broke with sterling.</P>

      <P>The motion is about increases in the prices of beer and spirits and I have been pointing out that Partition is not just a line on the map.  It is a thing that separates people, whether economically, culturally, politically or socially.  That party over there, of which a decent man like you has the bad luck to be a member, have pursued policies since 1932 which were not consistent with their supposed desire for national unity. Indeed they have done more against unity than the most bigoted Orangeman in the North of Ireland.  That is something-they cannot run away from.  Any of them who do not know that should pay a visit there and find out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have thrown away their right to talk about Irish unity.  Everything they have done and are doing is divisive. They cannot even take into consideration the possibility of maintaining some kind of uniformity of price levels in regard to beer and spirits.  Before we entered Europe we were told all about the importance of such membership.  We were told that the economies of all EEC nations would be harmonised, that the German mark could buy goods in France, that the <Col N="783" /> French franc could buy the same amount in Germany, and so on.  They were the dreams, but we never got that far.  If we are serious about bringing both parts of the island together then we should be trying to get harmonisation instead of division and inequality.  I protest because a party which cry from the rooftop about unity, do so from the pinnacle of hypocrisy. They have not made a single contribution towards achieving unity, apart from glossy well-phrased remarks addressed to the press of the world in posh hotels in London, Washington and New York.  They ignored the fact that &mdash;and I am talking now about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No.  I will when I have concluded.  I will not be too long.  I hope the Taoiseach is listening to me when I say that if we are serious about healing the divisions between North and South we must first of all try to harmonise the economies of both parts of Ireland.  We must foster reasonable levels of tolerance. There must be some similarity between the prices of commodities on both sides of the Border.  Otherwise the divisions will be maintained, and divisions mean partition.  Our purpose in going into the EEC was to enjoy the benefits of harmonisation.  Instead, the Irish pound is useless to buy goods in six Irish counties.  That is because Fianna Fáil have been in power for the greater part of 40 years.  Their hypocritical essays <Col N="784" /> on unity have been with the purpose of keeping Fianna Fáil in power, just like the Taoiseach's remarks last week in the US.</P>

I have already said to you that your interpretation of Standing Orders is much more pure than the Ceann Comhairle's, who ruled quite differently when Deputy Woods was speaking.  However, I will abide by your ruling, but would point out that there is great inconsistency between the ways you are ruling now and what the Ceann Comhairle ruled.  I do not know what the explanation is, but that is for the record. I just want to say what brought me to my feet.  I did not intend to speak for so long. I want to appeal to the Government, on behalf of the publicans and the people they employ in Border areas, to reconsider the prices they are putting on beer and spirits.  They were bad in the January budget, but before that budget I put a petition before the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, asking him to take these difficulties into consideration. Those difficulties have been exacerbated by the further increases which were not voted here tonight but announced by the Taoiseach a fortnight ago, two days after he became Taoiseach, and the Minister for Finance did not even know about it until the following morning.  It is a deplorable situation that a Government party which when in Opposition voted against this resolution should now do this.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 23 February 1981 but was not qualified for payment as, according to the records of my Department, he had not the required minimum of 26 paid contributions to his credit since his entry into insurable employment.  He was, however, paid benefit provisionally up to 16 March 1981 pending investigation of his record of insurable <Col N="576" /> employment.  It was subsequently established that he had in fact sufficient weeks of insurable employment in 1978 to qualify for benefit.  The balance of disability benefit due from 17 March to 21 April 1981, after which date he was certified as fit to resume work, has now been paid. The claimant is not entitled to pay-related benefit on the claim as he was unemployed in the relevant tax year, and accordingly had no reckonable earnings in that year.</P>

      <P>I understand that application was duly made to the employer and that a refund of the sum of £28.04 is to be made shortly.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed maternity benefit in respect of a confinement on 15 March 1982.  As, however, <Col N="583" /> she had less then 26 contributions in the 1980-81 governing contribution year she did not satisfy the contribution conditions for receipt of the benefit under the general maternity allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>Following inquiries it has been established that the claimant is qualified under the maternity scheme for women in employment by reason of the contributions to her credit in the 12 months immediately preceding her maternity leave.  All benefit due from 4 January 1982 to 27 March 1982 has now been paid.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit from 13 June 1981.  Pending inquiries as to the nature and origin of the incapacity disability benefit was paid as an interim measure. All benefit due to 8 August 1981 after which date he was certified fit to resume work has been paid.</P>
      <P>On completion of the inquiries regarding the occupational injury it has been accepted that the incapacity was due to an accident at work and payment of injury benefit has been authorised.  An adjusting payment representing the difference between the amount of injury benefit due and the amount of disability benefit already paid has now been issued.</P>

      <P>The provision for such quarters in the Defence Estimate for 1982 is £0.575 million. It is proposed to use this sum to meet the cost of completing twelve new quarters at Cathal Brugha Barracks. Dublin, as well as the cost of the planning <Col N="584" /> and initial development of new quarters at that barracks, the Curragh Camp and Collins Barracks, Cork.  The provision includes sums retained against satisfactory completion of the new houses at Kildare (14) and Galway (20).</P>
      <P>The scheme being planned for the Curragh Camp will comprise 37 houses.  The number of quarters to be erected at Cathal Brugha Barracks, Dublin, and Collins Barracks, Cork, has yet to be determined.</P>
