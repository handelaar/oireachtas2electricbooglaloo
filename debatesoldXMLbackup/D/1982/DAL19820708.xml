      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he has any news about the reopening of Clondalkin Paper Mills?  He gave an undertaking to the deputation he received about three weeks ago that he would examine the situation to see if legislation was required.  Could he now inform the House if he has any information on that and, if legislation is required, when it will be coming before the House?</P>

      <P>In view of the historically high unemployment figures, could the Taoiseach say when the new economic plan will be unveiled?  The Minister for Labour in Belfast was talking <Col N="1590" /> about it two days ago.  In view of the very high unemployment figures which are affecting east as well as west, including Galway East, could the Taoiseach say when we may expect this plan?</P>

This Bill is due to be taken in two hours next Thursday and it has not yet been circulated.  May I ask the Taoiseach whether we could have this Bill today so that we can study it properly?  I am greatly concerned that we will rush the Bill through at the close of business next week without giving it proper consideration.</P>

      <P>As the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health will appreciate, there will be certain constraints on us all over the weekend in another part of the country.  Would it be possible for a draft <Col N="1591" /> of this Bill to be made available today on request?  Presumably, if it is to be circulated and printed over the weekend, the draft has now been settled and approved by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The people on the other side of the house have developed a custom of accusing the Government of doing their business in an irregular fashion. I suggest that Deputy O'Keeffe accepts the answers we have already given him about this legislation.  We have indicated to him that it will be available before the end of this week.  That is the position.  It is a very simple Bill, consisting of one or two sections, and I do not think the Deputy, as I explained yesterday, need be too worried about it.</P>

    <Title>Trade Disputes (Amendment) Bill, 1982: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with the opportunity to introduce this morning the Trade Disputes (Amendment) Bill, 1982. This Bill has for long been the subject of quite an amount of controversy and commitments made by successive Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is frequently asserted that the law plays a relatively minor role in our system of collective bargaining.  In other words, voluntary processes comprise the primary means for regulating relations between workers and employers.  While direct legal measures may play a less central role here than in some other countries, this is not to say that the importance of the legal framework governing industrial relations should be underestimated. Industrial relations, no less than any other area of social or economic life, are <Col N="1595" /> underpinned in the final analysis by a well-defined system of law.</P>
    <P>At first sight, many features of this system may seem puzzling and somewhat far-removed from the accepted realities of industrial relations.  Thus, under our system of common law, much of the type of activities which we would recognise as legitimate when carried out by trade unions would not necessarily be lawful if carried out by other organisations.  The explanation for this state of affairs must be traced back to the 19th century and to the protracted conflict which arose then between the key common law doctrine of restraint of trade and the basic purpose and practices of trade unionism.</P>
    <P>The answer to this conflict adopted was the evolution of a system of legal immunities. These immunities did not repeal the criminal offences and civil wrongs in question but rather removed legal liability for them which was incurred &ldquo;in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute&rdquo;. This was achieved gradually with the enactment of a series of statutes, commencing with the Trade Union Act, 1871, and culminating, for all intents and purposes, with the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, the one to which we are introducing an amendment this morning.</P>
    <P>The 1906 Act conferred immunity from liability for civil conspiracy, inducement of a breach of contract and interference with trade or employment.  It provided that peaceful picketing would be fully lawful and granted a general immunity to trade unions from actions in tort.  In its five short sections, the Act thus largely completed the emancipation of trade unionism from the legal constraints which had previously bound it.  It remains the most important statute governing trade disputes having since been modified only by the Trade Union Act, 1941.  This latter Act provided that, with certain limited exceptions, trade unions carrying on negotiations for the fixing of terms and conditions of employment were required to hold a negotiation licence.  A corollary of this was that the principal protections bestowed by the 1906 Act would henceforth apply only to unions holding such a licence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> The immunities conferred by the 1906 Act now apply therefore to acts by members and officials of licensed trade unions which are undertaken &ldquo;in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute&rdquo;.  The Act defines a trade dispute as &ldquo;any dispute between employers and workmen, or between workmen and workmen, which is connected with the employment or non-employment or the terms of the employment or with the conditions of labour, of any person&rdquo;.  The term &ldquo;workmen&rdquo; is further defined as &ldquo;all persons employed in trade or industry, whether or not in the employment of the employer with whom a trade dispute arises&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to remedy problems which have arisen in this latter definition.  Successive judicial decisions have held that the phrase &ldquo;trade or industry&rdquo; is subject to a strict construction.  It has been interpreted accordingly to cover only enterprises of a specifically commercial character.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;workmen&rdquo; affects the definition of &ldquo;trade dispute&rdquo; which in turn determines the application of legal immunities.  The result has been that over 200,000 workers, mainly but not exclusively in public employment, have found themselves excluded from the protections conferred by the 1906 Act.  This has not been altered by the fact that some of these workers were members of licensed trade unions.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the 1906 Act which is proposed in the Bill to rectify this situation is short and simple.  It consists of the deletion of the words &ldquo;in trade or industry&rdquo; from the existing definition in subsection (3) of section 5 of the Act.  For the purposes of the Act, workmen will in future comprise &ldquo;all persons employed&rdquo;. I am confident that this will remove all of the difficulties which have arisen in regard to the scope of the definition.  We are eliminating the words which caused the judicial decisions to which I referred and which created distinctions between certain categories of workers.</P>
    <P>The immunities afforded by the Act will of course continue to apply only to licensed trade unions.  This has been the case for some 40 years and, to the best of my knowledge, there is little or no desire <Col N="1597" /> to see it changed now.  Public service unions which are not currently in possession of a negotiation licence but wish to avail of the legal protections provided for in this Bill will thus have to obtain such a licence.  Several of these unions are in fact in the process of taking this step at present.</P>
    <P>The Bill further provides for the specific exclusion of members of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána from the protections granted by the 1906 Act. Such a provision was not required before as both groups were affected by the restricted interpretation of &ldquo;workmen&rdquo;. Other statutes dealing with the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána place more general prohibitions on trade union activity among their ranks.  Deputies will appreciate that the requirements of service in both forces are such that the provision of immunity for industrial action would be wholly inappropriate.</P>
    <P>The Government have taken the decision to introduce this Bill because we accept that the existing legal position has lent itself to an inappropriate form of discrimination.  While some limitation may be necessary on the exercise of the freedom to engage in industrial action, a situation where up to one-third of all employees are deprived of legal protections in all circumstances is scarcely justifiable. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have been campaigning for this legislation for many years and have been given undertakings in the matter by various Governments, including the previous Government of which I was a member. The document prepared by the last Coalition Government, known as the Gaiety Theatre document, also carried a commitment to amend the 1906 Act.  A resolution adopted at the ICTU annual conference in 1979 made the absence of this legislation the reason for their regrettable withdrawal from the Commission on Industrial Relations.  I was disappointed with that decision and the commitment in the national understanding of that year was to participate to the full in the workings of that commission. My Government have decided that the time has come to remove a grievance which has become a serious irritant to the <Col N="1598" /> trade union movement and which endangers any prospect of progress in improving our not very admirable industrial relations record.</P>
    <P>I have always believed that consultation and co-operation between the trade union movement and employers is essential for good industrial relations and for economic and social progress.  This is probably more important during periods of recession than during periods of buoyancy and I will continue to promote it.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that the essential nature of the services provided by some undertakings calls for the acceptance of some limitation on the freedom to resort to industrial action.  However, the existing restrictions do not really reflect such a concern.  The distinction between employees engaged in trade or industry and employees not so engaged is by no means equivalent to the distinction between employees engaged in the provision of essential services and employees not so engaged.</P>
    <P>There will be some found to say that this country suffers from too great a willingness to resort to industrial action on the part of its workforce and should not seek to exacerbate matters by extending the scope of existing legal protections. While I might concur with the first half of this statement, I cannot support the conclusion which is drawn from it.  We would all like to see a more restrained use of the strike weapon and to have industrial action accepted as a course of last &mdash; and not first &mdash; resort.  This applies particularly to unofficial disputes which account generally for over half of all disputes and which must be condemned for the effect which they have on the economy, on the community and on the trade union movement itself.  However, I am satisfied that enactment of this Bill should not, in practice, result in any escalation in industrial action in this country.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be able to say that, in response to the introduction of this legislation, congress have agreed to enter as soon as possible into discussions designed to find ways and means of remedying deficiencies, including those identified by <Col N="1599" /> the Commission of Inquiry on Industrial Relations, in our industrial relations.</P>
    <P>While the initial response of the Federated Union of Employers to the proposed discussions has been less encouraging, I would hope that they would reconsider their decision and that they avail of the valuable opportunity to influence policy decisions which could affect the shape of our industrial relations and our economic well-being and growth for many years to come.  It is hardly necessary for me to underline the fact that in our country free collective bargaining predominates.  I support free collective bargaining.  Against that background, prior discussions with both sides are essential to enable progress to be made on fundamental industrial relations reforms.</P>
    <P>I expect both sides to meet me in serious discussions directed towards enabling procedures to be improved to establish a better industrial relations climate.  The responsibility rests on both sides, as well as on the Minister of the day, and I will devote my time and energy to endeavouring to make those discussions produce a package worthy of both sides of industry and of the traditions of free collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>The FUE want the Government to indicate their views on the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry on Industrial Relations before they take part in discussions.  It is my intention that the commission's recommendations should be fully explored in the discussions.  I would emphasise that the way forward in this difficult area can only be found through full and frank discussions between the three parties mainly involved with the object of achieving a high degree of consensus on action to be taken.  If any one of the three parties hangs back or adopts a negative attitude the chances of progress will be greatly diminished.  I intend to devote much of my time in the near future to these discussions and to the search for effective results.  I earnestly hope that the full co-operation of employers and trade unions will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to deal with a number of issues in the industrial relations area and specifically to underline our support of the measure introduced.  The principal disappointment with the proposal is that it is not part of a more comprehensive package. Perhaps that is for another day and if so I hope it will not be too long in coming.</P>
      <P>The Bill itself, frankly, is not a very significant measure, although it has caused significant concern and anxiety to a number of trade unions and others, and financial embarrassment to more then one union.  The need for it arises because of the interpretation given by the Irish courts to a definition which did not cause similar difficulty in the courts of Britain.  I have no doubt whatever but that when the Act was initially framed the intention was to give it the meaning now being given to the Act by this Bill. The debate would have been more helpful had it dealt with a wider range of fundamental issues, and one could say that our discussion is a missed opportunity to deal with fundamental issues in a vital area of social and economic inter-action. That we are dealing with this Bill at all speaks volumes for the inability of our Parliament to respond effectively and efficiently to the issues of the day.  It is clear that we should be discussing a more comprehensive measure setting out guidelines towards helping the development of a sane and ordered industrial relations code of practice.  That is clearly what is needed.  I concur with the Minister and, in a sense, the more law deemed to be necessary in this area, the more we are failing.  It is inconceivable that we should order industrial relations by some vast complex of legislation herding hundreds of thousands of workers in one direction or another.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill itself has had a very long and <Col N="1601" /> tortuous history.  It is astonishing that such a slight measure &mdash; merely the clearing up of problems associated with a definition &mdash; problems created in good faith in the Irish courts &mdash; has taken so long. One wonders whether some of the mechanisms outside Parliament altogether, but perhaps accountable to it, should be sought for this type of technical problem which has little to do with the spirit or intention of the legislation but is about the peripheral aspect of essential definitions. That is not to underestimate the anxiety which this measure has caused &mdash; the irritant, as the Minister described it, which it has been to trade unions over the years.  I stress that if we can stand back from it for a moment we will see that the fact that we are dealing with this measure this morning &mdash; an amendment to a 1906 Act decades overdue &mdash; is symptomatic of the weaknesses of our present parliamentary system.  Perhaps we can discuss that on another occasion.  We appear to be imprisoned in some kind of ante-room, out of the main stream of current events and rooted in the past.  It would be nice to discuss, even once, a Bill about shaping tomorrow which was not just a reaction to some event in the past either inside or outside the courts.  It is a long time since we have done that.</P>
    <P>The Trade Disputes Act of 1906 was passed through the British Parliament by a newly elected Liberal Government, following a very turbulent period of trade union activity and was allegedly, a response to the Taff Vale case which arose from a dispute with the Taff Vale Railway and the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants.  To underline the fact that this Bill should not have been necessary and that a reasonable interpretation of the Bill would have ended with the conclusion which we are to enforce in law today, Professor K. W. Wedderburn who was an understanding academic and expert on labour law, has stated that such was the shock of the Taff Vale case that the unions and their friends would be satisfied with nothing less than a statutory declaration that no action should ever be allowed against a trade union and its funds in respect of any act alleged to have <Col N="1602" /> been committed by or on behalf of the trade union.</P>
    <P>We should stress, for those who might be a little anxious about the effects of this legislation &mdash; and I have heard some concern expressed by employers who have difficulties in certain other areas &mdash; that all this Act does is try to introduce some degree of equality of treatment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of workers, regardless of their category of employment.  It, therefore, establishes no more, in truth, than the principle of equal civil rights.  It is quite unthinkable that the old concept of the master and the servant should prevail and an outdated definition of a workman as being somebody who works manually while the professional classes are in a different category is surely something that we should have dispensed with long ago.  Apparently we have not done so and the Bill before us is therefore, necessary.</P>
      <P>This immunity sought by Professor Wedderburn was granted in section 4 (1) of the 1906 Act.  The definition in the British courts of the problematic phrase did not cause a problem.  The Irish courts have defined the Act in a very narrow and discriminatory manner and quite differently from the English courts.  By their so doing, many Irish unions have been deprived of the legislation protection which the 1906 Act was designed to grant them.  It is arguable to what extent this has had a detrimental effect on their ability to work for and on behalf of their members.  It certainly has not helped them and in a number of cases has caused extensive financial loss.</P>
      <P>The Irish courts held, now hold and presumably will hold until this Bill is law, that the phrase &ldquo;trade and industry&rdquo; excludes workers in services and nonprofit making trades, for example, dock workers in a non-commercial public port authority, as in the B &amp; I Steampacket, Limited versus Branigan 1956 case, or barmen in a Dublin workingman's club as, for example, the Smith v Beirne 1955 case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in Britain the commonsense definition of trade and <Col N="1603" /> industry concluded that trade is not only in the dictionary sense but in the legal usage a term of the widest scope, that it was connected originally with the word &ldquo;tread&rdquo;, an old English expression, and indicates a way of life or an occupation. In ordinary usage, it may mean the occupation of a small shopkeeper equally with that of a commercial magnate.  It may also mean a skilled craft.  A professional worker would not ordinarily be called a tradesman, but the word trade is used in the widest application in the appellation of trade unions.  Professions, for example, have their trade unions.</P>
    <P>It is a little extraordinary that we should have to worry about this matter at this time.  It has been embarrassing not just to the trade unions but to the country. This question has been raised in international labour fora and concluded upon in a manner detrimental to our country's image.  In 1979 ILO Conference Report, for example, indicates that the Irish Government are held to be in breach of ILO Convention No. 87.  On a number of occasions this type of allegation has been made by international bodies concerned with labour matters, and made with foundation.  It is regrettable that the many and successive attempts to have this Act amended were not more expeditiously dealt with and were not successful &mdash; and I include in that those of all Governments.  There were a number of attempts.  In 1966, a joint working party on industrial relations and trade union law was established, with representatives from Congress and the Department of Labour.  The text of a trade union Bill in 1960 was introduced, but lapsed at the time with the dissolution of the Dáil. Another effort was made in July 1975 and, again, in May 1977 it was the subject of discussion between the Minister for Congress and so on.  It has a very unusual history, in a sense, for a measure so slight.  Suffice it to say that there is a strong argument for this law being amended.</P>
    <P>If a conclusion is to be arrived at about how tortuous the process has been I would ask whether there is a better way of dealing with questions of a technical or <Col N="1604" /> definition nature rather than occupying the time of the national Parliament, not because the time is not available but because of the linear process of Parliament it is impossible to deal with matters when they should be dealt with.  Day after day we deal with issues which are years too late.  It would not matter very much if we had a committee of the House sitting with commonsense understanding and clear parameters and dealing with the area of the definition of Bills such as this one.  It could make simple recommendations and put them before the Dáil as a matter of form.  We might get our business done more promptly.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with some aspects of the legislation which are the heart of industrial relations.  The Minister in his speech acknowledged that it is frequently asserted that the law plays a relatively minor role in our system of collective bargaining.  I subscribe to the view that in this area the less law the better, if there is some other way of ordering industrial relations and labour law affairs.  We have attempted in a number of instances to enforce legislation and have failed miserably. If there is widespread support for a cause it is reasonable to assume that there is justice in that cause.  If there is justice in it, the expediency of trying to enforce an unenforceable law against groups of workers is ineffective and brings the whole labour law process into disrepute. The more we try to bind large numbers of people by statute the more we misread the essential challenge of industrial relations and misunderstand its very nature.</P>
    <P>I was struck by comments made by Professor Raymond G. Maguire of UCD in a address to the Irish regional conference at the Institute of Personnel Management in Galway recently.  The professor is an expert in this field and he reiterated that legal changes in this field will not change industrial relations.  He said:</P>
    <P>Despite the recent and occasionally clamorous demands for a basic reform of the laws regulating labour/management relations in Ireland, it is unlikely that far reaching changes in the present legislative <Col N="1605" /> scheme of labour law will be attempted during the present decade and, if attempted, it is doubtful they will prove effective.</P>
    <P>I believe he is correct.  These demands are usually quite strident and if the Minister listened to them this Bill would have included measures which would have been orchestrated by strong groups in our society with the primary concern of extracting the maximum from groups of workers without necessarily paying them the full respect to which they are entitled. Any Government should be wary of introducing legislation in this area unless it is clear that the legislation will be effective. Any such clarity should be arrived at only after consultation with all sides.</P>
    <P>The reason why industrial relations is not ideally suited to mass management by law is because we deal with the symptom rather than the cause.  We are trying to order the affairs of unions and workers and in a sense this Bill is about that.  It is really dealing with a symptom of a more fundamental problem.  It is natural for man to work.  Our society by failing to give work with dignity and meaning is undermining that.</P>
    <P>Although the economic and social crisis and international recession in which we find ourselves may confront us with enormous challenges, it also presents an opportunity to us.  We can break away more easily from old modes and introduce measures which can help us.  The resolving effect of crisis which to some extent sunders culture allows us to tackle the real problem more easily.  It encourages people to face up to the challenge of the moment rather than having a society which is extremely conservative.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity to deal with industrial relations and labour law.  I concur with the Minister in appealing to all those engaged in this area to come to the table and be involved in discussions even if some of the parties involved are unhappy about the response they got prior to this regarding measures they may have proposed to the Minister.  There is no room in this area for opting out.  If a Minister seeks the help of unions, employers and workers he is entitled to <Col N="1606" /> have that participation and respect.  The initial, understandable perhaps, anxiety or pique which caused people to draw back from the process of consultation should be reviewed and a more considered and constructive response in line with the tradition of the various bodies in this area should be forthcoming.  The job is to get down to creating the best structures, law and society.  If anyone opts out of that we will all suffer.</P>
    <P>We need real leadership and imagination in this area.  I appeal to anyone engaged in industrial relations &mdash; unions and employers &mdash; to give of their best, become involved and accept the Minister's invitation to discussion.  The anxiety expressed by the employer representatives bodies is a measure of frustration not at this Bill or any specific measure but at a growing feeling that there is a drift in this area.  The generating pattern of evidence in relation to labour law stability and industrial relations stability is something about which we should be concerned.  There is evidence to show that.  The statistical evidence in relation to the number of strikes and man days lost is not encouraging.  Relative to our European partners with whom we must do business, it should be remembered that if we do not get our house in order the Irish worker will be the victim.  When I talk about a house in order I am not talking about restrictions on trade unions or about the workers only wearing the cap.  I maintain that there is a very strong responsibility on people in industry and commerce to give leadership based on sound principles far more comprehensive than the principle of returning the most favourable balance sheet which, unfortunately, is very often the primary or even exclusive concern of some of these parties.  It is clear to me that a comprehensive industrial relations framework of policy is necessary.  Its greatest strength will lie in the moral approval of large masses of people outside and it will probably be most effective if it is not enforced by legislation.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the mechanisms &mdash; the Labour Court, the commission, the conciliatory machinery &mdash; all of these mechanisms for trying to order industrial <Col N="1607" /> relations, are rarely if ever subject to review, that they are in many cases understaffed, that they have no framework within which to act, that they act on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis; that there is no regular and constant review or monitoring of their operations with a view to bringing about improvements.  It seems to me, therefore, that if we are serious about encouraging an environment in which people will give of their very best, we should have the machinery to do that and that machinery should be primarily aimed at preventive action.  The overwhelming burden on our industrial relations machinery is in trying to dissipate strike action already taken, trying to arbitrate in disputes, rather than getting involved in the preemptive area of trying to ensure that disputes do not occur initially or are tackled at a very early stage. Interestingly enough, the very important principle of justice and equity is often damaged by precisely this mechanism, because an attempt to settle a dispute in, for example, the Labour Court, may often be directed towards achieving a settlement which settlement can be very different indeed from what is just and right.  A settlement can be based on expediency, on superior strength on one side or the other, can be based on a situation where workers simply cannot sustain action financially because they are not getting paid, although they may have a just cause.  The primary concern should be to resolve disputes before they become critical and cause great damage to the economy.</P>
    <P>In that area of activity there is a lot of danger and some cause for dissatisfaction because we are not dealing with what we should be dealing with, that is, the problem of getting involved early and creating a climate where strikes do not arise, where there is spontaneous machinery which allows for a level-headed, rational resolution of disputes, and the key will be the integrity with which that machinery is seen by both parties.  Other countries have done this.  There is no reason why we cannot do it.  The job really is to devise a comprehensive industrial relations policy.  If we think about it, we are <Col N="1608" /> engaged this morning in tidying up a definition in a Bill which was introduced in 1906.  That is the national parliament's contribution to industrial relations legislation in this year of 1982.</P>
    <P>The areas we need to be dealing with are too great to go into but there are important aspects that we should be looking at, for instance, changing the attitudes of workers and employers; the cynicism towards the establishment, including trade unions; the growing cynicism, which to some extent we encourage and engender, towards the political system in connection with key bargains; the sacrifices involved in strike action; workers' view of management competence; the growing industrial technological revolution; union organisation, lack of managerial attention to industrial relations &mdash; in some cases it is absolutely foreign to managers to concern themselves, except in fire brigade action&mdash;the absence of employer solidarity; the multiplicity and efficiency of unions &mdash; we all agree that we have to help the unions to be better unions &mdash; the lack of machinery for dismissal.  There is a very wrongful situation in relation to approving of effort put in by workers and disapproving of the contrary and, indeed, to being able to impose sanctions on workers where appropriate.  The range of issues is daunting and a comprehensive approach is essential rather than the bitty approach we are taking this morning.</P>
    <P>In an article in <i>Administration,</i> Volume 29, No. 3, Charles McCarthy said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>If, as we believe, those engaged in industrial relations are disposed to good order, there is clearly room for extending the procedures parties should adhere to in the conduct of claims and the response to them.</P>
    <P>He goes on to express grave concern with the nature of disputes and talks about the need for new machinery for overhaul and review.  A man so eminent in this area, whose request is echoed by many of us, should be listened to.  There is cause for listening to him.  In the submission to the Commission on Industrial Relations by the Department of Industrial Relations <Col N="1609" /> in UCD you find in tables in relation to strikes, total days lost, workers involved, average days lost per worker.  It is not a particularly bad picture.  In some cases it is not as bad as it is said to be.  For example, I do not join in the extreme anxiety, almost hysteria, in relation to unofficial strikes.  Having tried to examine the situation I find that the situation in relation to unofficial strikes, while serious and something we have to examine, is not quite as grave as it might appear.  Indeed, there is a difficulty about defining what an unofficial strike is.  By and large the greater problem is in relation to the relative degeneration of the picture here compared to other countries over the last number of decades.  We are steadily getting worse relatively speaking. The number of strikes, for example, in 1970 to 1978 was a yearly average of 159 whereas two decades earlier the number was half that.  That is the kind of barometer we are talking about.  In other countries they are ordering their affairs more positively and more constructively. We must be very watchful of that and try to act in a comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>The fundamental nature of the real challenge has not been fully understood either by the Government or by many of the unions.  In some cases trade unions are still fighting battles that they won long ago.  Pay and conditions has been the primary concern and is still the primary concern of unions, and quite rightly, but I would suggest to them that in a sense some of the attitudes that some unions adopt are outdated and outmoded.  I am talking here to union leadership which I distinguish from union rank and file membership.  Let us stand back from some of the traditional developments in this area and consider some of the things that have caused concern.  For example, demarcation.  Is there anything more likely to fly in the face of personal growth and development, development of skills, for example, than the idea of demarcation? It is quite common in our society for a driver to come out with three or four workers in the back of a van.  He walks up and down all day while the three or four workers do a specific job, because of demarcation.  That is waste of manpower, <Col N="1610" /> waste of humankind.</P>
    <P>Secondly, look at the damage to the work ethic in our extremely consumer-orientated society.  The happy, successful man is the man who has to do the least work, who has the most leisure time, who drives one of those fast cars which we see on television which invariably are driven through the raging surf.  I do not know why people have to drive cars in the sea, but they do it in all the best advertisements there.  The idea of work as having dignity and being natural to man is being undermined.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, look at taxation policy which penalises work.  The longer and harder you work the more tax you pay.  I know that is because you get more income, but there should be a tapering point where one would be encouraged to work longer and harder and more productively.  Consider the recent suggestion of banning imports.  This mechanism was employed in the sixties by a previous government and helped us towards economic strength when the country was in serious difficulty, but the principles of Sinn Féin on which this country stands and to which our party subscribe are anathema to the idea of banning imports in order to protect jobs unless, as a last resort, in certain key areas.  That is the lazy man's way out. Better challenges lie in getting the best out of all of us, worker and employer.  I say to the trade unions and the employers that these are some of the areas of concern. We may be getting our priorities wrong.  The loud demands for reform as, for example, in this Bill should be accompanied by other requests and thought processes and much more fundamental questioning.  In our society to work is in many cases to be seen to be somewhat foolish if you can avoid it, and some would maintain that the harder you work the more foolish you are.  That is unfortunate, but it is clear that, at present, the country needs workers at all levels.  I am talking about people at board room level also, many of whom invest little commitment and expect the man on the shop floor to punch in and punch out like an automation.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that we still foster the <Col N="1611" /> idea that the trade unions should fight the company or the nation.  It is astonishing that the employers see themselves as being apart from those they employ when they are all in the one organisation.  They will fight them, and this process is like eating one's own entrails.  This problem has been tackled in other countries.  For example, in Japan it would be unthinkable for workers in the same community to fight each other or try to down each other, hence they have succeeded where other countries have not.  What is good for the country is good for you and me, for the ordinary worker and the boss.  We should have unity in facing common problems rather than some kind of mutual adversity.  Therefore, instead of introducing this almost irrelevant legislation, our job should be to create the framework in which that kind of harmonious, mutually constructive approach to getting the best from all of our resources is possible.</P>
    <P>At present, unfortunately, the role of our industrial relations machinery is primarily concerned with arbitration and negotiation, and that is not necessarily in the best interests of anyone.  The whole attitude clearly is detrimental to all of us. We need each other and we should stress that message at all times.  This attitude may be a stereotype, and there have been changes in recent years.  There is some enlightenment now in the management area in terms of dealing with industrial relations problems, nevertheless many workers perceive that they are regarded as drones by those who employ them, who see them as a resource which is expendable at the earliest opportunity, In a work entitled <i>Understanding Human Rights</i> edited by Alan D. Falconer in an article called <i>Human Rights and Industry</i> David E. Jenkins quotes from material prepared for a British Council of Churches study on employment a statement by a sometime shop steward in the motor industry which sums up much of the disaffection and alienation in this area of labour relations.  Mr. Jenkins says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The worker is controlled by forces over which he has little or no influence <Col N="1612" />&mdash; by the limits of his education and qualification; his environment; the siting of factories and of schools; &lsquo;town planning&rsquo;; problems of housing accommodation; economic and social pressures... And who cares?...  He has never seen his boss.  The managing director is as far away and mythical a figure as the Mona Lisa or Whistler's Mother; the shareholder a mere cipher which everyone ignores.  He has lost the relationship of shared labour, the interest and incentive of even minor achievement... He can no longer see himself as a human part, however lonely, of the total enterprise that is British Leyland or Courtaulds or Joseph Lucas or whoever it might be. His days are recorded on a time band, his efforts on a mechanical counter, his rewards on a punched card untouched by hand.  His thoughts are not recorded at all, since it is assumed that he doesn't have any&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Perhaps that is extreme, but it gives a flavour of the perception of many workers today.  Therefore, we should place as a priority in this House now &mdash; and I extend to the Minister our willingness to be involved in any possible constructive approach in this area &mdash; the question of a positive and comprehensive labour relations policy, not waiting to try to discuss or debate it in the context of a strike in a key area where emotion rules, but dealing with it preferably over a period of time in an unemotive, non-divisive atmosphere.  The only way the House will tackle the fundamental problems in this area is by some attempt at joint constructive leadership which is so sadly lacking in the extremely divisive, destructive, cynical debates we get in this Chamber.  I do not wish to minimise the difference between parties or to pretend that disagreements will not occur, but there should be a better way of doing the business of this country than we have witnessed over the last months.  If we do not listen to that message &mdash; which is not mine &mdash; which is screamed at us from the mouths of young people particularly, then on our heads be it.  That message should go to the trade unions also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1613" /> The findings of a survey carried out in 1977 and reported in <i>Business and Finance</i> in relation to Ireland's attitude to trade unions made some very unfavourable comments about the perception of the average man in the street of trade union power.  Whether they are right or wrong is not important.  The survey was carried out five years ago and I have no doubt that if it were taken now the figures would be more telling.  Most people perceived then that unions had too much power in general and that their effects on society were not necessarily the best.  I do not subscribe to that as a statement of fact, but I recognise a growing concern about union power which unfortunately is often misplaced.  The trade unions must be helped by us to deal with this and to try to give leadership again to their members and to represent them in a way which gets the best from those members, rather than being forced into positions by unofficial action already taken or committed. The framework I am talking about is one within which employers and employees can relate honestly.  This Bill has the whiff of Disraeli's two nations and the idea of the professional classes and the drones which is long outdated. We have to get away from that and see people as being not the same but equal in terms of their entitlement to respect and to enjoy the dignity of being a human being.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the manner in which a company called The Scott Bader Company Limited of Great Britain managed their affairs.  If the Minister has time, I would be grateful if he would have a look at how they achieved economic success and social success by incorporating new principles of shared management, real participation in decision making and real participation in profit making and profit sharing.  That summary is outlined in Professor Schumacher's work &ldquo;Small is Beautiful&rdquo; which is a classic work in that area.  The principles adopted by that company were revolutionary.  I do not expect that they will take root over night, but they seem to work.</P>
    <P>In the context of the debate this morning, we could be discussing much more pressing issues.  I do not intend to go in <Col N="1614" /> detail into the problem of unemployment, but it is a daunting problem and will need the use of the best of all our resources from all sides and from all sectors of the community, and they should be forthcoming willingly to try to give leadership, which is the real challenge at present.  That said, there will be a need for legislation.  There will be a need for a legislative framework within which this chemistry can take place.</P>
    <P>There will be a need for hard decisions to be taken, and that is a fundamental part of giving leadership.  The truth is that we may have been and may still be misleading people by pretending that there are soft options and that quantitatively speaking, the availability of work is infinite when we know it is not.  We may be faced with dealing with the problem, at least in part, by talking about work sharing, trying to get our economy back on the rails by dealing with questions of restraint in costs, wages, profits, proper discipline in our consumption patterns, less licence, perhaps, but more freedom.</P>
    <P>If and when those hard decisions come to be made &mdash; and I say this to the Minister with great respect and with as much sincerity as I can possibly muster &mdash; if it is possible for this Minister or any other Minister to achieve some kind of outline consensus in this House, or outside it, with the relevant party spokesman, it will make it a lot easier for us to support the Government in dealing with these challenges if we have an opportunity to make a submission initially.  To drop coldly into the Dáil Chamber a Bill in respect of which no one has had an opportunity to contribute except in the most peripheral way and which is designed exclusively by the Government of the day who, on occasion, seem to resent the suggestion that anyone should make an amendment of any kind, is to invite polarisation of political views unnecessarily with the result, unfortunately, that some of us will feel constrained inevitably to invent areas of difference where none exist.  Some kind of consultative structures within the parliamentary process could help to minimise differences and to ensure that we do not create them where no true differences exist.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1615" /> I suggest that our structures should be overhauled, and I should like to make one or two brief suggestions.  We need more research.  I am struck by the fact that there is an increasing tendency to accept as gospel statements made by politicians, trade union leaders and employer leaders which are not backed up by adequate research and which, in some cases, do not stand up when you analyse them.  The areas of dispute prevention, dispute settlement machinery, workplace collective bargaining, grievance and disciplinary procedures, training and education needs, employer and worker organisations &mdash; how good are they; how effective are they?  &mdash; the unofficial strike referred to earlier on, all need some framework within which we can analyse and research the problems and discover exactly what the lessons to be learned are, rather than adopting attitudes which may cause temporary and in some cases extremely serious inconvenience to the public and to ourselves as individuals.  These matters are often dealt with emotionally rather than on a clear rational basis.</P>
    <P>What about the possibility of having an industrial relations council?  I am struck by the success of the ESB in this respect. What about having an internal arbitration mechanism which depends for its success on the respect of all?  That is the key.  We are wasting time legislating for industrial relations if the law will not be respected.  No Government could even dream of shepherding thousands of workers, or hundreds of thousands of workers if we are to involve all trade union members, into a constraint placed upon them by a law we introduce here. There has to be respect.  The best types of industrial relations are those which are spontaneous and automatic and have no threatening framework of legislation.</P>
    <P>What about the expansion and decentralisation of the Labour Court?  Why should not small disputes, particularly at the incipient stage, or disputes which may have a serious consequence but will not be dealt with for a long time, or will not be dealt with finally by the Labour Court until it is too late, be dealt with by a <Col N="1616" /> two-tiered local court?  We would not even need a building if we had some official with court responsibility or a judicial function who could arbitrate at the beginning when people have not got ingrained attitudes and have not dug themselves in, when they have not adopted postures, when unions have not carried the flag into the streets and feel obliged to see it through until they exact some gain.</P>
    <P>What about the extension of the conciliation service?  There are many areas. The aforementioned are referred to in a submission by the Department of Industrial Relations to the Commission on Industrial Relations which had many positive proposals in it.  Many people from all sides made suggestions of a constructive nature.  We have no mechanism by which they could be processed.  The Department of Labour have their hands full.  It would be unreasonable to expect them to carry the whole burden or even the major burden because they are concerned primarily with the legislative area which deals with the symptoms rather than the basic problems.</P>
    <P>The Trade Disputes Bill, while welcome, is a kind of sad example of how we do things wrongly.  It clears up confusion about definitions in an Act 70 years old. Why cannot we create some better system which would allow us to respond more effectively and efficiently and on grounds of commonsense and reason?</P>
    <P>Tribute should be paid to Mr. Murphy and his fellow commissioners who have done enormous work.  Should we have more Rights Commissioners?  Should there be a rights commission structure to which people could refer?  Should we have a permanent industrial relations commission to suggest changes to the Government on the lines of the Law Reform Commission, but I would hope more attention would be paid to their recommendations than was paid to the recommendations of that august body who did such good work?  Should there be less emphasis on legal regulations and more aid for self-help and development? Would it not be better for us to grant-aid people engaged in this process, rather than having damaging strikes which cost <Col N="1617" /> the country millions?  Would it not be better if we helped people to create the machinery even if financial aid were necessary, rather than in the absence of that structure having a strike costing multiples of the sum which would have been involved in the first place?</P>
    <P>We should have greater emphasis on education and training in the schools. From my own school days or during my teaching days, I cannot recall ever having had any formal dealings with the issue of industrial relations except in the context of the famous civics course which was, to put it mildly, somewhat peripheral to the main concern of passing examinations. There is change in that regard.  I contend that a proper attitude to work, a proper attitude to strikes and a proper attitude to other people in our society are as important as knowing the root of a Latin verb.  Yet they have not been given that status in our education system.  Education and training in the work place and the question of real worker participation also arise.</P>
    <P>In an article from the <i>International Labour Review,</i> Volume 113 No. 1, January-February 1976 Johannes Schregle said:</P>
    <P>In this wider context workers' participation has a role to play in industrial relations in general, i.e. labour relations are not limited to the confines of the enterprise.  In fact in many countries the new trend towards increased workers' participation is not restricted to the enterprise and reflects an overall approach to labour relations in the national economy.  The need to co-ordinate shop-floor and enterprise workers' participation with the representation of trade unions on national councils and similar bodies is obvious. In an increasingly complex society many decisions cannot be taken at the enterprise level and must be left to higher authority.  In a highly industrialised society such as Japan, for example, the most urgent problems of our times, e.g. inflation and pollution, are considered too big to be effectively tackled at the company level, and this holds true for other countries as well.</P>
    <P>The point is that there is real democracy <Col N="1618" /> in the work place.  Workers are treated not simply as people who have to be consulted but as people whose input is seen as valuable and able to help us to create a better environment and therefore a better country.  What is good for Ireland is good for each one of us, down to what is known unfortunately, as the most menial worker.  The question of ownership and profit-sharing needs to be looked at again.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my party I want to reiterate my pleasure in having been given the opportunity to deal with some of these issues and my approval of this measure as presented, although I regret it was not part of a more comprehensive set of proposals. I wish to show a genuine willingness to work with the Government as well as possible in discussions leading to any new framework within which we can create more respect in the workplace for workers and employers, more productivity, more inducement to work honestly, and a better industrial relations scene and, at the end of the day, a better country for everybody, particularly the young people who unfortunately face a very daunting future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Time and time again the Labour Party sought an amendment of the 1906 Act.  In many respects this is a very historic decision by Dáil Éireann to amend the Trade Disputes Act and to extend immunity from prosecution to an additional 200,000 workers whose basic rights in terms of taking industrial action have for a number of years been very severely circumscribed by the Act.  Even though it may not appear to be so, this morning is a historic milestone in the evolution of industrial relations legislation and is one <Col N="1619" /> of the most important amending decisions to be brought in over the past ten years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating painted a very wide and interesting canvas of the general problems of industrial relations while covering this amendment and I propose to confine my comments to the Bill.  Since 1969, when first I came into this House, I have been campaigning for this fundamental amendment and prior to my election, in my capacity as a trade union official, I fully appreciated the serious defect in the Act as interpreted by the Supreme Court.  The extent to which public service employees have been open to injunctive proceedings and to damages, both individually and as members of a trade union, has not been fully appreciated by the public at large.  At times one got the impression that even a number of public servants were not aware that they could have been prosecuted because they took industrial action, or because their unions acted on their behalf.  It has not been fully appreciated either the extent to which the funds of the public service unions concerned have been in grave jeopardy because of this lack of immunity. We all know even one case could cause major losses of trade union funds and cripple a trade union in its day-to-day work.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a clear commitment from successive Governments to introduce the necessary amendment. My frustration has been that despite the promises made by several governments time has not been found in the legislative programme to enact this amendment.  Deputy Kavanagh when Minister gave that very clear commitment on behalf of the last Coalition but, unfortunately, because of the sudden demise of that Government it was not possible to enact that amendment.</P>
    <P>There are 300,000 workers in the public sector and 200,000 of them, post office employees, teachers, local authority and health board employees and so on, did not have the basic protection of immunity from prosecution or damages in the event of taking industrial action.  I am pleased <Col N="1620" /> to note this morning that not only is the Minister making this change, but the House is unanimous.  The Fine Gael Party have been unequivocal in their support. One of the reasons for the long delay in the introduction of this amendment has been the fact that for a number of years the amendment has been used as a bargaining counter for seeking reforms in other areas of industrial relations and particularly used as a bargaining counter towards the trade union movement by successive governments over a decade.  I could perceive that in the attitudes of the Departments of Labour, the Public Service and Finance in negotiations regarding national understandings and in the attitudes of representatives of employer organisations.  They have always held that if the Government were to concede this amendment there should be some <i>quid pro quo</i> from the trade union movement in the matter of reforms in other areas.  Needless to remark, I have never accepted that this should be used as a bargaining counter.  The amendment should be made in its own right, and that is what is being done now.  It is the appropriate and democratic way of dealing with the lack of scope in the 1906 Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the two exclusions in the Bill, namely, the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána from the protections granted by the 1906 Act.  I accept the exclusions but with a reservation. I have said before that I believe the Defence Forces should have a form of trade union organisation.  Admittedly one could hardly envisage that they be granted immunity in regard to industrial action.  The basic security of the State must be maintained at all times, but it is arguable that the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Defence should get rid of some of the more obscurantist attitudes towards trade union organisation in the Army and in the Garda Síochána. We will not be a fully democratic country until the 25,000 men and women who constitute our security forces have the right to trade union organisation, representation and association.  These are very important issues.</P>
    <P>The disciplined, hierarchical and necessarily authoritarian structure of the <Col N="1621" /> Army and the other branches of our Defence Forces should not preclude their having from within a form of trade union representation and a trade union structure. Admittedly one would not extend the immunities of the 1906 Act to them. One could hardly envisage the Army formally parading in front of a barracks with a notice saying &lsquo;Strike on here.&rsquo;  However, in other countries there are such forms of representations.  Our Army has served the nation well at home and abroad in very difficult circumstances, particularly on Border duty and in the United Nations peace-keeping forces, but there is still considerable frustration within the Army with regard to promotion prospects, disciplinary procedures, pay, conditions of employment and living conditions.  There are internal consultative procedures but it is a hierarchal consultation. For example, the Army cannot be affiliated to or participate in any way in the work of the ICTU.  It has no liaison, even on an informal basis, with that organisation.  Neither does the Army have direct liaison with the public service conciliation and arbitration procedures. It is totally excluded.</P>
    <P>The statutes relating to the Garda Síochána should be amended to enable them to be affiliated to the ICTU.  At the moment the maximum permitted affiliation is to the ICPSA.  Of itself this is a worthy organisation but does not compare in any way with the enlarged role of the ICTU.  It is wrong that the Garda Síochána should not have the opportunity of affiliation with the ICTU.  I urge the Minister to broaden our concept of democracy.  The 10,000 members of the Garda Síochána are affected by national understandings and by public service conditions of employment.  A <i>modus operandi</i> could be devised where their basic security functions would at all times be discharged while, at the same time, allowing them the right of affiliation.  The Congress must always scrutinise the constitution of bodies affiliating to it and I am sure it would welcome such affiliation.</P>
    <P>I hope that the current unhappy and disturbing disputes between the Congress and one major public service union which <Col N="1622" /> organises 13,000 workers can be resolved.  The Congress has shown enormous patience, tolerance and understanding of the grave charges that have been placed against that public service union.  We have a right in the Dáil to tell that union to put their house in order and to reaffiliate to the ICTU.  That union has a fundamental obligation to discharge its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the day when the 25,000 members of the security forces have a liaison with the ICTU, even if that is not a formal liaison, and also when the 13,000 public service workers whose executive have placed them outside the pale of trade unionism will be back again into that sphere of activity.  The public service union in question should address themselves urgently to that question while at the same time the civil servants involved should exercise their democratic right and insist on their executive and general officers re-examining the situation so that we will not have fragmentation of trade union organisation in the public sector.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has said, the FUE are somewhat jaundiced in their reaction to the proposed amendment.  This is understandable because down through the years this organisation were under the impression that the Government of the day would use the amendment of the 1906 Act as a bargaining counter for various other reforms which they were seeking. The FUE to say the least have been browned off with what they regard as a change of heart on the part of the Government.  I have considerable regard for the concern of the FUE and in particular their Director General on the question of the reform of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous need for massive fence mending on the part of the Government with the FUE in the matter of industial relations policy generally. There is almost hostility in the business sector towards the Government on this question of industrial relations.  This mistrust and hostility is not directed in any way at the Minister for Labour and the Public Service.  Relations in that respect are exceptionally good but the internal perception of industrial relations on the <Col N="1623" /> part of directors in major companies and within the executive council of the FUE in terms of what is the Cabinet's understanding of industrial relations policy, particularly in regard to individual settlements and disputes, is considerably jaundiced. That is not due in any way to any lack of concern on the part of the Minister because both now and during his previous term in office he has enjoyed excellent relations with the FUE, the ICTU and the other employer organisations.  However in many ways there has been a marked deterioration in that attitude. Since the Government may be in office for some considerable time to come, depending on the vagaries of the support they enjoy, it is essential that they have a constructive dialogue with the FUE.</P>
    <P>With the amendment of the 1906 Act, I would hope that the FUE and in particular their directors general, Mr. Dan McAuley would get together with the new general secretary of the ICTU, Mr. Donal Nevin, whose appointment I welcome, for the purpose of having constructive dialogue.  I should hope also that the new president of the ICTU, Mr. Paddy Cardiff, who is a trade union leader of outstanding ability, would also be a party to such dialogue and that all three parties would consider advancing substantially on the report of the Commission of Inquiry on Industrial Relations.  It is a matter of considerable regret that the ICTU found themselves constrained not to take part in that commission.  While I would not call for the setting up of a new commission I would hope that the three parties involved&mdash;the Government, the employers and the trade unions&mdash;would come together and consider further advances on reform.</P>
    <P>I make this plea in the knowledge that in the next two to three years there will be very grave problems for our country, problems that will affect not only the public sector but the whole range of industrial relations.  There cannot be any hope regarding the realisation of the massive expectations that people will have both on the pay and on the benefits side, such as those which existed in the early seventies and during a large part of the <Col N="1624" /> late seventies.  Such expectations cannot be realised in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>There has been a massive reduction in living standards in the past 18 months. We are talking about a reduction of from 14 to 15 per cent in real terms.  This is noticeable in terms of consumption patterns and of living standards generally. For proof of this there are many categories of figures that one might examine. For example, there are the returns for the first six months of this year for the purchase of new and second-hand cars. Arising out of that reduction in living standards, a reduction that has not been necessarily across the board but which has been rather patchy, there may be in the context of future negotiations of national understandings demands which may be way beyond the capacity of the economy to meet.  That sort of situation could give rise to grave problems.</P>
    <P>I remain a non-repentant advocate of national understandings.  I am absolutely in favour of the Government, the trade unions and the employer organisations coming together at periodic intervals and hammering out in the national interest economic and social understandings.  But such understandings must take place in a climate of realism as to what the public finances can afford and of realism also in terms of what the private sector is in a position to provide by way of increases. I am gravely concerned that the FUE and the other employer organisations may have thrown their hat at the prospect of further national understandings.  One can only hope that the climate will change and that the employer organisations will look towards the end of the year when we might have an 18-month-to-two-year understanding which should revolve essentially around the question of employment, of job creation, protection and maintenance.  This will be the fundamental issue for the next two years.  By October there are likely to be a further 8,000 to 10,000 trade union members out of work.  That sort of situation is bordering on a general economic crisis but if we compound that by having also an industrial relations crisis, we will be pulling the plug on our future development.</P>
    <P>I make those pleas.  I warmly welcome <Col N="1625" /> the Minister's introduction of this historic milestone.  I am glad to note that the House is unanimous in its decision and that public service employees and their trade unions can be assured that the Dáil has risen to the occasion, at long last removing this major anomaly in our industrial relations legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Waterford) Mr. Gallagher (Waterford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> I also welcome this short Bill but I must say that it has travelled a long distance and taken a long time to reach the floor of this House.</P>
      <P>Whilst listening to the contributions of the Minister and other spokesmen one could be forgiven for the lack of realisation that it has taken 76 years for this amended Bill to reach the House.  If my recollection is correct, I think it was Big Jim Larkin, as he was known, who first implemented this legislation in Belfast. As one of the initiators of the labour movement in this country I cannot help but wonder what he would have thought about this amending legislation taking 76 years to reach the floor of this House. There is a story told about Jim Larkin in Belfast during that very turbulent period in Irish history, particularly in so far as labour law was concerned.  He was at that time involved in a dispute and when the local police force arrived to arrest him he pointed out to them that in fact the 1906 Trades Dispute Act had come into operation two days previously.  In the course of conversation I think he educated them into the point of view that they, even as custodians of the civil law, had entitlements as workers in the broader sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the point with which I take issue in regard to this Bill, that while welcoming the amendment, we regret the Minister has not seen fit to include the Garda Síochána in the definition of &ldquo;workmen&rdquo;.  We believe the Garda should enjoy the same rights, privileges, and protection under this Bill as do any other public servants.  In the past five years or so, at various meetings which have taken place throughout the country it has been demonstrated and publicised that amongst the rank and file of the Garda there is a ground swell of movement of opinion toward trade union representation as against the Garda Representative <Col N="1626" /> Body.  I believe the Government should acknowledge that ground swell of opinion.  They should acknowledge also the dedication and commitment of the Garda by granting them the same rights and protection as they do other public servants.  Indeed the salaries and conditions of employment of the Garda leave a lot to be desired.  There is no reason to believe that they would use their rights to take action in furtherance of a dispute any less responsibly than would any of the rest of our public service.  It may be an emotive comparison to make, but I merely draw the analogy.</P>
    <P>For example, nobody would suggest for one moment that a doctor or nurse operating under the General Medical Service would allow a patient to die in furtherance of a trade dispute.  I do not even think that such would be suggested. Therefore it would be equally wrong to suggest that the Garda would exploit the protection of the 1906 Act to the detriment of the community.  They are a responsible body of people who take their duties seriously, they remain aloof from the everyday turbulence of life. They are there to protect the ordinary citizen while they, as ordinary citizens themselves, are denied the entitlements of this Bill the Minister sees fit to grant other public servants.  We believe that the gardaí have the right to withdraw their labour, particularly when all other mechanisms or procedures have been exhausted, in order to pursue what they consider to be fair and just improvements in their wages and conditions of service. It is as well to place on the record that there is absolutely no justification for treating those entrusted with protecting the rights of our citizens as second-class citizens.  That is precisely what is happening now.  When I speak about extending the rights under this Bill to the gardaí I draw a very clear distinction between them and the military.  I would not be sufficiently naive to come into this Chamber and maintain that the same rights should apply to the military, because I believe the same rights should not apply to them.  I believe that the gardaí are responsible for the upholding of our civil law but that the military &mdash; as the last <Col N="1627" /> bastion of defence in relation to democracy &mdash; should not enjoy the same rights. In effect if that right were exercised anarchy would prevail in the land.  That is a very clear distinction I draw.  We believe that the gardaí should enjoy the same trade union rights as do teachers, nurses, tax inspectors, health inspectors, factory inspectors, people right across the whole range of the public service.</P>
    <P>We believe that the exclusion of the gardaí from this Bill is based on a Victorian view of the police force by successive Governments.  We believe that if the provisions of this Bill were extended to the gardaí it would constitute a vote of confidence in the body of men and women who make up our police force.  We do not see it as a contentious issue.  We view the gardaí as no more nor less than the broad stream of other workers in the PAYE sector that make up 80 per cent of the total workforce and, in that context, should be afforded the protection of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There has been mention of the attitude of the Federated Union of Employers to this Bill.  I can describe that only as a sulking attitude.  It seems to me that on every occasion on which there is any trade dispute that, rather than concede something as of right instead of by way of extraction under some sort of pressure, the Federated Union of Employers refuse to realise that we are living in the year 1982 and not, for example, 1913 in the lock-out situation that obtained then. Whilst continuously preaching to workers about moderation, wage restraint and so on the Federated Union of Employers' attitude &mdash; and particularly in relation to this amending Bill &mdash; leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes some small way towards recognising the commitment and dedication of public servants since the foundation of the State.  Public service bashing is a popular pastime at present in this country, and indeed has been for several years past.  It must be remembered that one can always afford to bash the public service because they cannot hit back.  I recollect that, when speaking on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill, I referred <Col N="1628" /> to the lack of morale within the employees of the public sector, it does not matter which particular section, whether it be civil servants, nurses, doctors or whoever, to their inability to respond to the situations in which they find themselves, under constant sniping attack. There are an awful lot of public service employees and unions doing an excellent job for this country.  We see them in the ESB and in other State agencies.  Yet we witness the constant sniping by the would-be entrepreneurs who, incidentally, are the very people who benefit from the existence of such State companies. The Workers' Party are not afraid to defend public servants whose only &ldquo;crime&rdquo; has been to implement conservative ideologies and politics of their political masters.  I find it interesting and amusing that the reform of the 1906 Act, which has been demanded for decades by the trade union movement, is being implemented by a Minister for Labour from one of the two conservative parties in this House.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Desmond say that when Deputy Kavanagh was Minister for Labour he intended to do this, that and the other but the Government fell and the opportunity did not arise.  Deputy O'Leary, the Leader of the Labour Party, was in a position from 1974 to 1977 to implement that legislation but he did not do so.  Since the Labour Party are not in Government they will hardly be under a whip to oppose the amendments.  They were conspicuous by their absence yesterday in regard to the resource tax amendment so I doubt if there will be any contention in relation to this section.  My Party welcome this amendment, which goes some way towards accepting that, in our modern society, there are rights and entitlements.  There is an attitude taken by some people that employees and employers should work together and have a common purpose.  Fundamentally, I cannot agree with that.  I do not see a situation where workers and employers have anything in common.  All the workers has to sell is his labour.  However, we welcome this Bill and I hope it will have the unanimous support of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the introduction of this Bill which will regularise an anomaly which has existed for far too long.  The fact that it has not been on the Statute Books has not created many problems in recent years.  There is one reference to the courts that probably is a complicating factor, the Talbot dispute, and the Supreme Court handing down decisions which are not in the general interest in the very disciplined, strict legal sense and are not practical or helpful. Unfortunately, I did not hear all the contributions but I think Deputy Keating mentioned the fact that Parliament can be seen to be out of step with the general interest when the courts do not accept what we regard as rational submissions put to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy to introduce legislation for problems that are easily dealt with.  The major area of industrial relations is a complex subject with which we have not grappled or tried to modernise.  In May 1978 when the Minister for Labour set up a commission of inquiry on industrial relations it was a far seeing move, although there is another point of view that says if you want to do nothing set up a commission.  Unfortunately, at that time, one of the major parties decided not to participate.  We now have the reverse situation, as mentioned by the Minister this morning, that another major party are not agreeable to participate in discussion of the findings.  As a result, we have not made as much progress as we would have liked.  The commission was set up in May 1978 and reported on 28 July 1981.  One year later we are introducing a simple measure, and I hope the House will agree that it is forward looking legislation.  Our real concern is where we go from here.  Whatever the rights or wrongs, industrial relations have been far from satisfactory in the past ten years.  I know the present Minister for Labour has made untiring efforts, in many complex disputes, to try to be of assistance.  It has been said in this House that political involvement in trade disputes is not desirable, that there is machinery there to deal with it and that there are other steps that can be taken <Col N="1630" /> without politicans being involved.</P>
    <P>I genuinely believe that leadership is needed in this area at present from this House.  When we have a situation that a very comprehensive commission report is available and 12 months later we have not even commenced to discuss how we are going to implement some of the acceptable recommendations, not to speak of the contentious ones, we are not making progress quickly enough.  We are coming to the recess next week.  When that is over we will be almost at the end of 1982 and that will mean it will take two years to have any movement forward as a result of the commission's report.  Trade unions have been requesting this legislation for some time.  It is worthwhile trying to get a fair and reasonable balance as to where the rights and wrongs are in industrial relations.  I heard the last few minutes of Deputy Gallagher's contribution. The three representatives of The Workers' Party should not run away with the idea that they are the sole representatives of workers.  I represent a constituency which has probably more employees than any other.  I am just as well qualified to represent their interest as anybody else in this House and it is my responsibility to do so.  I was a member of a trade union for many years and am familiar with their workings.  I want to try to get the message across that in this House, irrespective of the so-called conservative label that may be put on various parties, we all represent the vast number of people who are employees.  The bulk of people are now employees because, with the disappearance of the family business, everybody from the chief executive of the largest organisation down, is an employee.  That must be recognised. Members of the House, people in senior management, in factory offices, in factories and so on are all in the PAYE and PRSI net.  That message must be got across.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement has been slow to modernise and rationalise.  Genuine grievances have arisen where employees felt that their trade unions had not given them the representation that they needed.  That is understandable.  But <Col N="1631" /> the people who are most critical of the service they get from their trade union are the people who are paying a very low subscription.  Most of the full-time trade union officials are extremely hard-working and over-worked people.  It is only when one has a dispute in one's constituency and tries to have discussions with the parties concerned that one fully appreciates the pressures and demands on the full-time trade union representative. Everybody accepts that we have far too many trade unions.  But how does one rationalise that situation?  What union is going to agree to disband?  That is a major problem, and we have not made any progress on that aspect of trade union representation.  The trade union movement will have to try to resolve this purely in the interests of giving their members better representation.  We have various inter-union disputes where people wanted to transfer from one trade union to another trade union within a company.  That is not acceptable.  There are differences of opinion which cause disputes.  One union is seen to be more aggressive than another.</P>
    <P>This has created a great deal of fragmentation and created a situation where unions have left Congress and are not party to Congress decisions for too long. At the recent annual conference of the Marine Port and General Workers Union they decided not to come back into Congress by quite a substantial vote.  This is sad for anybody who wants to see a progressive and strong co-ordinated trade union movement.  The role of the trade union movement in the eighties is going to be different from what it was in the past.  Various Ministers for Labour and various Governments have brought in a substantial amount of legislation to give basic protections to employees.  In so doing they have negatived part of the role of the trade union official, for example, in the areas of redundancy and unfair dismissal.  Under various headings legislation now protects the employee.  Therefore the role of the trade union official has to change to meet the new challenges because the legislation has dealt with a lot of the anomalies they had to deal with <Col N="1632" /> in the past.  What is his main function now?  Unfortunately we have tended to have fire brigade actions in this situation. It is very easy today to talk to trade union officials about rationalising and about other subjects in companies where there are difficulties.  Unfortunately when there was an upward swing it was difficult, the demands were possibly excessive and created the bad track record that we have.  Now because we have a recession and the difficulties that go with international recession things have changed completely and the trade union official finds himself in a very difficult situation. Having been too demanding some years ago he has now to go very much towards giving on behalf of members in accepting redundancies, short-time working and other problems that beset us at the moment.</P>
    <P>While we have the opportunity of discussing industrial relations I would ask the Minister to give his view on the commission's report.  It is not unfair for the trade unions or the employers to ask for the Government's view.  Why should we not give the leadership and say what our ideas are to form the basis for the agenda for the first meetings that are going to take place between the parties concerned? I am convinced that there is no more important subject that can come before this House than the matter we are dealing with today.  I would like to see every possible effort made to agree a formula on the Commission's report by the end of this year.  That may not be a realistic target but it is my recommendation to the Minister.  I would urge that everything possible be done to decide whether the recommendations are good for industrial relations.  But at least let us come to a conclusion and put away this commission of inquiry on industrial relations by adopting it or getting it agreed or partly agreed.  But at least let us see some movement forward.</P>
    <P>The OECD report dealt recently with unemployment figures.  It mentioned that there are 28.5 million people unemployed in the countries it reported on.  It dealt also with the problems of unemployment and how we were going to cope with it in the eighties.  It urged great <Col N="1633" /> acceptance of new technological advances and that we should quickly recognise the spin-off employment benefits that will accrue from accepting new technology.  It pointed out that where there was resistance unemployment figures were rising and would probably continue to do so and that the best we can do as a group of countries is to recognise the realities of today's technology, to recognise that it will create redundancies under one heading but could create employment under new headings.  I would urge the trade union movement and management to look jointly at this subject and to come up with some guidelines as to its acceptability.  At the moment if we talk about new technology the trade union official or his members will straight away take a position of resistance because they immediately see a machine replacing a person.  That is a reality and that is happening.  But if we want to be competitive with a small open economy we have to recognise that we have to use the most efficient methods in the commercial and public sectors.  If on the one hand that is going to create unemployment problems we must recognise that on the other hand we must try to identify the job creation effects on the implementation of new technology.  That applies to the service sector, the supply sector and efficiency bringing greater productivity which gives us an edge in exports and has a great spin-off effect of job creation.  That was the thrust of the message of the OECD report on unemployment. We have to recognise the potential and not be negatively resistent to new technology.  So I urge all parties concerned to look at this in a reasoned and balanced way and to come to the consensus that we are going to implement new technology where there is a beneficial effect and realise that if we have unemployment as a result eventually additional employment will be created.</P>
    <P>The Government must act as the honest broker and cushion the blow of unemployment. It must be recognised that downstream employment will be created for young people who are now being educated to take advantage of new technology. In my constituency there have <Col N="1634" /> been redundancies in the car assembly sector and in other traditional industries and there are difficult problems to be overcome, particularly for the older people affected.  If a new electronics industry were to be set up, the sons of those people who have received different training would be able to secure emploment, as would graduates and young engineers and other qualified people.  We must recognise this trend and address ourselves to it in a practical and pragmatic way.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the public sector and their efficiency or lack of it. Many see them as being in sheltered employment and they must accept the need for greater productivity.  People employed in the private sector know whether the company which employs them is profitable or otherwise because comprehensive accounts are published at the end of each financial year.  The Dáil each year votes an increased amount to enable the provision of various services by the public sector.  Those employed in providing those services get their pay increases and the normal benefits which accompany the centralised bargaining which many in the private sector see as being unrealistic in today's economic conditions.  I appeal to the public sector to feel accountable for their productivity. At the end of each month or year they should be able to measure in identifiable terms their contribution to the overall economy through the services they are providing.  The Minister for Finance intends to make savings in this sector.  I assume that there will not be job losses but that there can be savings in the costs of the services provided.  I do not wish to go into detail about the cost of the public sector or whether we are getting value for money, but those concerned must recognise that in a time of international recession they are in a sheltered position and must make a greater contribution.</P>
    <P>I realise that there were anomalies in their position which led to the introduction of this legislation and public sector employees may have felt in an inferior position to their colleagues in the private sector.  The reality is that while they may not have had all the various benefits they <Col N="1635" /> have not been making the contributions either and in times of economic difficulty they must contribute more to the national cake.  We can all improve our efficiency and politicians should set an example by being seen to be more productive and efficient in dealing with their affairs.  In return for the protection which this Bill will give to those in the public sector, there must be a reciprocal recognition of their position.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his speech to applications for licences for negotiation rights.  There is a case before the courts at present concerning some group seeking these rights.  This is a further fragmentation of an already fragmented situation in regard to industrial relations and every effort should be made by the Minister to discourage people from breaking into sectional groups, even in the public sector, and to persuade them to deal with their problems through existing negotiation bodies.  When a group apply for a licence for negotiating rights it is an indication of their dissatisfaction with their existing representatives.  I ask the trade union movement and the Minister to get agreement, if possible, not to set up any more groups with negotiation rights. What is this achieving?  The Labour Court is expanding and costing more money annually but there is no productive output.  Efforts to bring disputes to an end are costing more and more money.  I know that the Minister is expanding Labour Court facilities and this is an indication of their work load.  It is also a recognition that we are not able to resolve matters in-house, either in the public or the private sectors.  We must bring about a change of attitude to this subject.</P>
    <P>Nobody is more familiar with this problem than the Minister for Labour and I commend the Taoiseach on his decision to re-appoint Deputy Fitzgerald to the Department of Labour.  During his privious term he was recognised, particularly by the trade union movement, as having a tremendous commitment to progress and fair play.  I would urge him to implement by the end of this year some <Col N="1636" /> of the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry on Industrial Relations. If matters continue to drag on, the Labour Court will continue to expand and we will have fewer resources for worthwhile investment.  This plan will chart our course through the eighties.  I ask the Minister to ensure that industrial peace will have priority in that plan.  That is the aim and target of all of us.  We cannot have industrial peace if all sides are not involved.  This will call for sacrifices in some sectors and a major contribution in others.  Co-operation between trade unions, management and the Government must be one of the major aspects of the economic plan.</P>
    <P>Regarding the semi-State sector, I highlight the need for productivity.  This sector has come in for a lot of criticism over the last ten years, some of it very justified.  When there is justifiable criticism, everything, including reasonable, fair requests, comes under criticism.  The trade union movement, the politicians and those managing the affairs of the public and private sectors must recognise that our track record in the past ten years has been of inefficiency.  The eighties will provide a daunting challenge and a need for fresh ideas and new approaches.  This Trades Dispute (Amendment) Act is no small gesture towards the resolution of existing anomalies and the production of goodwill all round.  This will ensure cordial progress in the area of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister will act upon some of my suggestions and comments.  He is undoubtedly committed to seeking progress in industrial relations. I will be taking a great interest in that subject in the months and years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire) Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> My contribution will be brief.  We have gone a long way towards protecting people's rights, which is to be welcomed.  I see no reason why we should not extend that protection to the public sector, and for that reason I welcome the Bill before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one or two points to make.  This protection which we are giving also brings responsibility for those in the trade union <Col N="1637" /> movement and for the employers.  The vast majority of people in the trade union movement and the employers' groups have acted responsibly, but unfortunately there is a minority which does not show the leadership necessary to get us back on to the right road.  A lot is spoken about the need to protect the rights of our young people and to ensure jobs for them.  Those jobs will not be there if we do not act responsibly and if leadership is lacking.  There is too much speech and too little action in this regard.  I call on politicians, members of the trade union movement and employers to realise that we must protect these rights and show concern for our young population.  We must all make sacrifices, to ensure a flourishing economy which will produce the jobs which are so much talked about.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Lawlor's remarks with regard to technology.  Everybody in this day and age must recognise the importance of technology.  However, technology is one thing and job creation is another.  We have advanced technology here, but to date it has affected a number of jobs which would have been coming on stream every year, particularly jobs for our school leavers.  The technology introduced here is benefitting economies other than our own, something that should be looked at.  There is not much point in doing away with jobs here to help economies and create jobs everywhere else.  We have a responsibility to our people first.</P>
    <P>There are a number of large financial institutions trading in this country, such as insurance companies, who have in the past contributed a great deal to job creation, particularly among the young. However, there is now a trend for the bulk of their operation to be transferred abroad as a result of advanced technology. The insurance companies who trade here are dealing with large amounts of Irish money and if they are to trade here, as they have a right to do, they also have a responsibility to the people from whom their profits have been made.  I ask the Minister to examine the activities of some of these groups to see that they are not destroying job opportunities for our young people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1638" /> Is it not about time, in this age of technology, that we examined our whole education structure?  Our system is giving young people leaving certificates which are absolutely useless.  Those school leavers are put, unprepared, on the streets at 17 years of age, having had six years' secondary education.  This system has not changed since I was at school nor, I am sure, since the Minister was at school. Yet, we talk about advanced technology. Surely we should be updating our educational system to help people to meet the challenges of today, educating them in trade union matters, their responsibilities and activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I wish to thank the various speakers from all parties for their unanimous welcome and acceptance of the measure before the House.  I particularly want to compliment Deputy Keating on his appointment as party spokesman on Labour and to thank him for his contribution, which obviously was studied and to which he had given some attention before speaking in the House.  This indicates his commitment to the subject and to the importance of political interest in areas like industrial relations.  His contribution covered the history of the development of the 1906 Act, among other things, and referred briefly to some interesting cases of trade union law over the years.  This probably is one of the most interesting subjects, in its development from the early 1900s to today.  Until recently we were rather short of good, authoritative, explored and researched writing on this subject.  In recent times, there have been some very good contributions on the history of the Irish trade union movement.  One cannot divorce the circumstances of the 1906 Act from that interesting history of the development before the foundation of the State and during its early years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to thank the other speakers for their contributions.  I will first make some general observations and then comment on what has been said.  I agree with all who say that there is a need to improve industrial relations procedures and practices. I am glad to have been the Minister <Col N="1639" /> who steered this measure through the House.  It was a serious irritant.  I regretted the decision of Congress in 1979 at their annual conference not to be involved in the commission of inquiry into industrial relations because of this. It was a source of financial loss to some trade unions, and there was also the area of discrimination.</P>
    <P>We can all progress from here.  There is general goodwill.  I have a commitment from Congress side that they will contribute to discussions and I look forward to the FUE taking a similar decision to involve themselves in the discussions.  We all have a duty to the young people to whom Deputy Barrett referred.  All three parties have an obligation to ensure that the industrial relations climate is not a deterrent but is complementary to our industrial, economic and social development.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that on a measure such as this speakers should mention the removal of certain items.  The public service was mentioned because it has been given immunity.  Deputy Lawlor raised some good points about industrial relations, and I shall deal with them later. As regards the public service, they are criticised ofttimes during periods of recession because they are in sheltered employment.  That is quite true.  On the other hand, in periods of buoyancy the experience has been that the private sector passes them and gallops away ahead of them.  There is a lot of room for improvement and there should be more training and greater efficiency.  Governments should not allow schemes to continue to operate without asking if they are still benefitting the community or examining whether they should be replaced by something more desirable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating said he would prefer a more comprehensive measure.  Everybody would, but I have explained why it had to be this amendment.  We can proceed from here.  I know of Deputy Lawlor's great interest in labour legislation and trade union activities.  Any suggestions that Deputies put to me will be considered.  We are dealing with a basically non-political area of industrial relations <Col N="1640" /> but one which is very important in the Ireland of today.  The comparisons the Deputy made with 20 years ago on the number of strikes which took place are not valid, because we are now dealing with different developments than we had at that time.</P>
    <P>There are some hopeful signs.  For example, in the past, about 68 per cent of all strikes were unofficial.  It varied from 65 per cent to 70 per cent.  In the first six months of this year, 47 per cent of strikes were unofficial.  For whatever reason that is an improvement.  Trade union leaders have a deep commitment to the economic well-being and development of the country as well as the rights and entitlements of their members.  I share Deputy Desmond's concern about a particular problem in trade union circles at present and in a particular union but, too often, the members of trade unions do not attend meetings and do not give their support to responsible trade union leadership.  They deserve support if at times they are under pressure from elements within the trade union.  Each trade union member has an obligation to attend and be aware of what is happening within his own trade union.  It would be helpful to all concerned.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy mentioned that it was not a significant measure.  Deputy Gallagher said it took a hell of a long time to get on the floor of the House for such a small move.  I was aware of how contentious it was and I am proud that I was the Minister to bring it before the House.  It is a step forward and will enable us to make progress.  Industrial relations is an area where we do not stand still.  Deputies Desmond, Keating and Gallagher referred to the fact that for too long Irish management ignored the importance of personnel.  Little value was placed on the personnel function within a company or group.  That has since changed.  It must be regarded as an extremely important aspect of management today.  There must be greater involvement by staff, greater participation and a greater disclosure of information.  We must work for this.  We must achieve it.  If there are good human relations there will be good industrial relations.  If there is boredom or monotony <Col N="1641" /> that can lead to bad industrial relations.</P>
    <P>One of my more pleasant functions, having been reappointed as Minister, was to attend the personnel institute conference in Galway and to see the tremendous role they play.  During my visit to congress in Belfast this week I had the same experience and saw the same commitment by that dedicated group of people.  I will be meeting the FUE and will say to them that it may not have been the move they would like but we must remember that it was the public service employees who were suffering.  It was discriminatory not because of its operation, because that was completely different in Britain to what it is here, but because of court decisions and because we have to abide by them.  The Congress of Trade Unions have the same obligation to come and sit with me and see where we can make improvements. Deputy Lawlor asked if the Commission's recommendations would be utilised to the full in those discussions.  I accept that point.  Some will find consensus and agreement from both sides. Obviously they will be the easier ones for everyone to implement but they may well be the most expensive ones from the Government's point of view; but it is important as the previous speaker said, that we do review our procedures and our education.</P>
    <P>When I first went into the Department of Labour in 1977 I presided over a very substantial increase in the contribution to the research and educational services of the Congress of Trade Unions, and I believe that is money very well spent. That education is needed and must be continued and must be developed further. Education can play a very big role in improving the industrial relations climate. I agree also with those who said that the law itself is not the answer.  There must be legal structures, perhaps, to support codes of practice and whatever, but I have often said that if law were the answer every western democracy could have legislated away its industrial relations problems and would not have succeeded because law itself, as speakers have said, is no answer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> Imports were referred to and their value at the moment.  On radio this week I said I appreciated this point.  All of us in this House should continue to say to our communities and to our people and wherever we get the opportunity how important it is in today's climate to buy the Irish product, to buy the product that is made here, let it be for the home, the farm, the factory or whatever.  Our State boards have an obligation to ensure that priority is given to the Irish product and each one in this House should encourage that at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to unofficial strikes. Some Deputy spoke about the position of the Garda and the Army, Deputy Gallagher in particular.  As the House is aware, the Bill before the House gives immunity for picketing to licensed trade unions.  In fact, the position of the Garda and the Army is a little more complicated because they have, as I have said, been excluded from the provisions of this Bill, and this is being done because of the special position of the personnel concerned and, indeed, it is a recognition of the paramount importance of the security of the State and the preservation of law and order.  Even if the Garda and Defence Forces were not to be excluded from the provisions of the Bill they still would not have the protection of the law for picketing.  In other words, the position would be more complicated.  It would need amendments to other Acts not covered here, and I do not believe that a further delay in passing this amendment would be helpful or in anybody's interest. I have a lot of sympathy for the point being made by Deputy Desmond on their representation or a platform for representation. As the Deputy knows, there are problems too.  It is not easy but I share that view.  I would like to see a situation developing where they would have a forum where they could not only make their views known but indeed, were part of decision-making machinery.  This is an irritant that in their case is of some concern.  I support what we are doing in the Bill but I have some sympathy in the other area, despite difficulties as to how best we might overcome the problems.</P>
    <P>I assured Deputy Lawlor already that <Col N="1643" /> I will spare no effort, no energy, no time in trying to achieve what I believe is a proper development, a code of practice, improved procedures, whatever ways forward are the right ones.  We must explore them all.</P>
    <P>Despite the difficulty that did arise the personnel of the Commission on Industrial Relations deserve to be complimented on the time and effort they put in and for the great and detailed consideration they gave and the excellence of the report provided.  There is a lot of food for thought there.  There are some points of consensus; there are contentious ones, but in the industrial relations area there will always have to be contentious points to be discussed and debated and decided on.  My wish and my preference, and I believe it is the only way forward, is that we would never have to have confrontation, that it would be consultation, discussion, conciliation &mdash; all that way forward&mdash;and this generation knows it, particularly the young people we have been speaking about.</P>
    <P>I could go on for longer but as Deputies have said it is a long-awaited amendment, a desirable amendment to the 1906 Act and we can make progress from here. Again I want to say how grateful I am to Deputy Keating, Deputy Desmond, Deputy Gallagher, Deputy Lawlor and Deputy Barrett for their contributions and their interest in this subject, and I would say to any of them that in the area of industrial relations I agree with those who say across the floor of the House, let us work together in the interests of our community and particularly of the young people.  Thank you.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask a brief question with respect to line 10?  It just occurred to me that the redefinition says, &ldquo;and the expression &lsquo;workmen&rsquo; means all persons employed&rdquo;, <i>et cetera</i>.  Perhaps this is too much of the amateur detective, but what is the position of persons who are no longer technically employed, who would be, for example, either on strike or let go?  Are there any circumstances in which somebody skilled in the art of the legal process could seek to interpret the word &ldquo;employed&rdquo; at the end of line 10 as meaning only those engaged in a job at that time?  Are persons who might be on strike or who might be locked out employed?  I would like to clear up that area because there may be a slightly grey area there in the eyes of some people.  It would be most unfortunate if we were to create by accident any grey area.  I hope the Minister sees the point I want to make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not blame the Deputy for asking that question considering the way the courts have really caused the problems that we are trying to deal with.  I do not want anybody to get me wrong and say that I am blaming the courts for doing it, because they in their wisdom have decided that the definition that did exist did not cover certain categories of people and probably deserve to be complimented on that.  I share the Deputy's concern.  I would not like to see a situation developing where somebody might decide who was employed or unemployed.  As far as we can establish that term &ldquo;persons employed&rdquo; does cover a person affected by a dispute.

      <P>Could I make another comment about the exclusions?  As a general rule I agree with those who say that we should try to ensure that the spirit of Article 40 of the Constitution, that is, that all the people shall be treated equally in the eyes of the law, should be the spirit of our legislation and, therefore, anything which excludes persons from a Bill in a sense has to be justified.  From that point of view in a sense it is regrettable that one has to include a reference like this.  There are those who say that they should get special attention in that area. The Minister made a point which was interesting that, in fact, it is not simply this Bill that is involved here.  That, possibly is justification for the inclusion, that it would involve a range of other legislation and that interference therefore with the section in that respect would hold the whole thing up, and certainly nobody would want to do that.  I just want to mention that very briefly as something that we could return to on some other occasion, that there would be some positive discrimination in favour of those who would be excluded in situations like this from recourse to the normal protection.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has a point that is of concern to me because everybody in this House shares respect and admiration for the Garda force and the Army.  One has to take into consideration the security of the State and there are problems in bringing in an amendment. Because of other legislation these bodies as these Acts stand at present could not avail of the immunity we are offering.  For that reason rather than complicating this further we are taking a step forward.  I share the Deputy's sympathies towards them and Deputy Desmond talked about the desire of the representative bodies of the Garda to gain recognition on some forum such as the national pay talks or the national understanding. There are difficulties in that <Col N="1646" /> area and I am very well disposed towards finding a solution and seeing what can be done.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> I expect that the external balance position in 1982 will show an improvement on the outturn for 1981.  This expectation is supported by the recovery in agricultural exports and the rapid growth in industrial exports in recent months, as well as by the favourable development now emerging in export prices relative to import prices. The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible at this early stage to forecast the extent of the likely improvement by end-year because of the difficulty in quantifying the impact of the many factors which will influence the flow of trade and payments over the remainder of the year.</P>

      <P>The OECD are an impartial body who get their information on matters of this kind from the Government Departments.  How can the Minister reconcile his statement with the OECD report published two days ago which shows no reduction?  It shows no reduction because, although there is some improvement in exports, the whole of that benefit is taken up by increased payments connected with the external debt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

Their information is not completely up-to-date. It is only in recent months that there has been an improvement in industrial and agricultural exports.  It is possible that the OECD report may be somewhat out-of-date.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to improve those financial procedures which come within my competence as Minister for Finance. It is intended that information to facilitate a better appraisal of public expenditure will be made available in the context of the 1983 public expenditure documentation. The format of this information is still being developed.</P>
      <P>While I would hope to present the Estimates earlier than has been the practice, Deputy Bruton will appreciate the difficulties in doing this.  Other proposals being considered concern improvements in the timetable for presentation of budgetary documentation to the Dáil, the development of Government accounting practices, the reporting and accounting arrangements of State-sponsored bodies and the information provided on the Public Capital Programme.</P>
      <P>The question of reforming the financial procedures of the Dáil is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and has been before that committee for some time.  I hope the new committee will give the matter urgent attention.</P>
      <P>As to the discussion paper published by the previous Government&mdash;in which I appreciate Deputy Bruton when Minister for Finance took a keen personal interest&mdash;the proposals therein are being reviewed in the light of the public response.  I am not yet however in a position to indicate the extent to which the proposals will be implemented, except where they coincide with those mentioned above.</P>

I should like the Minister to state specifically if he accepts in principle that the Estimates for expenditure should be presented to the Dáil in the year previous to that in which the expenditure is to be incurred and should be discussed and <Col N="1659" /> sanctioned by the Dáil at that time rather than when the money has been spent, as is the case at present?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that, rightly or wrongly, the public feel &mdash; particularly in recessionary times &mdash; that a degree of comfort or amenity which in their eyes seems to be excessive is enjoyed by officeholders in several respects; that although there may be good reasons, particularly security reasons, for those amenities in some cases, there are all too many cases in which the public see no such reason and feel particularly resentful and are therefore that much less co-operative with the State whichever side is in or out?  Therefore would the Minister not agree that this whole matter deserves very urgent attention in order to produce a more modest appearance personally on the part of whatever Government are in office?</P>

        <i>(Clare):</i> There are a number of factors involved in this question. On the question of (1) service provided for Ministers and Ministers of State, I should say there is a vast difference between living in Dublin, as Deputy Kelly does, and living over 150 miles from Dublin as I do, particularly when one realises that a car of which one has the use could be doing in excess of 60,000 miles per year.  If a person is obliged to drive that number of miles, and endeavour to do a reasonably good job with regard to a Department, or wherever he may be I do not think it is physically <Col N="1666" /> possible to do that.  As one who drove that distance himself for many years as a backbencher I know what it can take out of a person.  Therefore it is not an unreasonable service to have.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is some room for rationalising the system without having to use less convenient modes of travelling the distance he speaks of and in which I entirely sympathise with him in his position? Would there be not some case for demonstrating to the Public that some economy was being practised, even on this front, while quite accepting that there are dimensions, particularly security dimensions, which may necessitate an escort?

I asked the Taoiseach a couple of weeks ago about a retinue, I can only call it such, of 14 persons who accompanied him to a Disarmament Conference at the United Nations, and I mean no disrespect to him when I say that no one in this House can now remember what he said at that conference or whether it would have made any difference to anybody had it remained unsaid.

I do not say that anybody deliberately abuses them but that is too much money to spend on accompanying a Minister, even if it is the Taoiseach, on an occasion of that kind.  Would he not accept also that there is a case to be made for the Department of Finance setting certain standards which are transparently fair and reasonable, and not leave it to the discretion of an officeholder to take along whoever he likes or whoever is wished on him &mdash; and it is frequently the initiative of his officials rather than the officeholder which produces these immense entourages?</P>

      <P>I would be very grateful for that.  In his rather comprehensive question, Deputy Kelly, in regard to paragraph (d) asked the Minister the numbers of civil service staff in Ministers' offices engaged principally in political work relating to Ministers' constituencies. May I ask the Minister whether he can give us any information on that?  Is it a fact that as many as 24 civil servants, in some cases, are engaged on constituency work for Ministers? Is this not a matter in respect of which the Departments of Finance and of the Public Service could lay down standards as we do not have the same problem here that we have in regard to conferences held abroad?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> The number of people recruited to a Department for that purpose is a matter for the public service. The Minister for the Public Service has to sanction any further recruitment, just as in the case of the civil service at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The question here is not the recruitment of people but the deployment of people within a Government Department, when a Government may change and when a Minister might not previously have had anybody engaged on constituency work &mdash; as I know was the case in at least one instance &mdash; and a new Minister who comes in takes 24 people from other work in his Department and puts them onto constituency work.  Does that not require standards to be applied?  Could the Departments of Finance and of the Public Service not apply themselves to that and make proposals to regulate what appears to have been an abuse, particularly in cases where there is a completely safe seat and there is not even a political objective to be gained by it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, this has been an excellent Question Time in my judgment.  I put this question originally to the Taoiseach as Head of the Government.  He just passed the ball to the Minister present. I am now asking the Minister, who the Taoiseach thinks is the right man to answer this question, since finance is what we are at here and trying to save money, would he agree that circumstances which emerged here last week where Deputy McEllistrim told us that ten officials, and I hope I am not doing him an injustice, were added to the staff of his own personal office &mdash; I hope I am recalling that correctly &mdash; and a similar number to the office of the Minister in chief in the Department of Fisheries and Forestry for no other purpose, as far as any Member was able to elicit, than to deal with constituency correspondence?  Surely the Department over which the Minister partly presides has a responsibility and an interest in this matter?  Surely this cries out for regulation and cries out for an iron hand?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> With regard to the question of the ten or 12, as I can recall it was not clarified if they were to be involved in his personal work, meaning constituency work.  It is possible to have a number of people attached to any Minister's office to deal with matters that come in from Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and many other people. It is possible that those people are involved in that work also as well as the work the Deputy has referred to.</P>

        <i>(Clare):</i> As I indicated in my reply of Wednesday, 9 June 1982, the total outlay by the Exchequer and the Central Bank in respect of repayment of depositors in Irish Trust Bank Limited was £2,863,984.  It is expected that the Central Bank's outlay of £988,705 will be recovered in full from the proceeds of the winding-up. It is not possible to say yet what the total repayment to the Exchequer will be.  As I pointed out in my reply of 9 June, £142,864 has been paid over to date to the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>As the liquidator has claimed £1 million for his services in the winding up of this company, is it not extraordinary that the Minister can reply to a question from me asking what his fees will be by simply stating that it was not his responsibility, particularly in view of the fact that the House is responsible for making payments to people who lost money in the Irish Trust Bank?  Is the Minister not responsible for the money that is being paid out by the liquidator or is being claimed by him for his services?</P>

        <i>(Clare):</i> When a liquidator goes into any firm he is in sole charge of it.  The purpose in going in is to liquidate the assets in order to try to redeem some of the debts which are outstanding, and whether it is 5p or 10p at the end of the day he must deduct all costs involved in the liquidation procedures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that the liquidator is being paid £1 million for winding up a company with assets of £4 million and liabilities of £6½ <Col N="1672" /> million.  It seems extroardinary that the House in the past decided to make up the losses of people who speculated on high interest rates and that now the Minister, in the course of a reply to a question tabled by me on 30 June, states that the matter of the cost of the liquidation process is for the liquidator only and that the Minister does not have any official responsibility to the Dáil in relation to that.  If the Dáil is responsible for paying money out for losses by the Irish Trust Bank I cannot see why the Minister does not have responsibility to the Dáil for the £1 million which the liquidator is claiming for his work in relation to the disposal of the assets.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> The Minister does not have any responsibility for a liquidator who goes into any firm.  A liquidator is put in by creditors and accepted by them.  He is in charge of the operation from that time until he winds up the firm and satisfies as many creditors as he can to the extent he can.  The figure of £1 million has been mentioned as being the liquidator's fees but that may cover many people because of the type of firm that was involved.  I do not know, but in my view the investigation required by the liquidator involved checking all the activities of the firm and that could eat into a lot of that fee.  I have the figures but I do not have any breakdown of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that with the permission of the House.  In relation to section 3, Deputy De Rossa withdrew on Committee an amendment which would have the effect of extending to single parents, including widowed parents with dependants the married tax bands.  I indicated that I would have to oppose this amendment on the grounds of cost and, in any event, it would, in my opinion, probably have been unconstitutional in the light of the Supreme Court judgment on the Murphy case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa asked me to look again at the matter to see if the constitutional difficulty could be resolved.  I must stand by my earlier viewpoint.  On grounds of cost, as I have said already, I would have to oppose any such amendment <Col N="1732" /> at this time.  In the short time available I have not had an opportunity of finding a solution to the constitutional difficulty but I will look at this matter further.</P>
    <P>The Deputy drew my attention to the fact that single parents are treated on the same basis as married persons as regards allowances.  This is true in the sense that while they have only the single personal allowance they also have a single parent allowance equal to the single personal allowance which adds up to the equivalent of the married allowance.  I feel, however, that this arrangement cannot be adapted readily to give the same effect in relation to tax bands.</P>
    <P>I will look again at the point raised by the Deputy in the context of next year's budget.  If the difficulties, which I have raised, can be resolved I will be prepared to move along the lines which he proposes. I thank the Chair and the House for giving me the liberty to say that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will extend equivalent co-operation in respect of some of the amendments.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;(1)  Nothwithstanding anything in the Tax Acts, income derived by way of interest on savings to a bona fide group water scheme shall be exempt from tax for the year 1982-83 and subsequent years of assessment.</P>
      <P>(2)  For the purpose of this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>a &ldquo;bona fide group water scheme&rdquo; shall mean only a scheme registered as a group water scheme within the meaning of the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1978;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;savings&rdquo; shall mean only money invested for the sole purpose of completing a group water scheme or maintaining such a scheme.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is concerned with the problem, which I raised on Committee Stage, whereby group water schemes in rural areas, which are concerned with a very valuable social service and many would <Col N="1733" /> argue are undertaking responsibilities which, if they were not undertaken in a co-operative fashion by the people concerned in the schemes using some of their own money, would ultimately fall to be met entirely by the Exchequer in the form of State supported water schemes for rural areas.  I believe all sides of the House agree that group water schemes are a good example of a positive aspect of development and self-help in the country. It was, therefore, with some shock that I learned earlier this year, after I ceased to be Minister for Finance, but in correspondence on behalf of a constituent with the Revenue Commissioners, that group water schemes, co-operatives registered in many cases under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, and, therefore, bodies incapable of making a profit in the conventional sense, have actually income tax levied on them in relation to group water schemes.</P>
    <P>This income tax liability occurs in very specific circumstances.  These circumstances are where the co-op have raised money from the members, who will avail of the proposed water supply, to pay the group share of the cost of the service.  As we all know, there are bound to be delays from the time the money is originally collected to the time when the actual scheme goes ahead.  These delays can occur for any number of reasons.  They can occur as a result of delays in the Department of the Environment or lack of funds there.  They can occur for technical reasons where it may transpire that more surveys in regard to the nature of the terrain over which the water is to be supplied are necessary than were anticipated at the time the money was being raised.  There are inevitable delays and the money has to be lodged somewhere. The usual place to lodge the money is in a bank.</P>
    <P>If the group get interest on that money in the bank under the present law they are liable to pay income tax on that interest, even though, as we all know, the rate of interest is actually less than the rate of inflation.  Any interest the group are receiving is doing no more than maintaining the real value of the money raised in the first place.  It is clearly anomalous and <Col N="1734" /> undesirable that income tax should be levied at all on interest received by these groups.  Some might argue that it is possible that if we were to exempt income in the form of interest to group water schemes from income tax, this mechanism might be used as a means of evading tax by people who would abusively set up a so-called group water scheme as a tax dodge which would not, in fact, be a group water scheme in the normal sense.</P>
    <P>I have very specifically drafted this amendment.  The Minister will note that I have improved on the terms of the amendment from that which was considered on Committee Stage.  I have made it clear that a bona fide group scheme means only a scheme registered as a group water scheme within the meaning of the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1978.  Those Acts are administered by the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism and he and the registrar of industrial and provident societies have a clear responsibility and mandate to ensure that any body which registers under those Acts is one which is engaged in bona fide co-operative purposes and this mechanism, therefore, should be capable of being prevented by means of the machinery available to the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism from being used as a tax dodge.</P>
    <P>I have added the words that &ldquo;savings&rdquo; may mean only money invested for the sole purpose of completing a group water scheme or maintaining such a scheme.  If, for instance, the group water scheme collects more money than is necessary for the completion of the group water scheme, it shall not be exempt from income tax on interest on any money which is in excess of the amount that is necessary for the completion of the group water scheme.  Deputy Brennan contributed to this debate on Committee Stage and made the point that more money than was necessary for the actual work would be collected and when the group scheme was finished it could be distributed and, in the meantime, no tax would have been paid on the interest. Clearly, that is not what I would wish to happen and therefore I have drafted the amendment specifically to exclude that <Col N="1735" /> possibility.  I believe this is a valuable amendment in terms of recognition of the importance of the work of group water schemes and one which I hope the Minister will be able to accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was discussed on Committee Stage and I indicated at that time that I could not accept the proposal to exempt from tax interest from savings arising to group water schemes.  The reasons for the decision were also outlined but I will now re-state the position for the benefit of the House. We are all in agreement that the cost in terms of tax foregone of granting exemption on the lines suggested would be negligible. It is not the cost factor which precludes me from agreeing to this amendment but the consequences that would result from the granting of such an amendment.  The granting of concessionary treatment in relation to investment income of group water schemes would, undoubtedly, prompt innumerable requests for similar treatment from bodies engaged in a wide range of worthwhile projects.  It will be contended that group water schemes are a special case but a similar plea may be anticipated from many other groups who regard themselves as being engaged in worthwhile undertakings which are equally deserving of special tax treatments.  Examples of such bodies are residents' associations, swimming pool committees, voluntary bodies caring for under-privileged citizens and so on.  It would be very difficult to justify refusals in such cases if exceptional treatment was to be conceded in the present case.  Furthermore, it is probable that concessionary treatment could be abused by the establishment of bodies which, while nominally being set up as group water schemes would, in reality, be vehicles for tax avoidance for the benefit of members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exemption enjoyed by agricultural and fishery societies was touched upon in the course of the Committee Stage debate.  It was asked why should group water schemes be liable to tax on their deposits if agricultural co-operatives were exempt.  Income and losses attributable <Col N="1736" /> to defined exempted transactions of agricultural and fishery co-operative societies are disregarded for tax purposes. The relevant legislation is contained in section 18 of and the Second Schedule to the Finance Act, 1978.  Interest or investment income is not exempt in the case of such societies.  To grant exemption in the case of the group water schemes would conflict with the treatment accorded to agricultural and fishery co-operatives and would lead once again to calls for its extension to cover those societies.</P>
    <P>One further aspect of this question which should not be overlooked is that the granting of exemption on the lines proposed could give rise to avoidance possibilities.  If group water schemes were exempted from tax in respect of interest on savings, it would be open to members of these societies to transfer their savings from their own savings accounts and reinvest them in those societies, thereby avoiding liability on the interest.  Having carefully considered this whole question, I am convinced that to accede to the proposal would not be a wise course of action.  In view of the problems to which I have already referred, I would prefer to see group water schemes investing any surplus funds in tax free securities.</P>

      <P>I am naturally disappointed that the Minister has not been able to meet the proposal I made.  He said that a similar plea might be made by other bodies such as residents' associations and voluntary bodies concerned with the under-privileged.  I would not consider residents' associations to be in the same category as group water schemes.  Residents' associations are primarily concerned with pressuring others to provide public services whereas group water schemes are actually engaged in providing public services.</P>

      <P>I have already dealt adequately with the points made by the Minister in regard to avoidance possibilities.  I believe that the amendment, as re-drafted by me between Committee and Report Stages, eliminates the possibility of avoidance to which he has referred.  In view of the Minister's rejection of this amendment on the only valid ground he has adduced, that it will create a precedent where other equally worthy bodies might make a similar case, and in view of the fact that money is not plentiful at present, would he have a general look at the liability of what are purely charitable bodies to income tax and see if he could consider a more generous scheme to encourage voluntary organisations?</P>

      <P>In page 12, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(v)  by 10 per cent. per annum for each year of ownership of the car.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put the amendment on this subject on Committee Stage and the Minister pointed out that there was a lot more expense to it than I had intended: if it had been passed it would have eliminated almost entirely the revenue from the section, which was not my intention.  My intention was simply to provide a small reduction on the value of a car as calculated for the purposes of deciding the extent of the benefit in kind each year so as to remove what I believe to be an artificial incentive in the present system not to retain cars and to keep buying new cars, because they are taxed on the benefit in kind derived from a car that is perhaps two years old on exactly the same basis as if that car was still a new car.  So <Col N="1738" /> obviously if they are going to be taxed on the same basis as if it was a new car they might as well have a new car and get rid of the old one rather than keep it on. From a number of points of view this is undesirable.  It is undesirable from the point of view of the balance of payments because the more new cars we import the worse is our balance of payments deficit. It is undesirable from an employment point of view because the longer cars are retained the more employment is given in the motor repair industry to Irish people, whereas the more older cars are dispensed with and replaced by new cars the more employment is given outside the country to manufacturers of new cars practically none of whom are in existence here.  It is merely to remove what I believe to be a basically unintentional anomaly in the system that gives an artificial incentive to people to buy new cars rather than retaining cars that I am putting forward this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand Deputy Bruton correctly his argument is really an argument for people keeping their cars much longer and by doing that they will get better tax benefits.  That is a dubious argument in lots of ways because, while there are all sorts of people who would benefit if people keep their cars, there are also a lot of people who will lose out if cars are not changed more often.  It is very much a balance sheet type of judgment and one which I would be very slow to make myself in any hard way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction sought by Deputy Bruton is 10 per cent on the 20 per cent every year which would be 18 per cent after one year, 2 per cent per annum approximately. Frankly, the rate at which motor car prices increase under all Governments over quite a period would mean that the sums involved would not be worthwhile.  I know what is in Deputy Bruton's mind.  He is obviously trying to take account of the depreciation of a car, assuming that is way below its original cost price.  But at the rate at which prices tend to increase one could not say positively that the cost price or depreciated price would be that much different over <Col N="1739" /> the years.  So there is no real point in making this change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just one small point.  While the first amendment was wrongly phrased, this is correctly phrased with the exception of one word in it, &ldquo;ownership&rdquo;.  The recipient of the benefit in kind is not the owner; it is a company car.  It would refer to the use of the car rather than ownership of the car if it was possible to do it.  Notwithstanding that, I have to say that the amendment proposes that the value for tax purposes of the cash equivalent of the benefit of the use of the car, as set out in section 4(3)(a), be reduced by 10 per cent for each year of ownership.  As the cash equivalent is defined as 20 per cent of the original market value of the car, the amendment proposes in effect that the cash equivalent, as Deputy Brennan has said, will be reduced by 2 per cent of the original market value of the car for each year of ownership.  The amendment is presumably designed to take account of the fact that if a car ages its current market value would be less than its original market value.  The proposal is unnecessary because due to inflation in car prices the cash equivalent will reflect the fact that the car was purchased several years previously without any express provision to that effect.  The purchase price of a particular make of car would have been considerably less three or four years ago than the purchase price of a car of the same make now and 20 per cent of its original purchase price would also be considerably less than 20 per cent of the price of a new car of the same make. Also, the price of cars is increasing by at least 15 per cent annually.  This produces a strong bias towards retaining an old car. Deputy Bruton's amendment increases that bias by a mere two percentage points, but at the expense of loss of revenue amounting to £.5 million in 1982, £1 million in 1983 and £3 million in a full year.  I could not accept it.  The number of persons affected is estimated at about 50,000 in a full year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>I am very surprised at <Col N="1740" /> the very high cost that the Minister has put on this amendment.  I had not thought it would cost that much at all.  I saw it as a very modest allowance for the depreciation value of the car.  In view of the substantial cost which the Minister has told me is involved I do not intend to press this amendment.  But I do not accept the Minister's argument that the fact that cars are increasing by 15 per cent in value each year is sufficient incentive to people to retain older cars.  It is the case that there is an undue tendency here to renew cars and the amendment that I put down here was not one which was put down off the top of my head.  The amendment came as a result of consultations I had with people who are in one of the substantial accountancy firms in this city who are advising people on how to minimise their tax liability.  They were of the the impression, from their intimate experience of the way in which this system works, that the proposals the Minister now has will create an undue bias in favour of the purchase of new cars.  So, while I am withdrawing the amendment at this stage, I would say that the Minister or whoever is in his office in the next year or two should look very closely at this subject on a continuing basis.  I am sure that in the event of an amendment being devised which was going to prevent an artificial encouragement of the sale of older cars, it could be done without any cost simply by raising the calculation rate in regard to new cars to a higher level and compensating for the extra costs by reducing it in respect of older ones.  There is always a way around such a problem without any cost if there is a wish to solve that problem.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 17, to delete lines 31 and 32, and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(i)  at any time during the year of assessment he was the age of 65 years or upwards or if under the age of 65 years he was at any time during the year of assessment in receipt of a <Col N="1741" /> taxable income (after deductions of normal allowances) of less than £600 per annum, and&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is the last in the long-running saga of amendments designed to achieve an extension of rent relief in respect of income tax to people on low incomes.  I had an amendment on Committee Stage which provided that if people had taxable income, after the deduction of normal allowances, of less than £1,000 per year they would qualify for the same tax relief in respect of rent that is available to people over the age of 65.  I am advised that because the words which this and other amendments proposed to delete were resolved by this House to stand, the Ceann Comhairle ruled that the matter has been decided and cannot be the subject of an amendment on Report Stage. Therefore, although I would prefer to have a taxable allowance here of £1,000, I am forced by the rules of procedure to introduce a lesser figure of £600 which is not as generous as I would wish but which costs even less than the amendment I proposed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We have spent the whole day debating the merits of extending to people on low incomes the benefits of the rent relief which is being made available to those over the age of 65.  I believe there is a strong case for such an extension because generally those who are living in rented accommodation are the least well-off section. Those who have resources of their own usually provide a house of their own but those who have no resources are forced to avail of rented accommodation. Generous tax allowances on mortgage interest are given to those who provide their own homes through the use of borrowed funds but no allowance whatever against income tax is given to those who pay each week substantial rents for housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposing to extend relief to people in rented accommodation will help to identify many landlords who are not paying tax on the rent they receive.  It will provide a mechanism whereby the identity of the person to whom a tenant is paying rent will come <Col N="1742" /> to the knowledge of the Revenue Commissioners. It is therefore, likely that significant sums will be raised in income tax on income which up to now has not been declared for tax.  This significant gain will stand against the cost that will obviously flow from the implementation of this amendment.</P>
    <P>The provision of income tax relief for rent payments has been an article of policy of my party since June 1981.  It was our original intention to extend this allowance to all people in rented accommodation. We found, coming up to the January budget, that funds were not available on a sufficient scale to do this, so we decided to extend that allowance to people aged more than 65.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory has put forward a formula in regard to taxable income which is capable of being adjusted to ensure that relief is given only to those who have a low income.  That mechanism and the proposals made by Deputy Gregory have convinced most of us that there is a strong case for extending this relief to people with exceptionally low incomes.  I am, therefore, putting forward this amendment. In fairness to the Minister, it must be said that he did not reject in principle any of the amendments put forward.  He said that this proposal could not be afforded this year but that without commitment he would look at the matter between Committee Stage and Report Stage.</P>
    <P>A reasonable argument put forward in regard to all the amendments was that there was no provision for marginal relief.  This means that a person with a taxable income of, say, £1,000, might get relief worth £250 but a person earning £1,001 would get no relief whatever and because of earning £1 more would lose relief worth £250.  This is the problem which arises when there is no provision for marginal relief, but I have provided a mechanism for it in amendment No. 4. I do not wish to go into detail as to how this marginal relief will work, beyond saying that the mechanism is derived from sections of previous Finance Acts enacted by this House with the best advice of the parliamentary draftsman designed to achieve this result in other <Col N="1743" /> areas.  The Minister can be assured that the amendment is reasonably well drafted because it is drafted, indirectly at least, by his own advisers.</P>
    <P>I think I have overcome the major objection raised by the Minister.  I do not have available an actual costing of this amendment but I imagine that it would not cost any money this year, somewhere in the region of £2 million in 1983 and perhaps £3 million in a full year.  I am sure the Minister will be able to give more accurate figures than those rough estimates. It is not a matter of significant cost.  This amendment will help those who are worst off in terms of their social position.  During the long hours spent discussing this subject we have all been concerned about doing something about the problem.  My amendment represents a reasonable consensus of the views expressed here, although it is much less generous than some Members would wish and less than I would have wished, for procedural reasons which I have already explained.  I hope that it is an amendment which the Minister can accept as a reasonable reflection of the wishes of this House, to which he, as are we all, is responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a lengthy debate on this section.  This amendment is the last in a long line of what might be termed a dutch auction in reverse.  We started with something over £4,000 and are now down to £600.  Any relief which can be obtained for those in the hands of private landlords would be welcomed although, in my view, the relief received by the tenant, whether well off or poor, will eventually land in the pocket of the landlord, purely and simply because rents set are not controlled in any way except by the money which is available to pay them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It goes without saying that after a few months landlords will raise their rents to suit the ability of their tenants to pay and if the tenant cannot pay the landlord will shift him or her out and find someone who can.  This relief may bring about even greater harassment of tenants.  In some cases landlords are now changing their <Col N="1744" /> tenants three times a year to avoid being reported to the tax office with regard to collection of rent.  It is essential that this House, at an early stage, look at the whole question of control of rents of private accommodation, establish rent tribunals for all types of private rented dwellings and provide security of tenure. As regards local authority housing, the only ground on which a tenant can be evicted is non-payment of rent.  There are no grounds at all on which eviction can be refused to a private landlord.</P>
    <P>The only good point about the present amendment is that it might rope a few more landlords into the tax net, but given that the tenant is at the mercy of the landlord, any hint of the reporting of the landlord to the tax office will mean short shrift for the tenant and notice to quit. More often than not the landlord in this case will not bother going through the courts and the tenant on coming home from work some evening will find his baggage outside the door.  This is quite illegal, but that does not prevent it from happening.  For that reason we are not at all satisfied that this section will provide the relief which it ulitmately sets out to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 is in the same terms as a number of amendments put down on Committee Stage by Deputies Gregory, Desmond and Bruton except that the taxable income limits for persons under 65 years is reduced from the taxable income limits in those amendments which were £4,500, £2,000, £1,000 and are now down to £600.  Amendment No. 4 aims at providing a form of marginal relief.  The cost of the proposed relief is estimated at £1½million in 1983 and £2½ million in the full year.  The number of persons who would benefit is estimated at 28,500.  If the taxable income of £600 were to apply in the case of a married couple under 65 years old, it would be necessary, because of the Murphy decision, to fix a taxable income of £300 for single persons.  In that instance the cost of the proposed relief is estimated at £0.8 million in 1983 and £1.3 million for a full year.  The number of persons who would then benefit is estimated at 22,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1745" /> The objections to the giving of relief subject to taxable income limits to persons under 65 years were explained on Committee Stage.  Briefly, again, they are: (1) end of year reviews would be required in all cases under PAYE; (2) provisions would have to be made to take account of the implications of the Murphy case and, accordingly, an income limit of £300 for single persons would have to be provided for; (3) the reference to the level of taxable income at any time during the year of assessment appears to imply that if the taxable income in any one week were below the weekly equivalent of £600, or £1,100 in amendment No. 4, relief would require to be given even though the person's taxable income for the year of assessment might exceed the limit of £600.  Such a system would be incapable of implementation.</P>
    <P>Marginal relief provisions in accordance with amendment No. 4 are complex and open to various interpretations.  Marginal relief should take the form of reducing the amount of allowance for rent by the excess of the taxable income over the taxable income limit of £600.  In other words, in the case of a married person with a taxable income of £1,200, the rent allowance of £1,000 would be reduced by £600, that is to £400.  The proposed amendment No. 4 would give no relief in such a case.</P>
    <P>We discussed this not only for days but over a period of two weeks and Deputy De Rossa has described the way the case developed from what, even in the first instance, was put down by Deputy Gregory and was a principle against which I would not attempt to argue, the principle behind assistance for this category of person. There is no doubt about it, something will have to be done in that area and soon.  We took on board exactly what was proposed by Deputy Bruton as Minister for Finance and his Government on 27 January.  That is the start.  As anybody around here with any experience knows, once a start is made in a case like this there will be pressures to move onwards, just as happened on the previous amendment today and earlier in relation to group water schemes &mdash; why not swimming pools, residents' associations, <Col N="1746" /> sports complexes, and community halls? The list can be endless.</P>
    <P>However, the start has been made in relation to this provision for those over 65 years of age.  That is a good start which is why I support it and it is now before us in the Bill.  I could not argue, or attempt to argue, against the principle involved in the first amendment put down, in this case, by Deputy Gregory.  I have no doubt that, as the months progress, very careful consideration will have to be given to the points made in relation to that principle.  I hope that by the time the next budget comes around, there will be some possibility of going some way towards meeting the needs of the various individuals and families who have been talked about during discussion of this item.  It is all right to do it for those aged over 65 years of age because then one is not involved with taxable income and so on.  The other situation would create all these anomalies about which we have been talking in the past few weeks.  Perhaps there is another way to do it.  We all know there has been a lot of discussion about it and so I shall not go into any more details on the reason why I cannot accept the amendment as proposed.</P>

      <P>We have spent a long time on this subject and on this section. I am not disappointed or annoyed about that because we have made a lot of progress, not in amending the Bill but in arriving at a general consensus that the whole question of rented accommodation and the difficulties arising therefrom is something which needs to be tackled by the House.  I am delighted that the Minister has said we must do it as soon as possible.  There is broad agreement that this question should be looked at in an overall way and not tucked into some Finance Bill by an amendment.  The rights of tenants, duties of landlords, the quality of rented accommodation and so on should be the subject of examination, investigation, review and legislation by the Government.  That is where we should be going as a result of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa that landlords will use this clause to increase rents further.  That would be one of the <Col N="1747" /> likely results if we went ahead with this amendment.  Since we have introduced it for persons over 65 years we can afford to wait and see if Deputy De Rossa's worst fears are realised.  Let us see how they get on before we extend it any further. I am pleased that the result of this long debate has led to a consensus that as politicians we must tackle the problem of rented accommodation especially for those on very low incomes.  To that extent the time spent on this has not been wasted even if an amendment has not been made.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton's amendment is a modest one giving relief to 28,500 families and individuals with the lowest taxable income in the state. The total cost would be £1½ million in 1983 and over £2 million in 1984.  The debate has been effective in that the financial dimensions of the amendments have been clearly outlined and we are acutely aware of the need for inter-action between landlord and tenant legislation and the Finance Bill.  It pinpoints the fact that we must have rent control statutory procedures and criteria, otherwise relief of this nature will be an incentive to landlords to reap the benefit of it.  However, that does not detract from the overall merit of the amendment.  If one does not start somewhere the pressures will never come on in the other directions.  I find a net balance of advantage in supporting an amendment of this nature.  We have considered the whole question exhaustively and have also considered a wide variety of alternatives.  Obviously the Minister cannot accept the amendment. By the third week of December all the innovations and the shape of the Finance Bill will be known and this is an area which the Minister may consider taking on board in the following year's budget. It is an area where productive parliamentary work can be done.</P>

      <P>The Minister could draft it so that it would conform to the Constitution if he wanted to.  As far as Deputy De Rossa's point about landlords benefitting from these proposals is concerned, I do not accept it.  If he thinks about it, he will not accept it either.  This relief is confined to those with low taxable incomes.  One would not know until the end of the year if a person is qualified or not.  A landlord looking at somebody asking for a flat will not know whether they are a type of person who will end up with taxable income of less than £6,000.  The person concerned may not know either. The only way advantage could be taken of the situation was if a landlord knew that a person qualified for relief.  There is a greater danger of landlords exploiting the situation in respect of people who are over 65 years of age because their position is known.  It is known they will qualify for relief.  In the case of my amendment there is no way of knowing simply by looking at a person whether they will qualify for the relief.  The landlord will not be in a position to exploit them.  The ability of a landlord to take advantage of the relief depends on supply and demand in the market.  One cannot say that if a general relief was given to everyone in some cases the landlord would not benefit. However, if that stops one from giving relief one would not give relief in respect of any activity.  Tax reliefs of all descriptions are passed on to people other than those to whom they were originally given.</P>

    <P>(ii)  Where an application is made under subparagraph (i), the Appeal Commissioners shall hear and determine the claim in like manner as an appeal made to them against an assessment to tax and all the provisions of the Income Tax Acts relating to such an appeal (including the provisions relating to the rehearing of an appeal and to the statement of a case for the opinion of the High Court on a point of law) shall apply accordingly with any necessary modifications.</P>
    <P>(6) (a)  Where at any time after the passing of this Act a payment is made on account of rent by a person (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as &lsquo;the tenant&rsquo;) who is entitled to relief under this section or who has reason to believe that he may be so entitled and at the time of such payment the tenant requests a receipt or acknowledgement of the payment, the person or body of persons beneficially entitled to the rent shall, within seven days from the date of the payment, give to the tenant a receipt or acknowledgement of that payment and, thereafter, in respect of any subsequent payment on account of rent to which that person or body of persons is beneficially entitled and which is made by the tenant, the person or body of persons shall, within seven days from the date of the payment, give to the tenant a receipt or acknowledgement of the payment, whether requested to do so or not.</P>
    <P>(b)  Any receipt or acknowledgement given pursuant to this subsection shall in writing and shall contain&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the name and address of the tenant,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1751" /> (ii)  the name and address of the person or body of persons giving the receipt or acknowledgement, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  the amount of the payment and the period in respect of which it is paid.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to give effect in principle to amendment No. 34b put down on Committee Stage by Deputy Gregory-Independent.  That amendment proposed that in order to prove entitlement to relief in respect of rent the tenant should disclose to the Revenue the name and address of his landlord and the names and addresses of the persons to whom he paid the rent.  I indicated during the debate on the amendment that I would be prepared to consider the matter and bring forward a suitable amendment on Report Stage.  The amendment now proposed is on the lines of the regulations which the Revenue Commissioners originally proposed to make under subsection (5) of the new section 142A of the Income Tax Act, 1967, inserted by section 5 of the Bill as soon as the Finance Bill became law.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes two additional subsections to the new section 142A.  The first new subsection sets out the basic information which a tenant will be obliged to furnish on making a claim for relief under the section.  The second new subsection places on a landlord the statutory obligation to give, when requested to do so, to a tenant of his who is entitled to relief under the section, or who has reason to believe that he may be so entitled, a receipt or acknowledgement in respect of rent paid by the tenant.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(b)  Landlords failing to comply with the provisions of subsection (5) (a) (iii) shall be guilty of an offence and be liable to a penalty of £1,000.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is simply to ensure that landlords will keep specified types of records in relation to those tenants who are entitled to the relief.  The intention here obviously is to tighten up and to ensure that as little evasion as possible takes place.  As I said earlier, this is an area where a great deal of evasion occurred.  One Deputy in the House put it as high as £200 million a year which landlords are failing to declare.  There is a need to ensure that landlords are registered. Dublin Corporation have a system whereby landlords are bound to register for various purposes but only a tiny minority of those who are supposed to do this in fact do so.  The reason the corporation give for not pursuing this registration is that they fear that it may reduce the amount of private rented accommodation available.  For that reason the consensus which Deputy Brennan spoke about earlier in relation to private rented accommodation needs to be broadened to take a look at the whole area of housing, building, local authority housing, the provision of rented accommodation to married people with children, single persons, young workers and so forth.  The amendment that I propose should be accepted as a start in trying to tie up some of the landlords at least in relation to the tax code.</P>

The Revenue Commissioners will also explore the possibility of increasing the <Col N="1753" /> penalty and extending it to other areas such as the failure of landlords to furnish receipts for rent paid.  I said &ldquo;increasing&rdquo; because under existing penalties it is about £800 but I am prepared to accept the £1,000 and we will look at the possibility of increasing that £800 to £1,000.</P>

There may well be circumstances in which the offence would be technically committed but the degree of responsibility would be such that the fine of £1,000 would be grossly disproportionate.  I know that the Minister has said that he accepts the principle.  Does he accept the fine of £1,000?</P>

No matter how much one objects to the concept of people being landlords, there are landlords in our system and they perform a function as long as we have a mixed economy.  They may well technically break the law in some instances without the degree of culpability which would require a mandatory fine of £1,000.  It is not clear to me whether it is a mandatory fine.</P>

It should be left to the judge who will hear all sides of the case to decide what fine to impose.  The legislature should not lay down this fine in all cases.  It is unusual that a mandatory fine is laid down.  The normal procedure in cases where fines were set in legislation is that a maximum fine is laid down, not a mandatory one. I am very puzzled why a mandatory fine is being set in this instance by the Minister.

In regard to keeping any of the laws relating to private rented accommodation there is a need for better policing of the regulations and the laws.  Probably very few people in this House have not had at least one experience of seeing houses which are broken down into single-room flats without fire escapes and possibly without a proper water supply or any thought given to how the people living in those houses will get out of them in case of fire. I know of two houses next door to each other where each room is a flat with a bottled gas heater and there is no fire escape in either house.  It is a death trap and the sooner we show that we are prepared to pursue landlords who are making large amounts of money out of private rented accommodation and to enforce the law in relation to accommodation, the records they should keep, fire hazards and so on, the better.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 25, between lines 34 and 35, to insert as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;13.&mdash;(1)  Section 2 of the Public Revenue and Consolidated Fund Charges Act, 1854 is hereby amended by the insertion after &lsquo;the net produce of all permanent taxes&rsquo; of &lsquo;and the amount of revenue foregone (in each case) to the Exchequer by way of the income tax reliefs as specified in section 13 (2)* of the Finance Act, 1982&rsquo;.</P>
      <P>(2)  The reliefs to which subsection (1)  of this section applies are as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  all income tax allowances (excluding those specified in section 2 of this Act);</P>
      <P>(b)  allowance for interest on loans, specifying the different categories of loans;</P>
      <P>(c)  allowance on health insurance premiums;</P>
      <P>(d)  allowance on insurance premiums;</P>
      <P>(e)  allowance for benefit-in-kind; and</P>
      <P>(f)  allowance for interest on savings in building societies, commercial banks, post office savings bank and other lending institutions;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment involves no cost.  It merely requires the Minister to give certain information about the loss to the Exchequer from various tax reliefs given. In the course of this debate on the Finance Bill, we have had extensive discussions on the fact that people who are well enough off to be able to claim tax relief get a greater benefit the higher their tax rate and the higher their income. People on an income which is so low that <Col N="1756" /> they cannot claim any tax relief get no benefit from these tax reliefs however laudable their purpose.</P>
    <P>I want to make a change in the financial accounts published each year.  To do so it is necessary to amend section 2 of the Public Revenue and Consolidated Fund Charges Act, 1854, to require the Minister to give information to this House every year on the amount of revenue lost by virtue of the following types of allowances: allowances for interest on loans, specifying the different categories of loans; allowances for health insurance premiums; allowances for insurance premiums; allowances for benefits in kind of all sorts; and allowances for interest on savings in building societies, commercial banks, post office savings banks and other lending institutions.</P>
    <P>All of these allowances can be availed of intrinsically by people who have a reasonably substantial income or, alternatively, a reasonable amount of savings. This amendment does not seek to withdraw any of these allowances.  Transparently it seeks to have stated each year in the House, in a document which is available to the public, exactly how much these reliefs are costing the Exchequer in terms of revenue not collected by the virtue of the fact that these reliefs operate.</P>
    <P>We have here, and I hope that in the future we will have to a greater and more effective extent, extensive discussions on Estimates of expenditure by the Exchequer. Revenue not collected by virtue of allowances is just as significant a cost, and is as much a matter which requires deliberate policy decisions, as Government expenditure.  By requiring a comprehensive statement to be made each year of the cost to the Exchequer in terms of revenue lost because of all these tax allowances I am providing, I hope, a base for informed public discussion on the appropriate levels of these allowances and whether they are achieving their purpose.</P>
    <P>Many of these allowances were introduced quite a long time ago to achieve a change in public behaviour at that time. When they were introduced probably they were eminently justifiable.  Of <Col N="1757" /> course, the change in public behaviour, whether it be in regard to savings or house building, or whatever it was that was sought to be encouraged, has already occurred.  Therefore, it is questionable whether the reliefs should continue indefinitely on the same basis, given that the conditions which justified their initial introduction may no longer exist. Because they are never consciously brought to our attention, and in particular because their cost is never consciously brought to our attention in any one place or in any one document, they are never considered in a comprehensive fashion.</P>
    <P>I am seeking to put that right by introducing this amendment to the Public Revenue and Consolidated Fund Charges Act, 1854.  This proposal is consistent with a proposal made by the previous Government in the White Paper entitled &ldquo;A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances&rdquo;.  I was glad to learn from the reply given by the Minister of State to a question today that broadly, but not in respect of this proposal, the Government are in agreement with that policy.  I hope the Minister will be able to accept the amendment which will not cost a single penny, but will provide in a comprehensive form valuable public information to enable us to discuss the structure of our taxation system in an informed and reasonable way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague, Deputy Bruton, on this amendment. There is a great deal of parliamentary ignorance of the ramifications of individual tax allowances.  I have been in the Dáil for some 14 years and it was in very recent years only that I managed to get some kind of a grip on how to get the information one needs if one is to have an informed opinion on taxation matters of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make a number of points.  The first and most important is the enormous and inordinate apparent secrecy about information.  This does not arise from any disposition on the part of the public service, the Revenue Commissioners or the staff of the Department of Finance to hide that information or to prevent politicians from having access to <Col N="1758" /> it.  A large number of politicians do not know how to go about getting the information, asking the appropriate questions and setting in train the appropriate mechanisms to have the detailed information made available to them.</P>
    <P>Successive Ministers for Finance adopted the view that, if they could win the argument based exclusively on the ignorance of the people on the opposite side, and get their Finance Bills and their budgets through on the basis that, because the people on the other side did not know they would not ask awkward questions, they were &ldquo;away on a hack&rdquo; in terms of achieving their political objectives.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commission staff, the staff of the Department of Finance and all other public servants associated with the collation of information of this nature are only too willing to assist politicians to the greatest possible extent, but the mechanism for having the information made available to the House and brought to the attention of the public at large does not exist.  Over the past five or six years I have been trying to draft parliamentary questions and flooding in a series of questions in the hope that, when I got the replies, I could digest them and shift out the gems of fresh information.  For these reasons I fully support Deputy Bruton's amendment.</P>
    <P>It will ensure that a political climate will develop in which those who are in receipt of benefits will be known as such, and those who are not in receipt of allowances, but would dearly wish to have some prospect of having parity of allowance, will know they are foregoing such allowances.  I ask the Minister to consider this point.</P>
    <P>This House is hidebound by outdated conventions in terms of considering matters of this nature.  We have a budget and Finance Bill every year and that is the end of the financial administration of this State.  We need Dáil committees, budgetary committees, finance committees and Members making recommendations to the Government and having the courage of their convictions to uphold those recommendations at budget time.  That would be a more constructive approach. <Col N="1759" /> The information outlined in Deputy Bruton's amendment should be provided. That procedure could be classified as a prospective parliamentary reform which is very urgently needed and it will be in the national interest for information of this kind to be made publicly available. We, the politicians, should inform our constituents of these allowances, their effects on income, poverty and deprivation and the lack of distribution of the general wealth of the country.  From what I have seen in this area over the years, it is obvious that there is an urgent need for fundamental structural reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The desire behind this amendment is to have the necessary information at regular intervals in one place.  I do not have any strong feelings against this amendment but I think a lot of this information is already available because successive Ministers have given such information in answer to Dáil questions and in published Government documents throughout the year.</P>
      <P>If the amendment innocently seeks to have a lot of information provided, I cannot see any major reason why it should not be provided from time to time as requested but I bow to the Minister's knowledge in regard to whether this is the precise way to do it.  I was pleased to hear the Minister of State say at Question Time that he would ask the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to undertake fairly urgently a review of the system of organising the financial debates and procedures of this House.  This statement was welcomed by all sides of the House. I trust that committee will get down to work on this matter which has become very urgent.  Since the foundation of the State there have been very few changes in our financial procedures, despite the fact that increasingly the role of the State in society and in the economy has expanded dramatically.  The procedures need to be updated and I am glad the committee are going to look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made the point earlier that we should not be debating Estimates during the period the money is being spent.  We should debate them as early as possible <Col N="1760" /> so that we can look forward to what we are about to spend rather than what has been spent.  Discussions of the Estimates tend to be used as an excuse for a major debate on the Department.  I am not sure that is what was originally intended.  I imagine the original intention was to examine each item in the Vote and to have a more professional consistent analysis of each item in the Estimate and to look at it in a more professional way, as befits a modern Parliament.</P>
    <P>As a number of Deputies have said, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is made up of Members of all sides of this House.  They should look at the procedures of the House, particularly financial procedures.  Were this House a company which had been in existence as long as this House, they would have updated their accounting, analysis and decision-making procedures or they would not have survived in the commercial world.</P>

      <P>This proposal is that details of the revenue foregone by virtue of various tax reliefs should be specified in the finance accounts.  Section 2 of the Public Revenue and Consolidated Fund Charges Act requires that the finance accounts shall be laid before Dáil Éireann by 30 June.  These accounts contain the detailed financial account of the Exchequer and give a breakdown of tax receipts paid into the Exchequer during the financial year in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no objection to publication of the costs of various reliefs as proposed by Deputy J. Bruton, but the most appropriate vehicle for publication would be the annual report of the Revenue Commissioners and not finance accounts. <Col N="1761" /> There is no necessity to provide any legislative requirement for publication of this information in the annual report. This can be arranged administratively and I will see that is done now the request has been made.</P>
    <P>Data on tax relief is accumulated on a tax year basis whereas the finance accounts are concerned with a financial year.  Also the finance accounts detail money actually paid into the Exchequer and this will not correspond directly with the accounts of the Revenue Commissioners. Therefore publication of the information sought by the Deputy in the finance accounts would not give the picture he wants.  What Deputy Bruton and others have been interested in is the cost figure for any particular tax year and this information can be got in the annual report of the Revenue Commissioners and I will undertake to ensure that this is done.</P>

      <P>In page 29, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>)  (i)  The Minister shall make regulations laying down, for the purposes of making a determination under paragraph (a) (i) of this subsection the specific detailed criteria by which a building may be considered to be one to which the said paragraph (a) (i) applies.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Every regulation made under this paragraph shall be laid before Dáil Éireann as soon as may after it is made, and if a resolution annulling the regulations is passed by Dáil Éireann within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which Dáil Éireann has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment derives from a concern I have and I am glad Deputy Brennan is present because I know he has an interest in the matter.  It concerns the decision that the Revenue Commissioners, as provided for in this Finance Bill, will be able to determine what is a building of scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic importance and once it is defined as coming within one or other of those categories it will be capable of receiving tax relief in respect of costs incurred in maintaining that building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am worried about is that the Revenue Commissioners will be set up, without any guidance from this House or in the form of regulations, as the arbiters of what is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest.  Some guidelines must be given to the Revenue Commissioners in <Col N="1763" /> the form of regulations which would be available to anyone interested in applying for this benefit as to the basis on which decisions will be made.  Some people will have a view that a certain item is of aesthetic value while others will hold that it has no aesthetic value whatever and the same can be said with regard to items of architectural significance.  It is all a matter of subjective judgment.  Yet, the Revenue Commissioners will have to make the decision about whether they will give a tax relief in one instance and not give it in another instance.  I do not think it right that any public body should be able to make decisions affecting the tax liability of one person on something as nebulous as the wording in the Bill which uses the words &ldquo;intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest&rdquo;.  In my view aesthetics are intrinsically subjective and are not capable of being expressed in legislative form without some guidelines as to the practice that will be adopted.  I agree that probably there could be some objective agreement about what is of historical significance.</P>
    <P>I am not proposing that we do away with the concession but I am asking that we give the Minister power to make regulations that will govern the way the Revenue Commissioners will use their powers under this section.  Otherwise disputes will arise: people will claim the Revenue Commissioners are being boorish in not accepting a particular building as being of aesthetic importance while accepting that another building is of aesthetic importance.  If there are regulations laid down by the Minister and approved by this House setting out the criteria on which the Revenue Commissioners will operate, there will be less basis for argument.</P>
    <P>In the interest of the smooth administration of this valuable concession there is a need to make some general regulation so that it can be reasonably interpreted. I am not proposing we should make the regulations in this House.  It would take too long and probably we would not reach a consensus in the time available. However, I believe the Minister should <Col N="1764" /> be given the power to make regulations in this respect, regulations that would be approved subsequently by the House, so that there will be an objective basis on which the Revenue Commissioners will make their decisions.</P>

      <P>The determination of what constitutes a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest involves a judgment of an essentially subjective character.  The criteria which may be applied by experts in making such determination are not amenable to precise definitions.  Each building or garden is unique and doubtless it will have its own intrinsic worth in the eyes of those on whom the Revenue Commissioners must rely for the making of such determinations.</P>
      <P>Similar problems have to be contended with in relation to exemption for artists under section 2 of the Finance Act, 1969, which speaks of &ldquo;an original and creative work having cultural or artistic merit&rdquo;. No attempt was or could be made to set down in relation to that section absolute criteria by means of regulations and any attempt to do so would probably be resisted by all persons involved in the cultural and artistic area.  Accordingly, no purpose would be served by taking power to make regulations under the section as proposed in Deputy Bruton's amendment.</P>

      <P>This is a departure and already we have proposed two pages of laws governing it.  Considering that we have those two pages, it might be more prudent to see how we get on with them before we try to tighten up matters further. We may tighten up things so much that we outsmart ourselves and do not allow the section to do what it was intended to do.  The section uses the words &ldquo;significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest&rdquo;.  If we go beyond that and tie the hands of the Revenue Commissioners or those who will make the decision, it could have the opposite effect to what is intended.  The guidelines and regulations might be so tight as to defeat the purpose of introducing <Col N="1765" /> the relief in the first place, which is to improve the condition of significant buildings in the country.</P>
      <P>My comment on the amendment is not that it is wrong but it is somewhat premature. We should see how we get on with the present definition.  To an extent we should give the Revenue Commissioners their head on this.  If necessary next year or the following year if we find it necessary to do so, we could tighten up on the definition of &ldquo;scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest&rdquo;.  In my view we should see how we get on with the section in the meantime.</P>

I was worried that there could be unnecessary disputes about this matter.  I hope that in practice the Revenue Commissioners will issue some guidelines as to the way they will operate the provision, even if the guidelines are not ones that have legislative effect.  Perhaps they could issue a brochure setting out in general terms the way in which they will interpret the provisions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to give force to a point I was making on Committee Stage.  I am <Col N="1766" /> very anxious that this tax relief for heritage and other dwellings in which I very strongly believe, should not be confined to the mansions that have been regarded traditionally as being heritage homes from the conventional point of view of that subject.  I am very anxious that a wide cross-section of all types of dwelling of the Irish people of the past be preserved and that must include the most modest dwellings, mudwall cottages, single-room or double-room cottages, outbuildings, industrial buildings and so on.  Obviously, not all of these will be preserved but we should preserve a cross-section of the whole range of our material heritage.  We must not preserve merely the examples of the type of life enjoyed by those who happened to be best off in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. To preserve only that segment, though it may have greater richness in terms of physical appearance, would be to give a jaundiced view of history to the younger generation of our people.  That is why I believe this tax relief should be used to quite a large extent in helping to preserve also our small, modest houses. The amendment does not seek to restrict what is provided already but simply requires that included under the heading of buildings that may be preserved are industrial buildings, farm buildings and small cottages.  I am not concerned greatly about the use of that wording.  It may have some element of rural bias to the extent of the use of the term &ldquo;cottages&rdquo; but I would hope that the Minister would find it possible to accept the amendment.  This would give a proper direction to the Revenue Commissioners to look in a broad sense at what is our heritage rather than approaching the situation in the rather narrow sense that might be dictated sometimes by what is purely artistic.</P>

      <P>Regarding amendment No. 11 which seeks to bring within the ambit of the relief industrial buildings, farm buildings and small cottages, the term &ldquo;cross-section&rdquo; is incapable of precise application to such buildings and represents a serious departure from the legislation as conceived.  The original relief was intended to assist the preservation of buildings which have merit in themselves and were not really selective representatives of a larger body of buildings of similar type.  Any encroachment into this area raises the difficulty of justifying to people owning buildings of a similar type why their buildings were being excluded from the relief.  In the case of industrial buildings and of farm buildings in current use the normal expenses of maintenance, repair and restoration are allowable within the terms of the general income tax law.  The section as framed would not exclude from relief a building of the type mentioned in the amendment which has of itself significant scientific, historic cultural or aesthetic interest.</P>

My interpretation of the Minister's reply is that it will mean that we will have a situation in which the only dwellings that will be preserved as a result of this relief will be the big houses.

      <P>In page 35, line 41, to delete &ldquo;before the 6th day of April, 1985,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall be brief about this.  First of all, I should like to thank the Minister for his willingness at least to sit back and examine the points I was making here yesterday evening.  I should like to thank him for making available to me officials of his Department with whom I discussed the matter briefly and with whose assistance &mdash; though naturally they did not commit him to anything &mdash; I put down the amendment. Its object, as I explained yesterday, is to free from the trap in which they feel they have been quite innocently caught probably a very small number of persons who, in reliance on the words of the budget statement, on the words of the document entitled <i>Principal Features of the Budget</i> which normally accompanies a budget statement and, after having made specific inquiries, in reliance on the statement which the Minister's own office put out, were led to suppose that a mortgage taken out before the end of the last financial year, notwithstanding that the purpose of the loan was for the purchase of a residence other than a principal residence in the case I mention, a holiday or <Col N="1770" /> retirement bungalow, would continue to be governed by the old regime in regard to mortgage interest relief.</P>
    <P>I am not going to rehash what I said here yesterday, but it seems to me clearly to result from the words of the three documents to which I have referred.  I cannot see that it was in any way unreasonable for somebody to act on those words.  Anybody who, having done so and having, as my constituent did, entered into a mortgage obligation on 2 April, then opened the Finance Bill and found that mortgate interest relief was going to close down in 1985 would feel aggrieved.  I must tell the Minister frankly that I do not know the number of years over which this constituent's repayment arrangements stretch.  No doubt we are dealing with a category of people and not just one individual.  That appears to be admitted by the Minister's Department by the fact that they very decently put out a supplementary explanation of their own on 31 March last and referred to the fact that they had received several inquiries. It may be that there is a small category of persons here and, if so, since the amount involved is small and since undoubtedly in the case of the person I mentioned he never would have taken the obligation on himself had he foreseen that the Finance Bill, notwithstanding all the previous material emanating from the Department, was going to be in the terms which subsequently transpired, has a fair case in asking this House through one of its Members for an appropriate amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not want to spin this out.  The Minister knows the case I am trying to make.  I am grateful to himself and his Department for having accommodated me in giving me an opportunity to put down an amendment which I have been advised is the appropriate one in this case, though in a very complicated series of sections I have not had the amount of time I would have wished to satisfy myself that this is in fact the most appropriate and best way of doing it.  I hope the Minister will admit that I have made a case in equity for the relief of this very small category and that he can see his way to removing the grievance with <Col N="1771" /> which I think they now justifiably feel afflicted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is intended to secure that a loan which was taken out after 25 March 1982, budget day, but before 6 April 1982, should be a qualifying loan for tax relief if the loan was taken out for the purpose of purchasing or improving an individual's residence other than his sole or main residence, in other words, for a second house.</P>
      <P>During the Committee Stage debate Deputy Kelly contended that an individual who took out a loan between those dates for the purchase of a second house had been misled by my Financial Statement of 25 March last into believing that interest on that loan would be eligible for tax relief for as long as the loan continued to exist.  I might draw the attention of the Deputy to portion of what I said in my budget speech as follows:</P>
      <P>I propose to implement the tax proposals put forward in January, subject to certain changes which I will shortly outline.</P>
      <P>The January proposals to which I referred were those contained in Deputy John Bruton's budget of 27 January last, when he said, and I quote:</P>
      <P>.... while there is a case for assisting the general house-purchaser, there is no case for saying that the better-off he is, the more he should be assisted, as in fact happens under present arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owners of second residences would come into that category of the better-off.  The intention was that only loans taken out for the purpose of purchase of improvement of a sole or main residence would not be subject to the new rules.  It follows that all other loans, for whatever purpose, including the purchase of a second residence, would be subject to the new proposals.  Accordingly I decided to phase out after a three-year period the existing relief for loans for second residences taken out before 6 April 1982. From 6 April 1985 such loans will qualify <Col N="1772" /> for interest relief subject to the specified capital limits of £5,000, £3,600 and £2,500.</P>
    <P>In the light of these facts it is clear that ample notice of the Government's intentions regarding tax relief in respect of interest paid on loans and mortgages was given.  As I said in the House yesterday, it must be borne in mind that all mortgages on second homes, including those taken out before 25 March, which may well have been in existence for many years, are subject to the new restrictions.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I cannot accept Deputy Kelly's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the matter does not seem to have engaged the interest of any other Deputy or his constituents.  Let me say that the point of view embodied in Deputy John Bruton's budget speech of 27 January last is one I entirely share. I have always thought that the mortgage relief arrangements were generous, if not overgenerous, and regressive in the sense that the better-off you were, the more solid your security, the greater the debt you could run up, the greater relief you could attract.  Of course that relief meant a diminution of the State's revenue, the slack having to be made up by one's fellow citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could see no justification for that. The Minister and I are not at loggerheads about that and I was completely with Deputy Bruton on it.  I can see that there is a social case for providing interest relief for somebody who is engaged in starting off life in their first home and so on, but I cannot see the social case for anything else.  I know I am regarded as being so far on the right hand wing of my party that I am almost out of sight but, needless to say, that is a press myth.  In that regard, and in connection with the wealth tax, I would be very much on the left of my party.  The limits within which it is justifiable in a country such as ours to apply mortgage interest relief are very narrow. Having said that I believe people are entitled, just as everybody is entitled to the benefit of the taxation provisions which are in force at a certain time.  They would be regarded as soft-witted, soft in the head and quixotic to the point where <Col N="1773" /> one might consider locking them up if they did not make use of them in the interest of themselves and their families. People are entitled to make use of the law as it stands and rely on what they hear from the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to bring party politics into this, but the Minister and his party were returned to power in March after a campaign in which the side I had the honour of belonging to was denounced as being excessively rigid and going too far, too fast, although the principled approach which used to be heard here about governmental efforts being too little, too late was suddenly out of fashion. It was then too far, too fast.  That was the way Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Bruton were trying to travel and that, apparently was an even blacker sin than too little, too late, We were put out of office by the fellows who wanted to go a little less fast and less far and wanted to be a little easier on everybody.  They produced their budget and citizens relied on the words in it &mdash; I am not speaking about the vague intimations, which were not specified.  The Minister has just cited not his own budget speech but that of Deputy Bruton and citizens could not be expected to rely on that.  What is the use in saying to my constituent: &ldquo;By the way, my name is MacSharry and I am Minister for Finance but in order to understand my budget you have to read between the lines of it back to John Bruton's budget&rdquo;?  If that is what the Minister meant after the election it should have been specified before the election.  Whatever the social justifications for wanting interest relief in respect of a second home &mdash; I have freely admitted that I never regarded that case as a strong one &mdash; it is quite unreasonable to be asked to accept what the Minister is asking.</P>
    <P>I know the Deputy opposite is not a tyrant but it is action in an arbitrary manner to say: &ldquo;I know I never said this to you and I know everything I said would lead you to suppose that I meant the opposite but nonetheless when I said &lsquo;my budget&rsquo; what I really meant was John Bruton's budget&rdquo;.  Any citizen is entitled to experience a sense of grievance when he encounters that situation.  He is entitled <Col N="1774" /> to experience a sense of grievance redoubled when he finds that the notes issued by the Minister for the convenience of the press with his budget, and for the convenience of the chaps from RTE who were reading onto the screens from little slips of paper handed out from the Chamber, are things he cannot rely on.  Under the heading, relief for personal interest for mortgage taken out after 5 April 1982 one of the rules to apply is that there will be no change in the income tax relief provision in respect of existing mortgages.  It was after that that several citizens rang up the Department of Finance asking what was meant by &ldquo;existing mortgages&rdquo;.  In order to clarify that, and in the interest of public relations, open Government, the goldfish bowl and all the rest, the Minister for Finance and his Department very decently used the resources of the GIS &mdash; instead of promoting the personality of Deputy Seán Doherty, the Minister for Justice, or anybody else&mdash;to put out a sheet of paper on 31 March explaining what they meant.  They said in the course of that explanation that the Tánaiste wished to clarify the budget proposal in relation to income tax relief in respect of the new mortgage loans.</P>
    <P>It was after that statement was put out that my constituent said he was definitely entitled to go ahead.  He took legal advice before coming to the conclusion that that was what it meant.  He left nothing undone, no stone unturned and no avenue unexplored in order to run the gambit of cliches apposite to the case, in order to establish exactly what was meant.  He felt he was free, provided he could get under the tape by 5 April, to take out a mortgage, albeit one to raise a loan on his own principal residence to pay for the building of a second residence.  It is not hard to understand how he felt when he found that the Finance Bill had dropped him in the soup.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister or his officials did not intend this mess.  Although I may often have spoken in heat in a way which suggested otherwise, I do not have anything but the highest regard for public servants in the Minister's Department and all other Departments.  I consider the <Col N="1775" /> country to be lucky to have such public servants, but here there has been a definite breakdown in communications between the governing and the governed. The consequence of that is that a small number of people, including a constituent of mine, who are as much entitled to consideration as a constituent in the west of Ireland, although we often hear things in the House which suggest that he is not and that somehow a person living in Dublin South is a less deserving citizen than a person living in the far west &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Such a person is as much entitled to consideration as the rest.  He is a victim of a very severe failure on the part of Government to communicate what exactly they meant and what the citizen was to expect.  I do not know enough about the man's financial situation to be able to measure the degree to which it will be a real millstone around his neck, but for all I know it may be a real millstone.  It may be that if he is to try to get out of his obligations now, to try to sell off this second house&mdash;I am not sure how far he has progressed in the building or in the buying&mdash;he will be heavily out of pocket.  The responsibility for that lies with Government.  Although it may be a difficult thing to do justice to him, that man cries out for justice to be done to him and the others in the same category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister treated me courteously, as did his officials this morning, and I do not wish to embitter our relations on this topic, whatever we may have to say to each other on other topics; but I appeal to him not to close the file on this category.  If the Minister is still in office when a modification in the law is apposite I ask him, in the justice which is required of all of us towards one another, whatever about our party feelings, to <Col N="1776" /> keep his mind open about this case.  I do not say that in a perfect world there would be such a case.  I believe that in a perfect world there would be no such thing as mortgage interest relief on a second dwelling.  Deputy Bruton is perfectly right about that, but there is a genuine grievance, a genuine injustice being done, albeit inadvertently.  I hope the Minister will not leave that approach hanging over him and his Department and that he will keep his file open not with a marker saying &ldquo;Faoi phráinn&rdquo; but &ldquo;Gan dearmad a dhéanamh air&rdquo; so that when the next occasion arises for amendment of finance legislation some relief may be carried to the person who is aggrieved by the story I have told.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to increase slightly the allowance for small companies.  At present there is a lower rate of corporation profits tax which applies to companies.  To encourage small companies there should be a slight increase in this allowance.  I do not wish to make a big case of this but to draw attention to the fact that the lower rate band of corporation profits tax has remained the same since 1977.  It has not been revised upwards.  My amendment, which I am not going to press, proposes a small increase in the figure.  Will the Minister consider this whole issue?</P>

      <P>I do not believe that small Irish companies are very worried about taxation.  They are all worried about survival, trying to keep their heads above water and staying in business for as long as they possibly can.  I understand what is in Deputy Bruton's mind when he suggests putting the limit up from £25,000 to £27,000.  That is really only an extra £2,000 and at a small company's rate of 40 per cent it is only worth £800 to such a company.  I do not believe it is coming to grips with the assistance which small companies need.  This change appears to be interested in the problems of small companies but it does not do very much for them.  I doubt if it is worth making at all.  It is spread around over many small companies and, therefore, is probably useless to most of them, a mere £800 in company terms.</P>
      <P>This comes back to a discussion we had at Question Time.  I am sure Deputy Bruton remembers the current deficit figure at the half-way stage and he will remember making some very strong points about that deficit.  I doubt if this is the place in the Finance Bill to start deliberately to increase that deficit.  It would be of so little benefit, a mere £800 at the bottom level, that I do not believe it would help any of them sufficiently to enable them to tackle their problems. The explanatory memorandum to the budget shows that we estimated we would get approximately 3 per cent of total State revenue from corporation tax.  I commented during the Second Stage of this Bill that that is an extremely low figure not because I believe that a lot of mythical companies would make a fortune and dodge taxation so that we got only 3 per cent total revenue from corporation tax but that in the difficult times we are living in most companies are not making the kind of profits that would give the return to the State above the 3 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see any great benefit in the amendment as it stands.  Many manufacturing companies, particularly those under the IDA small industries scheme, are small companies and they are on the 10 per cent tax rate.  This amendment would not apply to them.  It would probably <Col N="1778" /> apply to service companies or other non-manufacturing companies.</P>

      <P>Yes.  There is £2,000 involved and 40 per cent on that means that it is worth £800 to the companies involved.  As that is probably spread over a lot of companies I doubt if it would be of much benefit to any of them.  It is unnecessary to do that and to alter our budgetary situation because of it.  That is a basic tax policy decision which I am sure both sides of the House are aware of.  The problem of small industries at the moment is sheer survival and I do not believe an extra £800 taxation on a company is of very great consideration.  It is not worth altering the shape of the budget deficit to get that particular allowance.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Bruton and Deputy Brennan have said, the figures proposed are not of great significance. Deputy Bruton asked me to have a look at it.  I want to advise him that when the limits were last adjusted in section 21 of the Finance Act, 1978 the adjustment took effect from 1 January 1977.  If an amendment as and from 1 January 1982 is considered desirable it could be made in next year's Finance Bill. I shall look at this question in connection with next year's budget and see whether and to what extent budgetary constraints would allow giving relief, which would be of more general benefit to small companies than that suggested by Deputy Bruton in this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 51, line 19, after &ldquo;£15,000&rdquo; to add &ldquo;or on the first £15,000 of any relevant disposal&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister has provided, in relation to the new tax on development land, that an exemption will be given from this tax on the disposal of land up to £15,000.  Many farmers, because of the current financial difficulties, are having to sell a site or a group of sites in order to help them to get back into financial equilibrium.  Some relief should have been given in the Bill but there is no amendment to that effect to assist people as far as tax is concerned if the money is being used simply to pay off debts which have been incurred.</P>
      <P>My amendment is in relation to the £15,000 exemption.  It seems to me on the present reading of the section that if a disposal is £16,000 the full rigours of the tax apply to the full £16,000 whereas if the disposal is £14,000 the development land tax does not apply to any of it.  There is no margin of relief.  My amendment would give some marginal relief in this area where £15,000 would be deducted from all transactions and the tax would start at £15,000 rather than start at zero. There may be other ways of giving marginal relief but this is one way it can be done.  I do not believe the Minister intends to have a situation where a person who sells his site for £16,000 pays tax on the entire disposal whereas a person who sells £14,000 worth of land does not have any tax on it.  I believe that anomaly could be corrected by this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel the section as it stands is not entirely satisfactory from the points of view expressed by Deputy Bruton.  I believe the Minister realises that there is a problem with this section and he has met it to some extent.  It is <Col N="1780" /> important to ensure that the £15,000 is allowed as a full deduction.  It is important that it is realised that there are people who are disposing of land at the moment particularly to meet repayments to financial institutions.  I have come across quite a number of people who are faced with this problem.  Some people sell sites or others sell a portion of their holding, not for development, but to repay a debt.  In cases like that they may be liable for capital gains tax in some instances. There is a lot of merit in this section. When sites are being purchased or sold the Minister should grant exemption from capital gains.  If this is not allowed it will cause a problem which the Minister is anxious to ensure does not arise.  I know the Minister is interested in allowing this exemption on capital gains and this amendment will meet the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 37 of the Bill which was designed to exclude certain small disposals by individuals from the scope of the special rules for the taxation of development land gains.</P>
      <P>Section 37, as it stands, grants reliefs where the total consideration received by an individual in any one year of assessment where all disposals of development land made by him does not exceed £15,000.  In such a case the gains will be taxable as if they were gains on disposal of ordinary land.  In the case of land held for over three years, the rate of tax will, therefore be 40 per cent instead of 50 per cent and the chargeable gains could be smaller because there would be no restriction on relief for indexation.  In addition, roll-over relief would apply where the proceeds were reinvested in certain business assets.  There is also the £4,000 per year exemption limits in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton's amendment, as framed, would appear to require this favourable treatment to be accorded to the first £15,000 of each disposal of development land made by an individual. Accordingly, it would operate where an individual made a disposal for a very large amount or where an individual made numerous disposals of plots or sites <Col N="1781" /> in a single year, irrespective of the amount received by him on each disposal or of the total amount receivable on all the disposals.  An extension on the lines proposed by Deputy Bruton would undermine the new tax arrangements which are designed to secure that gains and disposals of development land, other than in the case of relatively small disposals, are more heavily taxed than ordinary gains.  The relief proposed in section 37 is quite generous and any further reduction of the tax base in this area would not be justified.  The amendment, if accepted, could lead to widespread tax avoidance by the artificial splitting up of a transaction involving the disposal of development land for a very large amount, into several partial disposals, in order to claim the £15,000 relief for each such disposal.  The relief suggested by the Deputy would also cause serious practical difficulties.  It would be necessary to apportion the consideration in the case of every disposal for over £15,000.  This would require the treatment of such a disposal as if it consisted of two separate disposals.  One of these would be treated as an ordinary disposal and taxed according to the ordinary rules with the application of full indexation, a possible low rate of tax and roll-over relief, unrestricted loss relief, etc.  The other deemed disposal would fall to be taxed under the special rules relating to disposals of development land.  It can thus be seen that the Deputy's proposal would require extensive and complicated legislative provisions, including anti-avoidance provisions in place of the straightforward and reasonable provision in the section as it stands which is designed to remove disposals of one or two small sites or plots from the relative severity of the special tax on development land disposals.</P>

      <P>I believe that there is a need for marginal relief.  I am not tied down to the amendment I proposed.  It probably could have been improved upon but I believe it is wrong that somebody who sells a site for £14,999 can avoid this tax and somebody who sells a site for £15,001 has to pay tax in full on the entire amount whereas the other person does not pay it on any of the £14,999.  There should be some scheme of marginal relief introduced to phase in to the higher rate of tax, rather than have people suddenly jumping into the high rate of tax simply by crossing this magic figure of £15,000. The Minister spoke about artificial transactions <Col N="1783" /> and artificial figures.  This crude limit of £15,000 is going to mean that everyone will sell his site for £14,999 &mdash; at least officially.  There are going to be all sorts of ways of getting below the £15,000 whereas if you had marginal relief it would be less easy to escape and would be fairer.  Perhaps my amendment deserves more thought and time than I gave it and perhaps I should have put down a marginal relief type of amendment instead of the one I put down which probably gave a lot of unintended benefits beyond the necessary scope of marginal relief.  I think the Minister is making a mistake in not accepting something along the lines we are trying to achieve and this will be seen in next year's Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 58, line 45, to delete &ldquo;100 per cent&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;60 per cent.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is concerned with profit sharing.  It is encouraging employees to be given or to take a share in the ownership of their companies.  This is a step in the right direction towards getting a situation where people have a real stake in the companies in which they work.  If people feel a greater commitment towards the company they will work harder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that this proposal, which was one that was in my January budget, has been carried forward into the detail of the Finance Bill by the present Minister. However, I feel that in so doing and <Col N="1784" /> indeed in imitating to an unduly slavish extent the British scheme &mdash; in fact the scheme here is done entirely from the British scheme as I understand it &mdash; he has built into this scheme the restrictions which ensured that the British scheme for profit-sharing was not the success that people hoped it would be when it was introduced.</P>
    <P>My amendments here are designed to remove some of those restrictions.  I do not want to delay the House unduly by elaborating them too much, but I will quickly indicate the changes I see a need to make.  If a person gets a share in a company and sells within less than four years of the share being given to him, as may happen if he leaves the employment or wants to realise it for some reason of his own, he must pay tax on the entire income that was given to him in the form of a share because it says in subsection (8) (a) that if the event, that is the sale of the share, occurs before the fourth anniversary of the date on which the shares were appropriated to the participant and paragraph (c) (i) does not apply, the appropriate percentage is 100 per cent. In respect of paragraph (b), if the event occurs on or after the fourth anniversary and before the fifth anniversary of the date on which the shares were appropriated to the participant and paragraph (c) (i) does not apply, the appropriate percentage is 75 per cent of the benefit given to him.</P>
    <P>I believe these figures should be reduced to 60 per cent in respect of profits to the shareholder/worker in the case of under four years and 50 per cent if between four and five years.  I am making similar changes in respect of other percentages of the income which would be taxed further down in the section in regard to later dates of disposal.  I believe that these are reasonable liberalisations of the scheme and, as I said on Second Stage, the fact that the British scheme has not really been a riproaring success suggests that the Treasury were unduly cautious in setting out the terms and we should learn from that error and be a little less cautious and a little more generous in the concessions we give.</P>
    <P>In regard to the disposal, the concessions <Col N="1785" /> I am mentioning here are reasonable. This covers amendments Nos. 18, 19, 20 and 21.  I am sorry we did not have a chance to discuss those on Committee Stage because if we had had that opportunity I am sure that my amendments for discussion now would have been more precisely framed and would have had fewer of the flaws that the Minister may say there are in them when he gets up to speak.  But we need to err on the side of being liberal in the interests of encouraging people to initiate profit-sharing schemes for their employees.  We should not be too restrictive about such schemes. We have to get over a lot of bad habits in industrial relations if we are to improve our economic performance.  Profit sharing is one way of doing this and we should not be too cautious in pushing out the boat and starting a profit-sharing scheme on this the first occasion it has ever been done in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The main effect of the amendments would be that the charge to tax, if the participant disposes of his shares within seven years of their being appropriated to him, would be 60 per cent, 40 per cent, 20 per cent or 10 per cent of the locked-in value of the shares depending on the length of time he had held them instead of the figure of 100 per cent, 75 per cent, 50 per cent or 25 per cent as proposed by the Bill.  Acceptance of this amendment would defeat the object of the legislation which is to encourage true profit-sharing schemes. An essential element of the legislation is that the tax relief would apply only where the employee holds his shares long enough to ensure that he participates in profits as a shareholder.  If he were to sell his shares shortly after acquiring them, which this amendment would encourage, he would never participate in the profits and the scheme as a whole would fail. Creation of a scheme of tax relief for shares held for a very short time would also be invidious as far as the many public sector employees who cannot participate in profit-sharing schemes are concerned. The scheme would quickly become a device for giving low-tax remuneration to employees of big companies and would <Col N="1786" /> lead to unrest among those not in receipt of similar advantages.  It would also make something of a sham of the scheme in that each year the company would be buying and issuing to employees the very shares the employees had sold that year. For those reasons I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a brief comment on the schemes.  They should be more extended in scope.  All companies, not just the public companies, should have the opportunity of participating in such schemes and they should be quite broadly based.  They should be quite clearly circumscribed to prevent them becoming a tax avoidance or low-tax payment scheme for employees.  In that context there should be a true retention period built into the granting of any such shares.  But the current schemes as proposed are, in my view, excessively circumscribed in their general scope.</P>

      <P>Profit-sharing schemes are very new.  This is the first time we have had it in a Finance Bill and it is new ground for all of us.  Deputy Bruton said that this has not been very successful in Britain.  That is my information on the matter also.  The whole area of profit-sharing schemes has been somewhat of a disaster.  Deputy Bruton puts forward the reason that somehow the regulations are a bit restrictive.  I have a feeling that the reason is much more fundamental than that.  There still exists a very strong suspicion about intention between employer and employee, so much so that the average employee today very much prefers to have proper year to year facilities and wages and more immediate returns from his investment in the firm.  There is somehow a suspicion that getting involved in the whole area of the sharing of profits is some sort of a management trick and something that they should not get involved in.  It is much more fundamental than the argument put forward by Deputy Bruton that if we reduce the level of taxation it will interest more people in profit-sharing schemes.  I doubt that.  The reason is based on suspicion and lack of trust between <Col N="1787" /> employer and employee.  Deputy Bruton is not drawing the correct conclusion in saying that it is the technicalities of the Bill which are keeping people away from these schemes.</P>
      <P>We should encourage these schemes by breaking down the suspicions between employers and employees so that more of these schemes will come into operation. When both sides see that the schemes are worth while and can work to the benefit of all they will become more involved in profit-sharing.  I am not convinced that changing the tax on the disposal of shares will tackle the problem, although it may help somewhat.  The fundamental suspicion will still exist, and there is a broader industrial relations question.</P>

      <P>Under the Bill a company will be able to distribute in any year only the equivalent of 5 per cent of their profits to employees in the form of shares.  That is far too restrictive and the scheme will make a very minimal contribution to the diffusion of property ownership and ownership of business.  Section 58 (1) states <i>inter alia:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provided that no deduction shall be allowed under this section or under any other provision of the Tax Acts in <Col N="1788" /> respect of so much of any sum or the aggregate amount of any sums so expended in that accounting period as exceeds 5 per cent of the company's&mdash;</P>

    <P>I see no justification for having any restriction on the proportion of their income that a company if they so wish can distribute as shares to their employees. Why should there be any restriction? Why should they not be free to give the entire profits to their employees if they wish?

Section 57 allows a company a deduction for tax purposes of any profits that apply to the scheme under the Bill up to 5 per cent of their profits in any year.  The main purpose of the 5 per cent restriction is to protect the interests of existing shareholders and to prevent the dilution of their shares and the reduction of their value by the application of more than 5 per cent of the company's profits to the scheme.  To allow up to 50 per cent of profits to be applied to the scheme would damage the interest of shareholders and might have the effect of the shareholders preventing the company from having a scheme under this Bill.  There is a huge differential between 5 per cent and 50 per cent but we might go as far as <Col N="1789" /> 10 per cent or 20 per cent, although I have not put down an amendment. Would the Deputy agree?</P>

      <P>I am surprised that Deputy Fitzpatrick should be worried about 20 per cent of profits in any year being given to employees.  The shareholders elect a board of directors at the annual meeting and they have every opportunity, by not electing directors who will behave irresponsibly, of making sure that their interests are adequately protected.  There is no need to have double protection by restricting the law unduly.  I am very pleased that the Minister has accepted this reasonable compromise.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 68, line 35, after &ldquo;years&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or a person in receipt of an Old Age Pension&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to the tax of £3 on anybody who travels by any method of transportation out of this country, whether to visit relatives, attend a funeral or for any other reason.  Our original proposal was to have a tax on package holidays, not on all journeys.  This travel tax does not apply to people travelling in <Col N="1790" /> executive jets which carry fewer than 15 passengers but people who travel on the mail boat will have to pay it.  It is a somewhat discriminatory tax.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to exempt old age pensioners from the travel tax.  Use of internal transport facilities is free for people over the age of eligibility for old age pensions.  I am not suggesting that such people should be able to travel abroad free of charge but we should not impose an additional tax when they visit members of their families in England or elsewhere.  I admit that the tax is not very substantial but we should oppose the principle of applying it to old age pensioners travelling abroad.  For ease of administration it might be preferable to exempt from the tax those who are holders of free travel passes.  That would be a wider definition than that of people in receipt of an old age pension and for ease of administration it might be a better method to use.  People in that age category should be exempt from this new tax.  I am happy to move this amendment on behalf of Deputy Fennel and myself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <P>I support this amendment. Those over the age of 65 who use airlines for travelling are a relatively small segment of the population in any event, but perhaps there might be a specification as to the type of pensioner exempted.  A person can have a substantial pension, but presumably we are talking here about people on social welfare pensions.  Certainly, non-contributory pensioners should be given an exemption. By and large, I agree with the import of the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was considered in the course of devising the tax but it was decided that only invalids would be entitled to exemption of this nature.  What <Col N="1791" /> was proposed originally on 27 January and even what I suggested in March during the election campaign have been somewhat diluted and the amount of revenue is now very small, about £1 million this year.  I am not prepared to contemplate any further exemptions.  They were already considered and turned down.</P>

      <P>This is a worthy amendment and I am surprised that the Minister is not accepting it.  As Deputy Bruton has explained, old age pensioners have free travel in Ireland and free travel facilities should also be available to them when they travel abroad.</P>
      <P>This matter has been discussed at some length, but I consider this proposal to be the best.  The whole idea behind this tax is wrong.  People leaving Ireland must pay this charge, whereas people entering Ireland will not have to pay it.  Business people travelling on a very regular basis should be encouraged to purchase their tickets here, but with the extra £3 tax regular travellers will buy their tickets outside Ireland, with a consequent loss of revenue to the State and a gain to the Crown.  The Minister may not have thought of this when the tax was devised. Aircraft with not more than 15 passengers have been mentioned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 79, to delete lines 10 to 19.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is concerned with the advance payment of value-added tax. This was the somewhat rickety cornerstone upon which the Minister's budget strategy for 1982 was built, a cornerstone which will be there this year, but not next year.  A house built on a temporary cornerstone will not long endure.  This is a wholly artificial transaction.  Money that should be paid in the normal course some time in January 1983 is now, by the wonderful workings of the Revenue Commissioners, going to be collected in December 1982.  By virtue of this magic transaction, we will find ourselves with a slightly smaller budget deficit this year than would otherwise have been the case. This artificial depresion of the budget deficit for this year will not continue in subsequent years, whereas the expenditure cuts and taxation increases which we are incuring this year, which this is going <Col N="1793" /> to replace would have brought in revenue next year, the year after and the year after that.  This measure will bring money in this year only and no additional revenue to match the extra revenue which would have been gained in subsequent years from the alternative proposals.  In other words, we will have a gain for one year to counteract a loss for that year, but in subsequent years there will be no gain to counteract the loss.  As a result, the underlying current budget deficit situation for 1983, 1984 and 1985 will be seriously worsened.</P>
    <P>What is of more concern is that people will have been led to believe that the situation was made better by this artificial measure.  As we all know, what is necessary to bring down the current budget deficit in a real sense is a wide public understanding of the problem.  This temporary and illusory deduction in this year's budget deficit will create in the public mind an impression that things are better than they are in fact.  Its artificiality is a damaging feature of this proposal, from the economic management point of view.</P>
    <P>This proposal will have a serious effect on our working capital requirements for industry.  Many of our industries import goods for further processing.  Many of them use services and goods provided by other industries which, themselves, do not re-export those goods.  This proposal will increase our cost of living because it will mean that anyone selling anything here which was imported, or which contained ingredients which were imported, will have to charge a higher price in order to meet the additional interest costs they will have to bear to enable them to pay VAT in advance to comply with the requirements of the section.</P>
    <P>The resources of firms&mdash;I am not talking about rich businessmen but firms which employ people&mdash;which should be used to give workers reasonable pay increases and so on will now have to be used to finance borrowings undertaken because the Government are not prepared to borrow the money or to take a decision to reduce their borrowing requirement in order that such measures do not have to be resorted to.  The <Col N="1794" /> Government will use the business sector as a means of raising money.  This is extremely damaging.  It will cause substantial job losses.  Anyone who had discussions with business people in their constituencies in recent weeks will be aware of the concern of those involved in the distribution field and the great fears they have which have been generated by this proposal.</P>
    <P>It will delay importation procedures because each port of entry will now require a separate guarantee by the importer regarding availability of funds to pay VAT in advance.  Goods often have to be diverted from one port to another due to industrial action.  Firms will now have to maintain guarantees at a series of ports in case the one they normally use is closed because of strike action.  The cost of doing this will be considerable.  The necessity to collect this money will require that the Border will have to be permanently guarded day and night by customs officials.  The Border is manned during the day but not at night. Now that VAT is to be collected on all goods coming in at point of entry, customs officials will have to maintain a presence on the Border.  That will mean substantial staff costs in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  I presume that is what the Minister intends to do with the staff of 60 he employed for the £9.60 who will not now be used for that purpose.</P>
    <P>This is a wholly artificial transaction. Staff necessary to collect the money will be there in 30 years time even though the money will be collected this year and never again.  There will be a permanent increase in the number of staff employed because of this change.  That will do more harm in the long term to the public finances, as it will be an unnecessary addition to the public sector pay-roll, than any benefit derived from bringing forward the collection date of the tax.</P>
    <P>There will be a problem regarding split containers.  Containers containing a variety of goods for more than one importer will be held up if a person receiving a particular consignment has not paid VAT in advance.  Importers do not have control over whatever consignments are in a <Col N="1795" /> container they happen to be using.  This will cause serious administrative problems. The Irish Hardware Association has suggested to me and to the Minister an alternative method of collecting the revenue.  Their proposal is that importers and agents should be accountable for VAT at port of entry on the same basis as they are accountable at present for VAT on sales, that is, VAT on imports for September-October 1982 should be payable no later than 19 November 1982. The accountable person will be entitled to a credit of the VAT paid on imports against the VAT liability on sales for September-October 1982.  This would ensure that the importer or agent has incurred VAT only on the added-value and not at the point of entry.  It is a balancing transaction made in advance so that liability is only on the net figure rather than the gross figure.  It would lead to an early payment of revenue by traders without involving them in major administrative problems in collecting the revenue.</P>
    <P>I do not have to remind the House of the number of firms in the distribution business which are in trouble at present. We know of the difficulties in Ardee. There are a number of other firms in Drogheda in serious difficulty which are involved in this kind of business.  One of the largest companies involved in the distribution and do-it-yourself implements is in severe trouble, as the Minister knows.  This additional charge will force many companies already at the brink financially over the brink into bankruptcy. If the Minister and his party succeed in carrying this proposal they will not be thanked by their constituents or the many workers who will be out of jobs this year.  It is a wholly artificial proposal in that it will just bring forward money from this year into next year without any underlying structural improvement in the balance of revenue as against expenditure. It is in substitution for measures which did precisely that.  It is a reckless and unnecessary proposal and one which should be rejected in the interests of the protection of jobs and of sane discussion <Col N="1796" /> of public finances as distinct from obfuscation of the real issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Bruton on this amendment.  There was a difference of approach between us in relation to this matter on Committee Stage.  Deputy Bruton had an amendment down deleting the whole provision&mdash;in effect, the whole £140 million. Our amendment, seeing that the damage was done, tried to undo a substantial portion of it by indicating that in our opinion raw materials or component parts of capital goods being imported for manufacturing industry should be exempted.  That would have been £80 million and we were prepared to give way on the other £60 million.  It is ironic that Fianna Fáil have tried to gloss over the serious impact of this major provision. When the Taoiseach was interviewed on television by Brian Farrell last Friday week he indicated in his amazing way that raw materials only constituted a small proportion of imports and blandly, with that magnificent capacity of his, waved the problem away.  The problem is there.  It was a central strategy of Fianna Fáil's alternative budget.  To a degree, I exempt Deputy MacSharry and lay the blame fairly and squarely on the other erstwhile economic guru of the party, Minister for Education Deputy O'Donoghue, because it was he who originally came up with this proposition in the famous alternative Fianna Fáil budget.  He advanced a number of reasons for indicating that there should be a decelerated payment of VAT at point of entry which he proposed would yield £45 million in 1982.  Needless to remark, when the thought impinged on the prospect of revenue for the Taoiseach, it went from £45 million in the pre-election alternative budget of Fianna Fáil to £140 million immediately afterwards because everything was to be caught at point of entry.  Deputy O'Donoghue, I remember vividly at the time, indicated that the reason he wanted VAT on imports at point of entry was to avoid evasion and he advanced a figure on a radio interview of £10 million.  That would cut out evasion.  It has now transpired <Col N="1797" /> on the best Finance estimates that out of the £140 million which is now being accelerated in, the most that one would capture by way of evasion would be about £5 million or £6 million.  Therefore, that argument does not stand up.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside all that, this provision will have a fundamental impact on the liquidity of Irish industry.  Particularly towards the end of each financial year, in the months of November and December, the liquidity position of most companies tends to deteriorate.  To have a refund system operating for some sectors of industry, particularly those in the export field, and to ensure that they would get their refunds from the Christmas postman within 30 days is just out of the question.  I estimate that they would be lucky to see any sign of a refund within seven or eight weeks, and that would be doing well on the part of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sector by sector of Irish industry have opposed this imposition of VAT, and I will give two examples.  One is the textile industry.  I hope that when the Ministers go down to the west they will explain to the workers there&mdash;in Galway for example&mdash;the impact that this provision will have on that industry.  The Irish Textile Federation representative of man-made fibres, stable fibres, continuous filament yarns for weaving and knitting, household and apparel woven fabrics and the carpet industry, have been extremely concerned about the proposal to levy VAT on imports of raw materials.  They have pointed out correctly that the industry comprises about 8 per cent of total national manufacturing employment, which is the second highest proportionately in Europe.  The gravity of the implications of this tax on such a sizeable industry is highlighted by the fact that the exports represent about two-thirds of the industry's total output.  The Irish textiles industry will be caught on raw materials at point of entry and the refund will be cripplingly late.  Inevitably the liquidity of those firms, many of whom are already facing considerable difficulties in the international market and for the most part are highly dependent on exports, <Col N="1798" /> will be substantially affected by this imposition.</P>
    <P>We have received representations from the electronics industry.  This is a growing, major industry here which with associated industries employs over 15,000 people in this country and last year they exported £600 million worth of high technology products.  They will be caught with VAT on imported raw materials which are incorporated into the exported products.  I could go on and on and name many other industries who will face serious liabilities in this regard.  I do not regard this as the best way of assuring increased Exchequer revenue and inevitably it will cause considerable additional workloads on the Revenue Commissioners at point of entry with the introduction of those complex procedures which have already been announced in advance information given by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The proposed arrangement for payment of VAT on imports and for refunds are very complex.  The CII in their newsletter said, and I have no reason to disagree with them: &ldquo;Exporting industry would then suffer an increase in working capital of over £1 million for each day payment of VAT refund is delayed&rdquo;. That could quite easily happen.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to reconsider this whole question.  The proposal was ill-conceived by my constituency colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, as a temporary expedient to try to get hold of £45 million to make up the famous alternative budget.  When the Fianna Fáil Party came in and decided to abolish VAT on clothing at point of retail sale and restore £46 million in food subsidies, they had to make up the money elsewhere and they picked the worst possible way of making it up.  If I were to become Minister for Finance tomorrow morning I would prefer to have VAT on clothing at point of retail sale rather than crucify every clothing textile manufacturer in this country trying to export out of Ireland.  I would prefer to see those people in Ireland who-have a high propensity for consumer expenditure &mdash; particularly young people because there is a tremendous correlation between disposable income and expenditure <Col N="1799" /> on clothing &mdash; under that type of imposition rather than to see employment and exports affected or major cumbersome import arrangements made by the Revenue Commissioners to obtain money on that basis.</P>
    <P>I am aware that other Deputies wish to contribute on this section.  It is a major section.  There is fundamental opposition from the Labour Party to this provision. In Government we thought of many ways of raising money in the Exchequer approach to the end of last year, but this was one way we did not consider appropriate because of its dramatic effect on the liquidity position of manufacturing industry throughout the country in terms of both exported goods and imported commodities.  Above all, as Deputy Bruton said, it will lead to massive efforts at evasion, particularly on cross-Border points of entry.  For these reasons we are opposed to the proposal.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will accept this amendment.  It will be interesting to see how many other Deputies from the other political parties will support our opposition in this regard.  Some people have a very simplistic view of life and they will say, &ldquo;Well, they are only employers, they are only manufacturers and they are caught for it.  The ordinary workers will not be caught&rdquo;.  As we all know, we live in a mixed economy and 65,000 Irish workers depend on exports exclusively for their jobs.  I hope the many workers in those jobs and their trade unions appreciate what this imposition is doing to them in affecting the basic capital liquidity requirement of their firms, and I hope they will respond accordingly.</P>
    <P>This measure is quite regressive, it is unnecessary in terms of revenue raising and in the long run it will be of no great benefit, because it is a deceleration of 1983 VAT into 1982 on a once-off basis at the worst possible time.  To do that at the peak of a recession is ill-advised and quite unnecessary, and the country can ill afford it, as we enter a winter of unemployment with major difficulties facing manufacturing industry in maintaining and protecting employment in an <Col N="1800" /> extremely difficult international situation.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to know if the Government have any proposals in relation to assistance to firms to pay this VAT  have been an appalling number  flying around that the ICC are to borrow £200 million abroad to lend money to manufacturing firms to pay VAT.  This will not show up in the Exchequer requirements.  That type of rumour should be scotched by the Minister. If that is the position we are going from one mad expedient to the next to raise revenue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBellew" hpid="Mr. Bellew Mr. Bellew">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bellew</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose any amendment to this section, a section which is correct and proper.  Listening to Deputy Desmond I was surprised at his remarks on the clothing and textile industries.  I do not know what practical experience he has of the workings of the VAT regulations. He may have the theory.  In practical terms he should be aware that the component parts of the textile manufacturing industries and the shoe industry, which are probably the more vulnerable of the industries mentioned, are exempted and zero rated as the regulations stand.  Therefore, these two industries will not be affected in any way.</P>
      <P>To my certain knowledge the only components which would be affected and which are subject to the imposition of VAT are zip fasteners and very expensive furs.  We need not concern ourselves too much with very expensive furs.  We are talking about the basic textile and footwear industries.  Their component parts are totally exempt from VAT.  Therefore, they will not be affected adversely under this section.  Deputy Desmond's argument does not stand up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a constituency which is very close to the Border and I am well aware of the abuses of the VAT system as constituted at present.  Down through the years since the imposition of this form of taxation, Governments have been defrauded of hundreds of millions of pounds by people who are importing taxable items and not paying the tax due.  By producing fraudulent numbers and by other methods, they avoid meeting their <Col N="1801" /> rightful obligation to pay tax.  Many traders and retailers are also neglecting their duty to pay this tax by substituting categories of goods in the returns they make to the Department.  It is common knowledge that builders providers in particular put incorrect descriptions on invoices to enable people to claim and reclaim from the Revenue Commissioners taxes in excess of what they are entitled to, thereby defrauding the State of sources of revenue.</P>
    <P>The imposition of the correct rate of VAT on components and articles attracting the appropriate rate at the point of entry will eliminate any temptation to defraud the Revenue Commissioners because people who do that will be the losers.  The value-added tax regulations need considerable tightening up to ensure that the amount of revenue which should accrue to the Exchequer is received by it.  This is an area of gross abuse.  I fully support the proposal that the tax should be collected at the point of entry.</P>
    <P>No doubt this will pose problems for certain industries.  There is no use in denying that.  Those industries should examine their own affairs and put their own house in order.  A document from the Confederation of Irish Industries has been quoted.  Another document produced by that body, the monthly report, could also have been quoted.  It is shown constantly in that document that many companies are grossly overstocked.  This creates cash flow problems for themselves. I am not suggesting that some assistance may not be desirable or necessary.</P>
    <P>This change in the regulations has been sought for many years by our native manufacturing companies.  By and large, they will welcome this proposal as a mechanism to eliminate any unfair advantage imported articles may have.  If it creates difficulty on a cash-flow basis for some companies, it may also be very welcome having regard to the general health of our economy if it eliminates many unnecessary imports people are bringing in in vaster quantities than they require for their own use or the use of the community. <Col N="1802" /> Their only motive is to make excessive profits for themselves.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to collect this tax at the point of entry.  I reject the suggestion made that it would be detrimental in any way to the textile and footwear industries.  That suggestion needs to be refuted.  There has been quite an amount of deliberate misrepresentation on this section to try to make people afraid of the outcome of its imposition. I welcome the section as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want Deputy Bellew to think I am speaking now because he is my opposite number in the constituency we both represent.  To me this is the wrong tax, in the wrong place, at the wrong time.  When it was first mooted by the Government I thought it was a piece of kite flying and that they would forget about it and move on to other available sources of finance when documentary evidence was submitted to them from everybody concerned.  Unfortunately the Government seem to have committed themselves to obtaining revenue from so many other sources that they are hung up on this proposal to have VAT at the point of entry.</P>
      <P>That it is the wrong tax at the wrong time goes without saying, and no representative body of importers, manufacturers or distributors has said anything to the contrary.  To impose it at the point of entry is foolish because it presents two problems.  It presents the problem of cash liquidity for the importer of raw materials which are so necessary for his business. It affects the liquidity of an importing distributor of finished goods which are not available or manufactured here.  On the last point, that of supplying alternative goods which are produced and manufactured here, we will have to do a big job on import substitution.  It will take more than words or promises to achieve the necessary result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the cash liquidity problem it will present, there is one aspect which might not have been touched upon.  There are cases where necessary raw materials or finished products have to be obtained in many instances through the <Col N="1803" /> goodwill of foreign suppliers.  We have a small market and to build up our goodwill with these foreign manufacturers over a number of years, we must prove that we can meet our debts by paying our bills when they fall due.</P>
    <P>This value-added tax at point of entry will create bureaucratic knots which importers will find very hard to untie.  It will lead to delays in the importer finding funds to pay the amount specified in the invoices when the goods arrive.  This could lead suppliers to say, as they have in the past, that it is not worthwhile cultivating the Irish market.  If there are delays at the point of entry and in the payment of invoices, they may come to that conclusion and that is something we must avoid.</P>
    <P>This point has been discussed a lot and I wanted to add my voice.  This is a part of the Finance Bill I never thought would see the light of day; I thought it was kite flying which the Government would have omitted, but unfortunately they have not. This measure must be opposed.  Not only is every responsible manufacturing body opposing this, but anybody with business experience knows it will create problems all along the line.</P>

      <P>Some of the Deputies who have spoken on this amendment said it was likely to give rise to a problem of liquidity.  That is not the way I would put it.  I see this proposal giving rise to a problem not of liquidity but of liquidation. This is the kind of problem it will cause for many of our manufacturing firms already operating on a borderline situation &mdash; between being in a position to carry on and maintain employment and going under, so causing redundancies when the firms go into liquidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last few years we have seen the rape of the manufacturing capacities of firms and factories big and small from Fieldcrest to small backyard firms.  The number of firms going into liquidation is increasing apace, causing increased unemployment figures every time we get four monthly returns.  I thought budgetary planning would have been directed towards reversing that situation, but we <Col N="1804" /> find the reverse here.  Here we have a budgetary proposal which on any objective examination will have the direct effect of increasing unemployment. There are many firms which are in a last straw to break the camel's back situation and any further burden will push them into liquidation and render workers redundant.  That is the kind of situation this measure must inevitably bring about.</P>
    <P>This measure was cobbled up at speed to provide a so-called alternative budget without regard to the economy or to the needs of the country.  Clearly it was not adequately considered nor were its consequences thought through.  It was not considered from the viewpoint of whether it was a plus for the economy or a millstone around the neck of our declining manufacturing capacity.  That was not its purpose.</P>
    <P>Consideration has been given to what the pulling power in terms of revenue will be of this measure.  Apparently it is estimated that £140 million will be contributed by manufacturing industry in 1982.  Deputy Bellew, by some stretch of the imagination which for the life of me I cannot fathom, has said industry will welcome this measure.  I suppose one would welcome a tax imposition of that nature like one would welcome a belt around the ears by somebody already stunned swimming against the stream.</P>
    <P>Maybe this measure will produce £140 million on the plus side, but has any thought been given to what it will cost the Exchequer on the minus side?  Has any consideration been given to what it will cost the State in redundancy payments for the workers when their firms go into liquidation?  Has any consideration been given to what the weekly social welfare payments will be for those workers who will be on the dole because their companies had to close as a result of this measure?  Has any consideration been given to the question of the lost production of goods by those factories and firms?  That loss will have to be replaced by the importation of goods thereby increasing the strain on our balance of payments situation and providing employment for workers in other countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1805" /> This is a classic example of an ill-thought out fiscal measure, thought in terms of how much the tax will produce so that we can give an apparent sop to the public to abolish an unpopular tax. That is an incorrect basis on which to plan a budget which should be directed towards the provision of employment, because we have 150,000 unemployed and that figure is rising all the time.  The Minister should seriously reconsider the situation.</P>

      <P>It has been very interesting to hear the contributions on this amendment which seeks to abolish the imposition of VAT at the point of entry. This measure is expected to bring in £140 million this year.  There is no way I could accept this amendment, but I would like to respond to a few points made and I will have only one opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy FitzGerald left the House because I had something to say about an idea he had a few years ago. Deputy Desmond said the scheme was ill-conceived.  That brings me to what I wanted to say in relation to Deputy FitzGerald's contribution in the Dáil on 21 October 1980 on a motion on the Government's Economic Policy.  At column 381 of the Official Report for that day he said:</P>
      <P>Why do home manufacturers apparently have to face the burden of VAT sooner than importers, giving an advantage to the latter?</P>
      <P>Obviously he understands the situation better than anybody speaking on behalf of this amendment now.</P>
      <P>At column 389 he said:</P>
      <P>At the same time the Government should look again at the manner in which VAT is levied on imports.</P>
      <P>Later in the debate the Deputy said:</P>
      <P>I urge on the Taoiseach to re-examine this issue in response to the urgent demands of hard-pressed Irish firms competing with a flood of imports....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was said two years ago by the present <Col N="1806" /> leader of Fine Gael, the party who put forward this amendment.</P>

Although I did not have time to read them I know that in the papers today there was a report that the trade union movement were calling for a ban on imports.  All we are doing is bringing forward a charge that will be levied on imported goods.  We are levying that charge earlier than would normally be the case.  That is all that is being done but it is being opposed by Labour Deputies. At the same time, the responsible organisation of the trade union movement is calling for a ban on imports.  I find it difficult to reconcile the two attitudes.</P>

      <P>I intend to look at the possibility of the ICC making money available for VAT on imports to companies which find difficulties in financing it otherwise.  I have said that on at least 15 occasions inside and outside the house since 25 March.  However, I do not envisage that any such scheme will apply to all companies.  I envisage that only a limited number will look for such assistance. Already discussions have taken place with officials in my Department and the ICC to formulate a scheme to have ready for operation by 1 September.  Apart from VAT on imports, consideration is being given to the ICC borrowing money abroad to provide loans to industry.  In this context a figure of £200 million was mentioned but I stress that this is not related to VAT on imports.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to put the record straight. This proposal was part of an election programme put to the people by Fianna Fáil in February of this year as an alternative to proposals put forward by the Coalition parties providing for VAT on footwear and clothing, the abolition of food subsidies and taxation of social welfare benefits.</P>

      <P>I know Deputies opposite have tried in the past three weeks to bring about a situation to precipitate a general election or cause political embarrassment but, again, they picked the wrong issue.  I am surprised at the attitude of the Labour Party in this matter.  I quoted what Deputy FitzGerald said.  He knows the importance of what we are doing and knew it two years ago. Many industries will benefit enormously as a result of our proposal, unlike what Deputy Taylor outlined.</P>
      <P>There is no way this amendment could be accepted and it is disappointing that Fine Gael put it forward.  Half-way through the year we have an amendment from the party of financial rectitude, the infallible party in relation to all financial matters.  This party have put down an amendment which, if carried, would cost the Exchequer £140 million this year.  We are not talking about the situation in the past few weeks where Deputy Bruton and others claimed that implementation of their amendments would cost only a few million pounds.  We are talking about an amendment that would cost the Exchequer £140 million.  Yet, Fine Gael are the party who told the people they were concerned about budget deficits and the level of borrowing.  This proves beyond doubt the reality that exists in Fine Gael and which is only now becoming clear to the public.  I have no doubt that the House will reject the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this tax as one that is purely artificial because it is simply bringing forward money from next year to this year.  I would point out to the Minister that the Confederation of Irish Industry have expressed grave opposition to this proposal.  Their worry is based on the impact this proposal will have not on importers but on the Irish export industry. <Col N="1809" /> As we know, the IDA launched a campaign in the past 20 years to attract industry based on the further processing, with the aid of skilled Irish labour and technology, of imported raw materials. We are adding value to imported goods and we are gaining immense employment as a result.  The voice of industry involved in this kind of activity through the CII has come out in the strongest possible terms against this proposal.  It has pointed out that exporting industries will suffer an increase in working capital requirements of more than £1 million for each day the refund of VAT is delayed, as it will be under this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, there are serious doubts about whether the banks will make the money available to finance these types of artificial transactions.  We know that the banks are already in difficulty in maintaining their borrowing programmes within the restrictions laid down by the Central Bank.  We know, too, that they are extremely angry at the extent of the <Col N="1810" /> arbitrary levies that have been imposed on them.  There is every reason to suspect that they will not wish to finance this artificial transaction which is giving purely a temporary short-term and nonrecurring boost to the Government finances.  The banks will not facilitate this artificial mismanagement of the nation's finances and it may well be that they will refuse to firms the working capital they will need to finance the additional borrowing that will be necessary to pay VAT in advance.</P>
    <P>It is in order to protect jobs, to protect financial honesty, and having regard to the fact that this is not a real revenue-raising proposal but something that is purely artificial, and in order to ensure that the modern industrial base we have built up is not destroyed by the arbitrary action of the Government, we are proposing this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I resume my contribution on the Bill I should like to comment on some remarks made in the House on Thursday last by Deputy Sherlock. That Deputy launched a rather savage attack on my election agent and I should like, in the interest of fair play, to set the record straight.  The person concerned is an elected representative of growers who call meetings at which votes are taken and decisions arrived at. The Deputy, as somebody who is involved in the trade union movement, should realise that that is how things are done.  I should like to point out that during the 1980-81 and 1981-82 sugar beet processing campaign in Mallow a wide divergence emerged between the level of tare in beet delivered to Mallow compared with sugar beet delivered from the Mallow area to the Tuam factory. The beet delivered to Mallow was showing tare as much as 40 per cent while beet from the neighbouring farms with the same type of land was showing tare of 9 per cent in the Tuam beet factory.  This problem, inevitably, caused a great deal of anxiety and frustration among the suppliers to the Mallow factory and, of course, there was a massive economic penalty on them.  The growers and their representatives in desperation initiated an intensive around-the-clock investigation of this serious problem and, finally, after almost two campaigns, it was found that the sampling scales in the Mallow beet factory was seriously defective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even when this was established it took a lot of time and effort to secure an <Col N="1814" /> agreement on compensation measures.  It was those events which led to widespread reluctance on the part of farmers to continue growing the sugar beet in the Mallow area.  The man whom Deputy Sherlock accuses of leading a no-grow beet campaign is one of the largest growers of beet in the country on his own land and on rented land.  He has grown and delivered to Mallow beet factory over the past three years 20,000 tons of sugar beet.  He has purchased annually 250 tons of fertilisers from CSET, 200 tons of lime from the Sugar Company's quarries at Ballybeg and over a three year period purchased £40,000 worth of sprays.  He has helped in the design of the sugar beet harvester and to date has purchased eight of those machines which were built by workers of the Sugar Company.  He has purchased five Sugar Company-built sprayers, Sugar Company silage machines, steerage hoes and seeders.  He is a recognised agricultural contractor who sows, sprays and harvests beet for a large number of farmers in the east Cork area.  His farm has been used extensively by the Sugar Company for field trials down the years and trying out new machinery.  During the period of the row there was a big demonstration of spraying and spraying machines held on his farm by the Sugar Company.  This is the best type of friend the workers in the Sugar Company could have and I am glad to be able to inform Deputy Sherlock that in my recent discussions with CSET workers and with the workers in Erin Foods in east Cork the vast majority of them shared that view.</P>
    <P>The workers in Mallow and Midleton have a far more realistic view of what is needed to promote their interests than Deputy Sherlock who apparently can do no more than bring up this scandalous, mischievous and nonsensical allegation. My election agent is a free citizen living in a democratic society.  As a farm leader he is not answerable to me but to the growers who admire and respect him.  He has contributed single-handedly more to the economy and the sugar industry than Deputy Sherlock and his entire outfit who seem to be hell-bent on destroying the economy in pursuit of their Trotskyite <Col N="1815" /> goal.  If that is successful it will enslave the workers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was told that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was in the Chair but, if I am wrong, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has my humble apologies.</P>
      <P>I see the road ahead for Irish sugar, in spite of the contribution from the State, as being a difficult one.  We must compete against some of the largest and most efficient sugar producers, those in the European market place.  We have small factories and the problems relating to small competition from other crops and this growers such as servicing.  We also have competition from other crops and this accounts to some extent for the difficulty in getting more beet grown.  That is a serious situation now.  For instance, with regard to the dairy industry we must consider the subsidies that are paid for calves and so on.  There is a real tendency for somebody who has cows already to invest more and more in that area.  We have also the lucrative crop of winter wheat which is taking over half of the midlands and the south.  Sugar beet is a paying crop now but the follow-on crops, such as spring barley, are not giving the return that they should.  That is something we must worry about and we must seek better markets for malting barley and do something more with the marketing of seed grain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the whole question of shareholding.  I welcome that suggestion, shareholding by the growers and indeed the workers.  The amount of money might not be very significant but it will increase the involvement of people which I think means a more successful industry.  The Minister mentioned Erin Foods and that the problems of the Sugar Company were to some extent brought about by Erin Foods.  In so far as the Sugar Company had to build up Erin Foods and promote it in the market <Col N="1817" /> place, this is true.  It was a new industry built out of the very limited resources of the Sugar Company.  At that time the people in our own area had to be taught new skills and technologies and we had some very difficult periods in growing these crops.  Quite a lot of them were sold at a loss but despite that the practice has survived and I look at it now as the base for an entirely new food industry.</P>
    <P>We saw in the papers in the past week that we are importing £75 million worth of vegetables which we should be growing, but it has to be done in an organised way and I think the Sugar Company would be the proper agent to initiate vegetable growing by competent people on a national scale because we cannot really consider anything else &mdash; it must be done nationally.  The market must be assessed to find out what is needed and when it is needed.  There is a time factor involved and you have to vary varieties in order to ensure continuity of supply. You must have quality control of all the vegetables, proper packaging, storage and so on.  With improved technology it has been found possible to store fresh vegetables over reasonably long periods without going to the expense of freezing. This should be the new role of Erin Foods as well as continuing and forging ahead with their processing side and certainly the new research and development section in Carlow should forge ahead.  Our supermarkets should be stocked up &mdash; sometimes they are not &mdash; with Erin Foods products.  I can still see a very exciting future for fresh vegetables in this country because, as I have already said in regard to agriculture, we can ill-afford an import bill for something we should and can produce ourselves.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is realistic to expect everybody to dig up their back gardens and produce what they should be producing. With the high costs and so on they might end up not only buying vegetables but wasting money also if they do not have time to devote to them.  I would expect that if we are to tackle the import problem realistically, whether in the case of potatoes or carrots, it will have to be done on a contractual basis, with a fixed price, even a price guaranteed in advance <Col N="1818" /> to encourage growers year in year out to pursue that activity knowing in advance that they will have a reasonable market.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, I am proud to have been associated with the industry down the years in my capacity as chairman of the Sugar Beet Growers' Association and as a founder-director of East Cork Foods Limited &mdash; I am still on the board of that small company.  I am very interested in the food and sugar side of things.  The industry has certainly contributed more than anything else over the years to the welfare of rural Ireland and of the towns fortunate enough to have factories built in them.  That is as relevant now as ever and I am convinced that given the proper impetus we can go from strength to strength.  While there is a lot of money involved now it must be remembered that this money should have been sought years ago.  They should have insisted year by year on getting an allocation and should not have allowed the debt to become so heavy that they are now faced with this massive bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill but I want to say that between June 1981 and January 1982 I did not hear any concern expressed in this House nor was there any effort made to bring in a Bill to provide the equity capital which we can now see that the company so badly needs. <Col N="1820" /> There was no question then about the problems of the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The borrowings of the Irish Sugar Company are so high that a massive amount of the turnover of the company is now being paid in interest on borrowing.  This equity capital should have been put into the company long before this.  I know the operation of the Irish Sugar Company and I know the capital works which have been undertaken by the company in the last four or five years, particularly in the last few years in the Mallow area.  This was done in order to have a more efficient factory for the purpose of giving a better service to beet growers.  It is important to provide the best facilities possible so that the beet grown in that area can be processed and the total acreage of beet can be disposed of by the end of December or early January.  If that is done beet growers will be encouraged to increase their acreage of beet.  The capital works in that area are part of the overall operation of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there is a great future for beet growing.  A great number of people are employed in the sugar industry.  If this company were a private company they would have gone to the wall long ago. There is a great future for the country in State enterprise in industries like the Sugar Company, Bord na Móna, NET and those other companies.  It is important <Col N="1821" /> that this equity capital is provided for the Irish Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>I have been critical in the past of the manner in which the company have been prevented from diversifying.  The Minister should remember that in the past few years it was only natural that the Sugar Company, who are manufacturers of sugar, should want to have some control in the fertiliser industry.  They made an effort to get into that industry in a big way a few years ago by trying to purchase a factory in Waterford.  Some person said no and the Sugar Company did not proceed with the development.  That should be looked into because a fertiliser factory is very complementary to beet growing. I believe that in the past sugar manufacture was a more lucrative business than it has been in the last few years.  The food processing industry should be developed also.  There is no reason why this company should not be able to take over land and grow vegetables to be processed in their factory.  This should be done in a competitive way which would mean jobs and the production of cheap food in our own country.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the grow no beet campaign in the Mallow area, which was referred to by Deputy Hegarty.  The price agreed for the 1982-83 campaign should have been agreed in all the other areas, like it was in Mallow.  I became aware of that because a number of people in the North Cork area came to see me and one of them told me that he was a conacre man, paying £100 an acre for beet on conacre and found he was doing quite well out of it.  He told me he was concerned about the grow no beet campaign and did not see any sense to it.  He told me who was involved in it and thought it need not have gone so far.  He was not the only person who came to me about that.</P>
    <P>This was a most unreasonable campaign. It had some effect on beet growing because it continued even beyond the sowing season and perhaps led to a little reduction in the acreage under beet.  I hope we will be back to the situation we had some years ago.  I am confident we will because the attitude of the company to the growers is to provide the best facilities <Col N="1822" /> and pay the best price for beet.  I believe there will be such a demand for beet acreage that there will have to be a cut-off point.  I have listened to people who will always give an accurate appraisal of the situation and they have told me that there is a great future for sugar production in this country.  The Sugar Company must be in complete control and that is the reason why I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <P>The interest rate on the heavy borrowing by this company will have to be looked at very seriously.  A change is needed in the whole financial system of the country.  It is very important for the Government to have control over credit. This will have to take place if we are to succeed and develop.  The Government must have some say in the control of credit.  This means having some say over the banks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this enabling Bill to increase the capital of the Sugar Company. As a rural Deputy I welcome it, and I am sure it will be welcomed by the entire sugar beet industry, workers and farmers, in areas where the factories are located.  This is only the first stage, we hope, in a development plan for the agri-food industry.  We have heard so often that Ireland has the land, the good pasture and the good soil to enable its people to develop a highly successful food processing industry.  However, we hear of £600 million worth of food imports annually, and that is clearly a situation in 1982, when we are beset by borrowing and trade deficits, that we must be critical of.  If this happened in England it might be tolerated but when it occurs here something is wrong.</P>
      <P>Another impediment to our sugar beet industry is the appearance of sugar imports from France which we have been told are on the increase.  This is worrying and it must be of great concern to the entire industry here.  It must be controlled, irrespective of EEC regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This investment in CSET is long overdue. For many years we have been giving lip service to the agri-food business and I hope that this at last is a genuine effort to develop a branch of the industry which <Col N="1823" /> has tremendous potential.  At a time when we are endeavouring to create jobs and when thousands of jobs are going to the wall, we must try to develop with urgency an industry that has such great potential.  The company have been hamstrung by their need to borrow at such high interest rates.  If we are genuinely concerned to develop this industry the Government must look at the cost of borrowing because it is retarding the growth of the industry we are now talking about.  In consultation with the banks every effort must be made here to introduce a system of cheaper money for such promising enterprises.</P>
    <P>We have had difficulties in regard to Erin Foods.  Efforts are being made to ensure the continued viability of the Tuam factory.  I come from an area that has a sugar factory, in Thurles, which is urgently in need of modernisation, including renewal of plant, and that can be done only by increased investment. Many promises have been made over the years but even today nothing is seen to be happening in Thurles and this is of great concern to the town and the surrounding areas.  In the past 15 years the number of promises we have heard and commitments given to the workers and the sugar beet farmers in the Thurles area would overflow the Shannon.  The work in the factory is being continued with worn-out, outdated machinery.  I make a special appeal to the Minister that the Thurles factory, which is so important to farmers and workers will be given priority in regard to the renewal of machinery.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the effects the Bill will have and I wish the Sugar Company every success.  That will be forthcoming only if there is continuous investment.  I particularly appeal for new investment in the agri-food industry so that instead of importing £600 million worth of food per year we will grow it and process it here and thus help to reduce our external deficits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Sugar Company.  I do not accept Deputy Sherlock's suggestion that the company's achievements have <Col N="1824" /> been due to nationalisation.  I have had long association with the beet growing side of the business and I can say that the growers have been propping up the industry for years through their sheer loyalty in the face of poor price increases. I have been a member of the BGA and I know the situation well.  It will be claimed that in the recent past Irish beet growers got significant price increases, but they have paled into insignificance in the face of increased costs.  The colossal investment in the production of an acre of beet must be of great concern to the company.</P>
      <P>Other problems face the industry as a whole.  For instance, if the harvesting and processing campaign are not adjusted I can foresee beet growers becoming uninterested in growing sugar beet.  The length of the campaign, and the time of the year, are not given due consideration. The Minister comes from a beet growing county, he will be aware of this, and I hope he will ask the company's officials to take note of it.  The beet campaign straddles Christmas and often runs into January.  Such a season is tough on machinery and on man, and men today are looking for easier options.  Therefore, if the beet harvesting season is not shortened there will not be beet growers and if there are not growers there will not be an industry.  The factories should try to gear the campaign to finish by 20 December at the latest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to consider part processing of sugar beet and to make more money available for such an enterprise. As everybody here knows, the Wexford grower has propped up the beet industry for many years.  One quarter of the nation's sugar beet is grown in Wexford but we do not have any industry there apart from growing the beet.  It would make good economic sense if a part processing plant was considered for the Wexford area.  Possibly as much as 150,000 tons of beet is transferred from Wexford to Tuam each year.  There are very high transport costs involved in that transfer and much harm is done to roads by heavy lorries.  If the beet was part processed and then transported to Tuam it would be far less costly for the Sugar <Col N="1825" /> Company and do much less damage to our roads.  It would make good economic sense and I ask the Minister to consider it carefully.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Sugar Company should make every effort to improve the consistency in tare and sugar content because it is in the tare house that the price of beet is decided.  That price is not decided in March or April of any year; it is decided when the beet goes into the factory and the tare house.  There is gross inconsistency in tare content.  There could be a difference of 10 or 15 per cent. The company might claim that the higher percentage was the right figure but the grower will always claim that the lower percentage is the correct figure.  I am asking for more consistency in this matter and I suggest that a visual content of tare should be considered rather than the present system.  I know to my cost, because I was a member of the BGA, that the sugar content given to us by the Sugar Company is often far lower than that proven by independent tests.  I ask the Sugar Company, as a matter of urgency, to take up this point and to consider it very seriously.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister and the Government for making this money available to an industry that can and has been very worthwhile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. L. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, let me welcome the goodwill with which the Bill has been received on all sides of the House.  It demonstrates two things.  It constitutes a recognition of the central role played by the Sugar Company in the development of agriculture in Ireland over the last half-century.  And it places on record the commitment of the House to fostering an ordered future for the company.  Much of what has been said by Deputies calls for no comment from me beyond a simple expression of recognition. Some questions have been raised and I will attempt to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I do so, I think I should recall the basic purpose behind the Bill.  The principal purpose of a capital injection for the company at this time is the broadening <Col N="1826" /> of its equity base.  The element of loan finance in the company's present capital investment programme is far too high, and the element of shareholders' funds is far too low.  This imbalance needs to be corrected.  That is the basic problem we are attempting to deal with and, in doing so, we will be creating the conditions for further ordered development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes's remarks seemed to suggest or hint that the new funding should in some way be project-linked, that it should be employed to finance specific new projects that will be devised. I wholly agree with the concern underlying his remarks.  It is of the utmost importance that the funds are used to back up the company's efforts to modernise and make itself more competitive. But these efforts are already under way, financed by borrowing.</P>
    <P>Nobody would wish to appropriate in a narrow way or to certain specific purposes the funds advanced to the company. The funds will be made available to the company in the spirit of the 1962 Act, namely &ldquo;... on such terms as to repayment, interest and other matters as may be determined by the Minister&rdquo;.  I can assure the House that those terms will be such as to ensure that the capital injections proposed will have their desired effect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes also mentioned the rationalisation plan to be substituted by the company as a condition for the new funding.  As was indicated by the Minister, the submission by the company of a clear and specific programme will be a condition for any allocation of new capital. I would expect this programme to be furnished to my Department at an early date.  Having said that, the approach will be to avoid laying down the details of the rationalisation plan in advance.  This does not mean to say that certain ideas have not been developed.  But what is primarily required is increased overall efficiency. While the immediate purpose of the Bill is to restore financial balance to the company's affairs, this is followed closely by a concern to see that the company moves consistently into the black.</P>
    <P>The figure of £75 million does not imply an immediate injection of that sum. <Col N="1827" /> It reflects rather the kind of figure that the company's equity base would need to be set at taking into account the level of capital investment on which it was embarked to make the sugar industry competitive.  For 1982, the Government will advance £30 million and that will be subject to the conditions already mentioned. I should like to make it clear that this £30 million is available and subject to compliance with the conditions, will be paid in 1982.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes referred to the Minister's assertion that Erin Food was at the root of the company's financial worries. First of all I should like to emphasise that the Government have every expectation that the food division has a future with the company.  But, given the integrated financial structure of the company, there is no point in not recognising what happened in the past.  In effect, profits on sugar which should have been applied towards modernising the sugar factories have had to finance losses on the food side over very many years.  In consequence, the company has had to resort to heavy loan commitments to carry out essential improvements.  I think it is proper to impute the company's recent losses to the food division, even though the interest burden underlying them arises on the sugar side.  The link to the food side, if not direct, is nevertheless real.</P>
    <P>The question of the tightness of the company's financial control was also raised.  Without going into detail on the subject, I should remind the House that when the 1980 irregularities were discovered the company carried out a full investigation and sought the advice of an independent firm of auditors with a view to preventing a recurrence.  I understand that the company has fully implemented the recommendations made.  Deputies will recall that the joint committee dealt with the matter in its report.</P>
    <P>The consultants' report on the company's operations commissioned last year furnished a great deal of information to the Government.  Deputy Dukes would like to see it published, and cites the publication of the joint committee's <Col N="1828" /> report as a precedent.  I can assure the Deputy that the reports are very different in nature.  The consultants' report has a great deal of detailed commercial information which, if put into the hands of the company's competitors, would disadvantage the company in the marketplace. The Minister has therefore decided not to have the report published.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins raised issues of rather wider scope than those which relate strictly to the terms of the Bill.  I could go along with much of what he said but when he seeks to dismiss the response of the market to the company's products as being of secondary importance, then I have to part company with him.  The Sugar Company are up against the giants of the world food industry, as Deputy Hegarty reminded us, and it is necessary to be able to compete effectively with them.  Market demand and market conditions cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>I know that the Sugar Company are encountering difficulties in the retail area, particularly in supermarket chains, and I recognise that some of the methods employed by the company's customers are pretty cut-throat.  But if the company cannot defeat the competition on their own ground, this clearly points up the need for modernisation and greater efficiency. The capital investment programme at present under way is designed to achieve these results.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins expressed concern as to whether the work force at Tuam were consulted on the future of the factory there.  I can assure him the Minister has met the Tuam Workers' Action Committee, and that he has listened to their views.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt put his finger on the one element that will contribute more than any other to assuring the future of the sugar industry in Ireland &mdash; that is the question of the beet acreage.  It is important that a greater area of beet should be grown.  We must have a constant eye on 1984, when quotas will again be discussed in Brussels.  There is still a long way to go before we may be comfortable about the situation.</P>
    <P>There were one or two other points raised by Deputy Ryan.  I want to assure <Col N="1829" /> him that the Thurles factory is scheduled to benefit substantially from the funding being made available in this Bill and its future is assured.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Rationalisation can be very irrational at times.  This is why I am concerned.  We are concerned at the mystery which surrounds the future nationalisation programme of the group.  We hear far too much nowadays about chopping off and paring down and so on.  It is a negative approach to industries.  We have the same situation in NET where there is even talk about a cutback on <Col N="1830" /> security.  So in the absence of some sort of clear statement that, say, on the food side we will be forging ahead with all systems going, I would be very unhappy to agree in the dark to this.</P>

I am very fearful about what this type of mechanically minded operation will finally come out with.  They are not concerned about people and families.  It is more a ruthless balancing of budgets.  In the teeth of a depression it is totally wrong not to be concerned about people.  The whole face of Erin Foods and the Sugar Company could change overnight with improvement in the economy and increased consumer demand.  I hope, before we leave this section, that we will get a commitment from the Minister that there will be no further curtailments in this very valuable industry.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The main purpose of the Bill is to increase the capital of the company from £10 to £75 million and that is what we are doing in sections 2 and 3.  Under section 3 the Minister is enabled to acquire all the capital of the company if he thinks it is desirable and that is where the cost to the State arises.  Presumably plans have been submitted to the Minister by the company and he is satisfied about the justification for authorising an increase in the capital of the company and also satisfied that he would be justified in acquiring all the shares of the company.  Perhaps the Minister would give us a rough idea of the proposals the company have put before him and how it is proposed to use this huge increase in capital.  I realise that it may not be the intention of the company to use all the capital at the same time or <Col N="1831" /> to call on the Minister to put up the money, but the House should have a general idea of what is behind the proposal, the plans the Minister has received, the reports he has obtained on the state of the machinery in each of the company's factories, whether it needs to be replaced and, if so, how much money would be involved.  At first sight an increase from £10 to £75 million is huge but the cost of replacing the very elaborate machinery used in undertakings such as sugar processing is very high.</P>
      <P>Without coming back to the House, the Minister can acquire all the capital of the company at a cost of £65 million and this is the only time Members will have an opportunity to find out what proposals have been made to the Minister.  I am sure there have been protracted negotiations between the Department and the company.  Deputy Hegarty is satisfied with the Bill and welcomes it but I feel the House should not be asked to vote in blinkers for this measure.</P>

      <P>The increase from £10 million to £75 million looks huge to the layman but it seems that this is necessary. The Department hardly agreed on this sum without receiving plans and proposals from the Sugar Company.  We all agree that our industries must be competitive if we are to survive and we need the most up-to-date machinery and technical expertise.  If machinery is allowed to run down over a long period it may cost ten times as much to replace.  The Minister might tell us what proposals he has received.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> As I was saying, I have read through this speech which the Minister circulated and cannot find the information which I asked for, which was a general idea of the proposals put to the Minister, or his Department, by the company, which justifies the passing by this House of an amendment of the capital limit of the company, thereby giving authority to the Minister to acquire £75 million worth of capital and put £75 million worth of money into this company.  When I asked the Minister for that information in the early stages, he referred me to this speech in an insulting manner and said that if I was here when he was delivering his speech I would not have had to ask that question because the information I sought was contained in it.  When he consulted his advisers he discovered for the first time that he did not have the information although he tried to be smart and tell me that if I had listened to his speech I would have got the information.  He stood up a second time and said he did not have the information and that, if he did have it, he did not think he would be at liberty to give it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It gives me no pleasure to say that but I will not take ignorant lectures from the Minister of State or anyone else when I come in here to perform my duty.  In the interests of employment and of keeping the sugar factory going, we will not <Col N="1837" /> obstruct the passage of this Bill.  It is an extraordinary state of affairs that we are being asked to pass a Bill in which under sections 2 and 3, if taken together, we are authorising the Minister to invest either £65 million or £75 million in the Sugar Company and yet we cannot get elementary information from the Minister of State, who came in here on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture who is God knows where, to put this measure through.</P>
    <P>This is not good enough.  If the Minister does not have the information, he should get it.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to raise from £30 million to £80 million the limitation both on the aggregate borrowing powers of Bord Gáis Éireann for capital purposes and on the aggregate of such borrowings which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current limitation of £30 million is set by sections 23 and 25 of the Gas Act, 1976, as amended by the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1980.  Section 23 refers to the aggregate of outstanding borrowings for capital purposes and section 25 relates to <Col N="1838" /> outstanding borrowings, other than borrowings out of the Central Fund, which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  To date the total borrowings of the board amount to approximately £8 million and the amendments now proposed are necessary to enable them to finance the Cork to Dublin natural gas pipeline and other projects.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann was established in 1976 and undertook, as its first project, to pipe natural gas, which is of very high quality and calorific value, from the Kinsale Head Field to the Cork area.  This necessitated an onshore pipeline and associated transmission facilities necessary for the distribution of gas to users such as the ESB, NET, Cork Gas Company and other industries in and around Cork.  As Deputies are aware, this goal was achieved successfully and effectively by the board.</P>
    <P>At the time of the decision to proceed to commercial production, the Kinsale Head Field reserves were estimated to contain 1 trillion, that is, 1 million million cubic feet of recoverable gas.  This was sufficient to maintain a daily production of about 124 million cubic feet over a 20-year period and the contracted off-take in the Cork area was set at this figure in an agreement between BGE and Marathon.</P>
    <P>Following experience of actual production from the gas field and review of its characteristics generally, the recoverable reserves have now been formally revised to 1.35 trillion cubic feet &mdash; an increase of 35 per cent on the original estimate. This is sufficient to support production of approximately 180 million cubic feet per day over the balance of the 20-year contract period.  Current off-take is approximately at this level and is accounted for by an additional allocation of gas to the ESB for 1982 and 1983.</P>
    <P>The upwards revaluation of the gas field's reserves by 35 per cent was a major factor in deciding to proceed with extension of the natural gas grid.  Another important factor was the report of the Town Gas Review Committee which concluded that there were distinct advantages, both in economic and energy terms, in allocating a maximum proportion <Col N="1839" /> of the natural gas resource to the premium markets in the Dublin area and other populated centres, especially those with existing town gas industries.  The present Government approved such a policy because of their emphasis on more efficient and economic use of natural gas, savings on imports of premium fuels such as gas oil, revitalisation of the town gas industry and because it will make available to a large sector of the population an indigenous premium fuel.  I wish to see the natural gas grid extended to as many areas as possible outside Dublin where this can be done economically and efficiently.</P>
    <P>Clearly the construction of the Cork to Dublin pipeline is the first priority and will form the backbone of the national gas grid.  The contract for the construction of the Cork/Dublin pipeline to Dublin City Gate has been awarded to the Irish/Dutch consortium of Irishenco/Nacap at a cost of £27.4 million. The overall cost of the project is expected not to exceed £45 million.  This includes the cost of acquisition of wayleaves, engineering, communications and other related projects not covered by the pipeline construction contract itself. When provision is made for construction of the link from the City Gate, beyond Clondalkin, into Dublin Gas and the ESB, the overall cost of the project is estimated at under £60 million.  Contracts for both parts of the link into the city from Brownsbarn to Grove Road on the canal and from there to Dublin Gas and the ESB, have just been awarded to the Irish/UK joint venture of Murphy International/Murphy Pipelines.  All projects are expected to be completed in time to have Kinsale gas flowing into Dublin by early next year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that the most efficient use that can be made of the Kinsale field is to maximise the availability of gas for the premium domestic market and for use in industry and commerce generally.  As I indicated, the displacement of imported premium fuels such as gas oil is a primary aim.  The central heating market in houses, offices and factories will be an important area in this strategy. <Col N="1840" /> After that we must look to the availability of gas for direct use in industry.  While these markets are being built up, the sale of residual gas to the ESB will contribute quite significantly to the economics of the pipeline and will generate additional substantial revenue for BGE and the Exchequer.  Moreover, the availability of gas to the ESB will help to stabilise electricity prices to the consumer and save on oil imports thus assisting our balance of payments.  Current savings on imports from all sales of gas by BGE are running at £200 million and will increase over the next few years as the gas grid is expanded to replace the maximum amount of premium fuels.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the allocation to Dublin Gas alone would reduce our energy import bill during 1983 by about £17 million on present consumption levels. As Dublin Gas are confident that they can expand the market for gas by six to eight times the present level, savings on imports by the end of the decade should be very significant indeed reaching a level of about £80 million a year in 1982 terms.  On the financial side, it is the Government's intention that the estimated cost of the entire project, that is, £60 million should be 30 per cent funded from BGE's own internal resources.  This provides a reasonable level of internal funding while ensuring that a substantial proportion of BGE's surplus arising from the sale of gas will accrue to the Exchequer. The remaining 70 per cent of capital investment will be mainly funded by borrowings from the European Investment Bank on terms which are currently being negotiated.  This will leave a proportion of borrowings to be raised on the home market in a manner still to be determined.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that our primary objective is to bring gas to Dublin.  This is as it should be.  An improved gas supply to the existing market in Dublin and the availability of Kinsale gas at competitive prices to new customers will ensure that the premium market is exploited quickly and efficiently.  Because of this I was pleased to be able to announce recently that agreement had been reached between Bord Gáis Éireann and the <Col N="1841" /> Dublin Gas Company on the main provisions of a contract for the supply of gas. This will clear the way for Dublin Gas to receive supplies from Kinsale in January next year, but, as I also said, we must cast our sights beyond Dublin.  I am anxious that other towns should have Kinsale gas.  I am particularly concerned that existing town gas companies should be given the opportunity to get Kinsale gas where practicable.  Town gas companies such as Limerick, Clonmel and Waterford either have had consultancy studies carried out or have such studies in progress. In addition BGE have recently completed preliminary route studies on possible spur lines to Limerick and Waterford and these studies are being considered at present.  While I am not now in a position to give a time scale for the completion of this essential planning for the second phase of the development of our natural gas grid, I can assure Deputies that it is being progressed as quickly as possible having due regard to all factors involved.</P>
    <P>Deputies will of course be aware that Cork Gas Company are already receiving supplies of natural gas.  At present the company are using the gas as a feedstock for the manufacture of town gas.  I hope that the company will be in a position to complete their programme of conversion to direct use of natural gas as quickly as possible.  I look forward to seeing substantial growth in their volume of sales and simultaneous expansion of their distribution system as natural gas becomes available direct to the consumer.  Indeed, BGE are now anxious to proceed to the quick conclusion of a contract with the company in order to facilitate these developments.  Concrete progress has been made and I hope to see the matter brought to a conclusion shortly.</P>
    <P>The extension of the grid has also presented us with a valuable opportunity for positive and worthwhile co-operation with the North.  I recently met with Mr. Adam Butler, the Minister of State with responsibility for energy matters at the Northern Ireland office, to discuss a possible supply of natural gas for Northern Ireland.  The discussions covered supply schedules, duration of contract, price, <Col N="1842" /> price review mechanisms, capital investment and transmission costs.  We reached agreement on the main terms on which gas could be supplied to Northern Ireland and the Minister of State and I will be recommending these to our respective Governments.  We should be in a position to deliver gas to Northern Ireland during 1984.</P>
    <P>This will be a very significant extension of our gas grid and I am confident that the very great benefits to be derived from it will be quickly reflected in our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>The whole development programme which I have just outlined will require quite considerable capital expenditure on the part of BGE.  As I have explained, this will be met partially from surplus revenue from the sale of natural gas and partially from borrowings to be raised by BGE.  Over the next few years, as the various stages of development take shape, I anticipate that borrowings not exceeding £80 million will meet BGE's requirements.</P>
    <P>This type of capital investment is to be welcomed because of the substantial benefits which can be expected to accrue to the economy.  I have already outlined some of these benefits.  Other immediate benefits which should also be mentioned relate to the very high level of Irish input into the project and the jobs it provides. During the period leading up to the commencement of the construction phase, there was great awareness of the need to maximise the Irish content.  The co-operation of the IIRS, the Confederation of Irish Industry and others, was a major effort to ensure that the opportunity for use of Irish goods and services was highlighted. As a result I am pleased to be able to tell the House that, notwithstanding that the major items, that is the pipe and fittings, had to be manufactured abroad, 60 per cent of the value of the pipeline project will be sourced in Ireland.  In terms of jobs this means that 700-800 Irish people will be employed on the project overall.</P>
    <P>The building of the works main into Dublin city and further extensions of the grid which I have mentioned also promise substantial employment as the various <Col N="1843" /> projects get under way.  That this level of home input should have been achieved on a project of a type and size new to this country is a tremendous tribute to all those who contributed in bringing it about.  We must not overlook the immense benefits to town gas enterprises. As I indicated earlier, the distribution of gas through these enterprises will revitalise what was an ailing industry; give security of employment to workers; provide opportunities for investment in what is becoming an expanding industry with bright prospects and provide a unique opportunity for private industry to co-operate with the State in maximising the distribution and use of Kinsale gas.</P>
    <P>I think we all appreciate the importance of the Kinsale Head field as a natural resource.  As I have said, the most effective use we can make of it is to have it quickly and widely available for use in the premium markets, principally domestic use, and after that, commercial and industrial use.  The whole project is a formidable one based on an indigenous resource which can sustain itself.  I am confident that the House will support this Bill which is designed solely to enable the board to borrow for the project.  I therefore recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill and I take some pride in being able to say that this is the only amendment to the Act since it was introduced in 1976 and the amendment is to increase the borrowing powers of BGE.  Given the fact that this was at the time a totally new undertaking by the Irish Government to introduce legislation to deal what was then and unfortunately still is this unique indigenous source of energy, the Act seems to have stood the passage of time fairly well, except in this one regard of increasing the borrowing powers which may have been increased once before, but that is all.  At least if there are defects in the Act they have not shown up in its operation in the last six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will recall very briefly to the House the circumstances in which the last Bill was introduced.  It coincided with what was perhaps the most unhappy <Col N="1844" /> period for this country since the Second World War, and that was the energy crisis of the early seventies.  This find of natural gas off the south coast of Ireland was a challenge and a hope and it gave a sense of optimism in what was otherwise a very bleak field.  We had moved through the sixties fuelling a very impressive industrial expansion on the basis of cheap energy, cheap oil prices from the Middle East and that came to an abrupt and shattering end in the autumn of 1973 at the time of the first flexing of OPEC muscles.  I was charged at the time with the responsibility of deciding on the use of this natural gas which was then, as the Minister said in his speech, estimated to come out of the ground at about 125 million cubic feet a day which has been increased to 180 million cubic feet a day. The problem then was to get the maximum benefit into the economy as quickly as possible while negotiating a contract with the developer of the field at the cheapest possible price.  Naturally, there was a relationship between the speed at which the gas could be taken out of the ground and used inside the country and the price to be paid for the gas used.  If the developer was not to see a return on his money for 50 or 60 years or if the gas was to come out of the ground at a slow rate, say 20 or 30 million cubic feet a day, then the price would be higher.  It is generally accepted now that the negotiated price for that natural gas was extremely advantageous to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Government were faced with the task then of finding major users for the gas so that it could be brought ashore and the contract that had been negotiated with Marathon made effective as quickly as possible.  It was decided that there should be two major users, the ESB and the NET factory at Marino Point in Cork. There was a lot of criticism at the time in the House and outside it.  One criticism was that the figure of £25 million included in the 1976 Bill was too small for the task An Bord Gáis were given.  The other was about using such a large proportion of the field for the generation of electricity. The only two amendments to the Act were the one we have before us tonight and the one in 1980 which increased the <Col N="1845" /> borrowing powers of the company to £30 million and now to £80 million for a specific purpose.  Therefore the House should accept that the original figure was correct.</P>
    <P>There is a benefit not only for this company but for the ESB and many other State companies.  Where borrowing limits are written into Acts they should not be so substantial that the affairs of the company do not come before the House for discussion for a number of years.  It is better to write in amounts of money which bring Ministers back to the House with amending legislation to allow a discussion on the activities of the companies in relatively short periods of time.  By that I do not mean every 12 months.  That would not be realistic.  They should have to come back to us every two or three years.  Unfortunately we are having a truncated discussion on this Bill tonight because of pressure on Dáil time.  It would be useful if every couple of years Ministers had to justify the activities of companies over the previous two or three years.  This would give an opportunity to many Deputies who would have useful things to say about the operations of those companies.</P>
    <P>The other point is the allocation of natural gas to the ESB for the generation of electricity.  There are two sides to that argument.  One is that it should be used as directly as possible, and that the wastage which is alleged in the use of natural gas for the generation of electricity should be avoided.  That was one of the things which had to go on the scales when the decision was made nine years ago on how to use this gas.  On the other side of the scales was the benefit to the economy of getting this cheap gas in 1973 terms and in 1982 terms into the economy as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>There is a legitimate policy difference between individual companies and the Government.  I know my point of view is not held at present by the establishment, referring in the broadest terms to the Government and the civil service.  A beneficial use of this natural gas is to give it to the ESB at its contract price and allow the benefits of a cheap energy source to be fed into industry.  I know <Col N="1846" /> there are legitimate differing viewpoints on that.  I should like the Minister to tell me exactly what the Government's policy is with regard to the pricing of natural gas for electricity consumption, for the gas consuming companies and for industries outside the State sector.  I gather the policy is a pragmatic one, that is, to charge what the traffic can bear to each individual user.</P>
    <P>When the Minister announced the conclusion of the contract between An Bord Gáis and the Dublin Gas Company, he said this would mean a benefit of 30 or 40 per cent to the consumers of gas in the Dublin area.  He may have been making that assumption on the basis of the gas being given to the Dublin Gas Company at a contract price from Marathon, or a near contract price plus an addition for the conveyance of the gas.  He may have meant it was a real profit to An Bord Gáis, or that it was the energy-related price.  There is an argument to be made for each of those pricing policies.  If an energy-related price is being charged to the Dublin Gas Company, and if it were to be extended to all users of gas, that closes off the option for the Minister to give a hidden subsidy to some sections of industry, such as NET, if they are to be charged on the same basis.  There should be clarification on that point.</P>
    <P>With regard to the contract the Minister signed with the Dublin Gas Company, the following morning the papers said something to this effect: &ldquo;Late last night or in the early hours of this morning this deal had been concluded with a benefit of 30 to 40 per cent for the Dublin gas consumers.&rdquo;  The previous night on the 9 o'clock news the Minister had an announcement to the effect that a contract had been concluded.  This was at the time of the Dublin West by-election.  At the time there were large advertisements in the papers from the Dublin Gas Company extolling the virtues of natural gas and the benefit it would be to the population when it was piped and used by the company.</P>
    <P>It has always been the practice that, as far as possible, State companies should be allowed to run their own affairs.  The philosophy behind the setting up of State <Col N="1847" /> companies was that they should be separated from political control and allowed to do the correct thing within the terms of reference laid down in the Act under which they were set up.  It is regrettable that in this instance the Minister's enthusiasm to gather votes in Dublin West led him to forget his better judgment and make an announcement before the deal was concluded.  If my impression is wrong, the Minister may correct me. That was the impression I got that weekend.  If the whole thing was coincidental, I must congratulate the Minister on being fortunate enough to be in the right place at the right time, but unfortunately not getting the right result.</P>
    <P>The decision to extend the pipeline to Dublin is correct, even though I would have had some doubts about it on the basis of the original estimate of the size of the field.  The fact that it is approximately 50 per cent greater than was originally thought presents An Bord Gáis, the Minister and the Department with the problem of how to use it under the terms of the contract and get major users to absorb it.  On balance, extending the pipeline to Dublin was the correct decision. The contract price for the laying of the pipe seems to be extremely good.  A good job was done there.  I was glad to hear the Minister say there would be a large Irish input of workers and material in the laying of the pipeline.</P>
    <P>I am going to make a suggestion with which I hope the Minister will agree and maybe do something about.  For political and economic reasons the extension of the pipeline to Northern Ireland is a good idea but I hope we might even go beyond that.  As the Minister will remember, there was some controversy last year between politicians in the North and the United Kingdom Government about the desirability of connecting the North of Ireland to Scotland and tying into the United Kingdom grid.  If we are going to extend our pipeline into the North, and have a grid covering the entire island, the economics at least should be looked at and talks entered into with the British Department of Energy on the feasibility of our funding the laying of that pipeline <Col N="1848" /> from the nearest point in Northern Ireland to Scotland allowing us to enjoy a common grid and buy our gas back from the United Kingdom.  That makes economic sense.  It would be a great benefit to have the system running not just between these two islands, but at a future date, through all Europe.  We should suggest to the United Kingdom Government that we would be willing to fund the laying of a pipe between the nearest point in the North of Ireland and Scotland if they would agree to see us back natural gas.</P>
    <P>The benefits are obvious.  It would give us a much bigger pool of gas to draw on, it would allow us, with confidence, to extend our grid to not alone Dublin and Cork but along the east coast from Dublin, across to the west coast through the Golden Vale, Limerick, Shannon, Galway and on to Sligo.  We heard of the unfortunate experience with the interconnector in Northern Ireland and I will deal with that on another Bill, but I would not be deterred by that unfortunate experience.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to press ahead with negotiations with the United Kingdom Government on the laying of this pipeline. The profits, if An Bord Gáis are allowed to keep them, would appear to justify the laying of that pipeline.  I made an inquiry about this in the last few days and was told the laying of the pipeline under water would be four times that laid over land.  If the crossing between Northern Ireland and Scotland is about 20 miles, it would cost between £40 million and £50 million to lay the pipeline. Given the projected profits, that would not be outside the capabilities of the gas company to fund.</P>
    <P>Despite whatever internal financial problems the United Kingdom Government may have &mdash; if my memory serves me rightly that was the reason they gave for refusing to build the pipeline &mdash; they should put them aside if we are willing to build the pipeline, and allow the gas to be supplied to the North.  The decision by the Irish Government to extend the pipeline to the North will show their concern for the economic development of the people in the North.  Its advantage to the <Col N="1849" /> Irish Government would be that we could take part in a grid which would encompass both islands and give us the confidence to extend the grid to other parts of the island.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a tribute to the IFA and the ICMSA for their co-operation.  We are frequently told that the people of Ireland are conservative and that there is no more conservative body than the farming community.  When I was engaged in the negotiations of the wayleaves for this pipeline I found both farming organisations extraordinarily open and appreciative of the necessity for them to co-operate for the benefit of the industry and towns in having gas pipes laid through their land.  There has been some agitation since about the method of laying the pipeline from Cork to Dublin, but it does not appear to be affecting the laying of that pipeline, I think it is going ahead on schedule, despite some very public protestations on behalf of a very small number of people who I do not believe represent either the IFA or the ICMSA.  I appreciated at that time, and I am sure every Minister for Energy appreciates this too, that it was possible for An Bord Gáis to negotiate with the parent bodies about the laying of wayleaves through land and that that agreement was abided by to the letter by individuals of the associations whose lands were affected.</P>
    <P>It is general knowledge that every gas company, bar one, in this country have had problems in recent years.  Their saviour will be natural gas.  I am pleased to see from the Minister's speech that the Cork Gas Company are using natural gas and converting it into town gas, and that they are proceeding with the programme which will mean the conversion of appliances to take natural gas in its raw state. This will mean a huge capital investment because the pipeline under the ground will have to be treated as well as the home appliances.  This is even more so in Dublin because the Dublin plant has not been kept as up to date as the Cork plant.</P>
    <P>In the original Act there is a section that allows the Government to invest in gas undertakings.  These undertakings are divided into two categories.  There <Col N="1850" /> are those like the Limerick Gas Company, which is owned by the local authority, and there are others that have a normal shareholding and are quoted on the stock market.  These are in Dublin and Cork.  It would not be an unnatural extension of the role of An Bord Gáis to have a greater say in the end distribution of gas.  That is easy for me to suggest from the Opposition benches but it presents enormous problems not only for the Minister's Department but also for the Department of Finance.  The benefits of the gas at any stage will be huge and we should make sure that the public get the benefit.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister made the following comment:</P>
    <P>On the financial side it is the Government's intention that the estimated cost of the entire project, that is, £60 million, should be 30 per cent funded from BGE's own internal resources. This provides a reasonable level of internal funding while ensuring that a substantial proportion of BGE's surplus arising from the sale of gas will accrue to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what this means.  Is it the intention of the Government in future to take an amount in excess of the 30 per cent used for building pipelines and other capital undertakings into the normal revenue of the Exchequer or is the Minister counting that 30 per cent as part of the general capital investment by the Government?  In his speech the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The remaining 70 per cent of capital investment will be mainly funded by borrowings from the European Investment Bank on terms which are currently being negotiated.  This will leave a proportion of borrowings to be raised on the home market in a manner still to be determined.</P>
    <P>The sums do not add up and I should like some clarification on the point.  Probably there is a simple explanation but it is not clear from the speech and I should like the Minister to enlarge on that matter. Will the board have their profits creamed off by the Exchequer on an annual basis? <Col N="1851" /> This could be a method for future Ministers of Finance to manipulate the price of gas so that more revenue would accrue to the Exchequer as a kind of hidden tax. I do not greatly object to that and some Minister might argue it would be a good thing.  My point is that we need much clearer policies on the matter.</P>
    <P>The budget had a sum of £28 million included in it, the amount of profits of BGE.  If the profits next year are £200 million, will the Government take that into their budgetary arithmetic in January 1983?  Will the policy always be to take whatever surplus cash the Government decide the board have and use it to finance general day-to-day spending?  Is what has happened with regard to the £28 million a once-off operation or will a fixed sum be taken every year?  Would it be more desirable for the Government to forget about the profits of BGE, to allow the profits to be reined in and give the consumer the benefit of cheap energy?  All these matters have not been discussed adequately.  The position has arisen this year because it was only at this time that the surplus was thrown up. However, the matter is of concern not just to the Government.  If enormous profits are generated by BGE, Members of this House should have an opportunity to debate how to use the profits to best advantage.</P>
    <P>My own preference would be to use the gas as a cheap energy source for industry and I make no apologies for that. Other European countries adopt this approach.  We will not progress unless we have an enormous increase in exports in the years to come and we cannot have that increase on a level that will absorb our young unemployed unless we can sell our goods at competitive prices.  That means controlling the cost of producing goods but one of the major costs in the last eight or nine years has been the cost of energy.  I am sure the answer I will be given will be that the EEC will not allow it.  There are very many things the EEC do not allow but nobody seems to listen except the Irish.  In other countries a subsidy is given to industry by providing energy from natural resources at prices <Col N="1852" /> that are not energy-related even though EEC policy is that all energy should be charged at oil-related prices.  This is done for conservation purposes.  I do not believe that is happening in other countries.</P>
    <P>I do not know but I think the pragmatic approach is probably the policy at the moment.  In other words, each user is charged a different price depending on ability to pay.  Thus, NET who have not the ability to pay, get the rock bottom price plus some administration charges; probably Cork Gas, the next user, pay the top of the market price which may be still below the price of naphtha, the most expensive commodity for making natural gas, and the ESB get a price somewhere in between.</P>
    <P>If BGE are engaged in a policy of this kind, are they doing so of their own accord or do the Government make decisions by instructing them what to charge each customer?  If we continue with the pragmatic policy which I think is the policy at the moment, it will be very difficult for Members of this House to judge if BGE are operating efficiently.  If we have the energy-related price, the Exchequer will get the benefit of huge surpluses of profits from BGE.  If that is so, I think that very shortly the Minister for Finance or the Government should state that this is the policy that will be pursued for the future, that BGE will charge an energy-related price and that the profits of the board will be taken into the general revenue pool.  The policy that I would pursue would be to ensure that the benefits would be given indirectly to industry, either by way of cheap gas for the ESB to allow them to maintain or even reduce the price of electricity or as a feedstuff to industry at a special price that would allow industry to produce goods at very competitive prices and thereby boost exports.</P>
    <P>The four points, then, to which I should like the Minister to refer are: first, the pricing policy of BGE, secondly, some explanation on the funding, thirdly, the question of the desirability of at least examining the possibility of BGE having some say in the end distribution of the gas through the Gas Appliance Company; <Col N="1853" /> and, lastly, the question of an approach by the Minister or the Government to the British Government to allow BGE to fund an Irish Sea crossing so that the Irish grid which could then be very much extended and the British gas grid would be cross feeding each other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barry has covered the ground fairly well.  Indeed, he has stolen some of my thunder on this issue.  I welcome the many decisions that have been made by the Government to enable BGE to develop their programme, in this case the laying of the pipeline.  One is rather surprised to find that, although this recently established State board have shown a considerable profit, in order to undertake the project we are talking of they must go on borrowing. One questions whether that kind of policy is the right policy to allow the board to adopt in view of the fact that the quickening rates of interest on borrowings are bedevilling the whole industrial development.</P>
      <P>It is surprising, too, having regard to the figures given in respect of savings in the importations of fuels, that the ESB as a result of being able to buy gas from BGE are not in a position to reduce the cost of electricity.  People are not able to pay their electricity bills.</P>
      <P>The other point I wish to make is that the purposes for which the gas is being used constitute a waste of gas of the high quality involved.  Perhaps crackdown could be used for the development of petro-chemical industries and, as has been mentioned, for feedstock for industry.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us whether BGE have any policy in this regard.</P>
      <P>There is concern in the Mitchelstown-Mallow area about the failure of the board to provide the spurs for the eventuality of high industry in that area being able to avail of the gas.  I understand that a request made through the local authorities in this regard was not acceded to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the employment content of the project will be between 700 and 800 people.  I am wondering where he got those figures <Col N="1854" /> from since the indications in respect of the development under way at present are that there are very few people employed and that there will not be any great amount of employment in the laying of the pipeline.  This is the message I have been getting from the people in east Cork who have been seeking employment.  Is there some further development to take place that will bear out the sort of employment figures the Minister is talking of?</P>
    <P>Like the previous speaker, I welcome also the Minister's statement regarding co-operation with the North in this matter with a view to supplying natural gas to that part of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One has some difficulty in assessing current Government policy in relation to BGE.  There has not been very much to go on in the past two or three months.  However, in fairly global terms I shall put the views of this party on the matter.</P>
      <P>At present NET are getting about one-third of the field's output.  For that information I am relying on the data that was available to me when I served as a member of the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies.  In crude terms the ESB get the other two-thirds and in between there is a percentage to Cork gas and another to commercial users, though not very much in terms of the total output.  Roughly speaking NET get the gas at what I would classify as the energy-related price per therm.  I am not breaching any confidentiality when I say that there is available published information relative to royalties.  This shows that NET pay a third of the price on an energy-related basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a massive price transfer subsidy from the field which, in turn, is severely reflected in the accounts of NET in so far as it protects the losses of NET from being as substantial as they would otherwise be.  Also &mdash; and this is a matter of serious national policy &mdash; it constitutes a major subsidy of the exports of NET; the subsidy is exported.  I will not indulge in the convolution that occurs there in the context of foreign farmers getting <Col N="1855" /> Irish fertiliser under the common agricultural policy on subsidised Irish gas input and feedstock.  But it is a factor we must consider seriously.  In any event NET receive a massive subsidy per therm.</P>
    <P>Speaking in very crude global terms, as I understand it, the ESB &mdash; I have not my notes with me here &mdash; would be paying what I would regard as half of the energy-related price; my energy-related concept per therm is in the 30 pences and, crudely speaking, the ESB are paying half.  That is as I see the situation obtaining. A quarter of the ESB's total feedstock is natural gas, again my surmise. Therefore, there is a major subsidy from the field on a price transfer basis to the ESB.  Arising out of all that arithmetic &mdash; which comprises a two-thirds transfer pricing subsidy to NET and a 50 per cent transfer pricing subsidy to the ESB, the profits of Bord Gáis this year will be approximately £30 million; having done all that they will still make £30 million in 1982.  I would estimate that next year Bord Gáis will make between £40 million and £50 million profits; this year £28.5 million will go to the Exchequer and next year I suppose the Minister for Finance could pick up anything between £40 million and £45 million, probably at the top, £50 million.  Were the subsidies not being given and were the two main users being charged the full energy-related price, not necessarily an oil-related price but broadly related price, Bord Gáis probably would be returning to the Exchequer this year, am I wrong in saying, £100 million, which would be reflected in this year's budget?</P>
    <P>As a former member of the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies, speaking with hindsight, we very nearly got round to discussing Bord Gáis and to reviewing their operations.  The kinds of questions I am posing now are those I remember I was willing to ask had the second last Dáil lasted and had we got round to debating the issue of Bord Gáis. The reason I pose those questions and mention those broad, crude facts, which I do not think are that inaccurate, is that as far as I am concerned what should <Col N="1856" /> happen in relation to Bord Gáis is that NET should be charged the full energy-related price per therm for their feedstock by the State, by the Government, through the contract mechanism.  I shall go further and say that I am strongly of the view that, if we are to develop a coherent energy policy and a natural gas policy &mdash; one which will last for 20 years because that is the life of the field &mdash; the ESB should be charged the full energy-related price for their feedstock &mdash; no messing.  That would mean that the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Energy, the Government of the day, would have, this year, £100 million, next year £120 million, £150 million, £200 million and so on; then, consciously and deliberately we decide.</P>
    <P>The price of electricity is very dear, the ESB are experiencing difficulties.  They have a price increase application with the National Prices Commission requiring sanction.  They want to put up the price of electricity: all right, give them an Exchequer subsidy, a subsidy through the Cabinet mechanism, from the Minister to the State body, when one will have control over the situation.  Admittedly at that stage the board of the ESB will be beside themselves with anger, frustration, denunciation of the Minister and four-letter expletives will emerge from each member of the board towards the Minister but we would have control of the situation. Through a process of quite deliberate subsidisation by the State, if it is deemed to be desirable by the State in the decades ahead, the price of electricity will be kept down.  The State might decide quite consciously and deliberately that, as far as industry is concerned, a higher proportion of subsidisation will go to the industrial user of the ESB as distinct perhaps from the domestic consumer, a conscious decision by the Government.  The options will not reside in the internal pricing policy of the board of the ESB which, by the way, I think we all concede is a highly efficient State-sponsored body.  By and large I have no quibbles with its general productivity and efficiency, as such; it is one of our better State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>Likewise Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta, I <Col N="1857" /> argued passionately in regard to NET at that Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies.  It has been suggested that we have been giving a subsidy to NET over and above their losses, that we have been giving them a gas subsidy by virtue of charging them approximately one-third of the energy-related price, a subsidy of £25 million to £35 million a year to produce fertilisers to export, for farmers to put on land so as to obtain benefit from the common agricultural policy against Irish farmers.  If we decide it is necessary and desirable to keep NET as a fertiliser-production unit, that we want to keep the jobs going in Cork and Arklow, a conscious political and Government decision that the board of NET should have a transfer State subsidy to meet their losses, fair enough, that is a political decision, a Cabinet decision.</P>
    <P>In the context of the management of our State-sponsored bodies they should pay the full price with no hidden subsidies. When Aer Lingus or CIE get fuel, the ESB get natural gas, or any State-sponsored body avail of the resources of the State, they should pay the full price. Everything should be explicit rather than implicit.  It should be known what they are paying for their feedstock and are getting explicitly from the State by way of subsidisation.  There is nothing wrong or immoral about subsidisation.  It is nothing to be ashamed of but such a change would be good for the morale of An Bord Gáis.</P>
    <P>Now that the contract has been agreed between the Minister for Industry and Energy and his colleague in Northern Ireland, Mr. Adam Butler, the terms of it should be revealed.  There is undue secrecy here about what we are up to in terms of energy and Government contracts. I am a firm advocate of normal commercial confidentiality to protect the interests of State negotiations.  I do not believe we should behave in an irresponsible way in those areas but now that the contract has been agreed the main terms of it should be made public.  Our people have the right to know.  It is likely that the Minister has got a good deal but the terms of it should be out in the open.  The price which NET pays per therm for the <Col N="1858" /> natural gas should be made known and so also should the price the ESB pays.</P>
    <P>The accounts of State-sponsored bodies and the reports of An Bord Gáis should contain that information.  It would get rid of a lot of speculation and rumour and put everybody on to a footing of reality rather than a footing of financial press speculation.  Admittedly, if the British Government said they did not agree that the terms should be made known I would respect that and would not ask that the terms be disclosed, but if that is not the case the terms should be made public.  I do not think the Minister would be unduly concerned if he is accused of selling an Irish natural resource to the North at a give-away price because I know he does not indulge in that area.</P>
    <P>The budgets of the next few years should give a full revenue return of An Bord Gáis and we should be told what proportion of the revenue of the board is devoted to the ESB and so on.  The consumers will then know what they are getting. There is the other alternative, what one might call generally unappreciated transfer price subsidies, but in the long run, it is not good.  I agree with many of the observations made by Deputy Peter Barry in regard to the construction work done from Cork to Dublin.  It proves conclusively that we can match international technology and use a natural resource effectively.  We can hold our heads high in regard to this work.  We have a magnificent natural resource in the form of the 1.35 trillion cubic feet of natural gas but we have to conserve that in a rational way.  The Irish people must be told that this is not to be frittered away and that, notwithstanding that we have this resource, its value and its worth to the Irish people is so great that it cannot be dispensed cheaply.  People have been told that the price of gas and electricity will be brought down and that everybody will benefit enormously from the gas find but we must exercise a cautious and careful national resource policy.  Some of the points I have made may be unorthodox and painful for the consumers but I do not think it would do any harm to impose those views.  A former Minister responsible <Col N="1859" /> for Energy, Deputy O'Malley, who never courted popularity, would, I am sure, share my views on this.  I never discussed the matter with him but I know he was always prepared to put the realities directly to the users and the boards concerned. I believe it will be possible to reach consensus on this vital natural resource and use it in the national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of welcoming the setting up of An Bord Gáis by the last Government. It was a very good move.  I welcome the initiative of that Government.  It may be said that it was a bit late in the day to set up such a board and that it should have happened decades previously but, like so many other things in Ireland, it was better late than never.  It was appropriate that the new board was established by the last Government to advise and plan our energy needs in the years ahead.  The Minister must have the best expertise and advice available in regard to this area because he is working in a jungle of multinational oil companies who have tremendous experience, power and influence in dealing with energy and making money throughout the world.  The Minister has considerable experience in the business field and that is a great asset but it is important that he has the best advice available at all times.  I have had some experience of dealing with the new board and the people I met impressed me a great deal.  They are skilled and talk intelligently about our energy needs.</P>
      <P>The Minister is fortunate in having these advisers available to him.  The record of An Bord Gáis is good.  By all accounts their operations since they were set up have been successful and I am not merely talking about making money but in laying the foundations of our energy policy in the years ahead.  Their efforts in that regard have been good and useful. There is great potential for us in the use of natural gas but it requires to be used as widely as possible and with as much skill as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome also the development of the natural gas line between Cork and Dublin <Col N="1860" /> which I hope will be completed as soon as possible because delay in this area means loss of money.  I should like also to see spurs or prongs built on to this line feeding the main cities and urban areas between Dublin and Cork.  I am thinking particularly of Limerick.  We had a commitment from the previous Minister, Deputy O'Leary, that a spur would be built from the Cork-Dublin line simultaneously with that line to Limerick.  I hope the Minister will honour that pledge and have no delay in providing this Limerick spur.  The plight of the Limerick gas company is urgent.  The Minister, his officials and An Bord Gáis are well aware of the drastic need for financial help for the company to maintain their solvency and ensure that they are able to provide a gas service for the Limerick people.</P>
    <P>The company face a very difficult task just now mainly due to the cost of naphtha on the world market.  Naphtha is the product from which gas is made &mdash; I can see the Minister looking at me in a critical way &mdash; but naphtha is something that the multinationals also sell.  It is the main product from which gas is made under the present system of gas manufacture when you have not natural gas available. The price of naphtha has continued to rise at an alarming rate in the last decade. Back when Mr. Justin Keating was Minister he tried to tackle the problem of the price of naphtha and one of his most trenchant critics was the then Deputy O'Malley who harried him continually in the House about being timid and pussyfooting with the multinationals and not being able to impose control on the price of naphtha.  It was rather ironic that when the then Deputy Keating went out of office he was replaced by Deputy O'Malley.  Perhaps Deputy O'Malley was not quite so stern then in tackling the multinationals.  If one is to judge by the continuing spiral in the price he was no more successful &mdash; indeed less successful &mdash; than Deputy Keating was in regard to the price of naphtha.  The price continued to rise.</P>
    <P>We had other Ministers taking over from Deputy O'Malley, Deputy Colley being the first.  I went to see him as a member of Limerick Gas Committee to <Col N="1861" /> ask him to help the gas company to remain viable and in business in Limerick and also to help to control the price of naphtha.  While he was sympathetic and helpful and did subsidise the company he could not do much about the price of naphtha which continued to rise.  Since then two other Ministers have stepped in and we went to see each of them in turn. Deputy M. O'Leary, the previous Minister, continued the aid but the price of naphtha has continued to rise.  It is one of the fastest increasing prices in the world and as the gas company are totally dependent on this product for the manufacture of gas in Limerick they have no option but to pay the increased prices. The multinational oil companies concerned have a virtual monopoly in this area and one must pay whatever price they demand.  Otherwise they will threaten to terminate the contract and people would be left without gas which would be a great tragedy in the case of Limerick where gas has been used for more than 100 years.</P>
    <P>The position has now reached a crucial stage in that the money needed to subsidise the company and prop it up is increasing all the time.  The continued strain not only on the company but on Limerick Corporation is a matter of serious concern.  I had hoped that An Bord Gáis would have stepped in to reinforce the negotiating tactics of Limerick Corporation in tackling the multinationals. But they have not been successful either. The negotiation with the multinationals is one long tale of woe.  I appeal to the Minister to do all he can to ensure that the company are kept in operation and also to speed up supplies of natural gas to Limerick.  Unless this is done the consumers &mdash; and there are many thousands of them in Limerick &mdash; and also the workers &mdash; there are about 80 workers involved &mdash; are endangered because of the threatened closure of the Limerick Gas Company.  I make a special appeal to the Minister to give priority to the gas company concerned and to ensure that they are maintained in viable operation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish the Minister well in what he is about.  He has been given a very responsible position at a crucial stage in <Col N="1862" /> our development.  We have an increasing population and a developing, urbanised, industrialised society and his is a key Ministry.  It is very important that he should discharge his duties in the best interests of our people because our energy policy is central in the whole economic expansion and development of our society.  Unless that policy is right all other policies are bound to suffer.  I hope the Minister will address himself to some of the points I have made especially in relation to the Limerick Gas Company and that he will endeavour to give that company special priority on the financial front by means of a subsidy to keep the company in existence and also use whatever powers he has to endeavour to stabilise the price of naphtha and ensure that the company can buy it at perhaps not a reduced price but at least at a stabilised price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in principle and the progress which An Bord Gáis are making in bringing the gas line from Cork to Dublin.  I accept in principle the financial package outlined in the Minister's speech.  It is correct that we should have a balance between internal sourcing of finance and external sourcing.  I hope that in the external sourcing there will be a guarantee by the Government regarding any devaluation of the punt so as not to expose the board to the effects of devaluation.  This is not spelled out in the Bill but I think the Minister should assure the House that foreign borrowing would be guaranteed by the Government.  I note from the Minister's speech that borrowing will be from the European Investment Bank and I hope the Minister will bring before the House the final terms of the loan negotiated and make clear that the board are protected against devaluation of the punt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to raise briefly &mdash; since time is against me &mdash; the question of bringing gas to provincial centres such as Dungarvan and Waterford.  I understand that a technical report has been made by the Waterford Gas Company to the Minister and I would be grateful for his comments on it.  The proximity of both Dungarvan and Waterford to the natural gas <Col N="1863" /> line must be considered and the depressed economic state of both Dungarvan and Waterford must be taken into account by the Minister.  The supply of natural gas to vital industries such as Waterford Co-Op. and Waterford Gas Company would be of prime importance in reviving industry in Dungarvan and Waterford.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised by the South Eastern Development Organisation with the Minister regarding a supply to Kilkenny, Clonmel and Wexford.  I fully understand the need for a cost-benefit analysis.  I accept that you can reach a periphery where a cost-benefit analysis will come down on the adverse side.  Natural gas should only be supplied where it is more economic to do so and where the revenue accruing to the major users in the particular area is sufficient to make the product economically viable.  I heard with interest Deputy Barry Desmond's comments on pricing policy and I agree with them.  It is important that we have a market-related costing for natural gas. When I was in the Department I was particularly aware of the problems which Bord na Móna are facing getting a market-related price for their products.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I wish also to thank the Minister for Health for coming to the House to discuss a number of problems which have arisen from this accident involving two motor vehicles at Clamp Cross, Aglish, near Cappoquin, County Waterford.  Two young people <Col N="1864" /> were seriously injured and there was another person not so seriously injured.</P>
      <P>My information is that, despite a request to a doctor to come to the scene of the accident, he refused to do so.  I only make this allegation in the House because of the information available to me.  There may have been difficulty in making a telephone call to Dungarvan.  I am satisfied there was a delay in the arrival of an ambulance at the scene of the accident.  I have been told the ambulance did not arrive until one-and-a-half hours after the accident.</P>
      <P>The men who man the ambulance service in Waterford city are excellent and carry out their duties very efficiently. There may be some reason for what happened on the night of this accident.  There may have been some problem with the telephone service.  I would be grateful if the Minister would look into this aspect.</P>
      <P>I understand that a local veterinary surgeon came to the scene of the accident when requested and rendered first class medical aid.  I believe that in relation to one of the seriously injured young people his action stopped the bleeding and saved that person's life.  I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating him on his public spirit in coming to the scene of the accident.</P>
      <P>There are a number of important matters which need the Minister's attention. We must avoid a situation like this not only in west Waterford, which is ten to 20 miles from the ambulance centre, but in other places which are a fair distance from accident centres.  It is vital to have telephone communication between the scene of an accident and ambulance centres to ensure that an ambulance arrives in the quickest possible time.  This is vital.</P>
      <P>The places I am talking about &mdash; Aglish, Cappoquin, Careen, Lismore, Carrow and Ballyduff &mdash; are some distance from Dungarvan.  It is vital that communications should be quick and efficient and that a very efficient ambulance service should be available.  The South-Eastern Health Board should look at all the west Waterford area to ensure that an efficient ambulance service is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1865" /> I suggest that, instead of people having to ring a doctor in a locality at the scene of an accident, it would be more efficient if people could dial 999, give their location and say they want an ambulance and a doctor.  The telephone operator could immediately connect them to an ambulance centre.  It would be the responsibility of the ambulance centre to contact the doctor in the area.  That is an efficient system and is preferable to the present system where a person rings up a local doctor.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there are not group practices in rural areas.  A doctor practises on his own.  He may be doing excellent work and be highly regarded, but he is entitled to his sleep.  The ambulance centre in each health board region should have a list of doctors on duty in the various counties served by the health board. This should be available for County Waterford, so that the ambulance centres would be able to take on responsiblity for contacting doctors on duty.  That would make for more efficient and more speedy contact with doctors on duty who would be able to go to accident scenes immediately.</P>
    <P>Such a service is not available except in the event of major accidents in which case, I am sure, there is a system through which a corps of doctors and nurses and fire brigades would be recruited.  I am suggesting that there should be a similar system for minor accidents which would cover an entire county.</P>
    <P>I was reluctant to raise this matter in the House but I have a duty to do so because it may contribute to a situation which would not allow a recurrence of the type of accident I have been speaking about.  I have been referring specifically to my own county but I am sure all Deputies will have the same concern in regard to their counties.  I am asking the Minister to inquire into this accident, how it was handled and the procedure he intends to adopt in future to deal with accidents of a similar nature in remote areas.</P>
    <P>I should like him to tell me the arrangements he intends to make with health boards on the establishment of procedures to ensure that rapid medical and <Col N="1866" /> ambulance services will be available even in remote areas.</P>
    <P>This is a serious question.  I have been in west Waterford and I have heard complaints of the availability of medical services in cases like this.  There have been questions on the Order Paper to the Minister.  It is the Minister's responsibility to set up efficient procedures with regard to the contacting of ambulances and duty medical officers which could proceed rapidly to accident scenes.  In the case I have been citing, I am glad there was no loss of life and I wish to pay a tribute to a local veterinary officer who came out to render what can only be described as excellent medical treatment. I hope the Minister will not treat these representations lightly.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Collins for raising this matter.  It gives me an opportunity to put the facts on record, particularly in view of some of the reports which appeared in newspapers and which do not reflect credit on the ambulance services in particular.  I have made inquiries from the South Eastern Health Board who have responsibility for the provision of accident and emergency services.  The board report that at 12.50, post-mid-night, on Monday morning, 28 June last gradaí in Youghal were notified that a traffic accident had occurred at Aglish. The Youghal gradaí notified the gardaíin Dungarvan, who went to the scene.  On arrival there it is understood that the gardaí notified the ambulance service. This call was received in the ambulance depot at 1.10 a.m.  The ambulance centre was notified there had been an accident and an ambulance with driver and a nurse left at 1.15 a.m.  This ambulance brought three casualties to Ardkeen Hospital at 2.25 a.m.  The Deputy will appreciate that the run from the scene of the accident to Ardkeen Hospital is about twice the distance from Dungarvan to the scene of the accident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the mileage works out at 52.  The ambulance was able to leave the depot at 1.15, five minutes after the time of the alert.  The service would have appeared to have been remarkably speedy and it must be remembered that 52 miles had to be covered from the scene of the accident to the hospital.  It must be remembered also that the ambulance crew had to get the patients into the ambulance and render some immediate on the scene assistance. Three local general practitioners were called to the scene at approximately the same time as the Garda were notified. They arrived without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health board have emphasised that the first call to the ambulance service was received at 1.10 a.m.  I have arranged for the Department to obtain a full report on the incident, but it is clear from the information given already by the board that once the ambulance had been called it went immediately and speedily to the scene and brought the patients to Ardkeen without delay.  If the Deputy has any information in regard to the suggestion that a local doctor refused to go to the scene he should give it to me and I shall refer to it in the report which will be drawn up.  The information I have is that three doctors were called and three doctors arrived on the scene following the call by gardaí, and the three doctors were there when the ambulance arrived. It appears that the ambulance arrived quite speedily but there seems to be some confusion and there may have been some difficulty in communication.  I have made <Col N="1868" /> it clear what happened once the alert was given.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with Deputy Collins in thanking the veterinary officer. I congratulate him for giving a first aid and medical service.  I agree with the Deputy on the question of telecommunications. Perhaps the people concerned did not dial 999 and ask for an ambulance although it may have ultimately been a 999 call which brought the Garda.</P>
    <P>I was up the Wicklow mountains last Monday night with an old folks' outing and one of the elderly people had an accident.  We dialled 999 and the Naas ambulance was there literally within a matter of minutes.  The accident was quite serious, as the lady has been detained in hospital and is having an operation, but the ambulance men gave her excellent attention.  I understand in cases of accidents it is better to dial 999 immediately.  It is intended for emergency cases and, obviously, should not be used in cases of minor accidents. Ambulance personnel are fully trained to deal with emergencies.  They are the best people to treat the injured and the sooner they arrive on the scene the better.  They are also in a position to treat injured people on their way to hospital.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Deputy for raising this matter here so that the facts can be clearly established and I will communicate with him when I have a full report.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 351 to 353 inclusive, together.  It is necessary to maintain strict control on the numbers of FCA personnel who may be called for training and the length of training periods in individual cases during 1982 having regard to the provision in the Defence Vote 1982, for training of An Forsa Cosanta Áitiúil.  Annual training for 1982 is for the normal period of two weeks and additional courses are being restricted in order to ensure that the maximum numbers can avail of annual training.  The extent to which the available resources will permit personnel to be afforded training this year is being kept under constant review with the objective of facilitating as many such members as possible.</P>
      <P>These considerations apply to all units including the individual units referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I presume that the discrepancies referred to relate to the rejection of some calves as ineligible under the calf premium scheme.  Under the EEC regulations only calves born from 20 May onwards are eligible and the inspecting officers of my Department have to refuse certificates of birth in respect of calves which, in their opinion, were born before that date.</P>
      <P>From experience since the inspections under the scheme commenced about two weeks ago, however, it is clear that large numbers of over-age calves were being presented.  The inspecting officers, who judge the ages of the calves from their size, weight and general appearance, are experienced in dealing with livestock and the majority of them have been deciding the ages of animals under various headage schemes for many years.  Supervising officers who have been carrying out spot checks at inspection centres have confirmed that the rejections are warranted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland supported the adoption of the updated &ldquo;Declaration concerning the Policy of Apartheid of the Republic of South Africa&rdquo; by the International Labour Conference in June 1981.  The action taken by the Government to implement the provisions of the declaration is in full accordance with their general policy of strongly opposing, by all appropriate means, South Africa's apartheid system.</P>
      <P>In response to the specific points raised by the Deputy, Ireland does not maintain diplomatic relations with the Government of South Africa and the question of their termination does not therefore arise.  Similarly, there are no cultural agreements between Ireland and South Africa.  The Government's opposition to sporting contacts with South Africa is well known: they strongly condemn all contacts that would be in breach of the Olympic principle of non-discrimination in sport, and they have taken appropriate steps to prevent or discourage such contacts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1691" /> The Government do not encourage trade or other economic relations with South Africa and State-sponsored bodies do not maintain operations there.  There is no Irish public investment in South Africa.  I understand that the amount of private investment is negligible, and such investment is not supported by credit guarantees or other arrangements involving the State.  The Government support the code of conduct adopted by the ten member states of the European Community in respect of subsidiaries of European companies in South Africa.  At present, there are no Irish companies operating in South Africa to which the code would apply, and the question of implementing the reporting arrangements laid down in the code does not therefore arise.  In view of the situation in South Africa, the Government discourage emigration to that country; nevertheless they fully recognise the right of the individual citizen to foreign travel.</P>
    <P>The Government are fully conscious of the need to assist those countries which are forced through their geographical and economic situation to maintain links with South Africa.  Two of these countries, Zambia and Lesotho, are among those selected as priority countries for the Bilateral Development Co-operation Programme.  Lesotho, which is encircled by South Africa, receives a significant proportion of the total funds disbursed under this programme.  At the multilateral level, the Government are continuing to make substantial contributions through the Southern African funds established by the United Nations General Assembly.  These funds are used to support the victims of apartheid and of South Africa's destabilising policies in the region.</P>
    <P>The Government do not recognise any of the &ldquo;bantustans&rdquo; created by South Africa.  They support the efforts of those who strive for the achievement of human rights in South Africa and Namibia, and they are concerned at the continued denial of these rights to the great majority of the people of these countries.</P>

      <P>A claim for unemployment benefit has not been received from the person concerned.  A claim for disability benefit was however received recently and was disallowed as she had less than 26 contributions paid or credited in the 1980-81 contribution year which governs her claim.  A similar contribution condition would govern entitlement to unemployment benefit and the person concerned would not accordingly be entitled to that benefit even if she had submitted a claim. If the person concerned wishes to pursue further her entitlements it is suggested that she call to the employment exchange, Galway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 8 May 1981 and was paid from 12 May 1981, fourth day of incapacity, for a period of 52 weeks to 10 May 1982.  He was not entitled to payment beyond that date as he had less than a total of 156 paid contributions since his entry into insurance.  He entered insurance on 26 August 1980 and had <Col N="1712" /> only 40 paid contributions between that date and the date of commencement of his illness.  In order to requalify for disability benefit he would require a further thirteen weeks of insurable employment. The claimant was not entitled to injury benefit as his incapacity was not due to an incapacity arising out of and in the course of his employment.</P>
      <P>If the claimant did not receive cheques in respect of any period between 12 May 1981 and 10 May 1982 he should notify the Department and the matter will be investigated.  On a review of the claim it was discovered that pay-related benefit was not paid initially as the claimant had no earnings in the income tax year 1979-80 which governed the claim.  As it has since been established that he commenced employment for the first time in August 1980 his pay-related benefit is calculated by reference to his earnings in the first six months of employment. Arrears of pay-related benefit due for the period 22 May 1981, thirteenth day of incapacity, to 10 May 1982, were issued on 7 July 1982.</P>

All flat-rate unemployment benefit to which he was entitled was paid as weekly payments become due.  He became entitled to pay-related benefit as a supplement to flat-rate unemployment benefit from 28 May 1982 when the statutory 12-day waiting period for pay-related benefit expired.  The rate payable to him is £38.96.  However, due to a computation error at the local office dealing with his claim the weekly amount of pay-related benefit was underpaid by £10.00.</P>

      <P>These inquiries were completed recently and it was established that her entitlement to pay-related benefit at £15.20 weekly was not affected by the 85 per cent limit which in her case amounted to £48.38.

    <P>Of its nature, action to assist firms in difficulties is a sensitive task inevitably requiring a considerable degree of confidentiality. It involves consultation on a day-to-day basis between my Department and State agencies, notably the IDA, Fóir Teoranta and the ICC.  The relevant State bodies now meet also on a regular basis to review and co-ordinate rescue efforts.  The IDA offers appropriate assistance and services in close co-operation with Fóir Teoranta, which is the official rescue agency.</P>
    <P>The severe effects of the international economic recession since 1979 is reflected in the table.  In order to intensify efforts to assist firms in difficulty, the staff of the IDA Rescue Unit has been doubled in recent times.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Rescue&rdquo; arrangements are under continuous review to ensure that potential difficulties in firms come to attention as early as possible in order that timely remedial action can be considered.  Officials of my Department are currently in discussion with the relevant agencies and bodies to explore the possibility of any further improvements in the present system of early warnings.</P>

      <P>A grant has not been approved in this case.  A grant for the installation of sewerage facilities will be approved on receipt of evidence of planning permission for the septic tank.  However, grants in respect of a bathroom and water supply cannot be allowed because, contrary to a qualifying condition of the scheme, these works had commenced before an inspection of the house was carried out.</P>

I am satisfied, as were previous Ministers, that legislation to empower county councils to proceed with a project in the absence of consent by one or more of the parties whose lands or interests would be affected by it, would not be justified.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i> asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that courthouse facilities in County Monaghan are inadequate, that the facilities to deal properly with family law matters in that county are inadequate and that the staffing, office accommodation and facilities to deal with the increased workload and the number of District Court clerks in that county are also inadequate; if he will have these shortcomings remedied as a matter of urgency; and if he will take steps to restore County Monaghan courthouse in order to provide proper facilities for the county registrar for Monaghan and his staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Doherty) Sean (Longford-Roscommon) Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>Accommodation is provided for sittings of the District Court in the five main towns in County Monaghan, viz. Ballybay, Carrickmacross, Castleblaney, Clones and Monaghan town.  There are normally two venues for the Circuit Court, Monaghan town and Castleblayney, but the Monaghan sittings are being taken at Castleblayney pending the restoration of the fire-damaged courthouse in Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my policy to aim towards the provision of reasonable facilities of the kind referred to in all court premises, and I will avail myself of every suitable opportunity of ensuring that such facilities are provided.  Cost has to be balanced against expected use.  Reasonable regard must be had to the fact that the number of family law cases and other cases where provision for consultation in private between lawyers and their clients is particularly desirable are likely to be small in number in many court venues.  Monaghan County Council, who are charged by law with responsibility for the provision and maintenance of court accommodation in their functional area, have been reminded that, even before the fire in Monaghan courthouse, it had been anticipated that they would satisfy the need for consultation rooms, waiting rooms and public toilets there, as well as for additional office and record storage <Col N="1729" /> space, in the context of the transfer of council staff to new accommodation and that it was expected that the restoration work would be planned so as to integrate with the provision of the additional facilities. I understand that re-roofing of the premises has been completed and that further progress depends on the progress of the council's office project.  Council staff will have to be re-housed in the undamaged part of the courthouse until adaptation of the former technical school as office accommodation has been completed. This is expected to take about 18 months.</P>
    <P>In so far as the number of district court clerks is concerned this has always been directly related to the case-count for the area and I have no reason to believe that the number has been inadequate.  Should increased workloads result from the increased jurisdiction conferred by the Courts Act, 1981, additional district justices and courts staff will be recruited as required.  As I indicated in reply to Dáil Questions Nos. 306 and 307 of 5 May last, specific provision was made for this in the 1982 Estimates for my Department. However, the need for additional appointments has not yet arisen since, for one thing, court staff are refusing to cooperate in implementing the new jurisdictions.</P>

      <P>Under the scheme of civil legal aid and advice the establishment of law centres is a matter for the Legal Aid Board with my consent.  The board have not sought my consent for establishing a law centre in Tallaght specifically but have indicated that they intend to provide &ldquo;clinic&rdquo; services on a part-time basis in some suburban locations in Dublin commencing with Tallaght, Ballyfermot and Ballymun. I understand that these services will be provided in Tallaght as soon as suitable accommodation becomes available <Col N="1730" /> there.  I should make it clear that the board's plans were made in the knowledge that financial resources were necessarily limited and do not, of course, rule out consideration of Tallaght as a location for a full centre to the extent that financial resources permit of further expansion in the future.</P>
