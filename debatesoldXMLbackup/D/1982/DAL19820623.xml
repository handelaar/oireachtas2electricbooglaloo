    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I endeavoured to pinpoint areas of weakness in <Col N="1228" /> the Bill that I considered warranted the Minister's intervention prior to continuing the debate on Committee Stage. Among them were important matters, essentially the lack of final consultation with the staff on various aspects of the Bill in the area of future promotional needs, staff structure and other important labour matters which if left unresolved could lead to industrial unrest in this very large section of the public sector. In addition I emphasised the indifferent attitude of various Governments over many years towards various sectors such as the Post Office, with lack of policies and, most essentially, lack of finance to ensure that modern services could be provided for all the people of this country.  I accept that improvements are needed in this service but they should not be made at the expense of the workers involved or at the expense of services for the people in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>There are a couple of other items I would like to raise before I conclude my contribution.  One relevant and important aspect is the decision to divide under two managements the workings of this Department.  Since the foundation of the State, despite the lack of finance and the indifference of various Governments, the executive of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and its staff have, to the best of their ability, given the best service available under one management.  In this Bill it is envisaged that there will be a division of responsibility in the two sectors of the Department.  I believe that is a serious reflection on the abililty and expertise of the existing structures within that Department.  What is needed is not a diversification of responsibilities in two directions but a substantial capital investment to improve the present structures rather than duplicating administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have experience of duplication of services in relation to the Health Act of 1970.  Up to then local authorities were responsible for the administration of the health services in their areas.  Under the new Health Act we introduced health boards, which instead of bringing the services nearer to the people have created a wider gap between the services and the people for whom they were <Col N="1229" /> intended.  In other words, rather that having an improvement, we had a disimprovement, and it was the people who suffered.  This meant there was an additional burden on the ratepayers and the taxpayers with an overloading of administrative costs and duplication.  Before, the county manager was the ultimate executive responsible for the health services, the supervision of health costs and services in his area, but that responsibility is being moved further from the people and they are suffering.  I am very concerned about this proposed development because with a duplication of administration there will be an overloading of costs and senior staff without the required improvement in services.  Having learned from experience of the health boards, I believe this would be a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>At present we have a responsible body which has done a very good job down the years, but we now deem it necessary to divide responsibility into two sections rather than allowing the existing body to continue the work they have been doing, but giving a better service as a result of the additional cash injection I commend.</P>
    <P>In recent years amalgamation has been the yardstick of success in private industry. Can anyone explain why two such well known men can come before the people and vindicate the policy of splitting responsibility while, in their private concerns, their main emphasis was on integration rather than diversification? Where the structures have survived under one Department and with such expertise as is being brought in from the private sector neither the Minister nor the business supremos who are being brought in to supervise these developments can convince me they will be successful in a situation which is the reverse of their policies in their private industries. This matter is causing the workers grave concern.</P>
    <P>Are we very interested in making a success of these new enterprises?  I can appreciate that the services will be very successful in the heavily populated areas, but in the less densely populated areas the profitability aspect will be greatly eroded.  Because of this I believe the <Col N="1230" /> people in rural Ireland have grave cause for concern.  If this legislation is passed future elected representatives who are supposed to ensure taxpayers' money is spent properly and that the best services possible are provided for the money spent, will no longer have the right to question the activities and performance of these boards.  This will deprive the democratically elected representatives of the right to tell the people of the inadequacies and failures of the boards.</P>
    <P>The Minister will not have any power or responsibility for these bodies.  The person responsible will be the chairman of the particular semi-State body.  This is causing grave concern to the workers, the general public and the elected representatives. We are enacting legislation and, I hope, providing adequate financial resources to ensure the new bodies will work well in the years ahead but we will not have any responsibility for those bodies.</P>
    <P>This Bill could be described as discriminatory and anti-social because there will be specialised services for the heavily populated areas but people living in less densely populated areas will not be provided for.  These boards are being set up and their main motivation will be profit. It could happen that in three or four years time many rural areas will be very fortunate if they have a postal delivery once in three weeks.  I do not believe any Government or Deputy is prepared to accept a situation where there is a class distinction in a postal or telecommunications service which gives a better service to a person living in a city with a population of one million than to a person living in a less densely populated area.</P>
    <P>I believe the present system with one Department controlling the postal and telecommunications service is adequate to meet the needs of the people in the years ahead, provided sufficient capital is provided to develop and modernise the service.  Rather than having two boards we should have one body responsible for the development of the services.  There are nearly 30,000 people involved in providing these services and they should know in which direction the Department <Col N="1231" /> are going.  They also have the right to promotion within the Department and to other Departments, but these matters are not being clarified by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Last night I appealed to the Minister to resolve these matters first with the unions and with everyone concerned. When people are happy with the development and when an effort is made to ensure industrial peace in this sector, I believe it is only then we can proceed with any developments.  Without industrial peace and without a unified approach by all concerned, as well as a major input by the workers, the Bill will fail.  If the goodwill of the workers is not obtained, our ideas, promises and intentions will not be fulfilled despite any efforts the Minister may make.  As a member of a party which opposed this Bill vigorously on Second Stage, I ask the Minister to consider what I said about finalising consultations with the trade unions and thus give the Bill every prospect of success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Member of this House who has had the experience of difficulties in his own constituency, particularly with regard to the telephone service and the worsening state of the postal service, will agree there is need for change and reform in these areas.  I hope the changes that have been proposed by the Minister this morning will bring us forward and not backwards and will not leave the public in an even worse situation, if that is possible.</P>
      <P>I accept there is need for change in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, but that change must come about after due consideration by elected Members of this House and after due consultation with all concerned.  It is important that whatever change is made there should be some provision regarding accountability to the elected Members who are providing the funds and facilities for the boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment the problem is that nobody knows what is happening in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It is doubtful whether that Department, with 30,000 employees, are really accountable to the House and the Minister. <Col N="1232" /> I do not think the Minister knows fully what is going on in the Department or that this House fully appreciates what is happening because of the quagmire of bureaucracy the Department are in at the moment.  There is no doubt that reform is needed in some way.  I ask the Minister to ensure that in the proposals finally agreed there must be accountability if these bodies are to continue as public bodies and to be funded with public moneys.</P>
    <P>It is important that the right steps be taken now.  The people involved live in our constituencies and they have to be considered, but we must also take the right measures because of good industrial democracy and practice.  It is essential that proper consultation take place with the people concerned but that has not happened to date.  There is much worry and unnecessary concern at the moment in the trade unions and among members because of security of jobs.  These people are worried about their livelihood.  We must ensure that measures are not railroaded through the House and that the people involved are consulted fully.  We are living in an era of industrial democracy. The 30,000 people in the Department and their families will have to be considered.  The workers must be consulted and must be given an opportunity to have an input in the changes that are due to take place.  It is difficult to imagine how bad our telephone service is, but even more alarming is the postal service. For many years that service has been accurate and reliable, but it has started to decline.  While it is still a good service it is not as sharp as it has been in the past. Many letters are delivered in a tattered and torn state and there is considerable delay in deliveries.  There are cases where letters are delivered months after posting and this has happened even to letters addressed to the Minister.  The postal service has become less efficient perhaps because of bad industrial relations or bad management.  I do not know the reason but I am sure we have started on a bad path.  It has not gone so far that we cannot pull the service back to the excellent one it was in the not too distant past.</P>
    <P>The telephone service is another kettle <Col N="1233" /> of fish.  Some major action must be taken in this area.  There is a great demand and a total readiness to pay for the service and in any other sector someone would be making a fortune in meeting this need. I have been criticised by the press and by the Minister for putting down questions in this House about the telephone service.  The Minister has said it is not important and that we should not take up parliamentary time in dealing with the matter.  I make no apologies for putting down those questions.  When my constituents apply for a service they cannot get a reply from the Department.  If they wrote to any private body at least they would get the courtesy of a reply and they would be told the position but that is not the case with the Department.  People are ignored or are fobbed off with a standard reply, sometimes months after they have paid their deposit.  The whole question of the funding of the Department needs to be examined.  The Minister has a petition signed by nearly 1,000 people in my constituency looking for telephones and this can be repeated throughout the country. Millions of pounds are waiting to be picked up from people who want a telephone service but there is nothing from the Department except promises.  People are told an exchange cannot be built this year and that a mobile exchange will be provided or they are fobbed off with promises of a connection in six months' time.  However, the promises are never met.  The Department offer all kinds of excuses, including the excuse that their time is taken up replying to letters from public representatives.  That is nonsense. There are 30,000 people in the Department and I do not know why they cannot provide a service without all this moaning and groaning by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I hope the situation will change.  If a person applies for a service, particularly to a board who have the exclusive right to supply it, that public body must have total responsibility in providing that service. Otherwise we should get into a position of competition with private enterprise.  If we are not prepared to do that we should give the new boards the power to give our people the service they are entitled <Col N="1234" /> to and prepared to pay for.  In many cases seriously ill people who have sent in detailed medical evidence in support of their application for a telephone have not been able to get one.  In one case the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said that because of the urgency of the situation he would provide the service by last September, but the young girl who was seriously ill then has since died.  The telephone was never provided.  This is another element of accountability.  The information given to the House is only as good as the word of the Minister and I suppose his word is only as good as the information he has been given.  We have accepted low standards here and it is time we put everybody on notice that all people have entitlements, unions, workers, the public and public representatives. There are certain standards beyond which the House will not tolerate.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with those who under legislation introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare, and passed here, are entitled to free telephone rental.  That legislation is not worth a curse to those people.  We can pass legislation to the effect that we will give free telephone rentals to elderly people who are living alone, a wonderful idea, and it does not cost the State anything.  Why? Because the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will not supply the service. That is outrageous.  We have passed legislation giving that service to elderly people but the Department are not providing it.  It is against that background that people are talking about the private enterprise approach.  We must be honest with workers and others that the level of performance in the Department is not satisfactory.  I accept that none of us is hperfect and we all want to see proper consultation before any changes take place.</P>
    <P>Representations were made to me in recent days that in a sizeable area of the Liberties there is not one telephone kiosk in working order but yet in areas where people do not want telephone boxes and want them removed they cannot get that work done.  There is no response from this publicly funded body to the public <Col N="1235" /> needs, wishes or desires.  I do not think that sort of situation should be allowed to continue.  As long as the proper channels are gone through, jobs are protected and people have the proper opportunities and entitlements, I do not give two damns who runs the telephone service.  It is time people got the service they are paying for.  It would be preferable to see that done by the Department or a State body which would come about after proper consultation.  But we have to set our objectives to meet public demand and not be foisting on the public something they do not want or need.  The public certainly do not need broken telephone boxes.</P>
    <P>In introducing the legislation I wonder if the Minister has given any consideration to new forms of communication.  We have had a proliferation in the city of CBs and pirate radio stations.  There are other forms of communication and if we cannot supply people with telephones have we looked at the possibility of using those methods?  Will the new board be going after a communications system which is out-moded?  Should we not be saying to ourselves: we are starting from scratch and the situation is so bad that our long term objective should be what we will need in ten or 20 years' time?  We should ask ourselves if in the future we will need telegraph poles, cable and other systems that do not work any time it rains heavily? We have a golden opportunity now to look at the bad communications system we have and plan the major changes we should make to make the system so modern that we will at least be on a par with other countries, if not ahead of them.  I have not heard much ministerial or departmental innovative thinking in this area and that is regrettable.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is a bit of a laugh and people ask why we should have such an appointment.  We have a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and he is in charge of a very important Department but he has never taken his responsibility seriously and that is witnessed by the fact that he is also Minister for Transport.  If a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs were <Col N="1236" /> to take his responsibilities seriously, there is enormous scope for reform.</P>
    <P>To some extent the existing method of charging for telephone services may be contrary to consumer legislation.  It is not uncommon for people to get enormous telephone bills covering periods when they were on holidays or when they could not have made any calls.  There is no meter system in the home of the user and consumers depend on the good faith and goodwill of the Department to charge them properly.  If one gets a bill that is inordinately high it is very difficult to query it with success.  It is my view that if that was challenged the whole question of charges would be found to be contrary to consumer legislation.  In many cases people are being asked to pay telephone bills and the figure may only be a shot in the dark because of the disastrous system that operates.  That system does not allow consumers to meter the number of calls they make.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consult with the people concerned and to go through the proper channels of consultation.  Having done that, and on the basis of what is believed to be right and wrong and having taken into consideration the views of the people concerned, he should put the legislation before the House.  I do not believe proper consultations have taken place.  That would seem to be the case when one considers the number of contacts that have been made with public representatives.  Before pressing the legislation any further the Minister should consult with those who are worried about their position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to make it clear that the opposition by the Labour Party to the Bill is not based on the grounds that we are opposed to progress in this area or on the grounds that we do not want to see a vast improvement in the postal and telecommunications services.  We are not Luddites seeking to put the clock back.  We realise that there are serious defects primarily in the telephone service which has been and remains a great joke in European circles by reason of the antiquity of the system. We want progress because we realise the <Col N="1237" /> intrinsic worth of a good telephone system, not merely for the sake of the people who require the service but for positive economic reasons, the fact that people are loathe to come here and set up enterprises and continue in business because of the lack of a proper telephone system. We have to have regard to the far-reaching implications of this Bill, which rings the death-knell for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as we knew it since the inception of the State.</P>
      <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs, comprising some 30,000 people, is about to be abolished under this Bill and substituted by two companies, An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  Inherent in this proposal, therefore, are the far-ranging repercussions on people at large who have come to recognise the special services we have provided and who expect these services to be continued and improved upon.  Most of all, the repercussions will surely be traumatic for the 30,000 employees of the Department, indoor and outdoor staff, night and day telephonists and the engineering section. One can well understand the feelings of anxiety amongst those people and the sense of fear about the radical change involved for them and for the status and security which they enjoyed as civil servants in this Department for so long.</P>
      <P>That is why we in the Labour Party admonish the Minister not to move with indecent haste with the implementation of this Bill.  He should consult extensively until a consensus is reached between the Department and the unions involved so that the genuine fears of the 30,000 people involved may be allayed.  They are concerned about the loss of their status as civil servants and about the inroads which will be made on them by the provisions of this Bill which threaten their jobs and confer on the Minister and the new boards powers to grant licences to private persons to carry out the work heretofore done by employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, postmen, postwomen, counter staff, telephonists, artisans, tradesmen and labourers employed in the engineering section of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The civil service has stood the test of <Col N="1238" /> time and is recognised for its fairness and impartiality.  It has always been something of an achievement for a young man or woman to become a civil servant. There is a great aura of security attached to it in respect of one's working conditions and especially in sickness and old age when it comes to retirement.  These fundamental privileges are undermined in this radical change in the status of civil servants to that of employees of An Post or Bord Telecom Éireann.  They have good cause to be concerned when one peruses carefully the various sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the transfer of the control and management of postal and telecommunication services from the Minister and the Government to these new State-sponsored companies.  It involves the transfer of almost all the staff of this vast Department of State, comprising about 30,000 people, representing nearly half of the civil service.  It is a radical, far-reaching proposal and, if not done with caution and with the utmost consultation, can rebound upon us and create chaos.  It is not good enough to say that there have been consultations with the unions concerned.  It is acknowledged that there have been consultations but it is also true to say that there has been no worthwhile agreement, and no agreement at all, in respect of one of the largest unions involved.  Some of these unions are diametrically opposed to these radical changes and unless changes are made in this Bill we are likely to have conflict.  We in the Labour Party seek to avoid this.</P>
    <P>Already, it has been intimated to me that some personnel in the Minister's Department will not accept this change and are prepared to opt out rather than work under these proposed boards. Many of them will opt for early retirement. I ask the Minister seriously to consider inserting in this Bill a clause to cover early retirement where this is desired. There is no specific mention of this important facility in this voluminous Bill. At a time of high unemployment it seems necessary and desirable that there should be such a provision in this Bill for those who wish to opt for early retirement.  I appeal to the Minister to include a section <Col N="1239" /> to cover such people and to make it attractive for them to retire thereby creating more employment opportunities for the many thousands of boys and girls seeking jobs at present with no prospect of securing them.  With this movement of some 30,000 people there is an opportunity of finding ways and means to facilitate those who want to retire or who are dissatisfied with the new arrangement.  I ask the Minister to make this as attractive as possible in terms of pension entitlement and so on.  This will create new opportunities for students who see nothing before them but disillusionment despite their high educational attainments and their leaving certificates.  In this situation it behoves us in this House to try to create new employment opportunities from a reshuffle of this magnitude.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, as one peruses the various sections of the Bill one tends to come to the conclusion that the whole operation &mdash; the Minister shedding his responsibilities and abolishing his Department in setting up these two new State companies &mdash; is for the purpose of achieving efficiency, one would hope, but economy also.  We know what economy means in this situation &mdash; the loss of more jobs.  It means that the work which many thousands of people performed in the past is now coming seriously into question in this Bill and all kinds of inroads are being made upon it.  Private enterprise is being invited to participate to an extent yet unknown in the future operation of the postal and telecommunication services.  The Minister has power to grant licences.  Clearly, there is here the possibility of political pressure being exerted to grant more and more licences thereby eroding the prospects of security for existing employees of the Department as we know it.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go through the various sections of the Bill as we shall have an opportunity of dealing with them in greater detail on the Committee Stage but there are a few comments I want to make on certain sections.</P>
    <P>The counter-service section of the Department is widely availed of by <Col N="1240" /> almost all our people and is of tremendous value to recipients of various social welfare pensions, old age pensions, widow's pensions, children's allowances, invalidity pensions and so on.  I hope that service will continue and expand.  I have often thought and said in my past speeches in this House on the Department that where application forms are available for various social welfare benefits it would be a great facility if people were assisted in completing application forms at the counter especially the aged, the invalided and the handicapped so that instead of merely passing a form over the counter there could be consultation and assistance which indeed would take some of the workload off public representatives. I appeal to the Minister not to restrict the facilities being provided at present in post offices, but there seems to be restriction where it states that it is intended to provide counter services for the company's own and Government business, subject to the consent of the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that we should have a banking system in the post offices and I welcome that but in looking at the section providing for such a facility I see that it is purely a matter of &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash; the board &ldquo;may&rdquo; or the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  I should prefer to have the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; deleted and the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; inserted instead. Would the Minister say if there is a serious intention on his part to provide such banking facilities?  Is this a serious section and is it seriously intended to implement the section and if so, when?  There are many other facilities which the counter section of the Post Office could provide and are providing in other countries which I think should also be seriously considered here.</P>
    <P>The funding for the establishment of these two boards is considered to be totally inadequate and not sufficient to allow for any appreciable progress to be made in the provision of the numbers of telephones that are required so urgently. Neither will the amounts concerned be sufficient to provide for other areas of activity.  Increasing quantities of equipment are required.  It is appalling to hear of the inordinate delays in the provision <Col N="1241" /> of telephone service because of lack of stocks, because of lack of trifling pieces of cable.  The amount of red tape involved in securing such small items is mind boggling. Therefore, we should be greatly enhancing the moneys in this area.  A sum of £500 million for the financing of capital works should be increased substantially in the three-year period in question if we are to make the great breakthrough that we all desire in the field of telecommunications.  Many of the buildings are run down and there is a need for more new buildings.  The analysis we have made of the moneys being made available indicate that they are inadequate and that is why we are calling for a fresh look at the situation in so far as funding is concerned.  We observe that there is a big disparity between the capital sums available to the postal company and to the telecommunications company. While the postal company are to receive some £8,500,000, the telecommunications company are to receive an amount not exceeding £130 million.  We should like some explanation as to this variation. Is one service to be accelerated out of all proportion to the other?  Is one service to be allowed run down?  We must have a fair proportion in respect of the operation of both boards.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to bring to the notice of the Minister the fundamental issue of worker participation in these boards.  The people concerned will be known as employee directors but it appears that they will not be appointed until 12 months after the vesting.  That appears to be an extraordinary decision because while the most important decisions regarding the future of the boards are being taken the workers will not have an input.  In other words they will have no say in the formulation of the companies. Consequently, I strongly urge the Minister to bring forward the date of election of the directors and in particular the employee directors.  It is considered appropriate also that the Minister should not have the power to either hire or fire the directors involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, it is not in the Bill, that there must be a <Col N="1242" /> delay of 12 months before the appointment of the worker directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it, then, that these elections will take place soon after the passage of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibility is there for the elections to take place within a week of the passage of the Bill, that is, if the arrangements can be made within that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for that clarification and I take it, therefore, that there will be no question of a 12-month delay after the vesting and that the elections will take place as soon as possible after the legislation has been enacted.</P>
      <P>It must be understood that these worker directors will be elected by the rank and file of their respective trade unions, that they will have a clear mandate to speak on behalf of their fellow trade unionists.  If any Minister should have the temerity to dismiss one of these worker directors at any time, there would be bound to be serious repercussions since these people will not be acting as individuals but as spokesmen for large numbers of workers in the companies. Consequently their views will have to be listened to with respect and will have to be acted on where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the concern of the employees in relation to the loss of status, in relation to changing from being a civil servant to being an employee of one or other of these boards.  Naturally, these people are concerned about pension rights, gratuities, allowances and so on. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that there is the maximum consultation and agreement between the unions on all these matters so that in so far as possible the fears that have been expressed will be allayed.  There must be an input from the unions into such questions as the formulation of superannuation schemes.  The conditions applying to the workers in the new boards must not be less in any sense than those under which they are working in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Due regard must be had to the promotional opportunities that would <Col N="1243" /> have been open to these people had the change-over not been made.  Every employee of the post office and engineering sides of the Department knows what the procedures are in respect of promotion, salary scales, pension rights and so on but all of that procedure will have disappeared on the enactment of this Bill.  This, perhaps, is their greatest fear.  Unless we renegotiate and reconsider that, all the security will be damaged and the inherent fear of the employees concerning their future prospects will be intensified.  Added to that are the inroads that can be made in respect of the security of their employment by reason of the granting of licences and the prospects of their jobs being taken over by others.  It is a new situation altogether and must be treated with the utmost care.</P>
    <P>There must be no attempt at indecent haste in rushing this Bill through the House lest it boomerang against all of us. The Minister knows already that the section which enables the company and himself to grant licences will doubtless mean an extension of the courier service.  My colleagues on these Labour benches have adverted to the real danger that if the courier service is to be acted upon and operated on a wide basis it can be done successfully only in the main cities and urban areas.  Here, therefore, we will have the creaming off of the service, and a genuine fear exists of a worsening of the postal service in rural Ireland especially in isolated areas.  Indeed, the primary purpose of the establishment of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was to provide a postal service for all the people irrespective of where they lived, and it is deeply disturbing and astonishing for us in this House to observe a stipulation in this Bill that a cardinal, fundamental function of a postal service, delivery to the door, the house or the office, is no longer guaranteed in this Bill.  Section 62 stipulates in regard to An Post:</P>
    <P>The company shall not be required to deliver a postal packet to the addressee's residence or office, provided the company makes acceptable alternative <Col N="1244" /> arrangements to make it available to the addressee.</P>
    <P>It is there:</P>
    <P>The company shall not be required to deliver a postal package to the addressee's residence or office,...</P>
    <P>This is undermining the whole concept of the postal service since the days of Charles Bianconi.  Here is the great let-out. What is to be the alternative?  What are the acceptable alternative arrangements that the Minister or new boards have in mind?  The people are entitled to be told what the alternatives are.  The people must recognise in this Bill that the fact that their friends and relations pay the appropriate poundage on a letter of importance addressed to them does not mean now that the letter must be delivered by the new company.  The company are not required to deliver that postal packet.  They will find someone else perhaps to deliver it.  How will it be delivered, when and by whom?  The whole concept of the postal service is destroyed in this Bill and it is open to abuse and exploitation of every kind.  God help the people in rural Ireland if this Bill is passed unaltered.  What chance have they of getting their post delivered in the mountainous regions, in the distant towns, or indeed in the high-rise flats?  Wherever delivery is inconvenient, here is a let-out. Whenever it becomes uneconomic to deliver a letter or postal packet, here is a let-out.  As I have quoted already:</P>
    <P>The company shall not be required to deliver...</P>
    <P>This is the most damnable aspect of this Bill.  We have always been led to believe and understand that once we appended the appropriate poundage to a letter by way of a stamp that was a guarantee that that letter would be delivered to the addressee.  That guarantee is gone.  This is the negation of what a postal service stands for.  We need some reassurance in this area.  Licensing, courier services and so on, perhaps are new ideas that we must get used to, but our people are not yet ready for a worsening of the service to which they have been accustomed. <Col N="1245" /> We, as rural Deputies in this House, have a right to insist that the service they have been used to shall continue and will not worsen.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister contemplate that the issue of television licences and the follow-up in respect of non-payment of licences is to be taken away from the Post Office employees at local level who have been carrying out that work in recent years?  There is concern about the withdrawal of this work from the people who have been carrying it out and the possibility of it being operated from a central base perhaps here in Dublin.  If there is a serious intention to centralise the operation of the issue and collection of licence moneys here in Dublin that seems to us to be most unwise and uneconomic and much of the value of the licence fee will have been eroded in the cost involved in collection from such a centralised base. Perhaps the Minister will allay the fears of a section of people, small though it be, in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have observed that the boards shall have exclusive privilege in the telecommunications area generally.  Here I want to make a comment about the desire of many people for multi-channel television. People in rural Ireland are no longer prepared to be treated as second class citizens in the matter of television viewing. They feel, rightly, that they are entitled to the same service as is enjoyed by people in this city and so many other cities and large sections of the community who have access to a variety of television channels.  I urge the Minister to recognise the democratic right of these people and their overall desire for this facility and not do anything to stultify them in their genuine desire for cable television where such is available.  People in Clonmel have for years agitated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is coming up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Lovely, Minister.  I have been at the forefront of that.  I remember the first occasion on which I put down a question calling for an extension of multi-channel television and there were frowns all around.  It has now become common place.  We have been seeking the <Col N="1246" /> facility in Clonmel of cable TV for years. The corporation, of which I am senior alderman, were unanimous in their desire for this.  The public at large were clamouring for it.  I and the Minister know that it has now reached a final stage.  A competition was held to find the successful person to implement this great facility.  I am grateful for the Minister's nod to me that it is progressing satisfactorily, but I wonder if the outcome of the competition is known yet, who the successful person is and when the work will commence.  There is much anxiety among the people to see the work commence and any information the Minister has on the matter would be much appreciated.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister's predecessors for assisting fully in the provision of cable television for Clonmel.  I am also aware that my neighbours in Cashel town have had meetings demanding such a facility. I urge the Minister and his Department to lend their fullest support to the people of Cashel to enable them to achieve their desire to have cable television.  I understand a suitable signal has been found and that it is a feasible proposition.  It is dangerous for a public representative to be selective in mentioning areas of this kind.  I have always taken the view that the people are entitled to this service and I shall continue my agitation for any of my constituents in South Tipperary and West Waterford who require this facility and shall make apologies to no one.  We are no lesser personalities than the citizens of Dublin, Cork, Galway or elsewhere. We are paying the same licence and are entitled to the same facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make a special plea for telephonists in the changes which will take place with the establishment of these boards.  The Minister will be aware that there is great concern in my constituency in respect of the telephonist staff at Clonmel, Tipperary town and other centres about possible redundancy.  I would be grateful to the Minister if he would have regard to the fears of telephonists and do all he can to allay their fear.  In my opening remarks I said that we are not against change, but change involving a radical measure of this kind should be of a very gradual nature.  There must be no indecent <Col N="1247" /> haste.  With the advent of the automatic telephone system it is understood that the exchanges at Clonmel and Tipperary Town may become redundant with the consequent loss of many jobs. The number of telephonists in Clonmel and Tipperary Town are such that we regard it as an important industry.  It is an important social and economic adjunct to our towns and its removal will have an adverse effect on the business community of the towns in question. Everything should be done to provide alternative employment for these people. While we welcome the introduction of automatic telephone services, the genuine anxiety of the men and women involved should be given consideration.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party are opposing this measure for the reasons we have outlined.  We shall be putting down suitable amendments on Committee Stage. If the Minister thinks this Bill will pass in its present form, he has another think coming to him.  This Bill may never see the light of day and I trust it shall never emanate from either House of the Oireachtas in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, have reservations about the proposal before us, but overriding those concerns we should make it clear that there is need for updating and improving the postal and telecommunications services.  It is quite clear that for many years there has been a degeneration of the standard of service, both in the quality of service, its responsiveness to the public and its degree of relative waste of public finances.  Therefore, this measure affords us an opportunity to face the issues.  No one will claim that this is the total answer.  I presume the Minister does not either.  However, there are many commendable aspects to it.  I would not like to discourage any Government or Minister from tackling this huge monolith or any of the other huge corporations we have at present by unduly pessimistic forecasts about the expected failure rate or otherwise of the proposal. The concept of breaking up a corporation of the magnitude of 25,000 or 30,000 people is a good one.  It is perfectly clear <Col N="1248" />&mdash; and the literature is very extensive on it &mdash; that the larger the corporation the less likely it is to be efficient, satisfying to the workers and to the public it is expected to serve.  I am a believer that in this, as in many other instances, small is beautiful and that we should do all posssible to increase efficency and improve the working conditions of people by ensuring that there is a satisfactory size to the operation involved.</P>
      <P>Before going on to deal with that I should like to make this observation.  The real reason this Bill is being introduced is the increasing failure of Governments to be able to bring our present postal and telecommunications services to a standard satisfactory to us all.  This inability to act, this kind of mesmerism which has faced us all with the burgeoning growth of the public service &mdash; in many respects it is very satisfactory but in many others it is appallingly bad &mdash; may cause us to take action such as this for the wrong reasons.  I would argue very strongly that the standards we expect are comparable with those in other semi-State bodies or even in areas of the private sector.  There should be no inherent reason why the staff in the public service should not be able to reach such standards if given the leadership.  The real reason they have not is because the public service for years has had no goal or target.  No member of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, no member active in the postal and telecommunications services has any idea whatever of where they are going, what is their work and what is expected of them. They operate within no framework, no parameter of the public service, no goal, no target, no objective of any kind. Nobody can work in that environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overriding rule in the public service is to act in accordance with precedent, on the basis that safety comes first. No initiative is encouraged or rewarded. Too often lack of initiative goes unsanctioned and unreproved.  A much more imaginative, flexible, innovative approach to the public service, acting in accordance with a clear comprehensive policy for that area of the public service, devised and laid down by a wise and courageous Government, would mean <Col N="1249" /> that we do not have to go into this kind of escape hatch for areas of the public service such as this.  Why is it that it is now expected by the public at large, and widely perceived, that if it is anything to do with Government, local authorities or the Office of Public Works it is automatically lazy, less productive than the private sector, wasteful and inefficient?  The reason is that it is probably all of those things in part or in whole and that we have allowed that to happen.  I want to make it quite clear that I not at all blaming the workers involved.  None of the workers involved has the slightest idea of what standards are expected of him or her.  Nobody has given them any indication of their target personally, or as a Department, or as a section of a Department.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this approach to the postal and telecommunications services may well work, but not unless there is a comprehensive, national communications development policy, one which embraces all of those areas of communications now and for the foreseeable future.  That is a very exciting area of technological innovation, one which we have not even begun to face up to in this House or in the country yet &mdash; except of course for some enterprising people in the private area who have some idea of what is going on in fields further afield than this and who have readily embraced new technology, using it wisely and sensibly, though there are dangers in that also, as was hinted at yesterday by my colleague, Deputy J. Mitchell.</P>
    <P>The challenges of the future may well be met by something like this Bill.  I should like the Minister to say whether or not this is something that was conceived as a genuine mechanism for tackling the challenges of the future in this area or as some kind of a device for evading responsibility arising out of the disastrous strike which occurred in this area some years ago &mdash; that this is in a sense a way of saying: &ldquo;Lord, if it be Thy will, let this chalice pass from me&rdquo;?  That is not the kind of approach we should take to what is a most essential and economic need and what is also, as it happens, a financially very viable area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1250" /> If the service is given, the public are willing to pay.  At present they are expected to pay and the service is not being provided.  This basic idea &mdash; and I shall not dwell any longer on it &mdash; that State bodies by definition are now accepted to be wasteful, less conscious of standards is something we will have to face up to.  The growth of the public service, operating outside the framework of any national policy of goals, targets or objectives, short, medium or long term, constitutes an enormous threat &mdash; in my view, one of the very major threats facing the future of this country.  It will simply be impossible to carry this burgeoning, wasteful system.  Not only that, but the workers within that service are being under-used and their resources left untapped.</P>
    <P>I happen to believe fervently that there are very many fine public servants involved in the public service who, if given the chance, have something very fine indeed to contribute and that they should not be used as the but of public ridicule or abuse.  At the same time they should be able to face up to honest criticism when given.  However, the basic failure is not one of public servants but of Governments, Governments who have consistently failed to say to the public service what they expect from them. Nobody can operate in that environment.</P>
    <P>The postal and telecommunications area is obviously in need of modernisation and updating.  It is quite extraordinary that in an age of micro-technology, of instant communication, in some cases crossing continents, it now takes four and five times longer to have delivered a simple letter than it took some years ago and that, relatively speaking, we are paying a lot more for it.  I have been struck very often by pleas from people in the commercial area &mdash; whether in business in this country, whether in importing, setting up new businesses, tourism &mdash; for telephone services.  I shall not go into constituency details but all of us have mounds of correspondence from people who are endeavouring to provide jobs. Basically they say: look, we cannot get a telephone, we cannot get a telex and, according to the Department, we shall <Col N="1251" /> not have it for the next two years.  I appreciate also that there is no point in expecting this Minister to wave a magic wand, that the kind of capital and infrastructural investment necessary to bring about that kind of service virtually on tap is something that must be planned.  In all honesty I do not see in this Bill any great concern about that kind of fundamental investment; it is a restructuring arrangement for the administration of the existing network.  That troubles me a little.  I would like to see much more commitment to a fundamental appreciation that a quantum leap forward is necessary if we are to have services, as we need them, for jobs, tourism, indeed for the ordinary citizen.</P>
    <P>One thing also is clear and it is this: if this proposal is to succeed &mdash; and I think in itself it can succeed &mdash; it can do so only with goodwill and co-operation all round. There is evidence to show that up to now there has not been the concern with meeting the reasonable requests of staff at this stage in the manner which will guarantee that success.  I am not one of those who subscribes to the view that consultation is a process whereby discussions continue until one comes around to the other chap's point of view.  At the same time there is at present fairly scant respect shown to the 25,000 to 30,000 workers involved.  Their unions have expressed dissatisfaction.  Of course unions do that regularly, in some cases without it necessarily being warranted.  In this case, however, it is warranted.  The Minister will have a major hurdle to overcome if the inexorable slide towards industrial confrontation continues.  It is in his hands to defuse that, if it is not already too late. That has to be done.</P>
    <P>Indeed in that respect, just to give the House a specific idea of what I am talking about, I should like to give an indication of how this potentially disastrous industrial relations problem has developed. Apparently, despite requests from the unions, I am told that the only figures which were ever published or made available to the workers in the telephone operator grades by the management were buried in a small section of the National <Col N="1252" /> Board for Science and Technology's publication in July 1981 on micro-electronics and the implications for Ireland.  This showed that the present five-year telephone development plan is expected to reduce the jobs for telephone operators from 5,600 to approximately 1,000.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we should artificially sustain areas of the public service or the private sector merely to take the gloss off the unfortunate unemployment figures or somehow to impede progress.  If change is necessary and if that means redundancies the Government and all of us have a duty to face up to and say: &ldquo;That is the way it has to be&rdquo;.  If we did not pursue that logic we would presumably be putting children up chimneys to keep them clean.  However, it does not mean that we should ignore or neglect the needs of people who are liable to be made redundant in this way or ignore their request for information at this stage in the belief that the less we tell them the better.  I have been getting requests from people in this areas for assurances and information.</P>
    <P>The loss of about 4,500 jobs is three times the number lost in Ferenka about which there was a national debate.  That loss does not cover other grades apart from the actual operators and their supervisors. At a lecture in TCD on <i>Digitalisation of the Telecommunication Network</i> in December 1981 Mr. A. J. Mullen the director of Development, Planning and Personnel confirmed that there was no prospect of absorbing this huge number of telephone operators whose jobs were to go.  The growth in lines and subscribers will not offset cutbacks in operators needed.  In fact, the improvement in the quality of the automatic service will speed up these cuts.  All manual exchanges are eventually to be closed, the old style coin boxes are to be converted to direct dial and the failure of the ISD and STD leading to calls through operators will, hopefully, shortly be eliminated by the drop in network failure.  With the target rate of 3 per cent failure per 100 direct dial calls being reached, as we are told, by the middle of next year, the calls which still need an operator should be put through <Col N="1253" /> much more quickly obviously, since the operator would have access also to a much improved fully automatic network. It is reasonable to expect that, if we are to ensure that technology applies to this area, there will be job losses.  I do not believe that in itself is a disaster provided we deal properly and honestly with the consequences and tell people now rather than have this thing develop secretly and in stealth behind the backs of the people involved.</P>
    <P>The number of operators expected to be needed at the end of the present five-year plan will be about 1,500, which is a huge decrease.  Mr. Smurfit, the chairman of one of the boards involved, in a letter to the staff involved said at one stage: &ldquo;I will shortly be sending you more detailed information explaining the potential opportunities for all levels of staff which the new service will offer.&rdquo; That letter has never reached the staff. Mr. Tom Byrne, the proposed chief executive of Bord Telecom was quoted in the official Posts and Telegraphs staff magazine <i>Pagust</i> as saying:</P>
    <P>We would like to create a situation where each member of the staff felt fully informed about the board's activities and plans.</P>
    <P>Later in the same communication he stated:</P>
    <P>The staff have nothing to fear from change.</P>
    <P>Mr. Smurfit in his publication to the Post Office staff &ldquo;The Way Forward in our Telecommunications Services and Your Role in their Future&rdquo; said:</P>
    <P>New skills will be called upon, new jobs created, there will be changing programmes from which you can benefit. There is a great future in communications; these are exciting times for us all.</P>
    <P>That is the right heady inspirational note. Unfortunately, however, these indications of goodwill, co-operation and honest dealing with workers have not yet been matched by action.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Reynolds was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, in his note to staff in the Green Paper on Re-organisation <Col N="1254" /> of the Postal and Telecommunications services he said:</P>
    <P>The Government believe that the change to State-sponsored status will be in the best interests of the staff.</P>
    <P>I share this view.  That was never spelt out.  If the best interests of staff are to be fully met some ground has got to be made up because there is a credibility gap at the present time.  I am deeply troubled that an essential courageous attempt to face up to the huge problem involved in the postal and telecommunications services area could very well be left aside or obstructed indefinitely by virtue of possible avoidable delays which will occur inevitably if this issue at the industrial relations level is not dealt with honestly and openly.</P>
    <P>I am a firm believer that it is much better to deal honestly and openly with industrial relations problems at their root rather than hoping that the problem will go away if we ignore it or that the weight of numbers in here or the weight of public opinion, as it could in this case, will steamroll people into eventual submission. That rarely works.  Even if it did, as a device it is dishonest and dishonourable because it does not deal with people in the manner to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>Mr. Tom Byrne, the proposed chief executive of Bord Telecom in his second annual report said:</P>
    <P>Clarification was frequently sought on the options to staff with regard to future areas of employment.  Chapter 10 addressed this question and to my mind answered it fully.</P>
    <P>However, Chapter 10 of the White Paper, &ldquo;Implications for the Staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs&rdquo; said:</P>
    <P>Many unions and associations made submissions expressing concern about their prospects, loss of status etc.</P>
    <P>It went on to say in paragraph 10 (2):</P>
    <P>This White Paper does not purport to contain answers to these questions.</P>
    <P>One can only conclude that Mr. Byrne or chapter 10 of this report is wrong. <Col N="1255" /> Regarding details on options to remain civil servants, return to that status or on permanency of employment, it merely says that all will be the subject of consultation with staff unions and associations. The present Minister, in a message on the publication of the Bill, told the staff:</P>
    <P>You and your staff associations will be kept fully advised of further developments.</P>
    <P>The staff involved note that this admits a duty to tell each of the staff.  Unfortunately, it seems to come from the same management which intend to make a lot of people redundant without informing them that they will do so.  There is at this stage very substantial distrust.</P>
    <P>That little resume has surely enough straws in the wind, to put it mildly, to give an indication of a very dangerous pattern of probable behaviour, whereby a number of people charged with public responsibility, consistently attempt to reassure staff, apparently facing redundancy, while at the same time withholding the information and not honouring their intended action and genuine consultation. The result of that process is inevitable.  Apart from the great distrust which exists, which I deeply regret, of the Minister and Bord Telecom, there will be serious industrial relations troubles unless an immediate change about comes in this particular area of dealing with the staff and their unions.</P>
    <P>A more recent example of it occurred in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 29 May last when the staff discovered for the first time plans for the number of jobs for their operator grades, which was presented as an unpublished report, while apparently a spokesman for the Department was quoted as being unaware of any forward projections with figures for the number of operator positions outlined.  There is reason to believe that a lot of ground has to be made up in this area.  I appeal to the Minister, if he genuinely wants progress in this area, to come clean with the trade unions and the workers so that we can avert the inevitable industrial trouble which may very well put into the shade <Col N="1256" /> the strike which caused such hardship some years ago.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on all of us to try to improve our systems, be they of communications or otherwise, and, in that context, I believe there is a role not just for Governments and for vested interests but for the trade unions.  I appeal to the trade unions to take an enlightened approach to this and, while solidly defending the rights of their workers, which I believe the Government have not up to date, honoured in the manner I would like to see, there is an obligation on them and an opportunity for them to say &ldquo;This is an area in which we would like to make some positive contribution.  We believe that good postal and telecommunications, and a proper network of telephones, telex, data systems, microtechnology, computers and so forth are all in the interests of the workers of this country, and we would like to make the following contribution &mdash;&rdquo; and they can suggest improvements. It is not adequate for a trade union or a Member of the Opposition simply to stand apart from the situation and criticise the proposed development in a negative and destructive manner.  Our obligation and that of the trade union supersede that.  This is a role which probably has not yet been fully met by the unions involved.  I would like them to be concerned with the issues at the heart of the improvements here and which surely point the way forward to a better and happier industrial development and job situation for people, perhaps not in the telecommunications area alone, but in other areas where economic progress has been inhibited by a very poor standard of service in this respect.  That challenge is also with the unions.</P>
    <P>We must be very careful indeed when these boards get off the ground that the criteria by which they operate are not merely or exclusively those of the commercial market place.  Wherever a State service can be made viable or can offer a service which makes money, it should do so.  I do not believe that the State should be the lame duck in this respect and need only be involved with what I may call the social area which nobody else will touch. <Col N="1257" /> It has every right to compete, to make money and be viable.  It operates by virtue of public funds.  As far as I am concerned, that is the same input and investment as the private individual makes to a company.  There is no reason for the State to hang back in this respect.  There are many areas in the telecommunications sphere which would be very remunerative financially and supportive of other areas which must exist by virtue of social need and which may not be financially attractive.  In some cases, these areas may lose large amounts of money, but they must be sustained.</P>
    <P>We must resist every attempt to remove services from or diminish them to people in our community, who are weaker, geographically at a disadvantage, or disadvantaged in one way or another and who, if such service were operated purely on criteria of the commercial sphere would not get a service at all.  That caveat must be entered into when we move towards a more modern, more efficient it is hoped, and more viable telecommunications area.  I would like the Minister to deal with this matter, if possible.  It is right that the public should be involved in this Bill.  The more public information there is, and the more explanation to the public in simple terms of what is happening, the better.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that we are in the age of microtechnology which has its dangers and difficulties.  I have long felt that there is need for legislation protecting the availability of data on the private citizen and long been aware of the possibility and the practice of abuse in relation to phone tapping, invasion of privacy and lack of data protection.  I was pleased when my colleague raised this issued yesterday about a specific case.  However, it would be wrong to construe this was the only issue involved.  The issue is much broader than that and involves a growing concern by members of the public that their privacy is being invaded regularly, that the right to privacy is not respected, that the telephone system can be used to abuse that right.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the growth and development of microtechnology, which I welcome as a fine development, is something <Col N="1258" /> which must be guarded against possible abuses.  Other countries have moved in that respect, but here at present we do not meet with the minimum standards required by the European Court of Human Rights as laid down by them in a judgment of 1973 in a case dealing with a German citizen.  They clearly said then that the criteria operating in Germany in 1973 were the minimum to accord with the standards of the European Court of Human Rights.  Here there are no criteria whatever.</P>
    <P>I have explained in former Dáil Questions and in correspondence with successive Ministers the manner in which such abuses are perpetrated with great ease and facility of access by anyone involved, or with access and a little technological knowledge.  That is an area with which these boards must be concerned.  I note, in passing, that they are, naturally enough, to be given access to all the personal files of the personnel involved, that the Minister intends transferring to the proposed State company the existing files which would obviously deal with problems of staff over the years in a variety of respects, dealing with sick leave, late attendances, records of discipline and so on.  However, the issue is bigger than that.  It is about the right to privacy of the ordinary citizen.  At present, it is true to say that many telephone calls begin with a statement from one person to another saying &ldquo;Do not talk about it on the phone, I do not trust the telephones&rdquo;.  That is a very bad situation.</P>
    <P>In Britain, there is a very extensive network of eavesdropping equipment which has been well documented by the media there.  Here, too, there is an extensive network which has not been well documented.  In normal circumstances, in the United States and most European countries under the Freedom of Information Act it would be possible to get access.  Here there is no such Act and there is a paranoia about secrecy, about very trite, minute details going back decades. This binds us all to ignorance.</P>
    <P>I tried recently to get some very simple military historical data for a constituent who was interested for a thesis.  It was impossible to obtain, even though the <Col N="1259" /> data went back 45 years.  That is a shame. The right to privacy has been referred to widely in the literature dealing with this area and I will just quote from an article in <i>The Economist</i> of April 2 1977 entitled &ldquo;The American Press and the Law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In 1890 Louis Brandice and Samuel Warren, disturbed by the flood of gossip and prurience in the American press, wrote an article for the Howard Law Review urging the creation of a legal right of privacy.  The article had a remarkable impact.  Over the years all States have established, by either judicial decision or statute, a right to sue for evasion of privacy.  New technological methods of snooping have made privacy an even more cherished value.  Brandice was on the Supreme Court in 1928 when it decided that police wire-tapping was not a search subject to constitutional restrictions. In the great dissent he recalled a phrase from his 1890 article &ldquo;The right to be left alone, the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That happened in the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century. Europe caught up rapidly with that. Britain and Ireland are at the bottom of the league and Britain is ahead of us in that respect.  In the democratic world, we have the worst record in relation to legislation on the right of access by the citizen to information and protection of the right to privacy.  Neither of these is protected by law.  As far as I can judge, phonetapping is not an offence or a crime.  Eavesdropping on a phone is not outlawed.  In those circumstances, it is quite clear there will be and has been abuse.  It is technically possible and many people accept that it occurs.  I am not suggesting that there is an extensive network like the Tinkerbell network in Britain.  I do not know if there is.  I do know that repeated attempts to get information from successive Ministers in this House have failed.  The answers have been couched in a manner which is certainly not calculated to reassure those of us concerned with this issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> I do not believe that in a country like this rights can be eliminated overnight. They are probably nibbled at, diminished monthly by gradual inroads not clearly noticeable to people concerned about these issues.  When we are speaking about the postal and telecommunications area we must appreciate that it is an area in which new technology is at its most effective. For example, most people are not aware that mail may now be read or scanned by fibre optic technology without the post being opened.  Most people are not aware that it is easy to eavesdrop on telephones and that there is no protection for people in that respect, no right of inquiry or of appeal if comments arising from such eavesdropping are put on public record.  People are not even aware of the existence of public records because they are not entitled to see them.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we should have specific legislation to deal with the matters I will now refer to.  There should be a law to deal with people's right to know: surely, the right to know the truth is a cornerstone of democracy which should be enshrined in the Statute Book.  It is not there at present.  Reports about citizens are garnered and developed and embelished over the years.  Citizens are unaware that such files exist.</P>
    <P>There is the right to privacy.  The first major exemption from free disclosure of information is that of privacy.  Personal information should not be divulged freely or disseminated if it would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy, and a person should have the right to pursue that issue.  There is the right to inspect. This will be very important in the context of this Bill because the unions will want, and they have my support in this, the right to inspect records which might be defamatory of their members about alleged performances.  If a person is a malingerer, if he is unable to work in accordance with the standards on which he was employed, it should be noted and dealt with, but that man or woman should know what is being said about him or her by others.  Such a person should have access consistent with his right to ensure that the record is accurate.  That right is not available at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> There should be the right to correct: an individual should have the right to correct information about himself if the information is demonstrably incorrect. Such a right does not now exist.  At present, in this Department, personnel files are subject to footnotes about staff, added to and commented on by senior staff, going up the line to the Minister's desk, without any right of inspection, correction or comment by the workers, who in many cases are innocent parties in regard to comments which might very well harm them.</P>
    <P>People should have the right to enjoy a situation in which only valid information may be disseminated and used by the administration.  Here we are dealing with a vast technological area, and the unions make the point that if we are to have a change to these new arrangements it should be a change that will give a fresh start, fresh confidence and fresh trust from the point of view of employer-employee relations.  Also there should be rapid action available in the courts to enforce these rights if people are reluctant to grant them.</P>
    <P>This debate affords us the opportunity to make these observations about the extremely unsatisfactory position obtaining here.  We do not honour even the minimum requirements of the European Court of Human Rights or the recent OECD guidelines on privacy, which are fairly minimal but which are at least a charter for action by Governments in civilised countries.  None of those is observed and Deputies on the far side have not been expressing concern about this.  On any occasion when this has been pointed out by this side it has been pooh-poohed and we have been discouraged from pursuing it.  The Minister has ample opportunity through this Bill to ensure that we can take the step forward that is now necessary to protect the right to privacy of the public in regard to the extremely leaky telephone system that is operated: in some parts of the country it is almost impossible to get anything but a crossed line, if it posible to get service at all.</P>
    <P>This opportunity should be taken to restructure the Department not merely <Col N="1262" /> in regard to the postal and telecommunications area.  There should be a comprehensive communications plan, prepared with an open mind so that there would be an ability to deal with the exciting technological developments which augur very well for people who endure sheer drudgery, which passes for work but is more likely to be toil.  We are on the edge of a great new frontier in this respect. Heavy jobs which can be eased by advanced technology will be diminished if not eliminated altogether.  I welcome that, <i>per se</i>, but at the same time I appreciate the enormous social challenge involved in absorbing the vast amount of time that will become available to workers.  There is a need to retrain workers, to look at job sharing implications and other matters that arise.  The more efficient the postal and telecommunications services become the more likely it is that a substantial wastage of workers will arise.  I hope the Minister will deal openly and honestly with it.  That has not been done to date.</P>
    <P>At the end, I will deal with a few points of a minor nature.  For instance, people are continuously confronted with problems in relation to their telephone bills. I am not satisfied that people have an opportunity to check their bills.  There is no court of appeal: if one writes back to say he does not agree with the bill, the response invariably is, &ldquo;We have checked it out.  I am sorry you owe the money and you will be cut off if the bill is not paid&rdquo;. I have known of cases, and I am sure the Minister will agree, in which individuals have been wronged in that way.  I know two elderly people who are billed for a trunk call which they maintain they never made.  They were billed for £6 or £7 for it but after representations the Department graciously agreed to let the thing slide.  However these people were warned they would be cut off.  I assume this occurs regularly.</P>
    <P>Therefore, a metering facility should be provided for those who need it, as they have in regard to ESB, gas and other services.  Such meters exist but on recent inquiry I found that apparently they are never in stock or are so far behind in stock that their existence is a myth for <Col N="1263" /> ordinary people.  There does not seem to be any concern in the Department to get telephone meters for people who want them.  This is particularly of concern to elderly people or to anyone who, like most of us has to live on a fixed income.  I appeal to the Minister openly and honestly to deal with the accountability of the Posts and Telegraphs engineering department in regard to faults.  It is almost impossible for a Deputy, not to mind a member of the public, to get a straight answer as to what technically has happened in relation to a fault that has developed.  There appears to be a conspiracy of silence; there seems to be a view in certain sections of the Department that the public either are beneath such technical knowledge or are not entitled to it.  I should like the Minister to tell us whether technical information is available concerning faults and if not what he will do to make it available.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the extremely unsightly impact of telegraph poles and wires on the landscape.  There may be an easy answer to this.  If such communications infrastructures, as it were, could be buried in the ground or borne on existing lamp standards or other standards, this could diminish the number of extremely unsightly perspectives in many parts of the country.  I know places in which an appalling motley of poles and standards have to be maintained. Not only are they environmentally unaesthetic but they are costing a fortune.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I will be referring to sections 39 and 42 in particular which deal with employment and labour questions. Labour is now my brief.  I want to give the Minister notice of the difficulty I see.  I am sure the unions have made it clear to him.  I appeal to him to deal with it now rather than letting it fester and develop to a stage where we cannot enact this legislation because of intransigence on either side.  The problem can be defused if people act responsibly now.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong for speaker after speaker to appear to castigate areas of the public service without paying tribute to them as well.  I was treated with great <Col N="1264" /> courtesy by many people in the Department. People went to great lengths above and beyond the call of duty to deal sympathetically with queries and complaints. I should like to to pay tribute to them. The same goes for the engineering section of the Department.  On occasions they have had to brave extraordinary conditions and elements.  They would probably welcome anything which would make their job more efficient, rewarding and satisfactory.  The whole question of job satisfaction arises in Government services.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister a question which just came into my head.  It will eliminate the need for me to put down a question which will probably not be reached.  Recently, unfortunately, the Minister of State has fallen into the very irritating habit of replying to representations about likely telephone installations in a very bland and general way.  I raised this matter with his office on three occasions so I am not jumping the gun. I have put down Dáil questions which I will now withdraw because I hope the Minister will answer me when he is replying.</P>
    <P>I should like him to try to see the enormous volume of correspondence which I presume he gets from members of the public and from Deputies not as an irritant but as an indication of the need for proper information systems in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and, indeed, in other Government Departments.  Would that we did not have to write these infernal letters.  They are no more pleasure to write than to receive.  If we had rapid access to information and good standards of reply there would not be a problem.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the new boards will deal with that.  Mr. Quinn and Mr. Smurfit are outstanding examples of how to achieve commercial and entrepreneurial success. They have given fine employment.  We owe them a debt of gratitude for taking on this very thankless job.  I hope it will not become a two-headed monster.  I am sure they have given amply of their time to try to devise a modern and progressive postal and telecommunications service which will meet the challenge of the next <Col N="1265" /> two or three decades.  If this is done it will be a cornerstone in tackling our economic problems.  I have seen new industrial clusters in remote parts of the country without a telephone line available to them.  That is a contradication in terms and shows we are not getting our priorities right.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill success.  The principle of the Bill is good.  The breaking up of big corporations is a good thing and should be followed up.  The Bill is not likely to succeed unless there is a radical review of the way in which the industrial relations aspect has been handled to date.  The Minister will give that priority if he believes we should proceed in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to listen as carefully as I could to the contributions to this debate.  To me it has been a far-reaching, rewarding and unexpectedly revealing exercise.  I hope the Minister and the Minister of State have listened carefully to the debate.  The Minister walked a minefield as Minister for Education.  He showed himself to be a shrewd, skilful and adroit performer, and a good tightrope walker as Minister for Education. Clearly he will need all his talents and skills to steer this Bill through the House in its present form.</P>
      <P>The Minister may not heed my advice to him on this Bill, but it would be a foolish Minister who would ignore the feelings of workers and trade unionists in his Department.  We live in a changing world and, therefore, public institutions and structures in our society must keep pace with those changes.  Change does not always come easily or painlessly to us.  I marvel at how some changes have been achieved in other countries relatively easily and smoothly.  I refer to some of the Scandinavian countries and countries on the Continent where technological changes have come about relatively painlessly and smoothly compared with the difficulties we have in our own society, and the dislocation when change is attempted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having been involved in trade union negotiations for 22 years I have some understanding of and sympathy for the Minister in his role in this area.  Perhaps <Col N="1266" /> because of our history and the legacy of insecurity and unemployment here, change is difficult for us to achieve.  When it comes in our society, it often comes in a sluggish and begrudging manner.  I concede that there is a great need for change in many aspects of our society today.  In the words of the cliche, there is a need to bell a number of cats.  There is a marked reluctance to carry out the work of belling those cats.  For better or for worse, the Minister has been charged with piloting this Bill through the House and belling the cats.</P>
    <P>All Members of the House will agree that if we are to compete in the world we need an efficient and modern telecommunications system.  All Members will agree that there are many flaws and inefficiencies in our present system.  Surveys, studies and investigations have been carried out in the Minister's Department in the past, some by foreign firms such as firms from Sweden and other countries. While it is very difficult to classify all these surveys under a few headings, it is true to say that these studies generally have found that our workers in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are as good as workers in other countries. What was found lacking was leadership and good management at the top, and the finances and equipment necessary to carry out the work involved in telecommunications.</P>
    <P>We can learn much from other countries if we look at how they coped with the problems.  When Conor Cruise-O'Brien was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs he identified the lack of finance correctly as the major factor responsible for hindering the development of an efficient telecommunications system.  Conor Cruise-O'Brien also favoured the introduction of BBC television throughout the country.  I supported him in that decision. There was a campaign carried out against the introduction of multi-channel television. Unfortunately that campaign was successful.  I opposed that campaign as being selective and restrictive.  It is in the interest of democracy that multi-channel television should be widely available throughout the whole country.  Let us hope the commitment given by the present <Col N="1267" /> Minister, Deputy Wilson, will be carried out as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Albert Reynolds was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs he appeared to concentrate on the need for more telephones but unfortunately when he eventually went on to greener pastures our telephone system was left very much as he found it with delays and constant frustrations all round.  We heard a great deal in the House yesterday about our telephone system and especially about vandalism to telephones throughout the country.  This vandalism is being carried out to a frightening degree.  But it is unfair to place the blame and the cost entirely on the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Vandalism is a sympton of our society as a whole.  It is difficult to tackle but we should enlist the aid of our schools, of television and radio to reduce the waste that vandalism is causing in our society.  There must be positive emphasis on this work as a means of saving money and creating a better and more civilised society.</P>
    <P>We heard in the House yesterday about telephone tapping in Leinster House.  Disclosures were made by Deputy Mitchell.  Who authorised this telephone tapping?  Who monitored the telephone conversations that were tapped?  What has happened to the tapes of these conversations?  There must be full investigation of this matter and the report of this investigation must be made available as soon as possible to all Members of this House.  Big Brother is obviously alive and well and living and listening in this House.  Surveillance is not too far away from intimidation and blackmail.  The number of telephones tapped should be made available to all Deputies in this House.  No telephone should be tapped unless for the greatest and gravest security reasons.  Telephone tapping is an erosion of democracy in our society and any extension of such must be opposed strenuously by all who love and believe in liberty and democracy.</P>
    <P>We also heard a lot about the implications of the Minister's Bill.  It was said that profitable work would be hived off to private interests.  I agree with this.  A <Col N="1268" /> good deal of work is being contracted out to private interests and not only in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I wonder if the Minister has quantified the amount of money involved here.  Has the Minister investigated how this work could be carried out by his own Department? I am satisfied that there is a considerable amount of waste here.  Many of the workers and trade unions in the Minister's Department are worried about this Bill.  They are worried about the security of their employment, their pension rights and conditions of employment.  Indeed they are worried about the very employment itself.  In the face of automation, in the face of high technology, Posts and Telegraphs workers have reason to be worried about their future.</P>
    <P>There have been consultations between the Minister and the workers but these consultations have not been adequate.  That is the important point to stress.  We have heard that consultations have gone on but we have not been told about the content of those consultations. If consultations are to be meaningful there must be give and take and cut and thrust.  That has not happened.  These consultations have not been conclusive and they have not been finalised in the interests of the workers and to their satisfaction and also to the satisfaction of their unions.  We pay lip service to the concept of industrial democracy at national and at local level.  But let us do something about that concept even now during the course of this Bill.  We are dealing with the human factor; we are dealing with the worries, fears and lives of workers in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It should not be impossible for us to reconcile the interests of the workers with the need for a good, efficient telecommunications service.</P>
    <P>Above all, the Minister must endeavour to identify national priorities at a time of financial recession.  The Department should husband their resources in the very best interests of our people.  It is important that the Minister should have central planning in his Department to carry out the priorities, to use the resources available to him in the best and most efficient manner.  That is the greatest <Col N="1269" /> priority right now.  As it is the Minister is on a collision course.  This debate has done much to identify problems and objectives in the Minister's Department and I am sure the workers and their unions will have learned a great deal from this debate.  The Minister is something of a student of languages and he will probably be familiar with the Irish quotation &ldquo;mol an óige and tiocfaidh sí&rdquo;, &ldquo;praise youth and it will respond&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In this context the Minister must endeavour to win the support and confidence of the workers because to go against them at this juncture would be a foolish and unwise move.  I am not here to tell the Minister how to do his job but I hope we have all benefited from this debate, including the Minister.  Surely it is not too late for all parties to bury their differences and come together in a civilised way in the interests of telecommunications, in the interests of our people, in the interests of the whole future and survival of our society.  This joint approach is the best and only way forward for us all and for the Minister.  I counsel the Minister to take this approach rather than continue on this collision course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I cautiously welcome the Bill.  The telecommunications section of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs needs to be re-examined, redesigned and restructured to meet modern needs.  I accept at this stage that the semi-State concept has gained so much momentum throughout the structures of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs that there is no way it can be stopped at this time. Therefore we have to accept it.  My personal experience is that very few people in the Department are enthusiastic about it.  There is a need for something to be done but I am not too sure if the present concept of a semi-State idea is the one that will eventually come through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My greatest fear at the moment is the lack of enthusiasm on the part of the workers.  In the recent past the unions have not been happy about the way the Bill was introduced.  They have accused the Minister of undue and indecent haste. The Bill will have to be delayed until such time as there is full and complete consultations <Col N="1270" /> and discussion with all the unions concerned.  Staff relations in the Department are so diabolically bad that one of the great fears I had as Minister of State was of trying to do anything without consulting all the different unions concerned. I recognise the interests of the union leaders in protecting the rights of their members. It is their job to exercise their rights and fight on behalf of their members. Nevertheless, it was difficult for anyone in the Minister's office to do anything without continually looking over his shoulder.</P>
    <P>One must ask who is responsible for this?  Is it the civil servants who operate the Department?  Is it the unions who run the services or is it the ministerial or governmental interests?  I do not know, but I am alarmed by the number of statements made by unions since the introduction of this Bill.  I will give a few headlines from the papers: &ldquo;Benefits Lost Worry Postal Workers&rdquo;, &ldquo;Union Threat to Postal Bill&rdquo;, &ldquo;Strike Threat by Post Office Union over Parity&rdquo;, &ldquo;Union Oppose P+T Breakoff&rdquo;, &ldquo;Civil Servants Demand Guarantees on Transfer&rdquo;, &ldquo;Not Enough Information on Communications Plan&rdquo;, &ldquo;Post Office Workers' Bill Fear&rdquo;, &ldquo;Post Office Workers will Fight to Keep Status&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Workers Bitter About Department's Planned Split&rdquo; and so on. There is ample evidence that the unions will not co-operate with the present approach to the Bill.  Therefore we must move forward cautiously and steadily.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record that from my experience in the short time I was in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, having broken through the veil between the workers and management and having got through to the workers, I found them reasonable in their approach if one listened to their point of view.  Unless we have the goodwill of the unions and all the workers in that Department, we will not resolve the problems in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It will be an idle and futile exercise to transfer the functions and authority from the present structure to the semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>Successive speakers so far &mdash; the absence of Government speakers, with <Col N="1271" /> the exception of the Minister, has been very noticeable &mdash; did not show any great enthusiasm for this Bill.  Deputy Faulkner, a former Minister, and Deputy Fitzpatrick <i>(Dublin South-Central)</i> a former Minister of State spoke about this. Deputy Faulkner while welcoming the Bill, praised the officials of the Department and said the fact that it was proposed to go semi-State was no reflection on them.  There is no reflection on those officials.  Rather the senior civil servants should be applauded for the service they have given the State, but Deputy Faulkner was blind to the responsibility he and others had as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>Since the foundation of the State the structure of that Department has been carried over from the British system.  The senior civil servants served the Minister and the Government and they did it loyally, irrespective of which Government were in power.  I give credit to Deputy Fitzpatrick for identifying the fact that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were starved of financial support and Government attention.  Over the years they should have been given the same attention as other services in the public sector, but sadly, they were neglected.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly said yesterday that we were going semi-State because Britain did.  The Minister will argue that we must go semi-State but I am not sure.  I believe there could have been a loosening up in that Department if there was a willingness on the part of the Minister to do so and if there had been agreement with the unions to rationalise.  The objects and target of the new semi-State bodies could be achieved by the Department's officials.</P>
    <P>There is an acceptance on the part of the people who will come under the umbrella of telecommunications &mdash; engineers, linesmen, and telephone operators &mdash; to go semi-State because for the first time the engineering section will be given money to do their job.  They will now have job satisfaction, doing what their bosses told the Government was required to give industry an opportunity to compete with the outside world because without <Col N="1272" /> proper telecommunications we cannot have a successful industrial programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly said we were going semi-State because the British did so but the Department say other countries are doing the same, but we are not identical to other countries.  We are more closely associated with the system operating in Britain.  Therefore, the blueprints used by other countries would not necessarily meet the criteria laid down for this country. Apart from the engineering section no one in the Department is enthusiastic about going semi-State, and there is a dampening of that enthusiasm on the part of the postal workers.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the telecom side will be a thriving industry.  There is a lot of money in telephones, telex and modern telecommunications.  We are living in what can be called a world of fantasy so far as telecommunications are concerned. No one knows from day to day how fast this service is developing.  This is an exciting time to be working on the telecommunications side and the workers are more than happy at the decentralisation which will give local managers more authority to deal with their everyday work.</P>
    <P>The workers will tell you that all these improvements can be carried out without going semi-State.  I believe there is a certain amount of jealousy because the people in control of the semi-State body will be getting all the credit for the work they are doing at present.  Apart from the guarded welcome by the telecommunications section, there is no enthusiasm for this change.  Therefore we must proceed with extreme caution.</P>
    <P>This Bill is well documented and is making a very good approach to finding a solution to our problems, but without the goodwill of the staff and the unions we will not resolve anything.  For example, there has been a great deal of discussion about the delay in delivering letters. We might talk about satellite communications and modern telecommunications, making instant contact with any part of the world, but that will not deliver a letter any faster.  The people of County Donegal who post a letter on <Col N="1273" /> Monday evening which is not delivered until Wednesday or Thursday will not be impressed if we go semi-State unless the service is improved.  It does not matter if we push our responsibilities on to a semi-State body if we do not solve our basic difficulties, the service will not be up to the standard required by the people who pay dearly for it.</P>
    <P>For example, when telecommunications are being dealt with by a semi-State body, will the telephone faults in Dublin city be remedied?  One of the scandals of today is that people are waiting for weeks to have their telephones repaired.  Does anyone think that moving from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to a semi-State board will change that if we do not have the goodwill of the men who do the work?  Will there be a change so far as the thousands waiting for telephones are concerned?  I cannot see that happening.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill with guarded caution. I am not quite sure if I am in favour of semi-State involvement because there is so much aggravation at the moment from the unions unless they get what they want.  Their conference has instructed the incoming national executive to enter into negotiations with the official side to secure the best possible package for their members and they have listed the following items.  The first item is security of tenure; second, safeguards to pay, conditions and superannuation; third, options on early retirement; fourth, the working arrangements; fifth, career and promotional expectations.</P>
    <P>We will have to consider the last item very carefully.  It will not affect engineers because they have their careers and get promotion, but it will affect members of other unions.  I will give an example.  Let us take the situation where two boys are recruited through the Civil Service Commission to join the civil service.  Both are interviewed on the same day and are taken into the civil service.  Through no choice on his part one boy is told he will work for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the other is sent to the Department of Finance.  One of those boys will not have to worry because he will be in the Department of Finance; but <Col N="1274" /> the other boy, who may have been much brighter and who may have been first on the list, is pushed into a semi-State body. He may well consider he has been discriminated against, but I will say more about that later.</P>
    <P>The unions also want a transitional period of ten years for promotional progression to general services for staff employed prior to vesting day and they say this should work in both directions. The unions have given good arguments why these points, which they have circulated to me and other Members, should be considered.  If I were one of them I would have the same human fears as they have.  They state that, while the Minister and the Department have been in discussion with them about their future, there has been no consultation.  There is a major difference between having discussions with someone and having consultation with them.  I recommend to the Minister that we move forward with caution.</P>
    <P>Many speakers in the debate have been citing the semi-State position as that of CIE and the ESB, but I wonder if that is accurate.  As I understand it, there could be an alternative.  There must be a more flexible form of administration to ensure that senior management will be in a better position to react more quickly to the needs of people.  Therefore, the present structures must be changed.  As I see it, we have stage one, namely, a Government Department; then we have State corporations such as CIE and the ESB; then we have semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>Semi-State bodies as envisaged in this Bill are a slightly different matter.  It is further away from a Government Department than CIE or the ESB.  There has been much aggravation on the part of the unions but it is not simply because they are against the concept of semi-State involvement.  Most people in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, whether on the postal or the telecommunication side, want to serve the public.  Many of them will talk in glowing terms of the kind of relationship that existed in the Department when they were recruited. They had pride in their work and they showed loyalty and honour to their <Col N="1275" /> duties.  That was probably more prominent in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs than in any other Department. Most of them will admit that since the long drawn-out strike this sense of loyalty has been sadly lacking.  Until we get back to that point again, this aggravation which is beginning to show its head again will not go away.  There was one proposal that, as an interim measure, we could look at an executive structure somewhere between the concept of semi-State and the present position that could obtain the same objective but which would not be as great a threat to the workers as the present proposal seems to be.  Perhaps we may have to retreat to that position.</P>
    <P>Our party will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage.  However, on Committee Stage we will put down a number of amendments and on that Stage we must deal with all points in detail.  I ask the Minister not only to give full attention to the unions concerned but also to take the Opposition parties into his confidence.</P>
    <P>It might not be a bad thing for democracy if, instead of meeting each other head on with horns locked on Committee Stage, we could have informal discussions with each other, because at the end of the day we are all working in the interests of the general public.  We are also in the public service and we must recognise that we serve the public.  The vested interests of any political party must be set aside because there are so many livelihoods involved.  No one has ever told me exactly how many people work in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  The figure varies from 28,000 to 32,000, so I will take a mean average of 30,000.  In addition, they have wives and families affected by this.  We must be very careful when dealing with people's livelihoods.  Some people will be made redundant.  The whole concept of rationalisation is that we are overmanned and that people must be laid off.  If they are to be laid off it should be done with dignity and they should not be thrown on the scrap heap because they are no longer wanted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney or I would be willing <Col N="1276" /> to meet the Minister, his Minister of State and other Department officials and talk at great length about our attitudes to this Bill.  I have already given an undertaking to all the unions concerned that I will make myself freely available over the summer months to discuss in detail any reasonable proposal put forward by them.  It is of paramount importance that the goodwill of everyone working in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is obtained, because if one union cries halt it does not matter how long we debate the matter here or whether the vesting day will be 1 October, 1 January or 1 April &mdash; it is only of paper value if we do not get the goodwill of the workers.</P>
    <P>We know that the industrial relations which have existed in the last four or five years in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have been so appalling that it has left us without a telephone or postal service for months.  In those days the workers in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were blamed for those disputes. I was one of the people who blamed them &mdash; my gut reaction was that they were at fault.  Having spent seven months in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, I wonder whether my criticism of the stand taken by the Post Office unions was fair, because I came across disputes in the Department which no one wanted to solve.  The officials dealing with them considered that they were right and that they could speak with expertise about how the job should be done.  There is no point in a boss telling workers how a job should be done if the workers consider there is a better way of doing it. Very often people who work on the ground and who do not have the same qualifications or broad vocabulary to express themselves nevertheless have the experience of getting the job done.  For example, at present there is a dispute in the Sheriff Street sorting office which has gone on for the past four years because the Department proposed to mechanise the sorting of parcels in that office.  The workers opposed the installation of machinery.  There was stalemate until I became involved in the arguments about who was right and wrong.  I discovered when I met the workers that they were <Col N="1277" /> not the bad boys I had understood them to be.  I told them so, because I had held them in such contempt privately.  I had thought they were acting in a dog in the manger fashion.  However, when you examine the various proposals to overcome disputes the people who do the job must have some reason for criticising the Department, otherwise they would not be in dispute.  They would not be leaders of trade unions if they did not express reasonably the views of the members whom they represent.  I admit some are rough diamonds, but not all, and even the rough diamonds have a human side to their personalities.</P>
    <P>There is a premises in Preston Street, about 150 yards away from Sheriff Street, which is idle and which could have been used.  The workers were prepared to do this and vacate Sheriff Street for a period to allow the Department to install machinery so that parcel post could be sorted mechanically.  This was not acceptable to some officials in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  On inspection of the Preston Street premises I found there was more room there than was actually needed.  When we talk about the goodwill of workers and despise union leaders for obstructing the running of a Department of State, we should ask ourselves if we are blaming the right people. I am not putting all the blame on the side of the Department officials; I am merely saying that all of the wrongs which were laid at the doors of the unions does not reflect the true position.  Unless we achieve a situation by the passing of this Bill which will have the agreement of everyone &mdash; van drivers, whose vehicles are an absolute disgrace, postmen, sorters, telephonists and people who man post offices &mdash; it does not really matter whether we go semi-State or remain a Government Department because it will not achieve the objective of providing a better telephone and postal service.  It will not meet the many modern threats on the postal sides.  Unless leadership is given and there is goodwill all round and co-operation from everyone concerned, this debate is futile, irrelevant and unimportant.</P>
    <P>That is why I am speaking directly to <Col N="1278" /> the Minister.  He will have the full co-operation of the Fine Gael Party in either discussing it privately or in Dáil Éireann. I suggest we should have private consultations with the Minister because we are all in this together.  If there had not been a general election earlier in the year our roles would be reversed.  Perhaps we would have avoided the mistakes which the Minister appears to have made.  I am not saying he did this deliberately, but if you take one wrong step you are in trouble with the unions.</P>

      <P>Fourteen persons accompanied me on the visit.  Nine were civil servants and the balance comprised the Minister for Foreign Affairs and security personnel who were members of the Garda Síochána.  Final accounts for the visit have not yet been received but it is estimated that the total cost will be of the order of £45,250, of which approximately £14,950 is attributable to the nine civil servants.  The balance of £30,300 covers the costs in respect of the other persons, and includes the cost of a reception which I hosted for members of the <Col N="1279" /> Irish-American community in the United States.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems fair enough. Might I just ask the Taoiseach if it really is necessary when he, or any Taoiseach for that matter, travels on an occasion like this, to be accompanied by so vast a retinue as 14 persons?  Naturally, I make no complaint about security personnel and a normal range of advisers but is it really necessary to be accompanied by as many as nine civil servants?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with the Deputy.  But on this occasion, it was a United Nations Disarmament Conference which was a fairly technical affair and my advisers felt that we needed this range of people there.  But my own personal opinion is that perhaps it is a bit over-heavy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Taoiseach will <Col N="1281" /> accept from me that I do not seriously mean what Question No. 3 purports to say.  But it appeared to be the only way I could extract any kind of an answer about this topic from the Taoiseach. Might I ask him this: what are the existing arrangements for giving notice or publishing Government decisions?  I am certainly not aware of them and I have been trying here for three weeks to discover what they are.  What existing arrangements are there for giving formal notice to the public of decisions taken by the Government particularly those which will involve a charge on public funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In some instances there is a statutory requirement that decisions taken are published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> but, apart from that, there are just the normal parliamentary procedure obligations whereby any form of Government expenditure must sooner or later find its way to this House for explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept &mdash; his memory cannot be so short that he may have forgotten &mdash; that I have been trying here for three weeks to extract from him, in various contexts, information which would enable me to make up my mind whether a particular commitment, later supposed to be a Government commitment, had in fact been the result of a Government discussion and decision? I am finding it impossibly difficult to find this out.  I am now asking the Taoiseach if he can direct, advise or help me about how I can satisfy myself or be certain that a commitment, for example &mdash; and I beg his pardon for mentioning something so contentious &mdash; resulting from the Talbot negotiations was discussed and agreed to by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows my reluctance to go into Government detail of this sort because, if I do it on one occasion, the precedent would be there for doing it on all occasions and I genuinely do not think that that would be desirable.  I feel sure that the Deputy, as a constitutional lawyer, might perhaps agree with me if he were taking a non-party <Col N="1282" /> view of this matter.  Having said that, I just want to say that in relation to the Talbot agreement entered into, that matter was discussed at great length by the Government and the decisions taken were Government decisions.  I also want to assure the Deputy &mdash; in case there is any doubt about it &mdash; that in any instance where a Government decision is necessary, a Government decision is procured by this Government.  I think the Deputy himself, from experience in government, will know that there are occasions when decisions not requiring formal Government decision, can be taken by a Minister or group of Ministers with the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two questions being taken together here and there are two or three other questions I want to ask about this.  Would the Taoiseach explain how it is that a contrast can arise of the following kind: between, first, what he said on one day last week when the question of Deputy Shatter's Bill first arose &mdash; when he volunteered to the House that the publication of the Government's Bill on the same matter had been discussed by the Government on Tuesday and publication had been agreed for Thursday &mdash; that he was able, on the one hand, go give that kind of detail but I got nothing but evasion when I inquired from him whether, prior to the reaching of agreement terms on the Talbot deal the substance of those terms had been discussed and agreed by the Government.  I think the Taoiseach will agree that he did not give a straight answer to that question.  He merely asked me to accept that the usual formalities had been gone through.  I wanted a simple answer only: did the Government discuss those terms before they were put to the other side or not; and did they agree them or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one more question to ask.  While I accept of course that there cannot be complete goldfish bowl transparency about Government proceedings would the Taoiseach not agree that there is a lamentable contrast between the publicity <Col N="1283" /> given to all court and parliamentary proceedings in this country and the virtual impossibililty of seeing what goes on behind the doors of the Government, or of being able to rely on anything except a <i>post hoc</i> assurance from a Taoiseach that the formalities have been observed? Surely that is an unsatisfactory contrast as between the three arms of the State?</P>

      <P>The procedures that this Government follow are those that have been followed by every Government heretofore.  I am quite satisfied that they constitute the best way of doing our business.

I am fully prepared to reconsider any case in which a grant has been refused in the light of representations made by or on behalf of the applicant.

Then there were 2,000 requests for payments after the deadline.  The Deputy has said I have wronged 20,000 people.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i> asked the Minister for the Environment if large numbers of applications for home improvement reconstruction grants which were lodged in his Department in or about January 1980 have been lost or mislaid or were destroyed; if he is aware that as a result many applicants have suffered the loss of grants to which they were entitled; and if he will take steps to make good the loss to those concerned.</P>

    <P>Following the announcement of the termination of the old scheme of house improvement and solid fuel grants on 21 January 1980, a huge number of applications were received by the closing date of 1 February 1980.  Applicants who maintained that their applications had been submitted in time to meet this closing date, even though there was no record in my Department of their receipt or they <Col N="1297" /> were recorded as not having been received in time, were given the opportunity to verify their claims by the submission of certificates of registration or posting.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, all applications forwarded through the post were accepted when it was clearly established from the postmark on the envelopes that they had been posted not later than 31 January 1980 and in the case of the Dublin area not later than the morning of 1 February 1980.  In the circumstances, I do not consider that any further action on my part is required.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister should be cool.  The people involved are very concerned about this and they would like to see us dealing with it in a cool, calm and collected way.  Might I remind the Minister of two things?  First, he is now the Minister in charge.  Secondly, as has been pointed out, his Government cancelled the grant and created the deadline.  I want to suggest to the Minister by way of question that there is chaos in his Department.  There is confusion in his Department.  Does he not agree that files have been mislaid and lost?  As evidence of that he told me yesterday that a grant was paid on 14 April 1980 and I was able to produce a letter from his Department dated May 1981, 13 months later, saying that the file had gone to the inspector for checking and payment of the grant if necessary. Does he not think there is something wrong in his Department when I can tell him that as recently as yesterday I got two replies about the same grant from his Department?  In the reply to Question No. 913 I was told his Department were waiting for a tax certificate and the grant could not be paid until that tax certificate was furnished.  Yesterday I also got a reply to Question No. 865, dealing with the same case, saying the tax certificate had been received in the Department and the grant would be paid shortly.  Those two replies were given to me yesterday by the Minister.  I ask him to accept that as evidence that, to put it mildly, all is not well in his Department.  Might I suggest that he should set up a small committee of people in his Department to interview these people and assess them? One person I was speaking about today is a personnel manager and another I have in mind is a senior employee in the Post Office.  Will the Minister set up a small committee in his Department to <Col N="1299" /> interview these people and make up their own minds about them?  If they certify that they should be paid, will he pay them?  On the question of money, the Minister is bringing in a Supplementary Estimate on Friday next asking for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 9 and 10 together. Inspection prior to the commencement of work was made an absolute condition of eligibility by the previous Government at the inception of the current house improvement grants scheme last October. This condition was prominently advertised at the time and again in April 1982 when the expansion of the grants scheme was announced.  It is also highlighted in the Department's explanatory memorandum and application form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the scheme has now been in operation for eight months I could not recommend to the Government at this stage, <Col N="1303" /> that this condition be dispensed with because of the grave danger of the abuse of public funds, the impracticality of enforcing a retrospective commencement date in relation to improvement works and because the substantial funds that would be needed have not been provided for in the current year's budget.  I do not, therefore, propose to review the prior inspection requirement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that every new scheme introduced has teething problems and this is one teething problem with this scheme of house improvement grants?  It is a well known fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister reconsider his decision on applicants who had only the bare wall of the extension erected when the inspector called?  They had no fittings of a bath in the building. There was nothing done except the block-work. In view of that, the Minister should be well aware that there was no abuse of public funds so far as those applicants were concerned.  As well as that the Minister must also agree that there are such things as stations being held twice a year in many parts of the country and the people concerned are anxious to have their houses repaired in time for the stations. As well as that, the weather&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The weather also has a major effect.  Also the contractors will not wait.  Finally is the Minister aware that there is a delay of four to six months before the inspector calls after the application is sent to the Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior inspection applies in the UK and other countries operating schemes of this nature.  When the previous Government brought in the grants the terms of reference were the same and we amended this scheme to take in the <Col N="1304" /> fabric of the house.  The main reason for doing that was to cut out the frills that are not needed such as verandas and other fancy work.  I am not going to change that.  I have explained this in speeches I have made, in advertisements in the paper and so on that it was a prior condition now not to commence the work until the inspector had called.  At the moment I am led to believe that the average time before inspection is about five or six weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the information I have at the moment.  Also it happens that people are not at home when the inspector calls.  The terms of reference are in the memorandum that was set out by the previous Government.  But now the number of applications coming into my Department where the work has commenced are very few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that when he was on this side of the House he was very vocal in his criticism of this precondition of the grant? How can he now justify his acrobatics in relation to this decision?  Is he aware that the reason for this condition was that since the grants had been abolished, in order that they could be backdated for a number of years, it was essential to put this in?  This is no longer necessary.  For future cases will the Minister alter this scheme so that work would not be completed but could commence and go ahead and could be approved in one inspection which would save his Department money.  This authorisation would not cost the Department anything more in new grants?</P>

Will he accept that if in any case it is possible to determine beyond any doubt whatever that an applicant is a person to whom the scheme applies, that the work he is engaging on is work contemplated <Col N="1305" /> by the scheme and that the work is being carried out in accordance with the scheme that in those limited circumstances he would authorise the payment of a grant?</P>

Is the Deputy clear on this? This is in the memorandum that was issued and it is also on the application form that work shall not commence until the inspector comes out to examine the work that is going to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment for lunch I was dealing with the need to improve industrial relations in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I pointed out to the House the sad history of that Department which is without parallel in the entire State.  I referred to the long drawn-out strike that took place and said that unless we proceeded with caution and with the goodwill of those concerned we would not achieve anything. Not alone would we be performing an idle exercise here but the national Parliament would be totally irrelevant.  For that reason I told the Minister he would have the goodwill of Fine Gael not alone on Committee Stage but in any private discussions he might want to enter into with us.  I recommend to him in the interests of all concerned that it might not be a bad thing to depart from the usual procedure of having a Committee Stage where both sides took up positions from which it would be difficult to move away. In the general interest of the people who have elected us and who expect a service from the Department, for which they are paying dearly, I suggest we should <Col N="1357" /> behave as adults.  I am not saying we do not always behave as adults, but I am making a special plea on this occasion.</P>
      <P>This Bill may threaten the livelihood of many people and certainly it will interfere with the livelihood of 30,000 people. We cannot dismiss lightly any Act of Parliament that has such far-reaching effects and which, rightly or wrongly, makes people believe that their jobs are threatened. If people believe that the proposals in the Bill will threaten their livelihood, whether that is true or false, those deep-felt fears must be taken into account.  I have no doubt that if many of the strikes that have occurred were dealt with at an early stage, if there was some commonsense shown and an appreciation for the other's point of view, many of the strikes could have been avoided.</P>
      <P>Before the House adjourned for lunch I was also outlining a situation in Sheriff Street where the workers' normal duties were going to be interfered with because the Department wanted to install machinery which would sort parcels by mechanical means.  Because these men were being displaced, they naturally entered into negotiations with the management. Management had their way of doing the job, I am not going to pronounce on whether they were right or wrong.  I recognise that the workers felt it could be done in an alternative way which they felt was more efficient.  One side blamed the other and I found myself in the centre of that controversy, where the workers were claiming total entrenchment on the part of management and management were claiming irresponsibility by the workers.  After meeting both sides for half a dozen times, commonsense prevailed; but not until I realised that the workers had a legitimate proposal which, although different to that of management, was still a reasonable way of doing the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what has happened since the change of Government.  Perhaps some people in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs felt that my stand was influenced by the workers.  Perhaps it was but, if so, it was because I wanted their goodwill.  Their proposals were not going to cost any more and, from an examination <Col N="1358" /> of the figures, they would probably cost a lot less.  When management and workers take up positions, personality clashes enter into disputes.  When there are clashes of personality, reason ceases to have any meaning.  None of the trade unions has welcomed this Bill because they suspect that the livelihood of some of their members is being threatened.  I do not know whether that is a legitimate position to adopt, but to them it is real. I will be acting as a watchdog on their behalf and I expect Deputy Wilson would have done the same if our roles had been reversed.</P>
    <P>The postal section of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs acts as a contractor to the Department of Social Welfare. What would happen if the Government had less control over semi-State bodies and if a future Minister for Social Welfare, for reasons put forward by his advisers, decided that there was a more efficient way of paying recipients of social welfare benefits?  I believe the postal section of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs would take a fatal knock and that the loss of business would rock it to its foundations.  The trade unions, post masters, sub-post masters and all the people who count the money that comes from the Department of Social Welfare will be looking at this matter.</P>
    <P>I made the point before lunch that centralisation is the curse of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  The unions did not want centralisation, but the management did.  When they centralised the sorting office in Sheriff Street they caused a holocaust which they can no longer handle.  It is very strange that, if I want to post a letter from Donegal to Sligo, that letter has to come to Dublin, through the sorting office in Sheriff Street, and back to Sligo.  If the Minister wanted to post a letter in Cavan that letter would also have to come to the sorting office in Dublin before it was sent on to Sligo.  I would like to meet the genius who thought that was in the best interests of the people.</P>
    <P>A bus travels from Cavan town to Sligo twice a day.  There is also a twice daily service from Donegal to Sligo in both directions.  It is costing £90 million a year <Col N="1359" /> to subsidise CIE.  We pay that money to CIE but we will not let them provide a better service.  What other society would tolerate such stupidity?  There is no point in saying it is the fault of the trade unions and that they stand in the way of progress. That is a lot of codswallop.  I used to believe it, but I do not believe it any more.</P>
    <P>We must loosen up the very tight management structures in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, because the system has grown up with the Post Office.  We copied that system from the British.  It does not take into account modern society, which is light years ahead of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Unless we take note of the way private couriers are operating the post and parcel services, the postal side of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has no future.  A close associate of mine in County Donegal, who is in private business, told me that he was telephoning a wholesaler in Dublin for supplies.  The supplier said that if he wanted them urgently he had an arrangement with a private carrier who would deliver them the following morning.  The businessman said he appreciated that but, as he was a sub-postmaster, he thought that would be disloyal to the postal service.  The supplier said if he posted them that day the businessman would not have the supplies the following morning.  They compromised and decided to put half the supply in the post and to send the other half by private carrier.  The sub-postmaster told me &mdash; and I have no reason to doubt him &mdash; that he could have had delivery of the goods later on that evening.  He said it would suit him to have the goods delivered the following morning and they arrived then.  One week later the parcel came from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  That is not the type of service which people are paying for and the semi-State companies will not achieve their objectives unless they have the goodwill of the trade unions and unless there is a dynamic force running the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The goodwill of the men must come before anything.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1360" /> I say this with regret but advancing it as an honest opinion after months of thinking about it as Minister of State; now, with responsibility to my party to monitor what is happening in the Department, I say that semi-State bodies cannot achieve anything like the dreamland some people would have us believe. What we are talking about basically is achieving a Utopian Department of Posts and Telegraphs simply by introducing the Bill and saying: &ldquo;We will forget about the past.  We are going to have two semi-State bodies and all of our difficulties end there.&rdquo; That does not make sense to me. It does make sense to achieve an objective whereby the structures obtaining in the Department at present can be changed and loosened.  That objective cannot be achieved within the present structures of the Department.  The people who run that Department, the senior civil servants, are excellent people.  One of the sincere regrets I have of ceasing to be Minister of State in that Department was losing the companionship and friendship of the people I had all around me in the GPO.  I say that most sincerely.  The relationship I had established with them was something I cherish very deeply.  I respected their advice and loyalty.  I have no complaint against any one of them.  But these men and women serve a different master from those of the semi-State boards.  They serve the Minister and the Government.  Whatever the Minister and Government may tell them to do they will do loyally.  Whatever policy the Government may decide to implement they will carry through to the last letter, unless someone along the line decides to cut across the tracks.  Then they will make up excuses and notes will arrive back on the Minister's desk that it is not physically possible to do this, that or the other, or that the unions have an objection to it.</P>
    <P>The present structure of the Department must be changed.  If we want to meet modern day requirements and provide a better service, the management of the Department must be changed.  That is no reflection whatever on the management personnel of the Department, but is very definitely a questioning of the <Col N="1361" /> system obtaining and the control which ties people who want to do things and cannot.  It is argued that the way out of this difficulty is that the whole system be rationalised, that the demarcation lines be examined, that there is an overlapping of tasks between the different grades, that all of that adds up to clumsiness, that the whole system must be decentralised. And we come up with the proposal of semi-State boards.  Now that the semi-State idea has gathered this momentum which cannot be stopped, I wonder whether we should not be looking around to seek an alternative.  Unless we can sell the semi-State concept <i>in toto</i> to the unions, it will not work.  We shall have to be cautious about it and this party will be very cautious in agreeing anything with the Minister.  We shall strenuously challenge every aspect of this Bill.  I should say that I could not remain a Member of this House or a spokesman for my party if I did not feel I was arguing fairly and squarely on behalf of the people whose livelihoods will depend on this.  I just could not and will not do it otherwise.  I want to say that I will be strenuously challenging everything the Minister is doing.  I shall be asking him to assure me that not alone is this the best and only way it can be done, but that every union within the Department is satisfied also. The centralisation of the postal services constituted an impediment to good service, as indeed did the centralisation of the telecommunications services.</P>
    <P>The Minister was asked a question by Deputy Blaney about my setting up an office in the constituency.  Of course, in his pettiness Deputy Blaney believed that I was setting up an office to promote myself in the constituency of North-East Donegal.  That was not the reason at all. The reason was that I considered it an affront to anybody in County Donegal who wanted to find out anything about telephone or postal matters to have to contact Dublin, where they are treated as anonymous callers.  I do not say this in any disparaging way about the personnel in Dublin who may be answering the telephone, because it could be me or somebody like me who would be doing so.  But the human reaction would be <Col N="1362" /> exactly the same.  I believed that, if I could reach an agreement with the trade unions to decentralise, to devolve responsibility to an office in Letterkenny that would deal with all the telephone and postal queries in Donegal, I would be serving the people I represent&mdash;not alone that but that it would represent in microcosm a system that could be applied to the whole State.</P>
    <P>Everybody in the Department, from the secretary right down to the fellow who delivers letters in the town of Letterkenny, believed that was a good idea.  All the trade unions believed it was a good idea.  But then the demarcation lines began entering into it.  One union began to say to the other: &ldquo;You cannot do that because that is our work&rdquo;.  Therefore we got bogged down on demarcation lines in regard to whose responsibility it would be to answer a query about a telephone or about why it took a letter ten days to reach Rathmullan from Thurles, which was a case I had investigated.  Equally, people are entitled to ask why a telephone service was cut off when they had paid their account.  These are mistakes that happen within the Department but which aggravate ordinary, decent people. Yet that person in Donegal would have to ring the GPO or talk to some anonymous person in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In order to provide our people with a good service we must get away from centralisation. We must get down to devolving responsibility to the lowest possible level of administration so that ordinary people who are paying dearly for a telephone service can be treated in the manner they deserve.  Unless the present Department structures are changed that goal is not attainable, as I realised when endeavouring to set up a Donegal office in Letterkenny.  But the Government proposal is that those structures be handed over to semi-State bodies and those semi-State bodies do not happen to please the unions.  As I said before lunch, the headlines in about a dozen different papers criticise the haste with which the Government are proceeding, question that haste and say quite categorically: &ldquo;Unless you consult with us, it is a non-runner&rdquo;. If it is going to be a non-runner <Col N="1363" /> now is the time to ask questions and seek alternatives.  Indeed, that is the reason for this debate: to reach a situation in which the present structures of administration of the Department can be dismantled resulting in a loosening up so that people in the Department can act on their own initiative, doing the things they want to do.  We, as politicians, can relax the rules to allow them reach those objectives by an alternative method which could deliver the goods, perhaps a method better than that envisaged in the semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this debate is to search for that alternative.  One of the alternatives offered by the Department of the Public Service was the executive unit. That unit is comprised of responsible people in the Department, professional people, people whose experience is without question, people who know the way to do things, who know the difference between right and wrong, who know how to achieve their objectives and who have built a personal relationship with the leaders of the trade unions resulting in there being confidence now not alone in the leadership of the trade unions but also in the personnel of the Department. Both sides will admit that one side cannot do it because of Government control and the other cannot do it because of demarcations from their members and they have to speak on behalf of their members.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm for us to look at the executive union and form the professional people in the Department into units, give them the power to rationalise and to negotiate with the trade unions on demarcations and other things.  If you do not give them this power we are not going anywhere.  I would like the Minister to consider this because we could at least debate this alternative.  It may not be the answer and semi-State bodies may be the better deal for the workers.  We should have a thorough discussion on the executive union type of management.  Perhaps this might be the one the people involved would buy, it might be the one they would be happier with and would be <Col N="1364" /> cheaper for us to operate.  If the semi-State body is the only alternative the Minister will not have any serious obstruction from us on Committee Stage if every Stage of the Bill brings the trade unions with us.</P>
    <P>The basic responsibility of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is to provide a good telephone service which means providing many more telephones than we have at the moment.  I envisage a situation where every home in Ireland will at least have one telephone.  If the people are to be given that and if there is to be no backlog of people waiting for telephones something must be done about it now.  If we are to achieve the objective where anybody who requires a telephone can have it within 24 hours then the Department have to clear up the backlog of telephone applications.  They must also provide a faster and better repair system.  Those things cannot be done without the goodwill of the unions and the workers.  It cannot be achieved under a semi-State organisation if we have not their goodwill.</P>
    <P>The responsibility on the postal side of the Department is to deliver a letter or a parcel as fast and as efficiently as possible and in competition with outside agents. If we cannot do that we should not be in business.  If we want to stay in business and achieve those objectives it is of paramount importance to bring the trade unions with us all of the way.  As I said before lunch, many of the trade unions understand that this is the ideal situation.</P>

      <P>I will not overdo it.  During this debate many speakers made comparisons between the semi-State bodies we propose to set up and CIE and the ESB. On closer examination this is not a very accurate comparison because there are three different options from the Government Department we have at the moment.  There are the executive units, which are being proposed by the public service, State corporations, which can be described as CIE and the ESB and then there are semi-State bodies.  We are talking about different things.  I would like the Minister to explain in detail the difference between them for the benefit of Deputies.  My Government were possibly as guilty of this as the present Government are but all of the people in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were told they would have an opportunity to opt out.  It was no fault of any person who joined the public service through the Civil Service Commission if that person ended up in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Some of them might wish to stay in the civil service and take advantage of promotion and other incentives that keep people in the civil service.  The door is now being locked to anybody in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The workers in the Department were told they would have an option to opt out or stay with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Now they are told that is not possible because with 30,000 people involved it would defeat the object of the <Col N="1366" /> exercise if they all opted out.  I am not sure if that is factually true although in a general way it is the position.</P>
      <P>The engineers who operate in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will remain engineers, the telephonists will remain telephonists, the postmen will remain postmen, the linesmen will remain linesmen and the people who man the post offices will also remain in those post offices.  All of those people will remain in the postal services.  When you write all of those people off you come down to a figure of a little over 2,000 people who are in the general administrative section.  The people I am talking about joined the civil service and could have been appointed to any Department. It could have been the Department of Justice, the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Finance but they are now in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  They have no option.  We will be putting down an amendment that we give more consideration to this matter. Half of this 2,000 people might want to remain in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  All of them might not wish to stay in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and might prefer to take their luck under the semi-State body or whatever other arrangements there will be in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we employ these people as civil servants and tell them that they may opt for or against continuing in the postal or telecommunications section, if they want to come back into the civil service proper they must be given that option.  We owe it to them.  There may only be a small minority, perhaps a couple of hundred people, who are happy where they are and would like to stay in the civil service, but the numbers might be quite large.  If the numbers were large, an arrangement could be worked out over an interim period of perhaps five years, in which they would be allowed to make up their minds.  Recruitment to the other sections of the service could be slowed down to take the overload of those leaving the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the telecommunications board and the postal board.  Human nature being what it is, if I were Minister I would have to be on the <Col N="1367" /> side of any person who approached me saying: &ldquo;Here were the conditions of my employment when I joined the civil service.  I had security of employment, pension rights and everything else.  I want to remain that way.&rdquo; The Minister should be sympathetic to such an appeal and I recommend that special consideration be given to these grades.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that that opens the door to every grade in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and I must acknowledge that it does.  However, it opens the door which many might not want to go through.  Also, one is only opening the door for a limited period and after that five or ten years have expired &mdash; the period is negotiable &mdash; the problem ceases.  Five years is not a long time in the running of a semi-State body or a Government Department.  The wish of any engineer or telephonist to avail of the opportunity to sit for an examination and move into a different grade in the civil service, a privilege which exists at present, should be respected and that privilege should, as far as possible, be preserved.</P>
    <P>The reason for going semi-State have been put forward by many.  Some think it is just a desire on the part of some to meet the need for modern day communications. I want to put on record that my honest assessment is that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was neglected by successive Governments but mostly by Fianna Fáil who have been in power for most of the time.  Indeed, any Minister for this Department during a period when Fianna Fáil were not in power was not there long enough even to get to know the people around him, let alone to develop a completely new, positive and progressive policy.</P>
    <P>I indict the Fianna Fáil Government for totally neglecting the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, not alone the postal and telecommunications service but the telephone service.  They were totally oblivious of the fact that telephones were necessary to create jobs in industries.  One cannot move into the industrial world and compete with foreign industry without telecommunication <Col N="1368" /> of a very high standard.  One industrialist recently told me that unless he was in constant contact with the factory in Detroit, California, New York, Berlin or Rome and could lift a receiver and speak to them or telex them, he was at a great disadvantage.  He said that other countries have these facilities and unless Ireland has them, it is not being serious about industrial development.  How many on the Government benches appreciate that?  It was not my responsibility to think about that until I became Minister of State, but I was not too long in that position until I realised that fact.  Many Ministers and Ministers of State in the Fianna Fáil Party did not recognise it.</P>
    <P>Let it be put on record that Mr. Conor Cruise O'Brien, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, recognised the need for massive spending of money in the Department. This has already been stated by Members of this House.  Let it be put firmly and indelibly on record that he was the first to recognise that we would be the Rip Van Winkle of the telecommunications world if we did not spend massive sums on telecommunications development &mdash; money which we could not find and could ill afford to spend.  When one looks at it, what has greater potential for revenue and income than a telephone? Large amounts of money can accrue from private telephones and telecommunications services to industry.  It is a gilt-edged investment second to none.</P>
    <P>Yet Fianna Fáil were blind to that fact. They were more preoccupied with trying to restore the Irish language &mdash; and they have made a fair haymes of that &mdash; and the unity of Ireland, and we know what they did about that.  They were wound up in creating a gombeen State where shamrocks would grow out of the ears of the people and unless you became a member of the Fianna Fáil Party or thought like them you were considered inferior, a second-class citizen, not really Irish. There was a question about your loyalty to the nation.  That is the nonsense with which Fianna Fáil have been identified from the foundation of the party. Regrettably I say that, because in its ranks there are very decent people and those who support it are very decent. <Col N="1369" /> That party were too preoccupied with mickey mouse aspects, but when it comes to buying bread and butter, paying for food for children, the father is not very concerned as to whether the children speak Irish or what flag they fly under.  It may be of importance, but it is not of high priority.</P>
    <P>I indict the Fianna Fáil Party.  The strikes of the sixties and seventies are a personification of the Fianna Fáil Party's lack of interest in trying to keep the Department of Posts and Telegraphs abreast of industrial development with the rest of the country.  We had a strike which jogged Fianna Fáil into doing something about it.  What could they do? The potato was too hot.  They did not really give the attention to the problems in the Department which should have been given or concerned themselves about policy making for the brilliant people administering the Department. People who understood professionally what it was all about and had lifelong experience of running the Department but were at a total disadvantage when the Government did not produce the policy that would allow them to run the Department to meet modern needs.  Therefore we had the strikes.</P>
    <P>The two massive strikes made the Government take note of the situation. The potato was too hot to hold on to and they decided to have semi-State bodies. That is why we are now talking about semi-State bodies, and for no other reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Let that be put on the record.  We should have been talking about semi-State bodies twenty years ago.  If it is legitimate to talk about them now and if the reason for talking about them now is valid without political overtones, we should have been talking about them ten or twenty years ago.  Some of the people working in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are geniuses at their work whom we should be proud to know and work with, who could hold their own in any country doing the work they are doing, men of great ability and wide <Col N="1370" /> experience, but whose hands have been tied behind their backs because they did not get the money or the political leadership the Government should have given to them to compete against private business.</P>
      <P>The Government blame the trade unions, the workers.  The workers know that if fewer letters and parcels are being posted their jobs are in jeopardy, and they do not have to be reminded of that. They know that if there is not immediate leadership their jobs will go.  I do not see any future in the theme of this Bill, the setting up of a semi-State body, unless it provides for dynamic leadership and confidence and a trust between the workers and the other side.</P>
      <P>I do not see why the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should not have been collecting road tax, should not have been issuing driving licences, why they should not have been collecting water rates and ESB accounts.  The structure is there.  The Department say that if they collected ESB accounts, for instance, they would lose the money paid by way of charge on money orders and postal orders if these bills were paid over the counter.  In that case, why could they not charge fees for that work?  Even if they were to lose a few pence they would be providing a service for the people.</P>
      <P>Apart from the telephone service, the greatest asset the Department have but which has been totally ignored is the Post Office Savings Bank.  The Post Office have more than 2,200 centres throughout the country.  Every postman, every sub-postmaster, every post office worker could be a canvasser.  But nobody cared, and now the PO Savings Bank is the Cinderella of the service.  If it goes semi-State, anything can happen.  The savings bank has been an agent of the Department of Finance, who control it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It turns my stomach to see county councils and health boards commissioning the commercial banks as their treasurers. Counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim are in the North Western Health Board who have accounts with four banks.  There may not be anything wrong with that, but when one account is in credit and another in debit we are being <Col N="1371" /> paid interest on what we have in credit but paying dearly on the overdrawn account.  Over the years why did the Government not decide to nominate the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as the national treasurer?  At one time I believed in the nationalising of the banks although that is not part and parcel of my political makeup.  I believe in the maintenance of private enterprise, and how therefore could I support nationalisation of the banks?  Would I not be in a quandary?  Then I thought that the commercial banks could still make their billions every year even if the Government and the public bodies accepted the Post Office as the national treasurers.</P>
    <P>My forecast is that the postal service will be outpaced by private organisations who gear themselves to delivering letters and parcels.  I do not think there is any future for the postal services unless there is new thought by new leadership.  I have discussed this with many knowledgeable people in the Department.  The postal service needs to be brightened up, but not by such things as delivering letters by wire or messages through satellites in the sky.  We must provide a service that will deliver messages and parcels efficiently in sufficient volume to keep people in that service employed.</P>
    <P>It sickens me to hear Fianna Fáil say that the present type of service is not the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing and that if we think along those lines we are backwoods men.  But what will happen in the future if we settle for the provisions in this Bill, which to my mind are against progress?  This Bill should not only provide benefits for the workers but for all the people.  We must have trust and confidence on both sides, between unions and the Government. The Government should say to this Department that the structures are there throughout the country to convert the Department into the State treasurers and that every cheque issued by the Department of Social Welfare, by the county councils and the health boards, by all of the public sector, could come through the PO Savings Bank.  The potential there is so great that the mind boggles but <Col N="1372" /> apparently the Government have not even thought of it.</P>
    <P>The three main unions in the Department say they have had discussions but not consultations with the Government. The unions have taken a strong stand. They have said that unless they can clearly understand where the Government are going by way of this Bill they will not travel with them.  There must be good industrial relations.</P>
    <P>In this regard it is quite embarrassing at times when we hear people talking about the reunification of the country, voices coming mostly from the Fianna Fáil benches.  For example, if the Minister wishes to write to a friend in Armagh, Dungannon, or Crossmaglen on the other side of the Border, it will cost him 26p to post that letter.  His friend in either of those three towns will have to pay only 15p if he is writing back to him.  There is no incentive there, whether the person north of the Border is nationalist or unionist, to come into a unified State.  I do not know what the Minister's answer is.  There comes a time when people say: &ldquo;Enough is enough and we will not pay any more for the delivery of letters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have no absolute evidence of this, but it is quite commonly talked about in the Department.  It is mentioned in certain circles in the Department that old age pensioners who have free public transport are carrying letters and small parcels for private couriers.  Now we have the strange situation in which the Government are paying for the free transport of old age pensioners on CIE and private carriers are taking advantage of them.  I have no concrete evidence of that, but my information comes to me from my experience in the Department.  If it is true, it is a situation which must be brought to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>Recently we had the unique experience of the Minister for Justice employing a private publicity company to tell the people what he was doing about security. The private company were paid a very generous fee.  Part of their duty was to deliver letters.  We had a Department of State employing a private agency outside the control of the State to deliver letters which the Government are paying <Col N="1373" /> another Department to do.  It all sounds very strange.  It becomes bizarre when we realise that the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, represent the same constituency.  Are they not speaking to each other?  Are they so disloyal to each other that the Minister for Justice has no confidence in the Minister of State and will not trust him with the delivery of letters?</P>
    <P>I put down a question to the Minister about this but it was ruled out of order for some reason.  I was told the Minister had no responsibility for it.  If the Minister has no responsibility to report to the House why the Minister for Justice employed a private carrier to deliver letters, when the proper authority for the delivery of any letters are the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, I will have to have the word redefined.  I understood that the Minister had the responsibility to answer the House on matters like this, but for some reason or another the Ceann Comhairle ruled my question out of order.</P>
    <P>I am mentioning it now and making it public.  It appeared in the public press, but the press did not notice the fact that the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, represent the same constituency.  If the Minister for Justice told the Cabinet what he intended to do, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would hear about it and inform his Minister of State.  If a letter is posted in Sheriff Street there is no reason why it should not be delivered the following morning as efficiently and as early and as fast as it would be delivered by a private company.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take up this matter with the Minister for Justice and find out how much public money was paid to this private company to deliver the letters.  The Minister for Justice had no authority to spend public money on having letters or postal packages delivered by a private company when we are in competition with those companies, and when some of them have not won the respect of the Department.  Good luck to the company for the type of business they are doing.  Full marks to them for their <Col N="1374" /> business acumen, but there is another side to it.</P>
    <P>The sale of stamps and philately have not been mentioned.  I became interested in this as Minister of State.  It was decided to honour a Donegal man who became known as the father of American Presbyterianism, Francis Makemie, who was born in Ramelton.  Because of my knowledge of him from books I had read, I became interested in philately.  I went to the United States and negotiated with the general manager of the American Post Office, Mr. William Bolger, on the possibility of finding agreement on paying tribute to Irish-American presidents. I hope the Minister will continue with those negotiations.</P>
    <P>The stamp market in the United States is wide open to Ireland.  There is a great love of Ireland in the United States.  It is more far-reaching than any of us imagine. I grew up in the belief that everyone of Irish descent living in America was a mad Irishman, but it goes beyond that.  The president of the American Stamp Traders' Association has no Irish connections, apart from the fact that his son and daughter have an Irish wife and husband and he has four grandchildren who he claims are half Irish.  Because of that he is very proud of the connection between Ireland and himself.</P>
    <P>There is a market in America for Irish stamps but there is this weakness in it, and I know the Minister will appreciate it.  Our stamps do not carry the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;.  Irish Americans in the States ask me: &ldquo;Where is Éire?&rdquo; They ask why the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; is not on our stamps. I tell them that &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; is the quasi-Irish or invented name for Ireland.  They say we are known as Ireland in the EEC and they point out that we do not put the word &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; on our stands for the sale of stamps.  Americans identify with the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;.  They have a love for Ireland which overwhelms you.  For some peculiar reason we will not use the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; on our stamps.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State I gave a direction that, having considered the matter in full and having discussed it with many people in the stamp world, in Britain and particularly the United States, it would <Col N="1375" /> be an advantage to have the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; on our stamps.  I have a parliamentary question on the Order Paper to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that will probably take weeks or months to be answered, but I know the Minister will give the stock reply that every country has its own name in its native language. I wonder whether Irish is the native language of Ireland at the moment.  I am a native of Ireland and there are 168 natives elected here, and I wonder how many of them say that Irish is their language.  It is codology to go on with this futile argument.  If people want to say Irish is the national language, I do not take exception to that; but is that going to do us any good if we are serious about breaking into the stamp market in the United States?</P>
    <P>The business there is so big that we could move from £1 million to £10 million in two or three years.  I have no doubt about that.  If I had continued in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs I would have set myself the target of doubling each year our sales of stamps in the United States by putting &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; on the stamp.  I have spoken to Americans who come here and to people in the American Embassy that I have befriended.  On asking them where they come from they say their people came from Ireland, their great grandmother came from Armagh or their grandfather came from Mayo. They are very warm towards the land of their forefathers.  But if one shows them a stamp and asks if they identify with &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; they say that it has no meaning at all for them.  In the United States there is a very deep love of this island and its people on the part of people who want to contribute towards the future of the country by buying stamps.  But they will only buy stamps that they can identify with and they cannot identify with the word &ldquo;Éire&rdquo;.  Whether the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs believes that to be true or not is a matter for him.  I am only telling him what my experience is and my experience is that we are cutting off our nose to spite our face if we do not use both names, &ldquo;Éire&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;.  I do not see any objection to it.  There seems <Col N="1376" /> to be a resistance on the part of somebody to doing that and that person is costing this State billions of pounds because of a stupid, entrenched bigoted attitude.  If I were in the Minister's position I would have that person taken out of where he is.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Bill itself, there must be an appeals procedure or a court that aggrieved persons can appeal to if they believe their rights and conditions are being weakened.  I have in mind elderly people who do not wish to go into the semi-State body and who might really want to retire.  They should be given the right to retire.  If it means that we have to give them a golden handshake, let us treat them respectably and say thanks to them for the long years of service they have given.  I was alarmed to learn of the number of people working in the Post Office who are over the age of 65 and over the age of 70 or 75.  When I asked why they were allowed to remain I was told they they could not be dismissed because they might suffer hardship.</P>
    <P>It is an answer to may question, but is it not a terrible admission that in present society we force a man to work until he is 75 years of age since to leave him off work at 65 would result in hardship for him because he would not have enough pension money to keep himself alive?  It is a terrible indictment of the Department that they cannot allow people to retire with grace and with dignity at a decent retiring age.  I know of young people who want to get into the Department of Posts and Telegraphs but their grandfather is holding the job, their grandfather delivers the letters.  Because he has no other means of earning income he has to go to the local post office on his bicycle every morning in hail, rain or snow to collect letters to deliver to people that he has been delivering to for the last 40 or 50 years.  Would it not be an honourable thing for us to do to thank the grandfather for his loyalty and service down through the years, to pay him a pension at the rate which he is now earning for the remaining years of his life and give the job to the grandson or someone else of his age group?</P>
    <P>Here are the little pettinesses in the <Col N="1377" /> Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  We do not have to talk about going semi-State to discover them.  But if we do go semi-State, will we do anything about changing this type of structure?  I am not convinced that we will.  I am convinced that we will still be cheeseparing, looking for the cheapest possible service and paying the minimum amount of money.  The Minister knows as well as I and every other Deputy that the service which the sub-post masters give to this State is paid for in buttons: unless their income is supplemented by having a separate business, they just cannot survive.  This is the type of service the Minister talks about.  This is what we are going semi-State on.  All of a sudden it is going to be alive and thriving, when it is now dead.  Unless we are prepared to spend millions of pounds to pay people properly for their services then it is not going to be any more alive than it is at the moment.  It will not make the slightest difference.  Therefore I appeal for a procedure whereby if people want to retire they will be given the right to do so with dignity and their services acknowledged.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brown put down a parliamentary question to the then Minister, Deputy Cooney, on 16 December asking whether it was Government policy to ensure that, when employees of the Department transferred to the new authority, responsibility for the service of all their present rights as civil service employees would be safeguarded.  The answer to that was that the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill would provide that staff transferred to the new State-sponsored bodies would not receive lesser scales of pay or less favourable conditions, including superannuation provisions, than those to which they were entitled as civil servants immediately before the transfer and that each company would also be statutorily required to set up suitable machinery for negotiating pay and conditions of staff in consultation with staff organisations. There is a fear that a person's status will be changed and that he can be paid off more easily under the semi-State bodies. I have talked to civil servants in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who <Col N="1378" /> can allay my fears and put my inquisitive mind at ease.  Unfortunately, I cannot do the same for the trade unionists, the ordinary people in my constituency or people I was in contact with as a result of my responsibility in the Department.  If this fear is real, it is not really important whether or not there are grounds for it. We are not going to get anywhere unless we can bring those people with us.</P>
    <P>There are several aspects of the Bill to which I wish to draw the attention of the Minister.  We will be dealing with them on Committee Stage and we will have amendments.  I have assured any person who has any fears about the proposals that I and my party will be available to listen to what they have to say and to discuss the matter with them during the summer months in preparation for Committee Stage.  I do not do that with a Harvey Smith sign to the Minister saying we are against him, that he had better watch out because we will trick him.  That is not our intention.  There are so many people whose livelihood is involved, there are so many families who have a wage earner in the Department, that I feel I have a public duty to them to ensure that when the Bill is finally debated it will be as near perfect for them as is humanly possible so far as the Minister and the Opposition parties can make it.</P>
    <P>I refer the Minister to section 27(2).  I am not satisfied that the £20 million referred to is sufficient.  The Minister should consider a sum of £40 million and the period should be changed from three years to five years.  I do not understand section 32 (6).  I do not know what is meant by it.  I believe the workers would like to be part of the planning here.  The election should be held much earlier, perhaps an immediate election rather than having an election within 12 months as stated in the subsection.  There is no reason why we should have to wait until vesting day.  It is a matter for the Minister to decide if there is to be an election or an appointment.</P>
    <P>I refer the Minister to section 43 (3) and (4).  If the subsections were in reverse order the unions would accept them more quickly.  From conversations I have had with members of the unions I am convinced <Col N="1379" /> they are not satisfied with the present undertakings regarding superannuation. The workers want the Government to accept full responsibility for all existing pensioners.  It does not seem an unreasonable request and perhaps the Minister would comment on it when replying.  I should also like liability to be accepted for all existing staff at the date of vesting and superannuation should not be less favourable.  Section 43 omits to state clearly what kind of superannuation is envisaged.  Members of the scheme should be at least told if it is a civil service scheme or a fully bonded scheme.  The entire section is vague and I cannot follow it very well.  Section 43 should deal also with contributory pension schemes for widows and orphans which is not mentioned.</P>
    <P>The concept of the council as set out in section 46 is worthwhile and one on which all are agreed.  However, what is involved should be spelled out more clearly and perhaps the Minister would elaborate on that in his reply.  With regard to section 48, the argument here is that if the Minister gives a direction to provide a loss-making service he should be responsible. I do not have to elaborate on that.  The Minister knows the point I am making and perhaps he will mention it in his reply.</P>
    <P>The spirit behind the concept of semi-State bodies is not questioned.  The people who have carried out much work on research to produce the Bill must be complimented.  Quite apart from all the reservations that have been voiced about the proposals we must put on record an acknowledgement of the dedicated work of the civil servants in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and those who helped them in their research.  This Bill will have far-reaching effects on all workers in the Department and on Irish society.  Nothing like it has come before this House since the foundation of the State.  It is a major Bill and every effort should be made to ensure that when it is passed by this House we will have covered every aspect, we will have dusted away every cobweb and we will have <Col N="1380" /> done everything possible to ensure there are no mistakes.</P>
    <P>We accept the Bill and we accept that something must be done.  We approached this measure in that spirit.  I want to assure the Minister and everyone concerned that Fine Gael will play their part in full but with the reservations I mentioned in my speech.  The end result will be a testament to all of us who are involved in trying to find a solution to a major problem, one of commercial and business interests but, more important, a matter that has deep human dimensions.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister guidance in achieving the objectives he has set out to achieve.  With the co-operation of everyone concerned I hope we will produce the ideal solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to be as voluble as the previous speaker.  He has followed it through and has a deep interest in the matter.  As Minister of State in the Department he was a very successful Minister and, as he said himself, he knew the ins and outs of that Department.</P>
      <P>I speak to show a certain amount of solidarity with the Members of my party in our opposition to the Bill.  The Labour Party oppose the Bill in principle.  I do not intend to deal with it section by section, seeing where it could be improved or changed.  I wish to indicate generally why we dislike the measure and why we will be opposing it.  From what has been said from the Fine Gael benches, I take it that they will not be opposing Second Stage and the Bill will probably go through Second Stage.  Nevertheless, it gives the Labour Party an opportunity to indicate their opposition to a measure which they believe is not in our best interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must initially indicate a personal interest because I have a sister who is a telephonist in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. However, I am not speaking in the interests of one employee of the Department.  There is great fear among telephonists because, whether the postal service becomes a semi-State body <Col N="1381" /> or not, the advance of science is causing great problems among those people.  The extension of the STD service is rendering many telephonists less important and is causing redundancies.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs have a very large staff of 28,000 plus 2,100 postmasters.  If the public wish to see a reduction in the number of public servants, obviously the introduction of the measure before us means that the civil service will be cut in half because 30,000 civil servants will be employed by the semi-State sector.  They will remain public service employees but will not be civil servants.  That is one of the areas of great reservation that the Labour Party have about this Bill.</P>
    <P>The main reasons for bringing in such a measure is to give a better service to the public by the creating of An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  There will be a residual Department in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs when these important areas are removed from the present Department and it means we will now have three different sections, two semi-State bodies and a much depleted Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  If our party could be convinced that the service to the public will be vastly improved because of this measure, I believe they could be persuaded to accept this Bill.  But it would be wrong for the Minister to say that this Bill was necessary simply to change and improve the service given to the public.  I remember, as I am sure many other Members do also, that we once had a six-day delivery. In the past we even had a delivery on Christmas day.  You could telephone most parts of the country and be heard on the other end of the line.  You could expect a letter posted in the city to be delivered to my town, Wicklow, the next day.  Sometimes, if it was posted very early in the morning, it would be delivered that afternoon.  This type of service has disappeared and there is a fear that we will never see it again.  I know if I post a letter to a constituent of mine in Wicklow that it is rare for it to be delivered in Blessington or Baltinglass in the same week.  It seems to take a minimum of four days to reach its destination.  When I was a member of Wicklow County Council, <Col N="1382" /> agendas for county council meetings, posted the previous week, did not arrive to Members in time for the meeting. Three members of the county council, representing all parties, continually complained that they had not got their agendas and did not know what was going to take place at meetings.  As Deputy Harte said, they probably went through Dublin first before they were posted to Wicklow. To ensure delivery the county council sent in their own lorries because they often had to deliver pay packets or stores. Service has diminished over the years.</P>
    <P>We know that the demand for telephones expanded at a tremendous rate in the last few years and that unless there was a huge investment in that service, it could not keep pace with the demands being made by a country which had joined the EEC.  After our entry we demanded certain means of communication which were part of the normal service in every other EEC country.  Yet when we look at the OECD Report, we find that there are 174 telephones per thousand of the population in Ireland while in Greece, a county regarded as being poorer than we are, there are 200 telephones per thousand of the population. We are at the bottom of the league of the ten countries of the EEC.  Since we entered the EEC it has to be said that we have experienced a vast renaissance in the industrial world.  Nowadays our demands need to be attended to much more quickly than ever before.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Everett was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs he had not got a private telephone.  He represented his constituency for something like 25 years without one.  No-one else had a telephone so there was no great need for it.  The postal service was reliable and efficient at that stage.  When he did get a telephone his number was 74.  That was for the whole Wicklow area; now the number has gone up to 3,000 so it is easy to see how well the demand has been catered for by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. It has been admitted over and over again in this House that the investment that should have taken place, especially prior to our entry to the EEC, did not take place and the telephone service <Col N="1383" /> was the Cinderella of various Government Departments.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say it has been acknowledged that Deputy Cruise O'Brien, when he was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, was the man who took steps to improve the telephone service.  He made arrangements, when Estimates were being drawn up, to see that money was invested in the service.  It was proved that one could motivate people in the Post Office, by giving them the money and incentive to go ahead and to expand in the various areas, to attend to the shortcomings of the Post Office.  When the Coalition left office in 1977 things seemed to slip back a little.  We had the disastrous Post Office strike in 1978-79.  I remember that strike because it took place during the direct elections to the European Parliament, at which I was successful, and was one of the main topics discussed during that campaign, and people showed their displeasure with the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>I believe it was at that time that the idea was born that this area should be handed over to semi-State bodies.  Obviously the thinking of the then Government was to look at what was happening in Britain. The idea of choosing two very successful young businessmen, Mr. Smurfit and Mr. Feargal Quinn, to put forward their ideas in the areas of posts and telecommunications was reasonable, but the results of their detailed inquiries did not come up with conclusive proof that the job could best be done by two semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>During my time in Government the Bill had not come before the Cabinet, although discussions were proceeding, but had we remained in office there would have been a great deal of hard thinking done before legislation would have come before the House.  That is why I can honestly stand with other members of my party and oppose this Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope that in discussing these very important matters other points which were raised yesterday, such as the phone tapping, will not deflect us from the important discussions needed on these two areas.  Now that that matter will be discussed by the Committee on Procedure <Col N="1384" /> and Privileges we will not concentrate on it but will deal with the very important points raised in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Because of the very large numbers of employees involved, I hope this Bill will not be rushed through Committee Stage or Second Stage because every consideration should be given to the consultations which are taking place with the unions on the changeover of employment so that everybody will be satisfied that his or her interests will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this Bill is a move towards privatisation and will solve all the problems in the Department.  That is not a move I favour.  Let us look at other areas which have been privatised. If we look at the view outside the door of Fóir Teoranta any Monday morning we will see many businessmen from the private sector looking for help to keep their businesses going.  I would not like the public to think that, if the Department were run as a private concern by young whiz-kids, it would solve all the problems, because that is not so.  There are 30,000 people working in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and almost all will be transferred to these two companies. They will form almost 100 per cent of the staffs needed and they will have the same unions looking after their interest.  Long and detailed discussions will have to take place with the unions before any great changes can be made in conditions of employment or the rights which the workers have acquired over many years.  To think that by changing over to the private sector there will be a miraculous change in the problems of the Department would not be right, because that will not happen.  It would be better if we had decided how much money was available to meet the shortfall in the Department over many years.  We should bring forward the bright young people in that Department and give them a chance to improve matters.  They did not get this chance before simply because the money was not there.</P>
    <P>The unions have made their voices heard and they are right to be concerned because in the White Paper workers' interests have been glossed over in very <Col N="1385" /> few words.  Post Office staff are civil servants and have all the rights of civil servants. For example, if the lowest paid member of a post office were to be sacked tomorrow, if a junior clerk behind a counter took a few shillings, or if a postal order found its way into the pocket of a postman a memorandum would issue from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to the Minister for the Public Service, who, in turn, would bring this matter before the Cabinet.  They would consider all the circumstances and then come to their decision.  I do not think anybody in the private sector or in semi-State employment would have such an opportunity.  This is just one small but important area which a person transferred to An Bord Poist or An Bord Telecom will lose if this Bill is passed as it stands.  There is a great deal of concern about this because it is not covered in the White Paper.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us these people will be looked after, but from what the unions have found out this point is not covered in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>A number of the personnel aspects of the Bill have not been fully teased out with the unions.  I think Deputy Harte was correct to say that discussions, not consultations, had taken place.  I remember that in Europe there was a word coined&mdash;&ldquo;concertation&rdquo;, which meant consultation ultimately arriving at a decision. We have not yet reached that stage in this country, a situation in which unions could be assured that something decided would now constitute part of the Bill.  The relevant sections&mdash;I think they are 42 and 43&mdash;of the Bill dealing with the personnel aspects fall far short of what is required by the unions and certainly will have to be examined at a later stage.  Assuming that the Bill is given a Second Reading, there are grave reservations held in that area.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by a previous speaker that before the proposed vesting day personnel could be assigned to An Bord Poist, An Bord Telecom or to the residual Department.  This is something about which there is great concern on the part of the staff of the Department.  Obviously if one is a linesman or an engineer, one <Col N="1386" /> knows that one will be part of one or other semi-State board.  Such personnel have very little to worry about; they know they will be assigned to one or other area. But, if one is one of the approximately 2,500 people in the general services grade who sat an examination advertised in the newspapers and was assigned to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs rather than the Department of the Public Service or the Department of Labour, one did not enter that examination for the purpose of being assigned to An Bord Poist or An Bord Telecom.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Minister would examine that aspect carefully so as to assure those members of the general services grades who sat examinations on the basis that they would be civil servants for the rest of their days.  Such people in good times may have turned down offers of employment in local authorities, semi-State bodies or in private business because they regarded the civil service as providing a permanent pensionable position suiting their mode of life.  Such people now find themselves in the position of being assigned to one or other of the semi-State boards, which is not something they intended being foisted on them when they joined the public service. There are at least 2,000 people in that position.  I remember inter-departmental promotional competitions being held that ensured a certain mobility between different Government Departments.  Will this mobility be denied those people in the general services grade?  If this Bill is passed will they be unable to look to, say, the Department of Foreign Affairs and say: &ldquo;Yes, I should like to work there. There is a job going there but I cannot sit the internal examination&rdquo;?  After the vesting day will higher executive officers, staff officers, executive officers and clerical officers be able to apply and be assigned to any other Government Department?  Those are the types of questions being asked and which have not been answered by the Minister or his officials in consultation with the unions.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that on occasion people do lose their jobs, but I do not want to reiterate my remarks in that respect.  For example, will the pay and <Col N="1387" /> conditions of those people assigned to one or other of the two new boards, if and when established, be guaranteed to be as good as those obtaining in the civil service?  At present there is a demand being voiced through the national newspapers that civil service pay PRSI contributions at the same rate as people in the private or semi-State sector&mdash;in other words, that they should pay class A PRSI rates.  But when negotiations took place with the civil service unions it was established that civil servants' rates were at least 5½ per cent lower than those applicable to people in the private sector simply because they were not entitled to the same benefits as those applying to the private sector.  Therefore when it is contended that personnel will not lose out by becoming part of one or other of the two new semi-State companies does that mean that not only will they be paid the same rate of pay but that they will also receive 5½ per cent extra to make allowance for the increased PRSI rates?  That is something that has not been clearly explained to the relevant staff at present and is something warranting explanation.</P>
    <P>Again, I do not want to elaborate on the problems of superannuation.  However, I must ask will the Government underwrite these two semi-State companies to the extent that all commitments entered into in respect of pensioners before they were set up will be honoured? Will the Government underwrite them to the extent required in respect of any improvement of pension rights of the people transferred to those two semi-State companies?  These are important questions needing to be answered. Indeed, they must be answered before many people at present working in the Post Office can afford to be less cautious than they are at present about the changes being proposed.  For example, will each category of personnel retain its rights to its existing workload or can they be deployed in some other area?  Machinery has been established for consultation with unions in the event of somebody at present doing a particular job in a particular area not remaining.  Will such conditions apply unless there is extensive <Col N="1388" /> consultation with the union concerned? Should the new companies suddenly introduce new conditions and directives, does that mean that a particular individual may be changed from one location to another?  What will be the consultation procedures to be resorted to to ensure that compensation can be paid if such conditions are not adhered to?</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to cite some of the concerns of which I have become aware from my discussions with members of the Post Office staff since this Bill, which will be of great significance to them, was introduced.  We are aware that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs has a certain social service attaching to it. Certainly we want to see that social service continued.  For example, there was a very good scheme introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government some years ago, continued and extended by successive Governments, providing free telephone service.  Should that service be continued or expanded, that in turn means that the profit motivation of An Bord Telecom could not be intensified. We are aware that there is a recoupment from the Department of Social Welfare for the provision of that type of service. Nevertheless it must be asked: would An Bord Telecom regard that as an important part of their future responsibilities? If anything, we should like to see that social service aspect expanded.  We want to see more of the old people who are without telephones receiving them.  At the same time we want to see the people who need a telephone for their business or those who want private telephones receiving them as speedily as possible. We do not want to see them receiving them at the expense of the social element that has always been a part of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased, when I was Minister for Labour and Minister for the Public Service, to see that 3 per cent quota of handicapped people being applied to various Departments.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs were very important because they employed the full 3 per cent quota.  The post of telephonist is ideal for handicapped people if their handicap is immobility and also if they <Col N="1389" /> are blind.  We know the number of blind people who have been taken on in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as well as in other Departments.  I hope in the future there will be the same demand by Ministers in all Departments for the employment of handicapped people. During my period as Minister the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were the only Department who achieved the 3 per cent quota.  Other Departments fell far short of that quota.  I hope, if the Minister is successful in getting this Bill through all Stages, that he will ensure that the new semi-State boards achieve the 3 per cent quota in the employment of handicapped people.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the previous speaker changed his attitude in relation to the trade union movement because after working in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs he found out they are not all the bad boys of Irish industry, that they perform a very important task in industry and the public service and they are there to do a job as well as they can. That is why the Labour Party listen to the points they put forward to us.  Speaker after speaker from those benches has presented the case on behalf of the trade union movement so that their priorities will be listened to.  Unless the staff of both of those new organisations work in harmony and unless their interests are listened to and their concerns attended to, the attempt to bring in a Bill to change the status of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs into some form of semi-State organisation will fail.</P>
    <P>We believe what the Minister is trying to achieve in this Bill could have been achieved through the Department of Posts and Telegraphs by ensuring that sufficient capital was given to that Department.  There would be no need for this Bill if sufficient capital had been given to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in the past and the rates demanded for doing particular jobs acceded to.  If the 1979 strike had the attention of Deputy Harte it might not have taken place and we might not have had this Bill to consider.</P>
    <P>The Minister must listen to the many amendments which will be put forward <Col N="1390" /> by the Labour Party and also, I understand from Deputy Harte, those which will be put forward by the Fine Gael Party.  As far as I understand, the amendments will be rather similar.  It is important that we amend this Bill to ensure that the concerns of the people who are at present working in the Post Office side of the Department and those who will work there in the future will be attended to.  We are all trying to achieve harmony in this area of public life.  We want to see a better service given to the public and we want to see a return to what people were used to in the past.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the high cost to the public of the postal and telephone services which have escalated over the past few years.  We believe that this could have been ameliorated if certain actions were taken in time.  We do not believe the introduction of this Bill will reverse the trend which has taken place over the last few years.  I am afraid anybody who thinks it will is deluding himself by believing that everything can be achieved simply by setting up two semi-State bodies. I hope we can take the worst features away from the Bill if the Minister accepts the amendments which will be put forward by the Labour Party.  Like my other colleagues who have spoken, I want to say that the Labour Party will oppose the Second Reading when the vote takes place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that there is no Irish version of this Bill.  The Minister has a great grá for the language. Tá fhios agam go bhfuil an blas aige agus tá brón orm nach bhfuil an Bille scríofa as Gaeilge.  The Bill is certainly a major one.  It reverses a trend in society which has in recent decades been in favour of Government Departments running our essential services of posts and telecommunications.  The reason for the change of this philosophy have not been fully explained.  I can only assume that it is felt that the environment within a semi-State body will lead to a more efficient service and one which will cost less to the public.  If that is the objective of the Bill, I welcome it and believe the people in general will also do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> The Bill proposes that approximately 30,000 people will be transferred to the proposed semi-State bodies &mdash; An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  That number is about half the total number employed in the civil service and is indicative of the input needed to run those services.  The move has resulted in concern being expressed by the present employees.  My experience of coming into contact with the employees, whether in the Post Office or the telecommunications sector, has always been good.  I have always been well received and got replies to my representations.  I found the employees pleasant and efficient to deal with.  I am pleased to note that in section 42 of the Bill the position of transferred staff is protected, which is as it should be. Subsection (1) states:</P>
    <P>Subject to subsection (2), a member of the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who is transferred on the vesting day to either company shall not, while in the service of the company, receive a lesser scale of pay or be brought to less beneficial conditions of service than the scale of pay to which he was entitled and the conditions of service to which he was subject immediately before the vesting day.</P>
    <P>This is traditional in all Bills which I have seen coming through this House and which involve transferred staff.  I note under subsection (2) of that section that there is to be consultation &mdash; full consultation I am sure &mdash; with recognised trade unions and staff associations.  I hope that these consultations will be amicable and will lead to a full understanding of everyone's position.</P>
    <P>The need for an efficient service is obvious as is the need for cost savings. The present position of permanent staff is exceptional.  The most junior permanent employee cannot be dismissed, unless by a Cabinet decision.  This, to my mind, is an extreme protection of a job. It is unnecessary and, indeed, undesirable. I hope that that anomaly will be resolved in the course of negotiations with the staff associations and trade unions and that any new employment <Col N="1392" /> contract arising in the new boards will have a more modern clause regarding protection of employment.</P>
    <P>As I am talking about staff matters.  I must criticise the present method of appointing outdoor staff.  Apparently, a short list is sent to the Minister's office and in the past there has been a practice of political patronage which is undesirable and has an adverse effect on the ordinary people who do not want political patronage to play a part in job appointments. Where this practice has occurred, not only in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, but in other Departments, it should cease.  A greater part should be played by our National Manpower Service in the appointment of staff to such bodies and Government Departments, except where the appointment requires the services of the Local Appointments Commission and the Civil Service Commission.</P>
    <P>There was an announcement some time ago about decentralisation affecting the Department's services and I understood, for instance, that a section of the Department was to go to Waterford. Could the Minister confirm that the decentralisation policy will continue under the two new companies, An Poist and Bord Telecom Éireann and that the section which it was proposed to transfer to Waterford will, in fact, be transferred there?  The public have been very critical of the postal and telephone services, due to the number of strikes and industrial disputes.  The strike of 1979 was very serious.  These unfortunate breakdowns in the service give rise to a lot of criticism of the Department because people and businesses, particularly industry, feel very let down when their usual modes of communication are cut off.  This is particularly so in businesses not located in Dublin but around the country, which depend to a very large extent on the availability of an efficient postal, telephone and telex service.  It is vital that the new companies should address themselves to industrial harmony within the companies.  There must not be a recurrence of major strikes or industrial disputes involving telephone, telex and postal services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1393" /> The recent establishment of the regional telecommunication offices has been of some benefit with regard to the telephone service but there has been a lack of investment in this sector which is only being seriously tackled over the past few years.  The explanation is often put forward that lack of equipment has been the main cause of delay in the installation of telephones and that the method of stocking telephone parts has not been efficient or to the benefit of the system down the years.</P>
    <P>The cost of installation has given rise to criticism, particularly from people living in rural areas.  Some attention should also be paid to the cost of installing phones for old age pensioners who are entitled to free telephone rental.  They should be subsidised either by the Department or by some allowance towards the cost of installation.  Ninety-one per cent of the population can now avail of automatic exchanges, and I hope it will not be long until the remainder will be able to enjoy this system.</P>
    <P>Industrialists have been very critical of the high cost of the postal, telex and telephone services, higher than elsewhere in Europe.  I ask the Minister to comment on that.  I agree that our population is more dispersed than in more developed and highly industrialised countries but we cannot overlook the fact that costs here are militating against efficient industry and business and that they should be tackled immediately when the new companies have been set up.</P>
    <P>Section 48 allows provision for loss-making services.  It provides that the Minister will have a part to play in directing the companies to provide such loss-making services.  So that An Bord Telecom will be seen to be acting in a commercial fashion, when the Minister directs that a loss-making service shall be provided, I hope that funds will be provided to cover the loss-making aspect of the service in such a way that we will not have the loss-making service appearing in the accounts in a way that would give the impression that the service was being run inefficiently.  Subventions to cover the loss-making part should be forthcoming from outside the two semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1394" /> The Bill refers to exclusive privileges for the two companies.  That is understandable in this small country, but it is not the practice in America where private companies are allowed to compete in the provision of telephone services.  In section 105 the Minister retains the right to grant licences for the provision of postal and telecommunications services after consultation with the companies.  In other words, he is keeping the door open for competition, which I think is right.  It is wise not to exclude competition because it leads to efficiency, and the postal and telecommunications services are no exception to the rule.</P>
    <P>The success of the private courier service has become evident and I hope An Post will be able to compete with them successfully, though I should like the Minister to explain clearly the legal position that arises in regard to private services.  The Bill is specific in regard to exclusive privilege, but will the courier services become illegal on the passing of the Bill or will they be granted licences?</P>
    <P>Section 58 deals with the position in regard to the Planning Acts.  I do not see why either An Post or An Bord Telecom should be exempt from those Acts.  I do not think there is a valid reason for giving them exemptions for two years.  That is bad law, and when established, these companies should be subject to the same planning laws as private individuals or commercial undertakings.  I hope the Minister will explain this fully.  If I came in here seeking exemptions from the Planning Acts for Senators and Deputies I would, properly, be laughed at.  The law should apply equally to all citizens and organisations, although I agree that local authorities should be in a different category. I am surprised there has not been wider public protest, particularly from An Taisce who have been vigilant regarding planning matters.</P>
    <P>Section 61 states:</P>
    <P>(1)  Subject to subsection (3), the company shall be immune from all liability in respect of any loss, damage or injury suffered by any person by reason of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  failure, neglect or delay in providing, <Col N="1395" /> operating or maintaining a postal service.</P>
    <P>It is a stringent immunity, a liberal immunity, a handsome immunity.  I quibble about the inclusion of the word &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo;.  If we are giving them a statutory responsibility to provide a service, failure to provide that service should not be immune.  That is going too far.</P>
    <P>Neglect in providing a postal service assumes that it is a determined and purposeful decision by the company not to provide the service or to neglect to provide it.  I do not think there should be immunity from that either.  I can understand the situation which arises in circumstances of an industrial dispute, or acts of God, or <i>force majeure</i>, but I cannot understand why the Minister should give immunity for failure or neglect.  That is going too far.</P>
    <P>In section 84 the same immunity, <i>mutatis mutandis,</i> is granted to the telecommunications service company for failure and neglect or delay in providing, operating or maintaining a telecommunications service.  Again this is giving too much immunity.  If they are to act as a commercial company, they should be responsible for failure and neglect.  I see no reason why they should be immune from the law in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 49 deals with the non-application of certain enactments to companies. The Restrictive Practices Acts and the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, &ldquo;shall not apply in relation to the exercise by either company of its exclusive privilege under section 60 or 83, as the case may be.&rdquo; I can understand that in the context of the general philosophy of the Bill, but I do not agree that the Prices Acts 1958 to 1972 should not apply to &ldquo;activities carried on by or on behalf of either company.&rdquo; An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann should be subject to the Prices Acts and to the Prices Commission.  We are giving them a <i>carte blanche</i> to increase their prices as they wish.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is correct.  They <Col N="1396" /> should be subject to the same scrutiny in relation to the prices they charge for letters, telephone calls and the delivery of parcels as any other commercial undertakings are for the provision of goods and services to the community in general.  It is going too far to exclude them.  It is bad legislation to exclude them.</P>
    <P>I agree with the intention to allow An Post, the postal company to provide banking services.  &ldquo;The Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister and the Central Bank, may by order empower the company to provide banking services, including the service commonly known as the Giro System and also including the lending of money.&rdquo; This is a revolutionary section and it gives teeth to the Post Office service.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that it is possible for the postal company, which will now have powers in regard to post office savings banks and other savings services, to have a full banking service.  This was never advocated before.  It is a radical proposal which merits serious consideration by the Minister and the Government. There have been many calls for the nationalisation of the commercial banks. I would not support those calls.  I am not against the granting of full banking licences to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, which is the farmers' bank, or the Industrial Credit Corporation, which acts as a merchant bank for Irish industry.  I see no reason why full banking licences should not be granted to both of those merchant banks.  I see merit, in certain circumstances, in granting full banking licences under section 64 to the Post Office services throughout the country. It is an interesting development, an interesting suggestion, and merits deep thought and consideration.</P>
    <P>This is an interesting Bill.  I support it. I should not like to see any unnecessary hassle arising between the employees and the new companies.  The transfer staff will be protected adequately under section 42.  I hope the consultations will be beneficial and productive.  I hope a new era will dawn and that we can have a very efficient postal and telecommunications service.  I wish both companies well.  They have a great part to play within our community, <Col N="1397" /> especially in the context of business and industrial undertakings.  It is a comprehensive Bill which deserves support. It will be subject to close scrutiny on Committee Stage.  The Bill deserves the attention of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a long debate and much consideration has been given to the provisions of the Bill.  I intend as far as possible to avoid going over ground already covered by colleagues in the House.  However, there are certain matters to which I wish to refer and, if I repeat what has been said by one or two other Deputies, I will do so because I believe they are of particular importance.</P>
      <P>I wish to look at the sort of protection the Bill affords to the consumer.  There has been a great deal of discussion on the merit or demerit of transferring responsibilities from the Department to the two bodies to be established.  There has been a great deal of discussion about the difficulties and concerns of the employees of the Department, and what their position will be after the transfer has taken place.  Obviously these are matters which must be dealt with in a sensible way, with real discussions.  That has been covered amply by my colleagues in my own party and in the Labour Party.  There is nothing to add to what has been said in this area. What I am concerned about and what I have been concerned about as a public representative is the absolute failure of the existing service to regard itself as providing a service for the consumer, the failure of perception on the part of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs of its position, particularly in the context of the telephone service, and its failure to appreciate the difficulties experienced by people when either there is no telephone service available to them or indeed when they cannot even discover when or if a telephone service will be made available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department which is concerned with telecommunications must be the worst Department of all Government Departments for actually communicating information.  It has a total inability to communicate accurate information, in <Col N="1398" /> particular to the telephone user or telephone applicant.  It is time we stopped beating about the bush and made this point.  As a public representative it is totally impossible on behalf of my constituents to find out accurately when telephones will be supplied to them when writing to the Department.  There is only one way at present in which one can get any accurate indication as to when a telephone service will be made available either to an estate within one's constituency or to individual applicants, and that is by putting down a Dáil question.</P>
    <P>If one puts down a Dáil question, be it in relation to one person or a number of people, or a school or institution, within four days one can get back a relatively accurate and sensible reply that gives an indication of when the telephone will be supplied.  That is all the average person wants to know.  Most people have reached a stage where they do not expect telephones to be supplied to them overnight or indeed within weeks of putting in an application.  But the amount of frustration that is created for people on the telephone waiting list for two, three, four, five years and who are unable to discover when and if they will be supplied with a telephone has reached a level of ludicrousness and a stage where I believe it is a matter which should be treated far more seriously than it is at present treated.</P>
    <P>It is not right and it should not be necessary for Members of this House to have to waste their time putting down questions about individual telephone applications or for Government Ministers to have to stand up in this House and answer Dáil questions about individual telephone applications.  The reason the business of this House has descended continuously to the level of the parish pump instead of dealing with issues of major national importance, in particular in the context of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, is because of the absolute failure of that Department to communicate information to those people it is supposed to serve and because of the general acceptance over the years by public representatives that this is a valid role to play and that every constituent in one's <Col N="1399" /> constituency who cannot get a telephone should have to find out what is going to happen to the application through a Dáil question.  If the Department properly ordered its business, if a proper system of records were kept, there should be no need for any individual telephone applicant to experience the difficulties and continual frustrations that beset one when seeking a telephone service. On contacting the Department it should be a simple matter for an official in the Department to tell a telephone applicant when a telephone will be supplied to him. It should not be a matter of mystery.  It should not be a matter that requires endless documentation within the Department while a note is passed from one section to another, from one engineer to another.  It should not be a matter that takes months of investigation.  Questions of this nature appear to be easily answerable within four days when a Dáil question is put down.  Why can they not be answered to the individual telephone applicant within four days when he puts in a question about his application or about when a telephone service will be supplied?</P>
    <P>But at least under the present system we have a Minister who is accountable for the inadequate supply of information and for the inadequate service at present given to the telephone user.  We have a Minister who is accountable to this House, whom we can bring into this House and hold responsible if matters are not dealt with in a proper way or if we cannot get information back as public representatives.  But what I am concerned about in the context of this Bill is that that small protection as it exists at the moment will fall.  There is nothing in this Bill that ensures that, if a telephone applicant is seeking to find out information, he will get any more efficient response than he at present gets from the Department.</P>
    <P>This function is being hived off to a body that will have no general function in the context of this House.  The Minister has reserved functions but within months, when this body is established, no Deputy will be able to get information <Col N="1400" /> through this House about the position of an individual telephone applicant because it will cease to be a matter which is of daily concern to the Minister and it will cease to be a matter for which the Minister is generally responsible.  Therefore the problem I am concerned about is that the consumer, the people of this country who wish to have a telephone service will, when their telephone service collapses and they want it put right, have no method of recall, no one to resort to to seek assistance, upon the establishment of Bord Telecom Éireann because Bord Telecom Éireann will be effectively an independent body outside this House. At least at present there is some means whereby a public representative can ensure that a constituent will be able to get the information sought or have service restored if the Department does not meet up to its responsibilities or provide information when requested.</P>
    <P>There is much in this Bill that is good but it does not provide adequate protection for the consumer and much of the protection that is in it is a shibboleth, it is unreal, it is not there.  Section 45 requires the Minister to establish a users' council for both An Bord Telecom Éireann and An Post.  But the users' council that is being established under the provisions of this Bill is a toothless tiger.  It will have no real impact.  A request or direction from the users' council will not bind either of the boards concerned.  They can disregard what the users' council says. The users' council can be mere window dressing.  For example, the individual who cannot discover what is happening to his telephone application, who cannot discover why after five or six weeks his telephone service has not been restored despite contacting the Department, will find the users' council appears to have little function in assisting him.  It can consider any complaint or representation made to it and can pass them on to the company, but the company can ignore them.  Bord Telecom Éireann can get letters from the users' council till the cows come home; it can file them all away and there can be very little that the users' council will be able to do about it.</P>
    <P>The objectives and functions given to <Col N="1401" /> the users' council should be given a great deal of examination and there should be amendments on Committee Stage.  I do not want to discuss them in any detail. But to illustrate the point I am making, the users' council can consider any matter related to the telephone service other than matters of internal management. What does that mean?  Does that mean that if a user of the telephone service cannot find out information about when the telephone will be fixed or when he can get a new line, or if a telephone applicant is seeking to find out when a telephone will be supplied to him, the users' council cannot deal with these problems if it discovers that these matters are being dealt with inefficiently due to matters of internal management?  It is a toothless tiger.  It sounds useful.  It sounds as if it is going to provide a protection for the consumer that is not there at the moment.  But the reality is that it will not even provide the same level of protection or assistance that public representatives at present provide.  I would again emphasise that I genuinely do not believe it should be the role of public representatives to have to provide a service of this nature.  No constituent should have to go to his Deputy to find out such basic information.</P>
    <P>If the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were a private body providing the kind of service they have done in recent years, they would not have been tolerated by anybody in private business and they would long since have gone bankrupt, but they have developed a degree of complacency and consequently we find ourselves in this position.  It was the hope of everyone that An Bord Telecom would sort out some of the problems that exist in this area, and it is still my hope that they will, but they will not do so if there is not sufficient protection given to the consumer and if the users' council are not given sufficient teeth to ensure a more efficient and acceptable level of service to those who wish to use the telephone service.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal more to be said about this area but I do not wish to go on at length.  There are valuable amendments which could be made on Committee <Col N="1402" /> Stage to give the users' council real meaning and to ensure that the consumer gets more protection than he does at present.  What sort of protection does the consumer get?</P>
    <P>There is a need for the establishment of local telephone or telecommunications offices to deal with subscribers' difficulties at local level.  If such local offices were available, they would lessen the need for the long-winded procedures at present operating in the Department and the long notes which pass from one section to another to find out the position about individual telephone inquiries. There is nothing in this Bill which suggests such offices will be established, although the powers conferred on the boards would enable them to establish them.  In the context of providing a more flexible, responsive and communicative service the board should give serious consideration to providing these local offices.</P>
    <P>In the consumer area, one must refer to sections 61 and 84 which seek to effectively deprive the consumer of the most basic protection afforded to him in dealings with any other form of service provided by the private sector.  These sections effectively grant the two boards a form of legal immunity which I believe is unnecessary.  If an efficient service is provided, the boards would not need such immunity.</P>
    <P>Section 61 gives An Bord Post immunity from all liability in respect of any loss, damage or injury suffered by any person by reason of failure, neglect or delay in providing, operating or maintaining a postal service or in relation to failure, interruptions, suspension or restriction of a postal service.  The members of the staff are immune from civil liability, except at the suit of the company, in respect of any damage or injury they cause.  I fail to understand the necessity for such extensive immunity.  If an efficient, responsible service is provided, the consumer should be given the same form of legal protection he is given in the context of each and every other form of service provided in the private sector and, in some contexts, in the public sector. This is removing an automatic legal <Col N="1403" /> right of action that presently exists in the context of negligent acts done by other Government Departments or Government employees in so far as they affect members of the general public.</P>
    <P>When people have suffered injury or damage at the hands of an employee of a Government Department &mdash; normally such cases are on grounds of negligence &mdash; it is a common matter that damages are given where they are warranted.  I would draw the attention of the House to a Supreme Court decision in which the court established effectively that there was a constitutional right to sue the State when the State, by a negligent act, did damage to you.  That constitutional right adheres to negligent acts done by a Government Department.  Normally it is the Minister who is sued although in most cases he is merely a nominal defendant, but the Minister is responsible for those in his Department.  If by the act of somebody in a Government Department a person suffers injury or personal loss, there is a right of action in our courts which I believe is a constitutional right of action, and it was declared to be such in a very famous Supreme Court decision in 1969.</P>
    <P>I have grave doubts as to the constitutional validity of sections 61 and 84 in so far as they seek to deprive individuals from bringing action against the boards in the event of a person suffering damage. We are giving to these boards a legal protection no Government Department has except in very minor circumstances, but the sections are not of great relevance in this context.  We should seriously look at them on Committee Stage because if we do not at some date they may be found to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>In regard to the users' council, my view is that the members of the general public will be deprived of legal protection to which they should be entitled under the operation of an efficient service and the removal of this protection takes away some of the incentives for either of these boards to provide an efficient service. This serious matter requires far more consideration on Committee Stage and I intend to deal with it then.</P>
    <P>If we do not have an efficient postal <Col N="1404" /> and telephone service and if the present difficulties in the telephone service continue, this Bill rather than doing what was hoped of it, could be politically convenient legislation for the Minister of the day who has the remnant of responsibility for Posts and Telegraphs that will remain after this legislation comes into force.  If the telephone or postal service break down under this legislation the Minister can wash his hands of the matter, or throw his hands up in the air and say it was the fault of An Bord Poist and An Bord Telecom.  I doubt if we should remove this responsibility from this House.  I agree in principle with the establishment of both boards but in my view the level of ministerial responsibility which will be left behind under this legislation is too little.  There should be far more accountability to this House for the services being provided under the auspices of both boards than this legislation will leave in existence.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy G. Mitchell, in his contribution said much of what I was going to say and to some extent possibly I have repeated what he said.  The telecommunications service we have given the public during the years has fallen far short of what should have been expected and, indeed, has fallen a great deal short of what should have been tolerated by the general public.  The service has not taken into account that it is there to serve the public, not merely to exist for its own sake.</P>
    <P>The provision of a telephone is a social necessity yet during the years the Department seem to have treated telephone applicants as though they were being given some privilege or favour when providing them with a basic service and information. I hope the boards will be far more responsive than the Department have been.  There are many people who require a telephone service and who require a degree of responsiveness from the body that is charged with the responsibility of providing it far above the degree of responsiveness given to date. In my constituency there are many elderly people.  There are many pensioners living on their own who need a telephone to maintain communications with <Col N="1405" /> the outside world and with their sons and daughters who may be living abroad or not in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It has often taken four or five years to get a telephone in such circumstances and applicants could never find out when the service would be provided.  People who fell ill, who found themselves isolated in their homes and confined to bed often found it impossible to get a telephone even when they were living alone and dependent on the goodwill of neighbours. I could take hours in this House giving the names of people in this type of situation.  There was a situation of a pregnant mother who having suffered three, four, or five miscarriages was confined to bed throughout the course of her pregnancy. On her behalf I pleaded with the Department to provide a telephone in her house so that she would have some contact with the outside world or contact with her husband or general practitioner if she should require medical attention. It was impossible to get a telephone from the Department for that person.  There are many other individual situations of that nature I could list for the House.</P>
    <P>I deplore the failure of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to respond to individual needs when they have arisen in such circumstances.  There is nothing in the Bill to indicate that An Bord Telecom will be more responsive.  It may be at the beginning but after a while it will cease to be responsive unless the users' council are given real responsibility, teeth and power to require the board to undertake certain tasks if the council believe they are necessary.  I am not suggesting that the council should dictate policy.  The telecommunications service could not operate that way.  However, there are a number of circumstances in which the board should be obliged to act on a directive from the users' council.  I hope the Minister will look at the legislation himself and draft amendments to deal with the social problems.  If he does not I hope he will be in a position to look at the possibility of putting down amendments.</P>
    <P>Far too many telephone kiosks are not accessible to disabled members of the community.  A specific legal obligation <Col N="1406" /> should be imposed on the board to ensure that within a reasonable period all public telephones are designed to make them usable by disabled members of the community. For far too long we have ignored them.  It has been done for a small number of public telephones in the past few years but the vast majority are not usable by disabled members of the community and there should be a legal obligation on the board with regard to this matter.  Too often we forget the disabled and unless there is a legal obligation they will be forgotten again.  It is an easy matter when providing public telephones to provide a facility that is usable by all members of the community.  I hope the Minister will look at this matter carefully.</P>
    <P>More could be done in the provision of telephones for new housing estates. Either in the context of this Bill or of the planning laws, there should be a reform to permit local authorities when granting planning permission to require developers to provide cabling for installation of telephones in industrial and housing estates, such cabling to comply with standards and specifications laid down by the board.  Often there are considerable difficulties in getting telephones into new housing estates.  There is a failure to coordinate the building of the estates with the provision of the services.  In my constituency there are many housing estates that were built for three or four years before anyone was lucky enough to get a telephone.  In many cases developers developed the estates in a way which posed difficulties for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs when they were carrying out their work.  There is no reason why to some extent the expense could not be transferred to the developer who is making money out of the development. Nowadays a telephone is a basic and essential item.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the provisions in the Bill relating to An Post which enable that board to collect television licence fees.  I am not sure if sufficient consideration has been given to this area.  I understand the RTE Authority have suggested that RTE rather than the Department should collect moneys due by way of licence fees. The board will have a considerable number <Col N="1407" /> of functions and it is difficult to see why they should be given the power and responsibility to collect licence fees when the money so obtained has no relevance to the functions of the board.  There is no incentive for the board to collect those fees in an efficient way.  I have no doubt that if they are given the function they will do their best to collect the fees but I believe it would be more sensible if RTE themselves were given the statutory obligation to collect the licence fees if they wish to take over that function.  RTE have been starved of funds in the past two years due to economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.  They are looking for money and they would have a real incentive to ensure that every person who should be paying a licence fee is so doing.  They would have a real incentive to ensure that all relevant funds were collected, as they would know that the more money they could collect the more would be available to them for the purposes of their own productions.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider the transfer of this function to the RTE Authority, if RTE wish to take over the function, which I believe is the case.  There is little rationale, now that we are creating new boards and hiving off some of the functions of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, in giving the function of collecting television licence fees to An Bord Poist.  It is a function which should be given to RTE.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be misquoted or anybody to suggest that I am being critical of the various unions and their employees in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. There are many valid worries on the part of members of these unions at present and the Minister will have to tread very carefully.  He will have to engage in proper consultations with every union representing workers in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. One of the things that has long concerned me about the Department and their level of efficiency is the strict demarcation lines within that Department and the vast number of unions representing employees. In reply to a Dáil question which I tabled yesterday, the Minister for Posts <Col N="1408" /> and Telegraphs informed me, in a written answer, that there are 16 unions representing workers and staff in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs concerned with the area of telecommunications. There are 11 different unions concerned with staff and employees within the postal service.  All that I have seen since I became a Deputy confirms the belief I already held that the vast number of unions and the strict demarcation lines that exist are creating a problem in providing an efficient postal and telecommunications service.  I genuinely believe that there is a need for rationalisation in this area, both in the interests of the consumer and the workers themselves.  It is a matter that will have to be dealt with in a sensitive, consultative and rational way by each of these boards when they are established.  I hope they will have the courage to deal with the problem, because until the union structure within the telecommunications and postal service is rationalised we will not have an efficient service, whether that service is run by a Minister nominally or by individual boards.</P>
    <P>I have restrained myself from referring to individual constituency problems but there is one problem, relevant to the Bill, which illustrates the point I have been making about lack of responsiveness.  In the context of the provision of post office facilities there has been a failure to keep pace with the development of population increases, particularly in County Dublin area and especially in my own constituency. The Firhouse area has developed enormously over the last ten years.  There is a population there now in the region of 10,000 to 12,000.  There is a small, inadequate post office to service the Firhouse area.  It was closed for a period recently, through no fault of the person who runs it, who was ill, but it is not accessible to many people who live in the Firhouse and Templeogue areas which are adjacent to it.  There is a need for a new, larger and more accessible post office to provide for the needs of people living in the Firhouse, Knocklyon and Templeogue areas.</P>
    <P>I put down a Dáil question on 1 June asking the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he would establish a new post <Col N="1409" /> office to service the Firhouse area in County Dublin as, at the time when the question was first placed on the Order Paper, the post office was closed.  It referred to the fact that post office facilities were inadequate.  I got a two sentence answer which said that the existing post office is considered to cater reasonably well for the amount of business transacted and that it reopened on Monday, 14 June.  I tabled my question on 1 June and I got a written answer to it yesterday.  It is a one-man post office which closes whenever the man who runs it is sick.  It is out of the way for half the population who live in that area and is another indication of the failure of the postal service, on this occasion not the telephone service, to meet the expanding needs of County Dublin.  The Minister did not even say he would consider the proposition or look into it to see if there was a need.  If the Minister responsible is willing to wash his hands of this matter, what hope will there be when we have An Bord Poist with a Minister who has no responsibility for individual decisions of this nature?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and his officials to look at the reality of the problems on the ground as they exist in Firhouse.  They should examine the post office service there and check the increase in population figures in Firhouse over the last ten years.  When he does that he will only be able to reach one sensible conclusion: that there is a need for a large post office facility over and above the existing one in Firhouse.  I am not asking for this service by way of charitable donation. The provision of this facility will result in additional funds coming into the postal service, because it will effectively make money.  It will alleviate difficulties experienced at present by constituents who do not know from one day to the next whether their local post office will be open and who have a post office that catered for the Firhouse area when 90 per cent of it was farm land and undeveloped and there were a few cottages on the main road.  This was long before we had the vast, sprawling housing estates which we now have there.  The Minister in this instance, as in the context of his <Col N="1410" /> Department generally in the area of telephones, showed a lack of responsiveness, a lack of understanding and an unwillingness to examine the question.  I deplore his attitude and I will have to receive far more assurances than I have heard up to now that on the establishment of An Bord Poist and Bord Telecom they will be more responsive.  Unless the users' council are given real teeth and unless users of the telephone and postal service are given rights of action, such as are given normally when services fail and people suffer damage as a result, services will not provide for the degree of efficiency which is desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to go back to the 1977 election manifesto because that was the beginning of the Bill.  It is strange to see what has emanated from that famous document.  As we are aware, in their general election manifesto the Government made the point that they intended to do something, in the classical Irish phrase, about an efficient, dependable communications system.  Of course that was an entirely laudable sentiment and one I welcomed at the time.  Then, in July 1978 the Government decided to establish the review group.  The review group was set up and that is probably where a good deal of the trouble started and has finished in this debate today.  Once we set off on a course of action we in Ireland tend not to refer back to our terms of reference.  I do not know who drew up their terms of reference but they did contain two separate paragraphs.  One was to examine and report on the feasibility of giving to the telecommunications service such form of autonomous organisation as was likely to be most effective in meeting current public demand.  As we recall, those terms of reference had a second part which was to examine and report on the organisational arrangements necessary to secure the modernisation of the postal system so as to promote an efficient delivery system nationwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the review group was comprised of an eminently competent and effective body of people.  I have considerable personal regard for persons of the <Col N="1411" /> calibre of Michael Dargan, Margaret Downes, Tom Hardiman, Frank Hynes, a distinguished public servant himself, and the other three members, Michael O'Keeffe, Harold O'Sullivan and Oliver Waldron.  As we know, Dr. Dargan agreed to act as chairman of that review group.  I wonder was it wise to give them terms of reference as narrow as that.  If one asks people to discuss the autonomy of the telecommunications service and, secondly, to discuss on a separate basis the organisational arrangements relating to the postal service, it is inevitable that they will come up with two boards, which is precisely what they did, An Bord Poist and Bord Telecom.</P>
    <P>I had a view at the time &mdash; admittedly a personal view I have discussed with a number of people &mdash; that such is the explosive nature and tremendous pace of change in communications technology generally that the wisdom of setting up two separate boards is very strongly called into question.  Even in Ireland, which does not have a very high <i>per capita</i> segment of letters, there has been a real decline in the incidence and usage of letter mail.  We know that there has been rapid growth in the incidence and usage of telephones and telex services in our community.  We know also that in America and Japan there is a quadrupling every two or three years of the growth of computer-based message systems.  Our existing conventional methods of communications have been supplanted, transformed beyond all recognition, in the past ten or 20 years.  It is now very arguable that we are setting up a structure of two separate boards when the whole of that technology will have changed dramatically within the next ten or 15 years. We have just seen here that dramatic change in technology in regard to video. How long ago is that?  How new is that in the context of Irish homes, in the context of our places of entertainment, in the context of our young people?  It is a technology which has hit us only in the past two to four years.  I have held the strong view that I would not have any great objection to the establishment of a separate State-sponsored body, commercially <Col N="1412" /> oriented, in respect of the whole of the communications technology field which must be catered for.  I have an even more vivid memory of going into the Department of Finance and asking who was handling savings banks.  Somebody there said: &ldquo;Well, the accountants' branch of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.&rdquo; I believe that the technology concerned could be wholly integrated. Indeed, the Post Office Savings Bank should be a massive State commercial banking system.  It is an absolute scandal that a country which claims to have independence does not have an internal, autonomous State banking system.  I shall revert to that later.</P>
    <P>I believe that perhaps the very conservative view contained in the report of that review group of 1978-79, presented to the Minister in May 1979, reflected organisational structures, an assessment of technology and a review of the year 2000 in an exceptionally conservative way.  As a result they opted for a rather dated concept that of An Bord Poist and Bord Telecom.  I would argue that there should have been integration on a separate basis.  What this country needs in terms of State involvement in this area is planning of our communications structure for the year 2000 &mdash; and in terms of planning that is not a long way away. What we are doing today in the context of this Bill is planning for the year 2100. Structures tend to last, they have their inbuilt empirical longevity.  I know the Minister is a most painstaking man in taking aboard all sorts of views in relation to this Bill in a most elongated debate.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude this portion of my contribution by saying that I firmly believe that the wrong solution emanated from that review group.  They had a valid point to make from the formalised, departmental civil service structure <i>per se.</i> That is fair enough, but they went out and then recommended the setting up of two companies.  I think they should have recommended the setting up of a national communications State-sponsored structure, perhaps, just to draw an analogy, not all that dissimilar from the ESB but all of it integrated &mdash; post, telephones, <Col N="1413" /> savings banks, computer technology, research and development.  That would serve the needs of Ireland more effectively in the years ahead, because that integration from technology will come without question.</P>

      <P>When we adjourned the debate last night I was speaking about the reduced limit being sought by the Government.  It is not too late for Fianna Fáil to make a stand on an exclusive fishery limit.  Their performance in this area in the past has been deplorable.  In the 1977 General Election Manifesto they declared:</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil firmly believe that to protect the livelihood of our fishermen a 50 mile off-shore limitation on foreign trawlers and factory ships is of urgent necessity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now Irish fishermen are being told by Fianna Fáil they will have to accept a <Col N="1414" /> six-mile limit in the more lucrative fishing grounds off our coasts.</P>
    <P>I would like Members to cast their minds back to the pre-1977 situation when the National Coalition Government were in power.  We should remember the statements made by a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies in the Dáil in 1976. Deputies O'Kennedy, Haughey, Molloy, Denis Gallagher and a host of others declared they would not accept one inch less than a 50-mile exclusive fishery limit. The catchcry from the Fianna Fáil benches was &ldquo;not an inch less&rdquo;.  Not even one of those Fianna Fáil Deputies has appeared in the House during the course of a fishery debate since 1977.  Not even one of them has expressed an opinion on fishery limits.  You could call it cowardice, running away from the issue or anything you like but that is a fact and I dare anybody to contradict me.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey declared on 27 October 1976 during the course of a debate on the EEC fishery policy motion that the Coalition Government would be guilty of a serious dereliction of duty if they did not confirm our right to an exclusive 50-mile limit for Irish fishermen in this evolving situation.  That is lovely terminology. I have not a clue what it means but it probably covers a multitude.  During the same debate Deputy Molloy declared that Fianna Fáil would not deviate from their insistence on a 50-mile exclusive fishery limit.  He also said:</P>
    <P>That is the attitude of my party in this House and we represent 50 per cent of the electorate.</P>
    <P>Around 1957 they represented about 50 per cent of the electorate but that has shrunk a lot.  It is below 40 per cent at the moment and heading towards 30 per cent according to my judgment.  We had all those statements and promises despite the fact that the Fianna Fáil Government had negotiated the Treaty of Accession in 1972 without making any attempt to safeguard our fisheries against the elimination of all limits by 31 December 1982. Fianna Fáil negotiated that Treaty of Accession but they did not once open their mouths in defence of limits for our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> Norway, together with Ireland, Britain and Denmark, were at that time involved in negotiations for entry into the EEC. Norway withdrew because of the unsatisfactory situation with regard to fishery limits which were not being granted by the existing six members.  The then Norwegian Foreign Minister declared on 14 January 1972:</P>
    <P>During the enlargement negotiations we were not supported in our proposals by the Community or the other applicant countries.</P>
    <P>That included Ireland.  We did not even attempt to safeguard the future of our fisheries.  Norway pulled out of the negotiations because they did not get any support not alone from the existing six, who had rigged the rules in their favour, but from the other three applicant members, one of whom was Ireland.</P>
    <P>In October 1976 at The Hague Deputy Garret FitzGerald, on behalf of the National Coalition Government, and on behalf of the country, made a major advancement in our position, allowing us a special position in fishery matters and the right to take unilateral conservation measures to preserve fish stocks.  The Government of the day did this, virtually creating a 50-mile exclusive fishery limit with remarkably successful results for the Irish fishing fleet which never enjoyed such good catches as in the succeeding months.  When I talk about good catches I take all species of fish into consideration, not any one specialised species.</P>
    <P>All this good work was thrown away by the Fianna Fáil Government who came into office in 1977, despite their pre-election manifesto and promises. Instead of declaring a 50-mile exclusive fishery limit, as was promised in the election manifesto, their Minister for Fisheries, no other than Deputy Brian Lenihan, the present Minister for Agriculture, declared the unilateral measures brought in by the National Coalition Government as crude and blatantly discriminatory thereby eliminating any chance of their being upheld by the European Court.  He was supposed to be on the side of the Irish people but he <Col N="1416" /> went out and undermined the case we were trying to make for exclusive fishery limits.  Deputy John Kelly one day gave the same Minister credit for stopping the Dutch fleet from invading our fishing grounds but he said he only succeeded in stopping them at the bridge of Athlone and that was not through any action of his but that they could not get under the bridge.  They probably would have reached the source of the Shannon if they could.</P>
    <P>Now Fianna Fáil are telling us that the best we can do is to hold on to the limits agreed to at the 1964 London Convention with slight improvements but with some major disimprovements.  That point has not been stressed by the Minister in his speech.  The French, if the new proposals are agreed to next week, will be able to fish for any species of fish up to six miles in our most valuable fishing grounds off the south and west coasts.  The French have been the greatest marauders and the most persistent poachers of our fisheries over the years and instead of being penalised they are about to be rewarded for their misdeeds.  According to the rules of the game as they are being played at present, there is a lot to be said for breaking the law and poaching at will.  I have no doubt that they will fish right up to our shores at every possible opportunity and with under-size mesh in their nets because that has been their track record as long as people can remember.</P>
    <P>This type of fishing will undoubtedly cause immense damage to our stocks of shell fish and white fish which are the basis of the livelihood of over 90 per cent of our fishermen.  These fish are the bread and butter of the majority of our fishermen. What a blow to them when the industry was never in a more depressed state.  With the exception of Killybegs in the north west where enormous catches of mackerel have been taken in recent years, the industry is on its knees and 90 per cent of our fishermen are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet. They are crippled by rising repayments on boats, the ever increasing cost of fuel and the depressed markets due to the huge imports of fish from third countries such as Canada, Norway and Iceland. <Col N="1417" /> Each of these three countries has a 200-mile exclusive fishery limit and as a result, each has an abundance of fish for export. In 1980, these countries exported over 50,000 tonnes of herring into the European Community, while Irish fishermen were forced to dump large quantities of fish all around our coasts.  These imports must be restricted and, if necessary, stopped if our fishing industry is to survive.</P>
    <P>In reply to a Dáil Question today I was told that over 2,000 tonnes of herring were dumped by our fishermen in 1981 and that in the first weeks of January 1982, 560 tonnes of herring were dumped, because of the over-supply situation caused by the imports into the Community from third countries.  There is an object lesson in marketing for us. We continue to allow in vast quantities of fish from third countries, while dumping thousands of tonnes of fish at home.</P>
    <P>Under Article 103 of the Treaty of Accession concerning fishing rights it is stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Before 31 December 1982 the Commission shall present a report to the Council on the economic and social development of the coastal areas of the Member States and the state of stocks. On the basis of that report, and of the objectives of the common fisheries policy, the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, shall examine the provisions which could follow the derogations in force until 31 December 1982.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Has that report been prepared?  We are entitled to that information before this debate is finished.  Has it been presented to the Council of Ministers?  If not, this report should be presented and acted upon before any decision is made in Brussels regarding a common fisheries policy, because it has an integral effect on the future of our fisheries.  This report is vital and will give us a good case to fight for extensive fishery limits, not a mere six miles.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of The Hague Agreement in October 1976, we can refuse to consent to any bilateral agreement exchanging Community fishery rights on a reciprocal basis unless and until agreement <Col N="1418" /> is reached within the Community on a fisheries regime which includes a realistic, exclusive Irish coastal band. There is another string to the Minister's bow, if he is prepared to use it.  It is well known that some member states, such as Germany and Britain are negotiating reciprocal arrangements with third countries and until such time as we get a realistic exclusive fishery zone, we should refuse our consent to any such bilateral agreements.</P>
    <P>It has become obvious to us all that only by tough action of this type will progress be made in European negotiations. We have only to look across at the stance taken by the British, French and others when their own national interests are at stake.  They will not agree to any such all-embracing agreement, but dig their heels in until their own needs are met.  It is about time that we did a little of that.  I urge that the Minister negotiate in Brussels next week for an exclusive fishery limit much more in keeping with his party's election promise of 1977 than the miserable six miles which we are now being offered.</P>

      <P>I was amazed last evening at an attack made on our Minister for saying that it was the wrong time for this matter to have been raised in the House, when very delicate negotiations are taking place on our common fisheries policy.  These are very tough negotiations and it is inopportune to discuss them at present.</P>
      <P>Listening to the debate last evening, I was astonished at the proposals contained in this motion.  Having heard the Minister demolish their case, the proposers still tried to justify their position.  It has been explained to them that the historic rights of other countries to fish in our six to 12 mile zone, which were recognised and defined by the London Convention of 1964, are legal rights which have now been enshrined in EEC law as a result of the Treaty of Accession.  These rights cannot be abolished other than by negotiation.  This is very important.  They can be abolished only by negotiation and with the agreement of the countries which hold the rights.  This is what the Minister and his officials have been negotiating in recent months.  When one studies the proposals that the Commission have put before the Council, one sees straight away that our case must have been presented in an excellent manner.</P>
      <P>The request in the motion is that we should refuse to agree to any revised policy that would not contain a fully exclusive 12-mile zone for our fishermen but, as I have said, the countries that have rights between our six and 12-mile limits have these rights legally and cannot be compelled to forego them.  Our only option, therefore, would be to veto any revised common fisheries policy that did not give the fully exclusive 12-mile zone. However, as the Minister indicated, such a veto would have the effect of allowing the current derogation to run out without having any new arrangement to replace it with the result that the fishing fleets of other member states could then fish up to our shores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposers of the motion know all this quite well, and it is perfectly obvious that their purpose in putting it down was <Col N="1420" /> to try to establish, in advance of any agreement in Brussels, a position that anything less than a fully exclusive 12-mile zone would be a bad bargain.  But how can the proposers of the motion justify such a stance when it is recalled to them that the Coalition Government authorised Deputy Fitzpatrick, then Minister for Fisheries, to settle for much less than a fully exclusive 12-mile zone.  Furthermore, without disclosing any details of our negotiating position, I make the confident prediction that the final agreement will represent a substantial improvement for our fishermen on the arrangements that existed during the past ten years, and more important still, a substantial improvement on what the previous Government were prepared to settle for.  When that Government specified a bottom to which they authorised Deputy FitzGerald to give his agreement, they acknowledged that he might have no other option but to settle on such terms.  These are the basic, indisputable facts of the matter, and no argument can&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Last evening, Deputies for the motion went back into the history of our negotiations and to the claim for a 50-mile zone.  They must be very naive if they cannot see that at the outset of any negotiations one must set one's sights high, but at the end of the day, after one has done one's utmost, a settlement must be agreed on the best terms available.  However, as I have said, the Fine Gael Deputies know all this but still persist with their hypocritical motion, trying to convey to the fishermen the impression that if in office they would be in a position to negotiate a 12-mile exclusive zone.  That is bad enough, but <Col N="1421" /> what is worse is that they know the motion is mischievous and entirely against the interests of our fishermen. Delicate negotiations are taking place in Brussels in which this country is still pressing strongly for improvement of the Commission's proposals in regard to the various ingredients of the revised common fisheries policy.</P>
      <P>The Minister had little option but to draw attention to the reality of the situation and to the favourable elements for this country in the Commission's proposals. By accepting the motion, however, we would be running the risk of prejudicing the case being made for still further concessions for this country.  For that reason I support the Minister's amendment and denounce in the strongest possible terms the cheap tactics of Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>Deputy D'Arcy's motion ranged over other matters such as quotas, marketing arrangements and structural measures. Reference was made to The Hague agreement and the commitment made to the expansion of the Irish fishing industry and we were asked if our performance had failed completely to measure up to our entitlement.  As the Minister pointed out, the position is that under The Hague agreement we were entitled to double our catches between 1975 and 1979.</P>
      <P>Our catches in 1975 totalled 75,000 tonnes and in 1981 we landed 180,000 tonnes, approximately 2½ times more than the 1975 figure.  Arrangements have been reached in principle on revised marketing regulations, the effect of which will be to depress imports of low priced fish into the Community and to improve the market prices for home supplies. Under structural measures this country has continued to enjoy substantial benefits, and FEOGA grants of £3 million were approved for new fishing vessels, processing undertakings and mariculture projects.  However, these matters are outside the scope of the motion and I mention them because they were raised by Deputy D'Arcy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident there will be a very substantial improvement for our fishermen of the arrangements in existence during the past ten years and, more important, a substantial improvement on <Col N="1422" /> what the previous Government were prepared to accept and which they settled for.  The motion is completely divorced from reality and designed to harm rather than assist the fishermen's interests.  I recommend to the House that the motion be rejected and the amended motion prepared by the Minister be approved.</P>

      <P>I have not heard anything from the previous speaker that would convince me there is anything wrong with the motion, which I regard as long overdue.  I am the chairman of the Fisheries Committee of the Council of Europe.  We had a symposium in Iceland on this very topical and sensitive issue.  It was an eye opener to me, coming from an island nation, to realise the value placed by the Icelandic people on their 200-mile zone.  They made it quite clear to all and sundry that they had the right to protect that zone.  They went further. They said it was their duty in the interests of all fishermen to protect the zones and they made no apology for it.  They gained nothing but respect.  They are not within the EEC, but the very valid point was made that the shores and waters of our island are our responsibility as much as the soil of Ireland is our responsibility.</P>

    <P>In spite of all the tonnages and figures quoted, the fact is that our waters have been raped by overseas fishermen.  That was brought home to me very forcefully. I suggested &mdash; and this was to do with EEC waters &mdash; that when an EEC vessel was fishing in the EEC zone off our shores an inspector from the Irish Department of Fisheries should be on board while the fishing was taking place.  There was almost uproar at that suggestion. How dare we?  This proved my point. Up to now those people have had the right to fish for only four species of fish. From now on apparently they will have the right to fish for more or less what they like outside the six-mile zone.  The worst feature of it is that, up to now probably, they have been doing it anyway.  When you go on board all you find is a wall of ice surrounded by mackerel and herring. How do we know that they have not got plenty of salmon on board?  We have no way of finding out except by having somebody <Col N="1423" /> on board while the boat is in our waters.</P>
    <P>Those of us who live among fishermen know exactly what the situation is.  There is no point in trying to bluff that our fishermen are doing well.  They are not doing well.  The Minister should know that.  High costs and the difficulties they face in marketing have put our fishermen in dire straits.  I would go so far as to say that some of the tragedies around our shores are due to the fact that they have to go out in bad weather and difficult conditions in near the rocks because our waters are denuded of fish.  Only the other day I was told the only place where pollock is readily available now is over wrecks and rocks.  In other words, they have to get special equipment to enable them to detect wrecks and rocky areas in order to catch pollock, which at one time was so plentiful that 15 yards offshore with an ordinary line you could catch all you wanted to.</P>
    <P>That is what happened to our industry. That is what the EEC has done for us.  I do not want to be political about it.  We have a joint responsibility in this Parliament to make sure that the right thing is done.  A six-mile zone is not the right thing, knowing the equipment these people use and what I call the hoover approach to fishing where everything is taken in from the sea with modern equipment. Like Iceland we have valuable breeding grounds for fish.  Our herring beds in the south are internationally known.  They are too well-known.  Outsiders want to come over and clean them out in an irresponsible fashion, as they have been doing.  We have a right and a duty to protect these valuable fishing grounds.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a heavy responsibility on his shoulders.  If these people are allowed into the six-mile area where we have lobster pots and small boats, what will they do to our little salmon men and their nets?  At the moment they come in on a bad night and are gone again in the morning.  They have no regard for us, or for our boats or our fishermen.</P>
    <P>Why are we building up a fine fisheries defence fleet if all we are talking about is <Col N="1424" /> a six-mile area?  You could protect six miles of fishing coast with a couple of punts.  If we are talking about fishery defence vessels, we should be given something to defend.  Give us a decent limit to defend and we will defend it.</P>
    <P>Fishing in Ireland is a growing industry and that is why our fishing catches have increased.  We are still a tiny dot in the market place.  We have a lot to learn.  We have many other problems mentioned by Deputy Deasy.  Our mariculture is in its infancy.  As yet, salmon farming is in its infancy.  We have a lot of work to do with pollution control, with estuary pollution and damn little we are doing about it.</P>
    <P>As I said so often, our municipal authorities are our worst polluters.  If we as a nation are to spend substantial sums of money on the protection of our fisheries and our fishermen, if we are to spend vast sums of money on pollution control&mdash;we hear a lot about red tide; red tide is pollution of one form or another; that is a popular name for it but it is plain pollution&mdash;and if we are to build up our mariculture, as I believe we will, we should have exclusive rights for ourselves.</P>
    <P>Part of our discourse had to do with maximum sustainable yields.  By that is meant that you fish less in order to fish more.  That is the message.  If we are to sustain our present fleets and expand them, we will have to act responsibly.  As in so many other fields we have acted responsibly.  Some of our competitors say we have not the equipment to act irresponsibly. I do not think that this is right. Our salmon fishermen have been an example to Europe in the way the rules are kept.  We have very little supervision over our salmon fishermen and rarely does one hear of a problem with our own people.  They know that if they overfish, if they fish at the wrong time, if they use the wrong nets, it is their own livelihood that is at stake.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will succeed in convincing his EEC counterparts that we are a small, poor nation dependent on agriculture and fisheries.  We do not have the massive resources of mainland Europe.  France will not starve without its fisheries, nor for that matter, will any <Col N="1425" /> of the other countries.  But it would be a severe blow to us if this time next year or in two years' time fishermen were walking outside our gates bemoaning the fact that we sold them out.  That is exactly what we will do if we allow fishing for all species from six miles off our shore. Unfortunately, the Council of Europe is only an advisory body.  We brought discussion down to a fine art and talked about the levels that could be sustained. At present the situation is one of maximum catches that are far too high, with a very real threat to our fisheries.  It happened in Iceland where cod were wiped out completely.  Again Iceland is an island nation of 250,000 people with a dismal naval force, but they succeeded in establishing their limit and everybody has benefited.  This is slowly percolating to the others, but they do not want to hear about it.</P>
    <P>The second level is something for the future, that is, the maximum sustainable yield where the species is maintained but the costs of catching are unnecessarily high.  That brings me back to my original point: that if we continue to denude our waters then fishermen will spend a lot more time at sea for less fish.  If we protect our fishing grounds the fishing can be done on two or three days a week with no need to go out in storms and high swells with losses for our fishermen and no need to end up on the rocks.  That is the optimum utilisation, where fish stocks are increased and catches become cheaper or at least we are able to hold the price.</P>
    <P>In recent years countries have realised the impossibility of continuing to catch fish at the maximum level.  But, as far as we are concerned, they are doing nothing about it.  We will have to impress them. We had a strong case because our fleet is small and the amount of fish we catch is very limited when one compares it with that of the factory ships of other countries with their hoover like approach to the seas.  At the same time it is an important industry.  Every year we have been importing about £650 million worth of food.  Are we to add to that by importing fish?  Are our fishermen to be without their livelihood?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1426" /> What about our valuable boatbuilding industry?  In my own constituency there is a boatyard specially designed to build the type of boat that modern fishing requires.  This boatyard is in extreme difficulty and is practically closed down. There is no reason for that.  That type of negligent approach will close the country down.  We have the same approach to agriculture by the Government.  If a farmer, instead of selling a field, just closed the gate how long would he survive? That type of negligent approach to the fishing industry is not the approach of a nation that hopes to build up the fishing industry.  The Minister will not get out of his financial problems by going to bed and forgetting about them.  They will be there in the morning.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have a much more vigilant approach to this whole area of fishing.  We have good fishing waters and we should protect them.  We do not want handouts from the EEC.  We want the right to live and we are entitled to that both on land and on sea.  That is what our fishermen want.  The fishermen want this right for themselves and for their children after them.  I would compliment them on their sense of responsibility, which is almost unique among European people in that they wish to protect the waters for all time.  This should be the approach of the Government supported by the Opposition. They should go out there jointly to the tables of the EEC and, like Mrs. Thatcher and the rest of them, pound the table until they get what they want and not dream of coming home without it.</P>
    <P>The Government do not have to go cap in hand.  The more powerful nations have behaved unscrupulously at the negotiating table.  All we are asking for is our right to live.  We have not got too many things going for us.  The basic things are eight or nine inches of good soil and our fishing industry.  At the moment that fishing industry could go one way or the other and whatever agreement the Minister makes is vital to that industry.  It is no use saying that our tonnages have gone up over the last few years.  That is because there are a lot more people at the job.  We would like to think that as many again will be at the job.  We have <Col N="1427" /> the capacity and the people who are interested in fishing.  We have the boatyards to build the boats; and we have the markets. Tribute must be paid to some of the people who are doing the fish marketing. At long last our inland hotels can get adequate supplies of good fish every day of the week, and that is something that is relatively new to Ireland and that will grow and grow.  If the Minister digs in in time he will get the support he needs.  All we can do on the Council of Europe is make recommendations.  The Council of Europe sponsors various committees. They will be coming to Ireland next week and I would like to introduce the Minister to a few of them.  He would hear from some very reasonable people from island States &mdash; the Icelanders, Norwegians and Swedes.  It will be very interesting to hear why they defended fishing and, more important, the end result.  If the Minister succeeds, as I believe he can, in getting what he wants, he is on the road to success and confidence.  Confidence is what we do not have at present.  People have lost heart because of the complete lack of administration in every area, agriculture, fisheries and so on.  Next week the Minister has a chance to put that right.  He should be seen to be out there fighting. If he comes home without reaching an agreement, he should go out again.  That is what the fishermen and the Irish citizens want&mdash; a Government prepared to fight for our rights as an island nation&mdash;a right which is as divine as the right to farm our land.</P>
    <P>Fishing is a traditional industry.  Down the centuries it was confined to small boats; it was a very limited operation. Nowadays it has taken on an EEC context in so far as we are in the game with the other member states, using the same type boats but we have an added advantage: we are near the source of supply. We do not have long hauls back to port. We have everything going for us.  If we allow this industry to expand and develop, a wonderful processing industry will result.  We hear a lot about creating jobs.  A viable fishing industry is an almost untapped source for job creation. Do not listen to the French when they <Col N="1428" /> say we have the herring grounds.  The only reason the French and Dutch do not have their own herring grounds is that they cleaned them out.  They cannot blame us for that, and they will do precisely the same here if they are allowed.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting I made what I considered to be a constructive suggestion. I asked why not have somebody on board when fishing in EEC designated waters off our shore.  There was an uproar, proving they do not want to keep the rules; they are not interested in rules. It is well known in fishing circles that these valuable herring grounds extend as far as 20 miles off our shore, and all that area should be protected, and we demand the right to protect it.  If we do not, nobody else will.</P>
    <P>Having returned from this conference I came here this evening to make a special appeal.  At the conference I listened to people who are worried about this problem and to the people who could not care less.  Mostly the Minister will be dealing with people who could not care less.  He has a tough job and I do not envy him. He has enough going for him to convince them he is right and they are wrong.  We still have fish but it is no thanks to them. We did not abuse our stocks.  We still have salmon in our rivers because of the responsible approach of our salmon fishermen and this is not very often recognised. If we allow Frenchmen within six miles our salmon will be gone too because there is nothing to stop them.  Not only ordinary white fish will be affected, but our very valuable salmon fishing, and the possible development of that industry into salmon farming which is so popular in some countries will also be affected. We are starting to raise young salmon and send them off.  Maybe only 30 per cent come back, but it is still a very valuable source of revenue.  That industry too will be wiped out if we allow these people near our shores.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to insist on realistic limits, to be firm, and adamant that we cannot agree to limits of less than 15 to 20 miles, in particular around the south coast where we find our breeding stocks.  This is vital.  If the Minister succeeds, he will get the credit he deserves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1429" /> The fishermen are going through a very tough time.  They spend a lot of time at sea with very bad results.  This has been a disastrous salmon season.  One of the reasons is, I believe that the fish which should come into Youghal Harbour are being intercepted by these boats because there is no check on them.  We have a right to protect these fish and the only way we can do that is to have limits.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made a constructive contribution. I have not been trying to score points.  I grew up among fishermen and have come to love them.  They have a unique way of life and I am very concerned about them.  They are coming back to Youghal, Ballycotton and Cobh with empty boats more often than they used.  I am also concerned because they are going out in weather in which they would normally not go out, and they are going to areas which are not normal fishing grounds.  I believe they are doing this because of what happened.  Let us stop it. It is in the Minister's power to do it.  I am sure he will not have very much difficulty convincing his EEC counterparts that if they appoint us as a nation to protect the fishing grounds of Europe we will behave in a responsible manner and everyone will benefit.  If there is fish in the first 15 miles, then there is fish in the first 50 miles, but if they clean out the breeding grounds, then they can come to the gates of Athlone and there will not be any fish. That is the problem.</P>

        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> I support the Minister's amendment.  I listened to the debate last night and tonight and from what the other side have said it appears we are completely anti-fishermen, completely opposed to the industry and to those working in it.  Members on the other side of the House have tried to give the impression that only they are interested in the fishermen and they have become very emotional about it. However, they have not been constructive in their comments.  A few short <Col N="1430" /> months ago when their Minister for Fisheries and Forestry went to Brussels to negotiate he had the all-clear from his party to accept a six-mile limit.  If they can refute that I invite them to do so. Now Deputy Hegarty spoke tonight about a 15- or 20-mile limit.  At least he should be consistent with his colleagues who spoke about a 12-mile limit last night.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.  There are clear signs from the latest proposals of the Commission on access and quotas that they may be close to a common fisheries policy which will be to the benefit of Irish fishermen.  I have every confidence that the Minister will get the best deal for us.  He has done more in the past six weeks than was done in the previous six years to get a common fisheries policy which it is so necessary to have before the end of the year.  It can be argued that we need not accept proposals before the end of 1982 but it appears it is necessary that we accept them.  Either we do this or we allow the French, Germans, Danes and British to fish right into our waters. I have every confidence the Minister will get the best deal possible and that we will <Col N="1431" /> not get what was being considered by the National Coalition Government, namely a six-mile ban around our coast.</P>
    <P>I am a Deputy from a constituency whose people depend largely on fishing. I am not here to play politics.  I want to speak sincerely about the industry.  I know many people along the western coast who depend on the industry for a livelihood.  I know it is necessary to have bans imposed to ensure the proper quotas are kept and that landings are monitored. Unlike mines, in fisheries we have a resource that is renewable but we must ensure that we take only a certain quantity of fish each year.  Even with the common fisheries policy we will have fishing within our 200-mile economic zone.  Our Minister might consult with other Ministers at the Council of Ministers meeting to have a system where observers would be put on each boat.  I mentioned this earlier in the session when we were speaking about fisheries.  These observers could ensure that the boats take only the amount allowed and in this way we could help our fishing grounds.  It is essential that we do not over-fish.  In the Celtic Sea much destruction was caused by the Danes and the Dutch.  Those who could not take the fish back to the continent took it to Dunmore East, processed it in a crude primary way and sent it back to Europe where they could add value to the product.  This should not happen again.  Down off Dunmore East, in Baginbun, there were very good herring grounds that were in danger.  However, action was taken and I have reason to believe that we can make a case to have this fishery opened in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>By having observers on the boats we could build up a bank of scientific knowledge. They could tell us where the fish were caught, the depth at which they were caught, the plankton content of the water, the markings that were available and the other types of fish in the area.  In this connection I am thinking in particular of sprat fishing.  When the Celtic Sea was closed and there was no fishing off the south-east coast, our fishermen were <Col N="1432" /> able to have sprat fishing and that was most lucrative.  The fish moved off to Cobh, to Castletownbere and to Galway. Some fishermen went to great expense to buy nets for sprat fishing which was the alternative to herring fishing, which stocks had become depleted.  Many processors invested money to set up processing plants.  The sprats were not there last year but I have every reason to believe that they are still off our coast.  The observers on board our boats could tell us precisely where we could find the sprats.  The sprat fishing season is short, only three or four months.  Sprats can be processed only when the bellies are empty.  The fish can be found in abundance during the summer but if the bellies are full the sprats cannot be used for human consumption.  Unlike processing plants along fjords in Norway, we have no facilities along our coastline to empty the bellies and process the fish at a later stage.  We have only a short time to fish for sprat and it is important that we are able to pinpoint their location along our coast.  Ireland is a maritime country and not alone should we monitor all this information from the boats fishing along our coasts but all the European boats should feed this information back to a base along the west coast where it could be monitored and put to the best use.  I ask the Minister to consider that suggestion &mdash; and I suppose I would not be a Donegal man if I did not suggest that the base should be located in Donegal, in one of our major ports.</P>
    <P>In relation to fishing for mackerel, larger boats are having difficulty in obtaining grants.  At the Council of Ministers' meeting we should try to ensure that the larger boats, which are the backbone of the industry, should get favourable grants.  We can look at statistics and say that things are going well on the west coast because the volume is there.  The volume is certainly there, but the number of people involved is not as many as we would like.  The 90 ft. boats should be given assistance by way of grant aid.  At present only boats up to 90 feet can get assistance and after that they have to have certain conversions carried out to extend them.  We must not overlook the <Col N="1433" /> owners of 60 to 80 ft. boats who are experiencing difficulties at present because they do not have the means to fish for mackerel.  These boats should get assistance from Europe so that they could convert the machinery on their boats. They were equipped to fish for mackerel and herring when they were closer to our shores but now they should be grant-aided to convert their boats to the traditional type of fishing.  If this was done, many of these boats would not become obsolete.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the smaller boats, the half deckers.  They are just as important as the bigger boats and should get the same assistance, because their owners also have to feed families.  For the last two years the smaller boats did not get a FEOGA grant.  If we are to prove in Europe that we are interested in the smaller fisherman they should get these grants.  I learned recently that none of them has obtained a FEOGA grant this year either.</P>
    <P>We must look at historic fishing rights. Even when a common fisheries policy is agreed to we should consider buying out these historic rights from EEC moneys. We should ask the EEC to pay off the Dutch and others who have these historic rights and leave these waters to us.  I am realistic enough to know that we have a situation at present outlined by the Minister last night, that if we enforce a six or a 12-mile ban, we should consider and put it strongly to the people in Europe that we should buy out these historic rights and leave these coastal bands to ourselves.  We should have ports up and down the country like Killybegs, Burtonport and Castletownbere which we can be proud of and which could be expanded.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in supporting the motion put down in the name of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, Deputy Daly, that we give him full support in his efforts to negotiate satisfactory arrangements in the current discussions on an EEC fisheries policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We put down this motion because we, in common with people on all sides of the House and the general <Col N="1434" /> public, are extremely worried about the point we have now reached in negotiations on a common fisheries policy for the EEC.  I wish to remind the Minister, in the light of remarks which he made last night, that negotiations did not start this year or last.  They have been going on for the last six years and, in a very real sense for our fishermen, have been going on almost uninterruptedly since the opening of our accession negotiations for the EEC.  We are still at the point where there is no fixed common fisheries policy in the EEC and we are still discussing issues which were important at the very beginning of that process.  They have not been resolved up to now and, for much of that period, have not been handled in a way that allows us to achieve the kind of objectives we need for fishery policies.</P>
      <P>What are those objectives?  They are very simple and we all subscribe to them. We want to ensure that those of our people who rely on fishing to earn their livelihood will have access, in a real way, not on paper, to stocks of fish that they can be sure of catching, to the extent that any activity so closely tied to nature can be something one is sure of.  We want to know that they have a realistic guarantee, given the conditions under which they are obliged to work, that they can catch what they set out to catch, can make a decent living for their families and that we can all share in the benefits of that living and in the kind of employment it will create.  It is that concern which caused us to put down that motion and I was very disappointed to hear the Minister say last night that we were mischievious in putting down that motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>He called us irresponsible and he has the nerve to repeat it now. Why does he think we are irresponsible? He says that it is irresponsible to put down a motion while negotiations are going on, while his civil servants were so busy in Brussels that they could not write his speech for him last night.  That is a minor point but it is indicative of the Minister's approach to this question. <Col N="1435" /> Why is it irresponsible to have the House discuss a matter of this kind before decisions are reached?  Would the Minister prefer if we waited until after decisions were reached to discuss the matter in this House?  Would the Minister prefer that we kept our mouths shut and did not discuss him by drawing attention to the difficulties involved in these negotiations? Would he prefer if we did not say anything at all about it in this House?  Is that the kind of responsible Opposition he wants?  I can assure the Minister that that is not the kind of opposition he is going to get.  This House has a right and a duty to discuss these things at a time when we can have some influence on the course of negotiations.  In bringing these matters up here, when the Minister is present, before he makes his final decisions in the next few weeks, we are carrying out the job for which we were elected.  I will not accept from the Minister or any of his colleagues that we are irresponsible in raising matters of this kind.  It shows a fine contempt on the part of the Minister for what this House is about if he persists in that attitude and calls democratic discussion and examination of the issues an irresponsible act.  I would ask the Minister to consider that. It is too late for him to say anything now. He may attempt to interrupt but he is digging an even bigger hole for himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies, Sir, for the phrase I used.  But I can assure the Minister that if he continues with the thinking he seems to have indicated last evening we can only conclude that he does not want this House to discuss anything of any substance in which he may be involved.  I am bound to point out that the kind of line he put across to us last evening, the alleged irresponsibility of bringing forward a motion like this at a sensitive time just before important discussions take place, is not one I can really accept is a matter of principle for the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1436" /> I would remind the Minister, lest he might have forgotten, or that he might not have been interested at the time, that on 24 November last, two days before the European Council Meeting in London, his colleague, Deputy MacSharry, brought forward a motion on the common agricultural policy.  Of course Deputy MacSharry was not irresponsible in doing that then nor did I think he was irresponsible in so doing.  We discussed matters that were of crucial importance, and we discussed them two days before a vital discussion in London.  Indeed Deputy MacSharry made the point, at that stage, that in putting down his motion he had no intention whatsoever of being mischievous.  He wanted to be helpful, he wanted to give this House an opportunity to show how deeply concerned it was about this matter.  He believed, and perhaps he really meant it, that it would be of assistance to me and to the Taoiseach of the day, that we could go to London and make the point that the matter was regarded as being one of such importance in our country that it had been discussed in this House two days before the meeting.</P>
    <P>That is an attitude of mind I would commend to the Minister.  I would hope that, on reflecting on the discussion we have had last evening and this evening, he might come, within the next few days to look on it in that way and decide to derive some benefit from the discussions we have had, indeed listen to a number of the points made not only on this side of the House but on that side also, and take them to heart because they could indeed be useful to him in the further pursuit of these negotiations.</P>
    <P>I am very worried by the Minister's approach.  He began by saying that we were irresponsible in putting down a motion like this.  Instead of addressing the issues he went on to make a number of what I can only describe as smart-alec remarks about Deputies on this side of the House, about Deputy D'Arcy's recent appointment as front bench spokesman for my party on fisheries, the Minister making the remarks he did from the great vantage point of all of his three-and-a-half month's experience in <Col N="1437" /> office.  I do not grudge it to the Minister. He should savour it while he can, he may not be there very much longer and he may come to regret the kind of remark he made last evening which is a discredit to himself, to the office he holds and the functions he is there to fulfil.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to make allegations about Deputy Fitzpatrick, allegations taken up by other speakers on that side of the House, this pretence of the Minister, the Minister of State and other Deputies on that side of the House who claim to have found out that Deputy Fitzpatrick during his term of office was instructed, allowed or had decided that he would settle for a six-mile band.  I would recommend that the Minister and Minister of State should re-read the files and compare the position as set out by Deputy Fitzpatrick when in Government with that set out by Deputy Lenihan when he held that office.  Indeed, if they read it with half an eye they will find that the position adopted by Deputy Fitzpatrick was a great deal firmer than the one set out by Deputy Lenihan, as indeed it must have been&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>They should read the paper again.  I shall quote it for them here if they like but they have it on their file. They should compare the two when they will find that Deputy Lenihan was far weaker in his approach than was Deputy Fitzpatrick on the issue.  The results show, after the debate in 1976 and 1977 &mdash; to which Deputy D'Arcy and Deputy Deasy have referred already &mdash; why so many Members of the Fianna Fáil Party were so insistent in their demands that we must settle for nothing less than a 50-mile limit.  Who was it who jettisoned the principle of a 50-mile limit?  Who was it who gave up on the claim for a 50-mile limit?  None other than Deputy Brian Lenihan, the then Minister for Fisheries who at that point conclusively gave away the principle.  Indeed we have been suffering from that cave-in ever since because, what has been going on ever since that date in fisheries negotiations has been a gradual manoeuvring by the <Col N="1438" /> other member states and indeed by the Commission, in response to those pressures, to find a way of giving in to, of satisfying those other member states. That way can be found only by putting more and more pressures on the waters in which our fishermen are obliged to make their living.  That is the history of those negotiations.  The other member states of the European Economic Community, having over-fished their waters, are now forced to go further and further and further afield to find fish.  Where will they come to find them?  In the waters off our coasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know for a fact that there have been a number of occasions during these negotiations &mdash; and the Minister can confirm it for himself if he takes the trouble to do so; no doubt his officials in between trips to Brussels will be able to tell him &mdash; when the <i>deus ex machina</i> of the Commission's plans has been the strength, richness and availability of fishing off our coasts.  That is something of which every Minister for Fisheries in this country must be very keenly aware and must guard against.  I make the point, and it is a very important one, that what has been happening is that we have been gradually moving further and further back from the kind of position we would want to maintain in defence of our interests.  For the Minister to come into this House and refer to the Commission's proposals as perhaps ones which could be improved on is the most scandalous naivety I have ever come across.  The history of these negotiations has been one in which we move further and further back from the kind of position we want to see, not where we move forward.  Indeed the proposal presented by the Minister last evening as one that improved in a certain number of aspects on the situation that obtained up to now, and on the situation that would obtain were we not to have agreement at EEC level on a common fisheries policy, is one which also contains some retraction by comparison with the present situation.  It could also be one &mdash; and this is the danger &mdash; that, even as it stands, unsatisfactory as it is, it could well turn out to be more favourable than the final agreement that is reached <Col N="1439" /> because unless we are very careful we will be moving back from that.</P>
    <P>The motion we have put down is that we reject any agreement on a common fisheries policy which allows non-national boats to fish up to six miles from the Irish coast within waters that should be available exclusively to the Irish fishing fleet. Even the fact that that motion makes the Minister uncomfortable today simply illustrates the force of what I have been saying and the reason for our putting down the motion.  The Minister proposes an amendment calling on us fully to support him in his efforts.  We want to do more than that.  We are not concerned merely with supporting him.  We are concerned with stiffening his back because we want to get further than he is prepared to go.  The Minister may not like it but we want to stiffen his back.  We would be very happy if we felt that he was going to adopt the kind of firm stance on these issues that Deputy Fitzpatrick adopted before him.  We want to make sure that <Col N="1440" /> when he goes over there he will be able to say, as he will be able to say, that he got a roasting in his own Parliament about the Commission's proposals before him.  A number of the comments made on this side of the House and on the other side would help the Minister if he has the wit to use them.  In putting forward this motion we have done our duty and we have done something which the Government have failed to do.  I ask the House to support this motion to strengthen our stand and to make it very clear to our European partners what we want from a fisheries policy and what they, if they are to stick to the terms of the treaty they signed with us and of the treaty they originally set up between themselves, are obliged to carry out, what they are committed to if they mean it, as we are, to helping in the development of the poorer regions of the Community and fisheries in this country are essential to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief in the remaining comments that I wish to make on this Bill.  I already expressed my reservations about the setting up of two State-sponsored bodies.  I maintained very strongly that the communications scene will in the nineties and up to the year 2000 show quite dramatic changes from the current system of communication by means of the letter, telephone and telex services of today.  With the introduction of computer based message systems, the development of electronic mail and television systems of communication, the revolution in communications which we are now witnessing, the concept of two separate State-sponsored bodies will be redundant.  That is the main argument against the proposals contained in the White Paper and those put forward by the review group when they presented their report to the Minister in 1979.  In that regard I was disappointed with the analysis at that time of the postal service and, to give just one example, with the total failure of that group and of successive Governments <Col N="1447" /> to analyse the role of, to take one sector, the Post Office Savings Bank, a sector which has not been effectively developed in this country at all.  I am convinced that we could have a Post Office Savings Bank operating under the general aegis of one State-sponsored body.  Indeed if it had been properly operated under one Department and given an opportunity to develop, particularly by the Department of Finance, it could have developed to its full potential as a major commercial banking institution making a very significant contribution towards banking competition here.  We have a nationwide distribution of over 2,000 persons at 1,500 centres.  We have over 2,000 counter service centres available in the country.</P>
      <P>There is no good reason why the national giro bank credit transfer system should not be independent from the associated banks.  The State could have saved itself a great deal of money by the development of an effective post office savings bank system, if it had been given the full support of the Department of Finance and other Departments.  It could have offered the Government a whole new financial banking structure which would have been of major benefit to the Exchequer.  My experience in the Department of Finance led me strongly to that belief.  It would also have provided an alternative banking system to the public in times of crisis.  That is a classic example of the failure of successive Governments to broaden the role of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and to foresee a role for the post office savings bank.  When one examines the accounts of the post office savings bank and of the post office itself, one inevitably comes to the conclusion that a great deal of interest on the balances held in the general banking arrangements of the post office accrues to the associated banks.  This point illustrates the need for a much broader national giro banking system. The need for such a system is manifest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inevitably I come to a personal conclusion that instead of two State-sponsored bodies we should not have yielded to the very conservative assessment of the <Col N="1448" /> review group and accepted their analysis of the situation, but we should have had a unified integrated State-sponsored body.  I drew attention to the ESB.  If we wanted to change the system we should have changed in that direction and not two separate bodies.  If the Minister were to go back to the two boards tomorrow morning he might find they would say that on re-examination the system should be integrated.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be acutely aware of the rising cost of postal and telecommunications charges.  I would prefer if, as has been originally envisaged, the charges had been subject to normal price control legislation, preferably under the control and influence of the National Prices Commission. It is anomalous to say the least that the Minister sets up two State-sponsored bodies while at the same time saying he will retain the approval or otherwise for increases in postal and telecommunication charges.  That is a considerable departure from the proposals set out in the White Paper of May 1981.  If the Minister sets up a body while simultaneously deciding that the cabinet must retain authority over the price of the product, the question must be asked, why set up this body?  If two semi-State bodies are given authority to act on a quasi-commercial basis, they should be given authority to process price increase applications, subject to normal price control legislation &mdash; the National Prices Commission.  The Users' Council should be consulted by the body seeking price increases.  That is only fair and reasonable. Perhaps in his reply the Minister might comment on that.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have expressed very grave concern about the overall intent of this Bill.  We are not satisfied that sufficient confidence has been engendered, particularly on the postal side, to convince the staffs that all their normal public service entitlements and prospects will be fully protected.  That was a very serious matter, and the reaction I got from postal workers was one of very considerable concern the more the debate unfolded.  The Minister will have to go a very long way before these fears are allayed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1449" /> We are not satisfied with the general level of capital investment projected particularly for the postal board.  We do not consider it sufficient to meet the demands of the eighties and the nineties. The post office fleet is sadly run down and dilapidated.  There is a great need for a new major construction programme even on the postal side, and on the telecommunications side one could comfortably spend £700 million or £800 million tomorrow morning and one would just about meet the demands of the day.</P>
    <P>I do not want to sound unduly parochial, but in the Dún Laoghaire borough there are about 5,000 or 6,000 telephone applicants awaiting service.  They take a jaundiced view of the extent to which that sector of the Department has managed to provide a modernised, effective national telecommunications service.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider whether it would be wise to go back to the two interim boards, to have another discussion with the unions concerned and to review the fundamental question whether we want to have two separate boards in what is a communications industry.  From the technological point of view that industry is changing with enormous rapidity and the question should be asked whether we want to see the proposed structure operating for the next 30 or 40 years.  I must confess I have considerable reservations about advocating a structure of that kind, and I hope my view is shared by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals envisaged in the Bill represent a major inroad into a well-tried and tested system that has endured for many years and which has given on the whole valued and reliable service to our people since the foundation of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is proposed in the Bill is a plan to alter the whole basis of the organisation of that service.  I use the word &ldquo;service&rdquo; advisedly.  When I read the Bill and studied the statement it brought to mind the words of a teacher of mine many years ago on the subject of administrative law.  He was talking about the advantages from a government's point of view in conducting their business through the <Col N="1450" /> means of a statutory body or semi-independent body.  He pointed out there were two main advantages and, in his inimitable way, he summed them up as follows: the first is jobs for the boys and the second is removing from the Minister concerned answerability and responsibility to the elected Members of a Parliament for the conduct of the affairs of that service.</P>
    <P>Jobs for the boys certainly will be involved in what is proposed here.  We have provision for two new boards, the members to be appointed by the Minister. In many of these cases appointees to such boards are people who do not have experience and expertise in the specialised fields that have been selected for them.  They are given sinecure appointments on the boards, to sit there forming part of a rubber stamp operation, paid handsomely for very little effort, for little knowledge and for little, if any, expertise in the areas involved.</P>
    <P>In the huge number of boards and agencies in existence we have enough jobs for the boys.  I do not think the country can afford any more.  It is time we so organised our affairs that the people who run the major services are people who work in the services themselves and who have detailed knowledge of their workings, not people who are rewarded for services to a political party. Let me hasten to add that I do not confine my remarks to a criticism of any side of the House in particular.  It is only fair to say that from time to time during the years all sides have been guilty of that offence, but I say that now is not the time to open the doors afresh to a new plethora of sinecures that will mean additional cost and expense to the already over-burdened taxpayers.</P>
    <P>It may be that the organisation of the existing Department of Posts and Telegraphs could do with some pruning, with some reorganisation and restructuring. Nobody would fault that, but to bring that about does not require us to throw out the baby with the bath water, which is what is envisaged in this legislation. We are proposing to throw away the established structures that were built up over many years.  By all means let there <Col N="1451" /> be an examination of the structures, of the nature of the employment and the division of the employment.  The unions would be very happy to co-operate in any such restructuring.  At least in that way the country would know that every person involved in the control and direction of this vital service was a person of that service, not a person imported into it from some outside and alien field at great and unnecessary expense to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the posts and telegraphs system as a commercial venture, as though this was solely in the field of commerce.  In my view a service involving our postal system, telegrams and telephones bears no relation to commercial activities.  Those are matters intended to provide a service for our people, not related to the profit motive, not related to the necessity of pruning services to save some money while paying scant regard to the hardship that would be caused in many areas by such pruning. We have seen that happen before all too often.  Many appalling decisions have been made with the aim of pruning in the area of the railways and in other sectors. We must provide a broad spectrum of service in the area of posts and telegraphs and the services conducted by the Department up to now that people quite rightly have come to take for granted.  I shudder at the thought that some independent company with its board of directors operating as a rubber stamp operation will sit down and, with gay abandon, will prune the service, will take away a postal service from a rural area that has relied on it from the time immemorial, all for the sake of a small saving.  Exercises like this would cause hardship to small communities.  That is not what is required of government.  What is required of government is service, and that is embodied in the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;, which means to serve, not to run a business at a profit.</P>
    <P>If more thought had gone into the pricing structures of the services that have been operating perhaps the losses &mdash; and I do not regret them because they are part and parcel of the services &mdash; would be less.  The cost of the postage stamp <Col N="1452" /> was increased in an effort to balance the income and expenditure of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, but there is a large number of people now who cannot afford to use that service any longer.  All too often the net result of such an operation is that the revenue coming into the Department decreases instead of increasing, thereby defeating the purpose for which it was brought in in the first place.  It is entirely wrong that a Department and a key central function of Government, such as is involved here, should be hived off from the responsibility of a Minister who sits in this House. That is unacceptable.  That service, as the Minister's speech indicates, must be funded by vast amounts of taxpayers' money.  For a start £55 million will be provided from the Exchequer for postal development and that is a drop in the ocean.  The amount of taxpayers' money that has gone into those services and the building of that infrastructure represents the hard earned money of the citizens of this country.  It is completely untenable that there should be no answerability in this House to the elected Members who represent the people who pay the tax.  It is a very convenient method of Government from the point of view of the Government.  It is very convenient from the Minister's point of view.  He will not have to answer to the elected Members as to what the expenditure of that money has produced.  He will not have to say where it has gone, if it was properly or well spent.  If we tried to inquire into the expenditure of these large sums of money we would be fobbed off and told that it was not the Minister's field of responsibility, that it was the responsibility of an independent board of directors who would be entrusted with the expenditure of colossal sums of money provided by the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Let no one think that the intended balancing of the books by these companies, which appears to be envisaged in this legislation, would be achieved.  Even with the decimation of the service that would inevitably take place, I have no doubt that the process of subsidisation of those services will be and will continue to be an on-going feature of fiscal arrangements <Col N="1453" /> of the Department for the foreseeable future.  I know that has happened before in other fields.  We are dealing with Bills and Estimates all the time but at least in many of these cases where the Department is involved, we can debate the subject and query what was done with the last £25 million or £50 million.  This would be an on-going drain on the shrinking resources of the country into a field where we would have no control.  We are adopting a very dangerous concept here. One could envisage a situation where virtually every service that is regarded as a normal service provided by the Government would be hived off to independent companies and corporations, leaving us sitting here in the House and the Minister sitting opposite as a mere shell operation. The whole process of Government would be conducted at a different level and we, as elected representatives, would have as our sole function the voting of money to be raised by taxation to pay a hierarchy of employees of companies operating on a different level altogether to us here. One could envisage that situation for every Government service.</P>
    <P>Why should the Minister for Defence have an army?  No doubt a statutory independent corporation could be brought in which would operate a mercenary army.  That might be a cheaper arrangement.  It is wrong that Governments should run away from the administration of the Government.  It is the Government's job to govern and the job of the Minister to serve.  He serves by running the service which is under his control.  He is the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and he has the obligation to run that service and to ensure that an adequate and proper service is provided for all our people, whether or not any individual or aspect of that service may be unprofitable or may run at a loss.  If that is the case, so be it.  That is the nature of the service which we must provide, that we have provided up to now but which I very much fear, in the event of the implementation of the concept of this Bill, will no longer be available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of the Bill has been emphasised by the fact that so many people have contributed to this Second Reading debate.  In fact the debate was <Col N="1455" /> so varied and interesting that I felt myself regretting there were not any more speakers.  It was quite apparent that the Deputies who contributed were deeply interested in the Bill and, in particular, in the development of the postal and telecommunications service about which this Bill is engaged.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Deputy Cooney for a very fine, helpful contribution, one that was positive and well thought out.  It was of course, the kind of contribution I had expected from him seeing that he had worked so hard on the preparation of the Bill in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I was a little surprised at some of the points made by various speakers that their respective parties, particularly the Labour Party &mdash; which seemed to adopt a completely opposite view to the one I was putting before the House &mdash; played such a large part in putting the Bill together.  I might mention that the Long and Short Titles of the Bill were put on the Order Paper before Christmas 1981. Therefore, I find it very hard to understand the strong opposition of the Labour speakers, seeing that their Members in Government had accepted this Bill.  I think the only provisions not included at that time were the financial ones.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney made the point that the companies would be in the market, felt they should be in a position to make a profit and to make a contribution to the Exchequer from those profits.  In that I am in total agreement with him.  He expressed the wish that An Post would recover business which was lost to private interests.  I want to make the point that it is illegal to conduct a courier service in the delivery of letters.  The parcel post has always been free and open to competition but it is illegal to conduct a courier service for the delivery of letters.  It is as well to put that on the record of the House, because some contributors to the debate did not seem to be quite clear in their minds on that.</P>

It is not the same thing at all as delivering letters addressed to a specific address.  That did not take place on that occasion.  That is the fact, that is the legal position as I am informed.</P>

      <P>I think, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you will agree that in the time you were in the Chair and also when the Ceann Comhairle himself was in the Chair I did not interrupt anybody making contributions to the debate.  Consequently, I do not intend to be interrupted now and I am claiming the protection of the Chair.  I know it was not Deputy Harte's intention to interrupt; I would not be quite so sure about Deputy L'Estrange.</P>
      <P>Many people referred to the sub-offices and their importance in the postal set-up, in the structures of the postal service.  I find myself endorsing the remarks made by the various speakers on the importance of the sub-offices.  Deputy Cooney was the first to mention their importance in the scheme of things.  I know from conversations with the executive and chairman of the postal board, An Post, that they have great plans for the use and expansion of use of the sub-post offices. The point made by Deputy Cooney that the consumers will benefit is one I endorse totally.  He complained of the high charges in telecommunications and mentioned the great potential for development in that area.  There is no doubt at all about it that that is the growth area under my Department, as for now, and the potential is great.  As we see it now, as it develops, there cannot but be a point in the very near future when substantial profits will be made and when the possibility of a reduction in charges will arise.  This point has not been reached as yet, but we assess the period until that happens as a very short one indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1457" /> Deputy Cooney asked me what was the rate of refusals as of the most recent period for which there are records, that is 1981.  On average the rate is 20 per cent, which is not very large.  There is, of course, a tendency for the refusal rate to rise in a time of recession or when charges are very high, but 20 per cent seems to have been roughly the rate of refusal that has obtained for some time.</P>
    <P>In addressing himself to the question of whether the change to State-sponsored bodies was desirable Deputy Cooney came to the conclusion that it was the best arrangement provided, of course, that the companies were properly financed.  He mentioned three main points with regard to the postal service, the first being the arrangements about superannuation.  Many contributors to the debate raised this question, so I had better deal with that in some detail. Deputy Cooney also raised the proposals about financing the postal development and mentioned the grants for the first three years of the five-year plan for current expenditure.  It must have been that Deputy Cooney misunderstood the implications of the arrangements proposed about superannuation.  Other Members of the House seemed to misunderstand them as well, so I will explain them carefully.  I want to make it quite clear that An Post and Bord Telecom are being required to make provision for superannuation only in respect of service arising after the vesting day.  The appropriate amount necessary to do this was decided by an actuarial assessment which was arranged jointly by the two boards. My Department was involved and the Department of the Public Service.  The actuary advised that, in order to make adequate provision in respect of post-vesting day service for the postal service, an annual amount equivalent to 16.8 per cent of payroll would be needed.  This is the amount that An Post is being required to make provision for, no more and no less.  It is not being asked to make any provision in respect of the pensions of former employees of the Department or in respect of the pre-vesting day service of transferred staff.  It is very important to emphasise that to the House.  The <Col N="1458" /> Exchequer will accept full liability in regard to these.  The only novel aspect of the arrangement is that the Exchequer liability is being deferred until a situation is reached in which the pension fund set up by either company is not adequate to meet the outgo on pensions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what confuses it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making it quite clear now.  At that stage the Exchequer contingent liability fund will become available to whatever extent is required.  I mentioned this arrangement in my introductory speech and I indicated that this was a fair arrangement to the companies, the staff, whose interests will be protected, and the taxpayer, who would otherwise have to bear the cost of existing pensions, which would increase annually as more staff retired after the vesting day.</P>
      <P>I want to reiterate that the companies are not taking over the State's obligations. Their financial position, in terms of current expenditure, will be exactly the same under the arrangements proposed as it would be if the Exchequer was being discharged from the vesting day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret having to raise this matter tonight to ask the Minister what steps he intends to take about it.  I thought it would be my Cork colleague, the Minister for Labour, who would be taking this because I believe he had discussions with the two groups involved in this case.  I welcome the Minister for Industry and Energy.  I hope he has something good for the workforce in this particular firm.</P>
      <P>This firm started originally as a family firm who, over the years, provided stable employment for the city of Cork.  A large percentage of the work force never worked for any firm except the Eagle Printing Company.  In 1981 this firm had a turnover of £2 million and had an after tax profit of £20,000.  This was a family owned firm up to the early seventies, when a firm of business consultants were brought in to advise how the company could be updated and made more efficient. This proved very successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They brought in a gentleman who <Col N="1460" /> belonged to the company which reviewed the activities of this firm, and appointed him as manager in 1973.  In 1975 they moved from the old city centre premises at Oliver Plunkett Street, which consisted of many small units, which was not conducive to efficiency, to the outskirts of the city, where they had no parking problems or problems in loading or unloading their trucks, which they had in the city centre.  The move proved so successful that they succeeded in getting the second largest printing order in the country. They got the contract for printing for Gateaux Limited, Dublin.  It is rather ironic that the people from whom they won this contract, their greatest opponents and the people who had been carrying out this work, were the Jefferson Smurfit Company.</P>
    <P>In 1977 the Jefferson Smurfit Company indicated that they were interested in this particular firm and they bought 50 per cent of the shares.  The full right of management went with that, and they would decide company policy.  Since 1977, despite the fact that this company had massive profits, whose branches spread right across the world, they failed to inject further capital into the Eagle Printing Company and, as a result, the company found it difficult but succeeded in remaining viable and continued to show a profit.</P>
    <P>There have been major advances in printing technology in recent years, but in the Eagle Printing Company part of the type-setting was still carried out by hand.  Despite this, Eagle Printing Company continued to prosper.  When the workforce were recently informed their services would no longer be required, it was a shock.</P>
    <P>I intended to put this to the Minister for Labour yesterday but I was ruled out of order.  The Jefferson Smurfit Company are reluctant to meet the union representatives of some of the work force to discuss severance pay and redundancy payments. I am more alarmed that the gentleman who is head of this printing combine is to be head of one of the semi-State bodies the House has been discussing for the past two days.  Is this the type of industrial relations we will <Col N="1461" /> have in one of our new semi-State bodies, Bord Telecom Éireann?</P>
    <P>There are 106 people who are now trying to find alternative employment in a city where there are almost 8,000 people unemployed.  I doubt if some of them will get employment again unless some definite steps are taken by the Government.  I ask the Minister if he would intervene and ensure that the voice of the workers is heard by the company concerned.  That is of primary importance. They deserve a fair hearing and a just reward for their service through the years.  The Eagle Printing Company have been part and parcel of Cork tradition and there is a market for their products.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the skills of these craftsmen are second to none but they will have difficulty in finding alternative employment in their native city.  At times we are very critical of Britain, but there a small firms fund was set up originally by the Labour Party which has been continued by the Conservative Party, enabling firms which go into liquidation or out of business, leading to redundancies, an opportunity to give their workers a new start. Could the Minister provide the necessary finance for those &mdash; I dare say not all &mdash; who would be interested in starting their own printing company?  The famous order which the Eagle Printing Works won from the Jefferson Smurfit Company is being carried out outside this country, which is deplorable.  Given the opportunity, some of the workers would be able to fill this void and apply themselves, as the workers at the Crannog factory did with grants from the IDA or an Foras Forbartha, to competing in the open market.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to these suggestions for which there are precedents.  The people involved are from all levels of employment: administrators, craftsmen, general operatives and their average age is 46 years.  A fair spread of skills is available. Were we to retrain this manpower source, it would cost quite a lot of money. Would the Minister intervene immediately and use his good offices to get the Jefferson Smurfit Company representatives to meet representatives of the <Col N="1462" /> unions which have not had that opportunity? Some of the unions have had discussions but craft unions, in particular, to date have not had the opportunity for consultation with the management and directors of this firm on severance pay and redundancy money.</P>
    <P>The Minister should seriously consider trying to fund a co-operative effort in an attempt to give these people their rightful place in society and in the workforce, rather than on the dole queue, which is not very encouraging.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. E. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the case made by my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, on behalf of the workers of the Eagle Printing Company of Cork. This is a traditional industry and we are speaking about people with long years of skilled service in the one company.</P>
      <P>Cork, generally, is an area which has been very badly hit in recent years by the collapse of traditional companies which employ many members of a family for all their working lives.  These people started work feeling secure in the knowledge that they would have good employment with good conditions but, due to competition, these companies went to the wall in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cork was equally unfortunate with many new companies, subsidiaries of international companies, which raised the hopes of the people seeking employment but closed in many cases after a very short time, one or two years, leaving workers without the prospect of employment. There are now 8,000 unemployed in Cork and the average unemployment rate there is higher than the national average.  We have always heard about the tremendous potential in Cork for long-term development, which to date has not taken place.  It is vitally important to harness the skills now becoming available because of the problems with these companies. All the skills are there and the market is there.  I ask that the skilled <Col N="1463" /> workers be given the assistance of the State in availing of this market.</P>
    <P>We all give lip service to the idea of private enterprise and to the concept of small industries and self-help.  Here are people who have been treated very badly and who are prepared to help themselves with a little assistance from the State.  I join with my colleague in appealing to the Minister to take action to ensure that every facility be given to these redundant workers who do not want to be a drag on the State where unemployment benefits are concerned.  They want to utilise their skills for the benefit of the State and the community.  Regarding redundancy and severance pay, it was very high-handed of the Jefferson Smurfit Company not to have discussions with the workers, for whom 146 jobs have gone, about those vital issues.  I do not have to illustrate the effects of this on their families.  Unless they are helped to get alternative employment their future is very bleak indeed. They have a right to redundancy and severance pay and the company should be forced to enter into discussions with the unions representing them.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and to his colleague, the Minister for Labour, to ensure immediate intervention by the Government on these issues.  This has been another blow to a city which has been dealt many blows recently, where unemployment is soaring and one item of bad news is succeeded by another, week after week.  Action by the Minister would be very welcome indeed to ensure that the workers will be treated as human beings with dignity and the respect which they deserve and that they will be helped to use collectively their skills in an alternative industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I share the concern of the two Deputies from Cork on the very quick closure of the Eagle Printing Company. I know Deputy O'Sullivan was surprised when he saw me coming in to take the Adjournment motion.  I heard the Deputy raise this matter on the Order of Business today and I was struck by the phraseology he used when speaking of <Col N="1464" /> the Minister for Labour.  I, too, have a responsibility in this matter.  Deputy O'Sullivan has made a clear and fair case on behalf of the workers and he can be assured that I will have discussions with his fellow Cork Deputy, the Minister for Labour, on the many aspects raised by Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>
      <P>It must be recognised clearly that primary responsibility for the well being of any enterprise rests with the owners and the management.  It must also be recognised that a critical decision, such as one to liquidate a company voluntarily, is the responsibility of the shareholders alone. In such a situation there is no requirement that I or the IDA be notified in advance that liquidation is being contemplated. Nevertheless, in this case I would have expected the controlling interests, at least as a matter of courtesy, to have signalled to us some days in advance the decision that was pending, to me or to the IDA, but most important, to the workforce.  In that way it might have been possible &mdash; I do not know if many possibilities existed &mdash; to have the business taken over as a going concern.</P>
      <P>The first news my Department or the IDA had of the company's situation was when we read in the newspapers on 7 May that a liquidator had been appointed.  Immediately on learning of the situation, the IDA took steps in conjunction with the liquidator to try to find a suitable person who might be prepared to acquire the assets and to continue printing.  The IDA prepared a brochure in conjunction with the liquidator and had it very widely circulated in an effort to interest companies who had been identified as having a possible interest. These efforts are being maintained, but in the circumstances and bearing in mind the trading performance of the Eagle Printing Company in the past year or so, it must be recognised that the prospects of arranging a suitable takeover are not good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am bound to say, too, that in this case it appears to me that the workers concerned, by pressing their claims perhaps too vigorously, presented the company with a ready-made excuse to cease production. Far be it from me to suggest or <Col N="1465" /> imply that workers are not entitled to resort to industrial action in pursuit of their just claims.  However, I would suggest that what happened in the case of this company suggests to me the need for workers to be restrained and measured when resorting to industrial action, and for companies who act with due consideration for workers and State agencies in the current economic climate.</P>
    <P>I am familiar with the Eagle Company. Many years ago I was a customer of theirs for a few years and I am not unfamiliar with the quality of the work they produced. I accept the case made by Deputy O'Sullivan in relation to the crafts and skills there.</P>
    <P>Two specific requests were made to me.  One was to intervene to give an opportunity to the workforce to have their voices heard in this situation.  As the Deputy knows, that is a matter for the Minister for Labour.  I had a word with him before I came in this evening and he told me he had met the workers in his role as a constituency Deputy.  I will tell him that apparently only some of them have been met so far and that Deputy O'Sullivan hopes that the rest of them will be given a similar opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour has assured me that he will give serious consideration to this matter and that he will continue his efforts in the matters just referred to by Deputy O'Sullivan.  Serious consideration will be given to providing an opportunity to the workforce to establish their own co-operative business.  I will not have any hesitation about asking the IDA to explore all possibilities in this regard. Deputy O'Sullivan may not be as well aware as Deputy Desmond that printing is an industry in which there is a fair amount of over-capacity.  It is one of the areas which the IDA stopped grant-aiding some time ago.</P>
    <P>However, on the basis of what Deputy O'Sullivan has said, the exploration of all possibilities will be considered by me and the IDA.  There may be some mix in the market which might be contacted to try <Col N="1466" /> to identify areas of the market which these workers could get into.  I share the concern of the Cork Deputies about putting these workers back to work in a co-operative or in some other small business undertaking.  That will have all the encouragement I can possibly give it.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the difficulties in the printing industry and its capacity.  Printing undertakings suffer very quickly in recession periods but can recover very quickly when the recession recedes.  I will continue our efforts, in conjunction with the IDA, to get somebody to take over the assets.  I understand the site is valuable and it might well be that if the workers were thinking of setting up some sort of business it might have to be in some smaller unit, such as an IDA advance factory or a cluster unit.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I will not spare any efforts to do whatever I can for these workers.  I do not wish to labour the point that we are in a difficult economic climate. Indeed, last week when I visited the US it became clear to me that the investment position there, because of the high unemployment that exists, which is the worst they have seen since 1938, plus high interest rates, is retarded and certain investment plans are being left aside. That is not to say that I will not continue all efforts in this matter.  I will give way to Deputy O'Sullivan because I think he has another point to put.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the attractions of the Litter Bill is that it will not, in fact, cost a great deal to implement it.  The necessity for additional staff, if any, will have to be considered by each local authority in the context of the needs of the areas and the existing activities.  Local authorities already spend considerably, and employ workforces, on street cleaning and waste collection and disposal and <Col N="1315" /> in some cases, on publicity and other campaigns.</P>
      <P>The provisions in the Bill will strengthen their powers to control litter and this should lead to a reduction in the problem and in the need for local authority spending on cleaning up operations. It is also intended that moneys accruing to local authorities under the Bill, e.g., from fines-on-the-spot or from charges, will be available as an offset against costs involved.  Finally, I might mention that there has been a major increase in the funds allocated to the local authorities this year for environmental works &mdash; to a total of nearly £7 million.</P>
      <P>In view of these considerations it does not seem unreasonable to expect that local authorities will be able to meet any modest expenditure that may be needed to implement the Bill.</P>

      <P>However, the total number of customs and excise seizures in each of the past three years was: 1979, 2,827; 1980, 3,711; 1981, 4,095.  It is estimated that about one-quarter of these seizures was made in Border counties.</P>
      <P>The disposal of seized goods, whether by subsequent release or otherwise, depends on the nature of the offence and each case is treated on its merits.  Minor seizures of a non-commercial nature are normally dealt with by acceptance of compromise sums in lieu of proceedings and by release of the goods.  In cases of commercial smuggling the goods are usually retained.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs his attitude towards proposals to establish a nuclear-free zone in central Europe; and if such proposals would have any implications in respect of the stationing of nuclear weapons in that part of western Europe outside the nuclear-free zone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would of course support any initiative which tended to reduce and eventually eliminate the nuclear threat to Europe.  A nuclear weapon-free zone would be in line with Ireland's 1959 proposal at the United Nations General Assembly for an &ldquo;area by area&rdquo; approach to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. International agreements have since been concluded to prevent the introduction of nuclear weapons in certain areas, for example the Antarctic and Latin America.  In 1978 the Final Document of the first UN Special Session on Disarmament reaffirmed that the establishment of nuclear weapon-free zones, on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned, should be encouraged.</P>
      <P>No proposal to establish such a zone in Central Europe has yet been formulated. A NWFZ in Europe will only be possible when the member countries of the Warsaw Pact and NATO abandon their respective strategies based on deterrence. There is no indication that they are prepared to do so, or to resolve the related question of the perceived threat posed by the imbalance of conventional forces in Europe.  However the fact that negotiations are taking place in Geneva between the United States and the Soviet Union on intermediate nuclear forces (INF) and strategic arms (START) is a positive sign and could represent the beginnings of a process of gradual reduction and final elimination of nuclear weapons from Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of any concrete proposal <Col N="1326" /> it is not possible to speculate about other implications of a possible NWFZ.</P>

      <P>Ireland is taking part at present in the United Nations special session devoted to disarmament which is meeting in New York from 7 June to 9 July. Ireland's delegation was led by the Taoiseach who addressed the session on 11 June.</P>
      <P>Our objective at this session is to secure concrete disarmament measures which can be agreed by consensus of the international community and which will lead to realistic reductions of weapons, both nuclear and conventional, and ultimately lead to general and complete disarmament under international control. Ireland will support measures at the session which are designed to reduce in particular nuclear weapons which present the most immediate threat to mankind. Ireland advocates the adoption of a realistic Comprehensive Programme of Disarmament (CPD) which will provide guidelines for subsequent negotiations and an impetus to the disarmament process.</P>
      <P>Verification is a highly technical and complex area which directly affects the security concerns of the states parties to any possible disarmament agreement. The Final Document of the First Special Session recognised that any disarmament measure must proceed on the basis of undiminished security to all states.  This principle is of fundamental importance in the search for agreement in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The initiatives to which the Deputy refers concern proposals on European Union put forward jointly by the Foreign Ministers of Germany and Italy.  A summary of the proposals is given in Chapter 19 of the Nineteenth Report on Developments in the European Communities (Pl. 333) which was laid before the House on 5 May 1982. These proposals envisage not the enactment of a new Treaty at present but rather the adoption of a &ldquo;European Act&rdquo; in the form of a solemn political declaration to be signed by the Heads of State and Government of the member states of the European Communities.</P>
      <P>The aim of these proposals is to strengthen the Community and European Political Co-operation by confirming the commitment of the member states to make progress towards European Union, by reaffirming the broad political objectives of the Community, by increasing the efficiency of its decision-making procedures, and by ensuring closer coordination between activities undertaken in the framework of the Treaties establishing the European Communities and those carried out in the inter-governmental framework of European Political Co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland endorses the objective of wishing to see the mutual relations of the member states of the European Communities evolve towards a European Union.  For this reason, Ireland has taken a generally positive approach towards the German-Italian initiative.  Discussions are continuing among the member states on the proposals and, in the course of those discussions, Ireland has expressed the view that progress towards European Union can best be made by strengthening <Col N="1328" /> the community of interest among the member states in the areas of economic integration covered by the Treaties and by promoting greater convergence among the economies of the member states.  The community of interest and convergence thus developed can strengthen the foundations for further steps towards political unification.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1338" /> The variation in cost per pupil as between the different types of schools may be considered to arise from the different circumstances affecting the administration of the schools, including, <i>inter alia</i>, the nature of the accommodation and size of classes, the range and type of subjects of the curriculum and the stage of development of each of the systems.</P>

      <P>In February 1982, following a review of her case, the claim was allowed from 2 December 1981.  All arrears due to her have been paid and further weekly payments continue to be made as they fall due.</P>
      <P>Under statutory regulations, in the case of wholly unemployed persons the combined total of flat rate unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and any income tax refund paid may not exceed 85 per cent of average weekly earnings after deduction of income tax and pay-related social insurance contribution or one-fiftieth of the prescribed earnings ceiling, whichever is the lesser.  In this case the net earnings from 6 April 1981 to 1 December 1981 were £1,172.88 and the average net weekly earnings were £34.50 of which 85 per cent represents £29.32.

      <P>The person concerned, whose husband died on 13 February 1982, claimed a widow's contributory pension on 22 March 1982, but this has been refused on the grounds that her late husband did not have the necessary insurance contributions to qualify her for such pension.  She has been notified accordingly. Her entitlement to non-contributory pension has not been examined as her means derived from a Government pension are in excess of the statutory limit for receipt of pension by a widow with no qualified children.</P>

Each was told that the letter would be taken as fulfilling the statutory requirement that one year's notice of intention to apply for naturalisation must be given and that a formal application could be made 12 months after the receipt of the notice or thereafter.
