    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has given any commitment to bring forward an immediate amendment of the Constitution to protect the right to life of the unborn child; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West)</i> asked the Taoiseach when he intends to introduce legislation in the Dáil to amend the Constitution to prevent abortion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together and I would refer the Deputies to my reply to a Parliamentary Question of 20 October last about constitutional amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, since then, given a commitment to members of the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign that I will consult with the Attorney General and will shortly ask the Government to consider whether the question of a Pro-Life amendment should <Col N="3" /> be dealt with separately, or should await the completion of the Attorney General's constitutional review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dublin North-West) Mr. Barrett (Dublin North-West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I remind the Taoiseach that a firm commitment was given by him to have this matter dealt with urgently, if his party were elected to Government.  Is he aware that by coupling this matter with other constitutional issues, he is taking away from the importance of the pro-life campaign and is reneging on another election promise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I rebut that accusation at once.  There is no question of reneging on any promise.  It is a question of the most effective way to implement this. That is what the Government are concerned about.  We are totally opposed to abortion.  Essentially the question now is whether the issue should be taken separately or should await the completion of the Attorney General's review and be dealt with in the general constitutional context.  That is a matter which the Government will shortly decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach indicate the exact terms of his commitment to the members of the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign, both before and since the general election campaign?  In doing so, would he confirm or deny that he gave a categorical, unequivocal commitment, without any reference to any other aspect of constitutional change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that a constitutional review is now in progress. I can read out the relevant letter, if the Deputy wishes.  This is a letter dated 5 August last which I have in front of me and which, firstly, thanked Dr. Vaughan for her letter.  It goes on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is unalterably opposed to the legalisation of abortion and is committed to taking whatever steps are necessary to ensure that an appropriate constitutional amendment is brought forward.  The Attorney General <Col N="4" /> is now examining the forms such an amendment might take.</P>
    <P>That was before the constitutional review was announced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach be prepared to tell the House whether he himself favours such a referendum and whether or not such a referendum would be held on its own, or in conjunction with other referenda at a future time?  Pending any such constitutional change which the Government may or may not intend, will the Government be introducing any changes in the law on abortion, irrespective altogether of the question of the constitution? If so, when would they propose to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter is a separate question.  As regards the first part of the Deputy's question, I have answered it. We will be deciding shortly whether to do this by way of a separate amendment or in the context of a change in the Constitution following the constitutional review.  We shall be making an announcement on that in the quite near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach himself favour such a referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly strongly in favour of ensuring that the Constitution provides protection for life, including the life of the unborn child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dublin North-West) Mr. Barrett (Dublin North-West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> May I take it that the delay by the Taoiseach is caused by the fact that there are elements in his own party which have announced in public that they favour the right of the woman to choose?  Would that be the cause of this delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Government, as a whole, and individually are firmly committed on this matter. The Deputy will not succeed in casting doubt on that commitment of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AliceGlenn" hpid="Mrs. Glenn Mrs. Glenn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, after <Col N="5" /> Deputy Haughey, if he wishes to speak on the same matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I again ask the Taoiseach to reply to my question which he has so far failed to do, namely, will he confirm or deny that his commitment to the members of the Pro-Life Campaign, both before and after the election, was without reservation and without reference to any other matter?  Is he now telling the House that it would not be possible for him and the Government to proceed with this legislation and with this constitutional amendment, without reference to any other constitutional matter? Would he please deal with those two questions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already read out the terms of the letter which I wrote in August last.  As far as the rest is concerned, the Government will decide which is the best way to proceed to fulfil the commitment.  I would deprecate any attempt to make this a political issue in the House because there are certain things that the parties in the House are united on and this is one.  It is not an appropriate issue to make into a party one.  Deputies are obviously entitled to make inquiries as to what our intentions are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept my assurance that we on this side of the House have no intention of making it a party issue and that whatever steps the Government take in this regard will receive full, expeditious co-operation from this side of the House?  But I must reiterate the question which I am asking the Taoiseach.  Would he not agree with the House that this legislation and this amendment could be proceeded with without reference to any other matter? This is a very simple question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When I receive advice on the matter from the Attorney General, which will be in the near future, the Government will take a decision as to which is the best way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AliceGlenn" hpid="Mrs. Glenn Mrs. Glenn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking for a direction <Col N="6" /> and it is relevant to what is being discussed at the moment.  I had a written answer to a question to the Minister for Justice relating to a group of people trading under the name of the Well Woman Centre who are publicising the fact that they are running an abortion referral service.  I did not request a written reply, but I got a written reply just before Christmas.  That prevented me from asking supplementary questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may ask a supplementary question now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AliceGlenn" hpid="Mrs. Glenn Mrs. Glenn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a reply from the Minister for Justice pointing out that he has no function in the matter.  I accept that explanation.  The Minister says that it is a matter for the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I clarify it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Deputy ask her question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may ask a question of the Taoiseach or she may ask the Taoiseach to clarify the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AliceGlenn" hpid="Mrs. Glenn Mrs. Glenn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking what is the Government's intention in relation to this.  Deputies on the other side of the House need not be so facetious about it. This situation was allowed to continue while they were in office and they turned a blind eye to it.  What are we to do about the fact that these people have made it public that they are carrying on this service when everybody throughout the length and breadth of this land is opposed to the slaughter of the innocents?  That is what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify the situation in relation to giving a written reply.  That was requested by the House and given by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must object to this procedure.  It is the Taoiseach's question time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions and has been referred to him by me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter which the Government will be taking a decision on in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood Deputy Glenn to say that it was stated in the reply which she received from the Minister for Justice that it was a matter for the Attorney General.  The Minister for Justice said that it was a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions. Could we have some clarification on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with a quite separate question.  The Deputy is asking about a question that was dealt with in the last session.  I take it that the written reply arose from the fact that the Minister's questions were not reached and written replies were issued to all Deputies at that time.  I have not got the terms of the reply here.  It is a separate question.  I can communicate with the Deputy but I cannot possibly deal with it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that none of the women Members of the House is prepared to refute the suggestion that women have not the right to choose in this matter let me as a male Member of this House say that I believe that they have a right to choose on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the progress to date of the discussions between the Attorney General and the relevant British authorities arising from his last meeting with the British Prime Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At our meeting on 6 November last the British Prime Minister and I invited our respective Attorneys General to consider what further improvements might be possible to ensure that those who committed crimes in one jurisdiction should not be able to escape prosecution and conviction by seeking refuge in the other.</P>
      <P>Following a meeting between the two Attorneys General a number of ways in which such improvements might be achieved are currently under examination at official level and it is envisaged that the Attorneys General will meet again soon to pursue their discussions.</P>
      <P>As is the normal practice in discussions of this kind, in which the opinions of the Attorneys General must be referred to the respective Governments, it has been agreed that details should be treated as confidential for the present.  For this reason it is not possible for me to give any fuller information in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Anglo-Irish Inter-governmental Council met for the first time at official level in Dublin recently. It is envisaged that the first meeting at ministerial level involving the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will take place in the near future.</P>
      <P>Other matters arising out of the Anglo-Irish joint studies are currently the subject of discussions with the British authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct to state that the National Board for Science and Technology budget for this year is cut by 11 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question. If the Deputy would put it down I would be happy to answer it and to explain the reasons for differences in the Vote between this year and last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Taoiseach's information, it is correct to state that there is a cut of 11 per cent.  Could I have an assurance from the Taoiseach that the NBST will not cut the financial support which they give to the shellfish research laboratory in Carna, County Galway by 11 per cent as a result of the cut in their budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it clear that the subvention will continue and in settling the amounts required by the NBST for their activities and for these activities which they will be continuing with this year I made it very clear that it is my expectation that the subvention to this laboratory would continue.  The NBST issued protective notices in December to staff in the laboratory.  There was no basis for that and I have indicated to them my concern that they should have taken an action of that kind before the Estimates were settled and in circumstances where there were no grounds to believe that there was any doubt about the continued employment of the people concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach assure the House that he will now inform the NBST that they are not to cut the financial support for the shellfish research laboratory now that they know what their estimate is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsequent to that I made the position clear to them.  There is no question about that and they have known for some time past of my concern in that regard.  It is the intention of the Government that the subvention should continue in 1982 at the level that it was at and the NBST are aware of the Government's concern in that regard.  We intend to see that that subvention continues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the figures readily to hand.  If I had I would be happy to give them.  The position is that the NBST grant-in-aid is on the basis that the current work level will be maintained into 1982.  The amount allocated, £90,000, is regarded as satisfactory and sufficient to continue work at the same level as in 1981.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If any difficulties arise about payments from the NBST to the laboratory which would interfere with the continuation of the work level into 1982, it would be a matter for my Department to take the necessary steps to ensure that the work continues and that finance is provided from the grant-in-aid.  The <Col N="11" /> Deputy need have no concern in that regard.  The matter has been dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the importance to industry of a continued programme of research and development I take it the Taoiseach is happy to assure the House that there will be no run-down of the NBST and no overall lack of commitment to such a programme?  There were disturbing stories recently about a weakening in this area.</P>

      <P>I have seen the report referred to by the Deputy.  Measures along the lines of those recommended in the report for the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises have already been implemented and continue to be developed by my Department and the State agencies for which I have responsibility. In particular I would refer the Deputy to (i) the IDA's small industries and enterprise development programmes; (ii) Shannon Development's small industry pilot project in the mid-west to devise and test new methods of promoting small indigenous industry; (iii) the establishment in Limerick of the innovation centre for small industry to develop and test new processes and products; (iv) the business advisory service of the Irish Productivity Centre, which provides a wide range of consultancy services for small firms; (v) the IDA's and SFADCo's programmes for the development of craft industries.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's first question relates to two export-oriented projects for which firm offers of grant assistance had, with Government approval, been made by the IDA.</P>
      <P>In one case, the promoters have since advised the IDA that because of trading difficulties in certain of their operations in Germany they had decided to defer, at least until early 1982, their plans for their Dundalk project.</P>
      <P>In the second case, I regret to say that the promoters indicated to the IDA that because the market prospects for the product had disimproved owing to the international recession it had decided not to proceed with the Dundalk project.</P>

Happily, the product of this particular factory is not particularly seriously hit by a recession.  It is a luxury type product that people buy anyway. Waterford Glass, for example, Cavan Crystal, Dublin Crystal and all the others are doing very nicely at the moment.  I do not think the recession has any influence whatsoever on this particular product.  In these circumstances, could the Minister not busy himself a little more to ensure that it is reopened.</P>

Following that inspection the council were informed that tenders should be invited for six areas and that a further examination should be made in other areas with a view to establishing the need for remedial works or monitoring, and to enable sketch schemes and estimates to be prepared where necessary. <Col N="30" /> I will be in touch with the council in regard to the financing of further works as soon as the proposals and estimates for these schemes are submitted.  The necessary finance will be provided for approved works.</P>
    <P>It is not evident at this stage that financial assistance from the EEC will be available towards the expenditure involved but this possibility will be further explored.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the minimum area that must be designated for public use as open space in urban housing developments; and if he is satisfied that local authorities <Col N="31" /> require developers to make such open space available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no statutory requirement as to the minimum amount of open space to be provided in housing developments.  The policy of planning authorities for the provision of open space is normally outlined in the development plan for their areas.</P>
      <P>As regards local authority housing, the amount of open space to be provided is decided by the authority.  A minimum provision of seven acres per 1,000 population, where playgrounds and open space are not already available in reasonable proximity to the scheme, has been recommended by my Department.  In regard to private housing estates, planning authorities have powers available to them under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 and 1976, to secure the provision of open space.  I have no reason to believe that planning authorities have found these powers to be inadequate or that they do not make appropriate use of them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy the steps he is taking to ensure the immediate reopening of Clondalkin Paper Mills which closed on Friday night last in view of the considerable loss of employment and the strategic loss of the country's last remaining white paper mill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret that, despite the considerable progress which had been made in the negotiations which were initiated by me on 8 December 1981, the proposals for a new company to operate the mill had broken down.</P>
      <P>Since last October, I personally, the Minister of State, and various State agencies have been in constant touch with the Clondalkin Group and the trade union group in an effort to solve the problems at the mill and secure their continued employment of the workers.  It is my understanding that the latest negotiations broke down on the question of the terms of a bonus scheme.  Both parties were willing to refer this matter to independent arbitration in the event of failure to reach agreement after a period of three months but agreement could not be reached on the terms of reference to the arbitrator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the failure of the recent negotiations the only possible solution in the matter is to have the assets acquired by another party with a view to continuing paper-making.  In collaboration with the liquidator the IDA are renewing their efforts to identify potential partners with a view to arranging a takeover.  In addition, I understand Fóir Teoranta would be willing to examine any proposals <Col N="36" /> involving new partners in a reconstituted company.

      <P>I very much regret, as do the board of the hospital, the disruption of services which has taken place as a result of this dispute.  I am as anxious as the Deputy that the dispute should be settled fairly and quickly.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, I hope, accept that my function in any dispute situation is to ensure that there are adequate procedures available fo facilitate its earliest possible settlement and to do all in my power to have these procedures fully used.</P>
      <P>I feel that it is important to make it very clear that both the board of the hospital and my Department have provided, right up to this day, every possible opportunity to the staff involved to demonstrate the validity of their claim.  A full hearing of the Labour Court was held in October last to examine the dispute.  In its recommendation, the court stated that it was not in a position to recommend any increase and noted that the workers concerned had &ldquo;declined to allow the Court to gather the information necessary to establish their claim that the work which they perform is more onerous than that performed by porters in other hospitals.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then, management have had a number of meetings with union representatives in an attempt to resolve the dispute. They have offered to make a lump sum payment in full and final settlement of the men's claim &mdash; the amount to be determined by an agreed arbitrator.  They have indicated that an immediate payment on account of £600 would be made to each porter pending receipt of the arbitrator's recommendation.  This has <Col N="40" /> been rejected by the union.  No progress was possible at a conciliation conference which was held in the Labour Court on 7 January and the meeting was adjourned.  I am glad to inform the Deputy that arrangements have now been made for a resumption of this conference on Thursday next, 28 January. Any further comment by me on the situation at this juncture would be inappropriate.</P>

      <P>Therefore, the Minister is fully aware of the importance of this hospital not only to the north side of the city but to Dublin generally in the sense that the hospital is a national neurosurgery centre.  I have had representations from many people around the country concerning extreme emergency cases which cannot be dealt with because of the dispute. The surgeons are doing everything in their power to deal with the situation but the accident and emergency services have been discontinued while the out-patients clinic is closed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this is a case in which there is the possibility of devising a formula to buy out the agreement.  The men in question have a benefit that is additional to that enjoyed by those in other hospitals but the central issue is the question of buying out this benefit in order to rationalise the system throughout the hospitals. It appears that there is much urgency about reaching agreement on a buying out price.  I trust that the Minister's resumed talks will lend to the situation a real sense of urgency, something which I am afraid has not been present since the talks broke down on 23 December.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. E. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of urgency, it is my function, as I said in reply to the question to ensure that the proper machinery is used.  I am following a precedent set by one of my predecessors, <Col N="41" /> the Leader of the Opposition, in the case of a similar strike in 1979.</P>
      <P>In so far as services at the hospital are concerned, I agree that the hospital is not fully operational.  On average there are only about 220 beds in use out of a total bed complement of 388.  All emergency cases are being admitted and some non-emergency cases where beds are available from within the number of beds being serviced.</P>
      <P>The hospital have withdrawn from the accident and emergency ambulance rota system but they are admitting head injury cases.  The casualty department at the hospital is open and patients are treated there, but only emergency cases are admitted to the hospital from the casualty department.</P>
      <P>The geriatric unit attached to the hospital has been closed and the patients have been transferred to another area of the hospital which is being serviced.  The geriatric unit is situated some distance from the main hospital buildings.</P>
      <P>The hospital have agreed to make some medical beds available to any of the other general hospitals in the north city area who have an overcrowding problem arising from an increased intake through their accident and emergency departments as the result of St Laurence's Hospital withdrawing from the accident and emergency rota scheme.</P>
      <P>I agree that there is a problem but up to now it has been contained in the main to reasonable proportions.  I am very hopeful regarding a satisfactory outcome of the situation.  My Department will do everything possible to ensure that the resumed conciliation talks at the Labour Court on Thursday will have a satisfactory outcome.  In the meantime we should leave the matter at that.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware of the proposed closure of Messrs.

      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being encountered by this firm.  They have already approached the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism with whom talks have been held.  Both the Department of Agriculture and the IDA have participated in those talks but since they have not yet got very far it would be premature to expect any conclusion from them.  So far as the remainder of the problem to which the Deputy refers is concerned, I am working on a proposal which I intend putting before the Commission of the EEC to secure an increase in the export refunds on boneless beef in order to allow a further improvement of the situation in the beef processing industry generally.  As the Deputy points out, that is a problem which has a direct bearing on the activities of the firm in question <Col N="43" /> since they are the largest meat and bone-meal plant in operation in the country.  In addition I shall be considering what further steps may be open to us in order to change the balance in our exports as between live cattle and processed meat. I intend in the very near future to talk to a major export customer of live cattle with a view to ascertaining if we can change the balance between live cattle and meat.  Again, that would be a further step in the operation to ensure that more of our cattle are processed at home, an aspiration shared by all of us.  This would help to avoid the kind of situation that has arisen in the case about which the Deputy is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Ceann Comhairle direct the Clerk of the Dáil to issue his Writ for the election of a member to fill the vacancy which has occurred in the membership of the present Dáil consequent on the death of Deputy Kieran Doherty, a member for the Constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Moore moved this previously, various arguments were advanced as to why it should not be passed by the House.  The Taoiseach said we had a very heavy legislative programme to get through.  He said that the only consideration which could apply must be the question of the legislative programme.  The Taoiseach also said that the changeover to tax credits instead of tax allowances in the income tax code was fundamental and that the implementation of that measure and of the associated payment of £9.60 to non-working housewives, he was advised by the Revenue Commissioners, could only be undertaken if legislation went through last session.  He said that if it were left to be put through after the budget it would not be implemented by the date set and announced at the first press conference after the election &mdash; the beginning of the income tax year next April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the reason given on the last occasion when I made an attempt to have the writ accepted by the House.  That whole tax package is now a matter of some mirth among not merely the Opposition Members but among members of the Coalition Government and cannot possibly be used as an argument now for refusing to face the electorate in Cavan-Monaghan. The Tánaiste has asked that the whole package should be looked at <Col N="95" /> again.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Desmond has also spoken about it.  Consequently, I do not think it is of any great importance any more.  The people who were supposed to have benefited most regard the whole matter with disdain, and the House should not be delayed by it. On the last occasion I indicated that the position of the constituency was of some importance, that it was a pivotal constituency, that three of the Six Counties bordered it and that it was a large constituency, I also indicated that the people in that constituency are very interested in the democratic process and that we had the highest valid poll there &mdash; 60,411 voters.  I also indicated that, apart from the constituency in which the Ceann Comhairle stood and was automatically re-elected, we had in that constituency the highest quota, 10,069.</P>
    <P>These are the people who are being deprived of the opportunity of expressing themselves through the ballot box.  They are very anxious to exercise their right to elect a Deputy to the vacancy that has occurred.  The Government should have gone before the people so that they could be judged by their first budget.  We did not succeed in doing that, but if the House accepts the motion now, we will have an opportunity of finding out what the people in Cavan-Monaghan think of the last budget and the one which will be announced tomorrow.  People are anxious to give their views on the handling of the economy by the Coalition Government. It would be a good thing if we had an end to what has been going on, where there are admissions of people making a mistake in their sums of £170 million and the Coalition Government treating the electorate as Pavlov treated his dogs.  The Taoiseach says one day he has found £170 million and the Minister for Finance comes back the following day telling us not to get into good humour, that euphoria is out and gloom is still around.</P>
    <P>The constituency is also anxious to have members of the Government operating there so that they can give an account of their stewardship with regard to the state of industry there.  We can say, <Col N="96" /> with great pleasure, that from 1977 to 1981 industry improved to the extent that there were 1,100 more people employed in the manufacturing industry in 1981 than there were in 1977.</P>
    <P>There are problems.  The Minister for Forestry and Fisheries will know about them.  The general secretary of the trade union concerned has been in touch with him as he has been with me.  We want to know what the Government will do about them.  We have a motion on the Order Paper at the moment indicating the concern of this party about what appears to be the economic withdrawal of this Government from the west of Ireland.  That is something we should also like to discuss and debate with the electorate of Cavan-Monaghan as the jury.</P>
    <P>At Question Time the Minister for Industry and Energy indicated that he does not know that there is a special definition of the west so far as economic and industrial development are concerned. I should like him to bone up on his own brief before he comes down to aid Fine Gael in that by-election.  I understand the Labour Party do not intend to put forward a candidate for it.</P>
    <P>As reported at volume 330, column 234 of the Official Report of 21 October Deputy Kemmy said:</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned the matter we are discussing can be left until the New Year.</P>
    <P>The new year is here and I want Deputy Kemmy to back his judgment of October with his vote in January.</P>
    <P>On occasion it is worthwhile to have a look at the procedures in other parliaments. This is a common enough practice. Judges refer to precedents in other countries, and so on.  One does not have to be an Englishman to know that the English are proud of what they call the mother of parliaments.  Not everybody would agree with that assessment of it and its activities, particularly with regard to subject countries.  It is worth looking at how they proceeded with regard to the vacancies in the constituency which is next door to my constituency, Fermanagh and South Tyrone.</P>

Deputy Doherty who was a Member of this House died on 4 August 1981.  I suggest to the Taoiseach, who is interested in constitutional and parliamentary reform, and always has been, that he should ponder on his right to deprive the people of an opportunity to express their views, in a by-election after such a long period, on the performance of the Government.  Is he saying the Taoiseach and the Government have a right to prevent the people from voting in a by-election and giving their views on the activities of the Government for an indefinite period?  I do not know.</P>
      <P>There is a possibility that the Taoiseach may announce that he has accepted the suggestion Deputy Loftus made when this matter was before the House on a previous occasion, namely, that the Government should concede the seat to Fianna Fáil.  It may very well be that the Taoiseach is about to announce that he is accepting that suggestion.  If not, the Government should accept the challenge for a fair joust in Cavan-Monaghan and find out what the people down there think about them.  They will get one hell of a surprise.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to follow Deputy Wilson's Pavlovian canine red herrings all the way.  I want to clarify one point lest there be any confusion or doubt about it with respect to the Finance (No. 3) Bill, 1981.  The advice given to us at the time when I spoke, to which Deputy Wilson referred, was that the Bill needed to be put through by Christmas. Subsequently we were advised, as I told the Dáil, that it was necessary that the <Col N="98" /> Bill should be published and that would be sufficient.  Deputy Wilson seems to feel that in some way the Bill is superflous. I should like to assure him that it is not.  It is in this Bill that the provisions related to family income supplements for low income groups, who were never previously aided by any Government measure, will be effected.  That Bill has to go through with other measures.  The Government oppose the moving of the writ at this time and propose to move it after the passage of the budgetary measures and the Finance Bills when Deputy Wilson's suggestion about Ministers being available in the constituency can be more readily fulfilled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Deputy Wilson's proposal that the by-election should be held right away.  As he pointed out, the people of Cavan-Monaghan feel a certain amount of frustration because they are not getting their rightful opportunity to pass judgment on the Government. Deputy Wilson dealt with the industrial side, and I should like to deal with the farming side.  This constituency is composed mainly of small farmers who would welcome an opportunity to pass judgment on the performance of the Government to date.</P>
      <P>They are concerned about the fact that the western package has not been implemented. They are concerned about the withdrawal of money from western development and from the western drainage schemes.  They are also concerned about the cutback in the farm modernisation programme.  They are concerned about the fact that the Government have not implemented their own policies particularly in relation to the calf subsidy which was promised by them before they took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very large constituency.  It is broadly representative of the people in the rest of the country.  A by-election there would give the Government an apportunity to see how the people react to their July budget and the budget to be presented tomorrow.  The Taoiseach has shown a great desire for changes in the Constitution, particularly in relation to Articles 2 and 3.  The fact that there is not <Col N="99" /> much interest in that matter in the consituency may be influencing the Taoiseach in some way.  Has he any desire to change Article 16 of the Constitution which governs membership of the Dáil? The spirit of that Article justifies holding a by-election at this time.</P>

      <P>Although Deputy <Col N="100" /> Haughey's intervention &mdash; and nobody can be sure it will be his last &mdash; took the form of questions, it was, of course, technically a speech.  I have to observe that it differs very markedly from the speech he made when a similar motion was before the House on the last occasion in October. On that occasion he assured the Government, and anyone else who cared to listen, that there would be no necessary conflict between holding the by-election and getting on with the Government's tough programme; because, for his part, he could guarantee that we would get all the co-operation necessary in order to enable this to be done.  That very handsome offer was not repeated this afternoon.  I think he was very well advised not to repeat it, because the degree of disingenuousness it contained on the last occasion was so highly visible that it would leave him with less credibility, if possible, than he has, were he to repeat it now.</P>
      <P>I want to tell the House briefly a couple of things about the holding of by-elections seen from the point of view of trying to organise Government business.  Perhaps we might have looked a little further than the British in constructing the form in which our parliament works.  Perhaps we might have looked to countries which I hope Deputies Haughey and Wilson would acknowledge are equally parliamentary democracies, but which do not regard it as necessary to go back to a particular constituency in order to fill a casual vacancy.  I do not offer any judgment on that now but we have that system for better or worse.  When we have a contest, it is asking too much of flesh and blood that the people most prominent in the contesting parties will not go out and take sides in it.  Although we all deplore the waste of time and of life and effort which goes into by-elections, that has been done since this State was founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is nonsensical to suggest that the business of the House can continue here at what one might call a normal tempo when a by-election is in progress.  If it were possible to scan, by something like an electrocardiogram or encephalograph, the debates of this House over the <Col N="101" /> last 60 years, one would find that the vibrations sank almost to a horizontal level at certain points.  If one were to plot against that graph the times when by-elections occurred one would find that those horizontal patches corresponded exactly.</P>
    <P>I can tell the House that a Government which is a lazy Government, which has no particular plans, which does not mind going out for three weeks, slogging it out &mdash; in the depths of winter, what is more &mdash; with the other side in any particular constituency, would have no problem about going out and fighting a by-election. But a Government who have a problem such as we have, namely, that we have a programme to get through, one made all the more necessary by the era of misgovernment which preceded us, realise that it simply cannot be done.</P>
    <P>I can recall by-elections held during the term of the Twentieth Dáil.  I can recall one in the constituency of Monaghan, another pair held on the same day in East and West Galway, another pair held in Dublin South-West and in North-East Donegal on the same day, and one in West Mayo also.  I think those were the six by-elections held during the term of the Twentieth Dáil and, on each occasion, the House was in session.  I then had the job Deputy Fergus O'Brien now has and essentially, the House's pulse &mdash; not through any fault of mine but simply because I could not put business through without a full House behind me &mdash; slowed almost to a stand-still. We had Estimate debate after Estimate debate.  Occasionally, when we could not and did not wish to avoid a Private Member's Motion, a vote had to take place on Wednesday evening and Deputies were whipped to come up.  A minimum amount of pairing only took place.  Perhaps there might have been one vote in the week.  As soon as that vote was over they scuttled off, paying perhaps a quick call on their constituencies, otherwise getting back to the scene of the conflict.</P>
    <P>It is not reasonable to accept that anything except a sort of free-wheeling debate &mdash; in which one can predict the time of the vote &mdash; can take place on a <Col N="102" /> Tuesday or on a Thursday, and perhaps even on a great part of Wednesday, in conditions like that.  That being said, I hope the House will see the point that, if there were no other element to be said for the point of view the Taoiseach has expressed, this one must carry very powerful conviction.</P>
    <P>I want to offer the House a much smaller and humbler argument in relation to the time of year.  I know we are all great democrats.  Perhaps we like to see ourselves cast in stone with a toga and a loving inscription on the plinth.  It may be that Members of this House will in due course so qualify.  Perhaps gems from Deputy Wilson's speech here this afternoon will be engraved on his plinth.  But let me put before the House the humble consideration that we are in the depths of one of the bitterest winters this country has had in 20 years.  We do not know when the weather is going to turn bad again.</P>

      <P>Evening begins, Sir, practically at 4 o'clock or 4.30 in the afternoon. And anybody over there who pretends that that is a matter of indifference to him is simply pretending.  I remember 1974 and 1975, before the temper of the House improved with the new sitting hours.  We were under fire here right through the end of June into July, and on one occasion into the first week in August.  The noises made in the House over here by the people now in opposition at the time were: &ldquo;We will sit here right through the recess; we will not bother with the recess at all; we will sit here until we have thrashed out this business properly and we will not submit to time allocation motions or anything else of that kind&rdquo;&mdash; that was the public face they presented in here &mdash; but that was not the face presented to me in the corridors outside or when I went up to talk to the Fianna Fáil Whips &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Then it was a case of: &ldquo;When in the name of God are you going to let us off?&rdquo; When I finally went up to the Fianna Fáil Whips and announced, in 1974 and 1975, that we had been reluctantly compelled to decide to put down time allocation motions, I did not see any long faces up there; no, there were smiles from ear to ear at the news that their hours were going to be cut short.  That was simply a question of their summer holidays, and they did not put it as anything more important than that; but it is a simple, human consideration.  I think this House must contain a lot of solemn asses if we are too solemn to admit that the time of year is also a consideration of some small human, and perhaps even other, importance in the context of a by-election.</P>

      <P>I should point out that I did not say that the by-election should be conceded to Fianna Fáil.  I said the by-election should go ahead and that Fianna Fáil or anyone else who wished to contest it should do so, that the Government should do the job they are elected to do, that is to govern.  I support this motion, contending that the Government should let it go ahead and that the Government do not have to contest it.  They were elected to govern.  However, ideally, we should all come together in a National Government, get this budget through and have a national consensus, then sort things out in perhaps two or three years' time.  We need a breathing space in terms of all that is happening, in terms of all the political parties and the political problems they have had to encounter since the general election.  Therefore I support the motion that we go ahead and hold the by-election.  I say still to the Government that their job is to get legislation through and govern the country.</P>

      <P>My first reaction to the Taoiseach's intervention was one of grave disappointment.  I think he treated <Col N="104" /> the whole matter in a cavalier fashion, did not seem to be regarding the matter as in any way important and, for that reason, he deserves the censure of the House.  It is a serious business.  It is considered so by great numbers of people and the democratic principle is an important one.  I regret very much &mdash; I shall not elaborate on it &mdash; that that was the Taoiseach's attitude.  If the Minister, Deputy Kelly, had had his toga on perhaps it might have induced some logic into his argument because I gather that he does think of the business of this House as being important.  What I should like to know is, how is the business of the House less important in May or June than it is in September or than it is in January?  If one were to follow his argument one would form the conclusion that there is a period in parliamentary business when the work is not as important as at other times and that the encephalograph he mentioned would show the horizontal waves in June.  What is the difference between horizontal waves in June and in January?  I cannot get the logic of it at all. I do not think that the Minister was serious in his contribution.</P>
      <P>I am asking the House to accept this motion.  The Members of this House who will be operating in the by-election will find a kindly, hospitable, shrewd people, people who will listen politely but who will form their own conclusions.  If I am to judge by my own assessment that conclusion will be that Senator Jimmy Leonard should return to this House.</P>
      <P>Another lack of consistency in the behaviour of the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism is that in September last he said the writ would be moved by the Government as soon as the Dáil resumed.  Obviously he has changed his mind on that and, perhaps with the aid of a good, strong vote in this House, he may change his mind on when this by-election should be held.</P>

    <P>(7)  That five members of the Joint Committee shall form a quorum of whom at least one shall be a member of Dáil Éireann and at least one shall be a member of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>The next step in the process of appointing the new Joint Committee has been reached.  This House is asked to approve a motion appointing a Select Committee, consisting of 18 Members of the Dáil, to be joined with a Select Committee appointed by the Seanad, to form the Joint Committee.  The Seanad has already passed a similar motion.</P>
    <P>When Ireland joined the European Economic Community, a new legal order was adopted, which now takes precedence over the national systems of law-making in the areas covered by the Treaties. The ability of the Community to enact laws in many important areas, meant a distinct limitation of the powers of the Oireachtas, and it was against this background that the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation was established, by expediency motions passed by both Houses in July 1973, the object being to allow the Oireachtas to influence Community legislation in those areas where the Houses had had to surrender their exclusive powers, and to supervise the implementation of such legislation in Ireland.  The Joint Committee is dissolved when the Dáil and Seanad are dissolved, and must be reconstituted by order passed by each House, after a general election.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the Joint Committee give the Committee authority to examine Community legislation at <Col N="112" /> three stages in the process of its adoption. It may examine legislation at the draft stage, it may examine Community Acts, and it may examine ministerial regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972, and instruments made under other statutes in order to implement our Community obligations.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the work of previous Joint Committees, all of which have done vast amounts of work with very little public recognition.  I should like to join, of course, to that a tribute to the staff who have been so helpful to the Joint Committees in the past.</P>
    <P>Much of the Community legislation is of a highly complex and technical nature, which makes the task even more demanding. The Joint Committee selects for examination, those draft Acts which they consider of particular importance to Ireland, and they examine all statutory instruments made to implement Community laws.  Reports, to the Houses of the Oireachtas, are then prepared. During the last session, 94 reports were prepared by the Joint Committee, nine of which were considered by the Seanad. Of these nine, two were also considered by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The subject of the Joint Committee was last raised in this House on 2 December 1981.  On that occasion the proposed terms of reference of the new Joint Committee were approved.  In addition to its mandate to examine Community legislation, the Joint Committee will further undertake the extremely important task of examining the relationship between the National Legislature, and the European Parliament.  This will encompass the examination of various suggestions about participation of our MEP's in the work of the Dáil and the Seanad, and their role as regards the Joint Committee itself, as well as the question of the so-called dual mandate.</P>
    <P>We must remember that although we have, at present, no Joint Committee, the flow of legislation from Brussels has not been halted.  It is, therefore, extremely important that the Joint Committee be reconstituted without further delay, in order that it may resume its <Col N="113" /> work and so I ask the House to give its approval to this motion.  Finally, I should like to welcome the new Opposition Spokesman on Foreign Affairs to his new post and wish him every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister of State for his good wishes and the welcome he has given to me in the new role I have undertaken.  I look forward to working with him and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Indeed, I have a lot of experience of working with the Minister of State because we faced each other on many issues over the years, not necessarily agreeing on everything, but on the basics we never really differed.</P>
      <P>With regard to the motion, the House is aware that Fianna Fáil support it.  The motion of expediency was discussed and passed by the House on 2 December last and for that reason I shall not repeat what my predecessor, Deputy Lehihan, said on that occasion.  However, as this is the first occasion I have had an opportunity to speak as Fianna Fáil spokesman on Foreign Affairs I should like to add a few words on the importance of the European Community to the work of the Dáil. Undoubtedly, this is one of the most important Committees that will be established in the lifetime of this Dáil and I feel obliged to remark that we have been a bit lax about getting it off the ground. The Dáil is now seven months in existence and I appreciate that as this is a Joint Committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas certain technicalities must be gone through, but because of the importance of the Joint Committee and the type of work it has to do, we should ensure in future that a seven-month period does not elapse before the Committee is established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of legislation, many directives, programmes and guidelines will have to be examined by the new Joint Committee. Since we joined the EEC we have had two Joint Committees and I understand that they always worked in arrears. I understand that some Members have expressed the view that it would be better if they could keep up to date with what is happening.  Members of the Joint Committee have also expressed the view that <Col N="114" /> if they were able to keep up to date they might be able to make a better input into the discussions.  I appreciate the view expressed by the Minister of State that even though the Joint Committee was not functioning the work of the EEC did not stop and matters that should be examined by such a Committee still flowed from the EEC.  I hope the Committee is established very soon and that the members get down to tackling the great problem that face them.  The legislation of the European Community impinges in many ways not only on the life of our citizens but also on our existing legislation.  It is important for us to examine the implications of the legislative proposals of the EEC when they are still at discussion stage.  I agree with the Minister of State when he stated that the former Joint Committees did valuable work.  Members of this House, and Senators, get an opportunity when on that Joint Committee to become more familiar with the work and procedures of the EEC.  It must be remembered that the EEC affects all Departments including the Department of Justice which I was responsible for up to last June.  I have every confidence that the members of the third Joint Committee will take their work seriously so that there will be no possibility of the Dáil or the Seanad being by-passed on any important EEC legislation.</P>
    <P>The additional function of the Joint Committee will be the resolution of the dual membership position.  As the Minister of State is aware Fianna Fáil have adopted a clear position on this issue and that position can now be seen to have been taken in the national interest.  In fact we may in 1979 have paid some price for our decision in that regard.  In the present parliamentary situation here Fianna Fáil members are the only Irish representatives south of the Border providing an effective presence in Europe. It is clear also that we will have to devise some system whereby the European members can retain their links with the Oireachtas.  There are a number of possibilities which can be adopted but I do not intend to go into them on this occasion. I believe that the terms of reference of the Joint Committee will ensure that <Col N="115" /> those possibilities are fully teased out and studied.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee will consist of 18 TDs and eight Senators and the position in relation to substitute Members is very sensible.  The Minister should tell the House how the membership of the Joint Committee is to be broken down between Government and Opposition.  It is important that we should know this.</P>
    <P>The matter of chairmanship was raised during the discussion on this expediency motion on December 2.  The Minister on that date gave an assurance that he would find out the Government's intentions with regard to the chairmanship and whether or not the precedent which had been established, of a Member of the Opposition being chairman of this committee, would be maintained.  It is important that this should be so.  I strongly urge the Minister and the Government to consider this step.  I thought that the Minister might have said something in that regard in his introductory remarks.  If that precedent were not being followed, I would, naturally, have had a lot more to say.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects of this committee will be to ensure that Members of the European Parliament forge exceptionally strong links between the European Parliament and Oireachtas Éireann.  In time, the dual mandate will go.  The Minister of State last December gave an indication to this effect.  I think I am quoting him reasonably accurately as saying that the probability was that the dual mandate would be phased out in the future.  If so, now is the time to establish exceptionally strong links between the Members of the European Parliament and Oireachtas Éireann.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the terms of reference for the establishment of this committee provide for the presence of MEPs at meetings and participation in discussions, but without a vote.  Suggestions have been made regarding the possibility of giving MEPs a right of audience in this House, which is a big question.  I gather that there are constitutional difficulties to be examined there and I do not know if these could be overcome.  If the committee examine this matter we shall <Col N="116" /> be able to see where we might progress from there.</P>
    <P>As soon as this motion is approved in this House &mdash; it has, I gather, already been approved by the Seanad &mdash; we should take immediate steps to get this committee off the ground.  They have a monumental task in front of them in studying guidelines, directives, draft legislation and so forth.  I urge the Minister to treat this matter as of great importance.</P>
    <P>The committee would probably work more effectively, and feel that they were doing so, if they could study the draft legislation, rather than legislation which has been enacted.  There is permission for this.  If we are to make suggestions along the way on matters which affect us as a community, this would be better done before the legislation is enacted.  Any help or assistance which my party can give to the Government parties in seeing that this committee will be a success will assuredly be given.</P>

      <P>Firstly, I agree with everything which Deputy Collins has said and add my words of tribute to the tremendous work which has been done by the membership of this committee in the past.  When I say what I have to say afterwards, I hope that it will not be taken as criticism of the membership since 1973.  The emphasis, even in the Minister's speech &mdash; for which there may be some technical or legal reason &mdash; is on the examination by the committee of Community Acts, ministerial regulations and so forth and there is not sufficient evidence of support for examination by the committee of opinions of the Council of Ministers on various proposals by the Commission, which may or may not at a future date lead to Community legislation. One often finds that these are even more important items than Community legislation for discussion by this committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This committee have not met since May 1981 and the amount of legislation which has come from the community since then is enormous.  Their task is daunting in the weeks and months ahead, in expressing opinions on legislation.  The <Col N="117" /> point made by Deputy Collins is very relevant.  We will now be setting up a committee to examine what, in the main, will be legislation which is already approved and in operation.  Only now is the opinion of this House being expressed.  This committee is taking over the function of this House in regard to that legislation.  We must look for ways and means of streamlining that process. The support given by Deputy Collins from this side of the House is there.  We would like the committee of selection to meet, possibly this week, once this motion is agreed &mdash; and we will not oppose it today.  The Minister of State is mentioning this Thursday, which is good. It is important that the committee fully formed should have their first committee meeting next week.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay procedure, but want to say a few words on agriculture. The most important factor which encouraged Ireland's entry into the Community was the existence of the now well-known common agricultural policy.  Many things happen under the common agricultural policy each year which may or may not require Community legislation, directives, decisions and so forth.  From what I know of this committee and its operation, nothing like sufficient time has been spent in examining those proposals.  I think I am right in saying that the only occasion when such discussions took place were the discussions on the 1976-77 and 1980-81 price proposals submitted to the Council of Ministers.  From my experience as a Minister in the negotiations in Brussels and &mdash; which is the most important area for our economy &mdash; discussions under the common agricultural sector during the course of each year and particularly at its beginning when the price proposals are published, there is not sufficient examination of these by this House, through its committee.</P>
    <P>It is important to set up the procedures to enable that to take place.  There will be the odd debate, discussion or question in the Dáil, but the in-depth examination which can and does go on with the excellent membership of this committee and its back-up services should be used more extensively in the <Col N="118" /> future as compared with the past, for examination of the various important proposals coming from the Community regarding our agricultural sector.  I make that point and hope that the Minister will take it up and that we will have, through the committee, the various examinations and reports, relating to the measures proposed by the Commission or the Council of Ministers, particularly those at the beginning of the year which govern the operation of the common agricultural policy during the course of the following year.  I understand that these proposals will be published this week and would like to see the committee examining and giving an opinion on them.</P>
    <P>Discussion has been going on since June of last year regarding the mandate for the reform of the Community budget which, in essence, means reform of expenditure under the common agricultural policy.  As I said, the most important factor for us in joining the Community was the existence of the common agricultural policy.  I would hope that this committee, by its reports to the House, would enable this House discuss these matters further.  Ministers in Government will be glad of the informed opinions of representatives of this House, through this committee, when they go to negotiate on our behalf.</P>
    <P>One of the most important questions raised since we joined the Community is the suggestion of curtailing or fixing a limit on agricultural expenditure.  That is undermining the fundamental principles of the common agricultural policy.  It is something that this committee will have to look into and very seriously consider because that, in essence, is a renegotiation from the Community side of the terms of agreement when we joined in 1973.  That is very serious for this country. There is already the experience of the UK government who are negotiating their membership of the Community for the third time.  Greece, who joined this time last year, are now talking about a renegotiation of their terms of membership of the Community.  At the same time, adverse proposals are emanating from the Commission with the support of <Col N="119" /> a substantial number of the Council of Ministers, eight or nine of the ten countries supporting recommendations by the Commission which are detrimental to the Irish economy and particularly to the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>I just wanted to make these few points to the Minister and to the Government and to ask them to assist this Committee in this work in whatever way they can, to ensure that these very important matters are discused in advance of any major decisions being made on them in the Community.  The Minister rightly talked about regulations and legislation, decisions and opinions.  Opinions are very important, particularly the opinions of the Council of Ministers on points proposed by the Commission.  Long in advance of these matters being discussed at Council meetings, our committee is going to have to look at them and give their opinion, their concensus view, in so far as it represents this House and the people, to ensure that the Minister is expressing the wishes of the people of Ireland in relation to the decisions being made by him and is also reinforcing the case he is about to make on behalf of the Irish community in any decisions that are being made in Brussels.</P>
    <P>I would like to think those viewpoints are relevant.  I know they are important. I hope that they are acted upon and that the Minister will make whatever staffing and back-up services are required for this very important work available to this committee.  I do not intend to be in any way critical of the membership of this committee in the past.  They have done tremendous work.  It is very difficult work and very important work and much of it very rarely sees the light of day.  But in the areas where we are fundamentally affected by decisions of the Community, particularly in the agricultural area, and not necessarily just agricultural legislation and decisions and regulations but in relation to opinions and suggestions that are being put forward by the Commission or even a member state, the Government will be anxious to have the back-up of this committee to reinforce their hand when it comes to negotiating these <Col N="120" /> points.  I would like to see a greater emphasis in the future by this committee on that aspect of the Community work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>First I would like to welcome the initiative setting up the select committee.  The work is important and it is onerous.  I would emphasise what Deputy Collins and Deputy MacSharry said about the provision for the committee of all the facilities they need to do their work properly.  Sometimes the work is very worthwhile and the hardship is great and very little public recognition is given for that kind of work.  This does not encourage people who regard it as a patriotic duty to give of their time and energy to committees such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to speak briefly on the educational aspect.  Unfortunately, up to now the select committee has not had very much work to do with regard to education in the European Economic Committee. This is something about which I feel very strongly because the founding fathers, the original promoters of the idea of a European Economic Community, stresssed very strongly the fact that the countries that were to be united in this Community share the same philosophic heritage, the Greco-Roman-Hebraic philosophies and that Europe was cemented together through sharing those philosophic origins.  Years and years of propaganda went into establishing this thesis and it is a matter of some regret that since the Community was established there has been a tendency to ignore that aspect and to emphasise more and more the economic aspects.  Many of the Commissioners and Ministers over the years have been aware of this problem. I do not know whether this is sustained or not but there has been an effort to call this the European Community rather than the European Economic Community.  Still, &ldquo;EEC&rdquo; is what mostly appears in documents although for a while at least &ldquo;EC&rdquo; or &ldquo;European Community&rdquo; were the terms used.  I know that we cannot be too much up in the air; we cannot divorce ourselves from the reality of the economics of the Community.  But a good deal of the trouble that has developed in the Community, the long sessions, <Col N="121" /> the wrangling about <i>juste retort</i>, the refusal to make subscriptions in accordance with the rules, which we had from Great Britain, the attempt to break down the common agricultural policy which is the only really successful policy since the Community was established, springs to a certain extent from too much pragmatism and too little consciousness of what motivated the original thinkers in the European Economic Community who, after all, were still carrying the trau-mata of a savage war.  When there were only six members, all the propaganda thrust was to emphasise shared roots in Europe.  Nowadays we do not hear anything about that.  Everyone is watching his own patch and seeing what he can get out of the Community.</P>
    <P>As far as education is concerned there is a serious problem because some of the members of the enlarged Community do not feel they have justification from the Treaty of Rome for any educational advance.  The Danes in particular have been stressing this and I can see their problems.  They have had people elected to the European parliament who are anti-EEC. Perhaps it would be better not to go into any detail about countries, but the Danes have a very special problem with regard to participating in any Council of Ministers of Education.  To a certain extent the French had also.  I know that Monsieur Beulac, when he was Minister for Education, was very anxious to make some advance in education in a European context but he was circumscribed by various circumstances.  I do not know what the situation is with the new administration in France but it is something that we should emphasise.  In addressing the Council of Ministers on one occasion I mentioned that one of the major problems is ignorance of the institutions, ignorance of the respective civilisations of the various countries that make up the EEC.  Many of the Ministers agreed with me on this.</P>
    <P>I had a proposal that there would be available at post primary school level a Euro livre which would cover a wide range of history, cultural history and economic history, perhaps in the format of Keesing's contempory archives where the <Col N="122" /> economic pages could be extracted year after year and up to date ones inserted. I got backing for this idea particularly from France.  The British gave qualified backing.  It is left to the staff of the different schools there to choose what is studied.  If such a book were made available in a number of languages not only would it help in the learning of languages but it would also help to attack the basic defect, and that is ignorance of the Community and apathy towards it.</P>
    <P>Unless things change this committee will not have a lot to do with education because there are so many inhibitions to educational advancement and development. In the Treaty of Rome there is written down the right of establishment, for citizens in the Community.  It is logical to argue that, if there is the right of establishment, education should play a big part in preparing the citizens of one country to establish themselves in another.  There are other problems about equivalence of qualifications and so on about which the Community have been conscious for some time.  The matter has been studied.  There are problems with professional bodies.  It is logical that, since there is a right of establishment, there is also a right to equip citizens for establishing themselves in the various countries of the Community.</P>
    <P>It is important that education was allocated to the Social Affairs Commission. Commissioner Burke had responsibility for it for a brief period at the end of his time as commissioner.  It is properly placed, seeing that there are serious problems of youth unemployment and of equipping young people for work after they leave school.  Being under the ferula of the Commissioner for Social Affairs, education may have a chance to advance.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the European Parliament.  I know the Parliament are conscious of the need for educational development in the EEC.  Members of the House have received a resolution from the Parliament indicating their concern about some of the points I have made.  The resolution is cast in the kind of legalistic formula which Europeans seem to love.  It is very long but, if one gets at the substance of it, it is that they <Col N="123" /> want an advance on the educational front.  Neglect of the philosophical area has caused some of the problems.  I am not so foolish as to believe that economics are not very important and that each country must watch its caulk, to borrow a shipping metaphor.  I do not believe policies such as the CAP will be able to survive if they are assessed on this principle alone.  Those are not the principles on which the EEC set out.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of the Ministers for Education meeting within the Council last June were mainly concerned with the problems of employment and equipping young people for employment.  Perhaps this is not the place to expand on this area, which is one of great disappointment to me.  It is my hope that this committee will have something before it, either in draft form or otherwise, affecting education and developing it in a Community context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contribution and the support given to the establishment of the committee.  Deputy Collins rightly referred to the rather complex procedure involved in setting up such a committee and the delays consequent thereon.  I am glad to confirm that this is the last stage and that the committee can now get to work straight away.  The point he raised about procedure should be looked at by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges as to whether the procedure could be simplified.  particularly where there is unanimous support on all sides for such a committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the functions of the committee is not a matter with which I dealt in great detail.  This matter was before the House last month.  I accept that an important aspect of the committee's work will be the question of considering the relationship between MEPs and the Oireachtas.  I referred to three or four options which might be considered. There may be others from the committee. The question of numbers was raised and the situation agreed between the parties is on the following lines: Fianna Fáil, eight TDs and three Senators; Fine Gael, <Col N="124" /> seven TDs and three Senators; Labour two TDs and one Senator; Independents, one TD and one Senator.  I understand that has been agreed and it is a matter for the Committee of Selection to nominate people as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>When the matter was before the House last month I undertook to recommend to the Government that tradition should be followed in regard to chairmanship of the committee.  It will be a matter for the committee to elect its own chairman but I have reason to believe that my recommendation will have the result that all members will be inclined to follow precedent.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacSharry referred to the importance of Opinions of the Council of Ministers.  Under their terms of reference, the committee have power to examine <i>inter-alia</i> Opinions of the council.  The Deputy highlighted the importance of agriculture and pleaded that more time should be spent on dealing with agricultural problems.  This is a matter for the committee.  It will be up to the members to organise their work rota but I agree that agriculture is of such tremendous importance to us that it would be proper for the committee to spend a good proportion of their time in dealing with it.</P>
    <P>This is all the more relevant when one considers the 30 May mandate, perhaps one of the most serious European problems we have faced &mdash; I believe the most serious &mdash; since we joined the EEC.  The pressures that exist now in regard to the CAP are such that it behoves us all to stand together on this issue.  The only point I make here is that I do not see any politics, as it were, in this area.  Every Member of this House and all parties are fairly and irrevocably committed to standing behind the CAP.  It is clearly in the interest of this country; it is clearly one of of the main inducements which caused this country to vote so over-whelmingly to join the EEC.  It would be appropriate that the committee should have an informed opinion on this issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson has, as one would expect, highlighted the educational aspects and the importance of that sector. I have to agree with him that the original European ideal is at this stage somewhat <Col N="125" /> lost in the financial matters and when one hears talk about <i>juste retour</i> money it runs contrary to the original European spirit.  One point I make to Deputy Wilson is that in the area of foreign affairs, for which I have special responsibility for development co-operation, I would always regard development education as very important.  By way of analogy I would feel, arising from what Deputy Wilson had to say that there probably is not enough European education, as it were, and people are not completely aware of what is happening there, and because of that lack of awareness support for the European ideal and the European institutions is probably diminishing.</P>
    <P>Lastly, the point made by the Opposition about the work of the members of this committee being unrecognised is worth making and recording because their meetings normally are held without publicity of any description.  The work involved is very complex and at times quite tedious and I am sure most members of the public and, indeed, possibly certain people whose suggestion is that they do no work at all are hardly aware of the existence of the committee and the work they are doing.  Therefore, it is important that they be recognised here.</P>

    <P>(6)  That 5 members of the Joint Committee shall form a quorum of whom at least 1 shall be a member of Dáil Éireann and at least 1 shall be a member of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House is the second stage in the procedure to establish a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas on Co-operation with Developing Countries. The first stage was completed last December when a similar motion of expediency was passed by the Seanad. The Committee is to consist of 18 members of the Oireachtas, 11 members of the Dáil and seven members of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>This Government have a clear and unequivocal commitment to increasing Ireland's contribution to Developing Countries through Official Development Assistance (ODA).  The 1981 ODA allocation represented 0.18 per cent of our GNP.  The joint programme agreed between the two parties in the Government includes a specific commitment to increase Ireland's ODA by annual increments of at least 0.05 per cent of GNP so that the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP can be achieved by the end of the decade.  Despite the enormous pressure on the public finances which we are experiencing at present, the Government are fulfilling this commitment.  The total provision for ODA in 1982 is £26.335 million representing 0.23 per cent of GNP.  This figure involves an increase of over 46 per cent over the 1981 allocation and the provision of this sum in 1982 ensures that the Government commitment is met in full.  This is a substantial increase in real terms and will result in a significant expansion of our multi-lateral and bilateral assistance to developing countries.</P>
    <P>This assistance is given partly because of obligations arising out of our membership of various international organisations <Col N="129" /> but largely because of a conviction that we, who are relatively prosperous, have a moral responsibility to contribute our share to help those who are less well off than ourselves.  We do not seek any return from this work for ourselves and yet the term `development co-operation' indicates that it is a two-way process.  In return for our assistance to developing countries, we gain the friendship and respect of these peoples, a great deal of new experience and a degree of satisfaction at seeing the skills and expertise, which we have gained in the course of our own development, being used for the benefit of others.</P>
    <P>There are, in addition, more tangible benefits in the form of contracts in developing countries financed by multilateral aid organisations and greater trading possibilities with these countries.  We do not reject these spin-off benefits although they are certainly not the prime motivation of our development assistance efforts.  Neither do we construct our aid programmes simply to attract these benefits. However, we recognise that development co-operation is not a one-way transfer of resources from Ireland to developing countries but a co-operative process in which both sides can benefit. For example, in 1981, semi-State bodies alone earned around £28 million from projects in developing countries which was far in excess of total ODA, both multilateral and bilateral, for that year. I hope that the joint committee will recognise and reaffirm the propriety and the importance of these benefits for this country.</P>
    <P>In looking at our ODA the joint committee will no doubt wish to include our participation in the European Community's development assistance programmes. Our contribution to these programmes in now the single largest element of our Official Development Assistance.  In 1981, the Community's total aid to developing countries amounted to more than £1 billion of which Ireland's contribution was approximately £6.4 million.</P>
    <P>The second largest element in our ODA, and the one that receives perhaps the most attention, is our bilateral aid <Col N="130" /> programme.  This was established in 1974, arising out of a recognition by the Government of the moral responsibility I spoke of earlier, that despite the economic and social problems that existed in this country, Ireland was still one of the wealthiest nations in the world and as such had an obligation to make some contribution to those who were immeasurably poorer and less developed than ourselves.</P>
    <P>Total expenditure on the Bilateral Aid Programme last year amounted to £5.12 million.  A further £1.42 million was allocated to other areas of bilateral assistance including the Agency for Personal Service Overseas and Disaster Relief.</P>
    <P>The Bilateral Aid Programme is concentrated on four `priority' countries in Africa&mdash;Lesotho, Tanzania, Zambia and Sudan&mdash;which between them receive more than 60 per cent of total expenditure. Concentrating our assistance in this way allows us to obtain the maximum effectiveness from our aid by building up coherent programmes with the full support and participation of the host countries. This policy also enables the public at home to see the results of our efforts and helps to secure the necessary public support and encouragement for the programme.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister of State I have had an opportunity to visit three of the four priority countries, Lesotho, Tanzania and Zambia.  My most enduring memory of these visits is of the enormous disparity that exists between the living standards in these countries and in Ireland, despite the very real economic and social problems we have here in this country.  It is difficult to describe adequately the terrible extent of poverty, disease and the lack of all sorts of services that we take for granted, such as education, health and social services.  An indication of the huge gulf that exists between Ireland and these developing countries may be gained from looking at the figures for GNP <i>per capita</i> published by the World Bank.  In 1979, GNP per head in Tanzania was US$260.  In Ireland in the same year, the figure was US$4,210 &mdash; sixteen times greater.</P>
    <P>Most of the projects in our priority <Col N="131" /> countries are technical assistance ones, involving mainly the provision of specialist skills accompanied in some cases by small amounts of capital aid.  This sort of assistance is particularly suitable for a small country such as Ireland which can never hope to be a major donor of capital aid.  In the course of our own development, however, we have gained important skills and expertise which are directly relevant to developing countries, many of which are facing the sort of problems we faced in this country not so very long ago.</P>
    <P>The Bilateral Aid Programme also includes a substantial degree of support for the activities of the voluntary organisations engaged in overseas development. Last year almost £½ million was allocated to the co-financing projects with these organisations and this year the provision will be more than doubled to £1 million.  I am very conscious that these organisations are the very bedrock of our development co-operation efforts.  Long before our official development assistance was instituted, Irish missionaries and lay volunteers were travelling to developing countries in their thousands. Whether their motives were developmental or pastoral, these people have had an enormous impact on the people they have assisted.  They have provided leadership, education, training, support and, above all, motivation.  How many villages in Africa, Asia and Latin America learned the rudiments of agriculture, health and education from an Irishman or woman.  We owe a great debt of gratitude to these people for the inspiration they have given us and the example they have set us.</P>
    <P>I believe very strongly that our official aid programmes must not in any way seek to supplant or replace the efforts of the voluntary organisations but on the contrary should try to complement and reinforce them.  In addition to increasing the budget for co-financing projects with the voluntary organisations, I will be looking at other ways in which we can co-operate with them and I would hope that the joint committee would consider this question also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="132" /> Development co-operation is not just about programmes but about policies as well: policies that cover a wide range of areas which touch on virtually every aspect of life in this country, including food production, energy, commodities, trade, industrialisation, and finance.  The European Community has repeatedly emphasised that co-operation between developed and developing countries and the intensification of international economic relations serve the interests of all countries.  In an interdependent world, it is not simply a matter of increasing the flow of aid funds to developing countries; it is much more a question of integrating them as rapidly and as fully as possible into the global economic structure.  Many of these issues have far-reaching implications for our own domestic, economic and social policies that must be faced up to.  There are no easy solutions and, indeed, in some cases it is not entirely clear what the real problems are.  If we have learned anything from the Brandt Report it is that the problems of developing countries are also our problems and if we are to look forward to a world of peace and prosperity for all countries and peoples, solutions to these problems must be found before it is too late.</P>
    <P>We have had over seven years of almost continuous dialogue and negotiations between developed and developing countries and the solutions may seem as far away as ever.  No one can deny that the results of the so-called North-South Dialogue have been meagre and disappointing for the most part.  But this need not inhibit some optimism regarding the future.  The search for a new method of approach in the dialogue will hopefully lead to a fresh beginning this year.  Many Deputies will know that a proposal to start a round of global negotiations on international economic co-operation within the United Nations system was made two years ago.  These would cover all of the major issues in the fields of food, commodities, trade, energy, industrialisation, and financial matters.</P>
    <P>Ireland, along with the other members of the European Community, has been very active in the preparations for the global negotiations at the United Nations <Col N="133" /> and we are hopeful that they will get under way this year.  In the present world economic situation there can be no alternative to a process of negotiations dealing with the vast range of practical problems facing both developed and developing countries.  Neither side can hope to solve these problems on its own; only the joint efforts of both sides can ensure steady progress in all areas covering issues which affect the future of all countries.  The Brandt Report, in its endorsement of the proposal of global negotiations last year, noted that the basis for these negotiations was inter-dependence and mutuality of interests.  North-South co-operation is not a one-way street.  It vitally affects our future too, not perhaps in the same life or death way as for many countries in Asia and Africa, but in a longer-term perspective.  That is why the global negotiations we seek must be designed to tackle both immediate problems and long-term structural changes, which can place the global economy on a safer and sounder basis.  I do not have the time to look at each of the main areas which will be covered by the global negotiations &mdash; obviously trade and energy are of particular interest to us &mdash; but I would like to speak briefly of another vitally important area, especially for many developing countries.</P>
    <P>Food will, I am sure, be a subject of very pressing interest to the joint committee. The Irish are now in general one of the best fed peoples on earth but it was not always so.  Memories of the Great Famine are still very much alive in our folk memory.  But even that tragedy, terrible as it was, pales in comparison with the poverty that exists in the developing regions of the world at the present time. It is estimated that 750 million people are living in absolute poverty and a further 420 million people do not have their basic minimum food requirement each day. The generous response of the public to voluntary bodies engaged in development activities is, I suspect, particularly remarkable in the case of those activities which attempt to alleviate hunger and to tackle its underlying causes.  Given this feeling of solidarity with hungry peoples, it is entirely appropriate that our bilateral <Col N="134" /> aid programme should give priority to food production projects and that foodrelated measures should account for a hefty share of the multilateral commitments which Ireland has undertaken.  The scale and complexity of the problem of world hunger have elicited a whole range of responses and proposed responses. Despite the very different standpoints from which they approach the problem, the participants at the Cancun Summit managed to reach a greater measure of agreement on how to tackle this most critical problem than they did on other matters.  It is my earnest hope that the measure of agreement reached at Cancun can be translated into prompt and effective international action against hunger.</P>
    <P>The proposed terms of reference of the joint committee are set out in the motion before the House.  They provide for consideration by the committee of all aspects of Ireland's relations with developing countries in the field of development co-operation, including the Government's official development assistance programme. I have deliberately made the terms of reference as wide as possible so as not to limit the committee's field of study.  I did give consideration to making the terms of reference more specific but I felt that it would be wrong to constrain or delimit the committee's brief in any way.  The field is a very broad one with many complex and interlinking elements and I believe it is necessary that the committee should be free to choose the area they wish to consider and the order in which to consider them.</P>
    <P>I have also considered the possibility of enabling Members of either House, including Members of the European Parliament who are not also members of the committee, to take part in the proceedings. This point was raised during the debate on the Motion of Expediency in the Seanad.  Deputies will be aware that Standing Orders provide for the attendance at meetings of joint committees by any visitor unless they are specifically excluded by the committee.  These members would not have the right to vote but could contribute to discussions with the committee's agreement.  Consequently, there is no necessity to make specific <Col N="135" /> provision for this in the terms of reference of the committee.  Given the pressure of work on Deputies and Senators, the number of members provided for in the terms of reference is, in my view, a realistic estimate of the number of members that will be able to contribute actively and regularly to the committee's work.  However, I would hope that as the committee progress, more and more Members from both Houses will take part in its deliberations.  If this happens, I will be happy to consider increasing the size of the committee at a later stage.</P>
    <P>One of the areas in which I believe the committee will have an important contribution to make is development education. This is an area of great personal interest to me because I am convinced that it is only through increasing the level of awareness in Ireland of developing countries and the problems they face that the necessary support for and commitment to solving these problems will be generated.  We must also consider the impact of developing countries' problems on Ireland.  Many of these problems &mdash; for example, industrial re-structuring &mdash; have implications for the developed world which we in Ireland must face up to.  We must recognise that in the long term it is as much in our interest to solve these problems as it is in the interest of developing countries.  We must also recognise the vast and increasing degree of interdependence that exists between the developed and developing worlds. This need not be a source of fear or suspicion to us but rather a challenge to seek solutions to the problems of developing countries in a way that strengthens and reinforces our own prosperity.</P>
    <P>The joint committee will have an important role to play in the development education process by focusing attention on these questions and giving a positive lead to public opinion.  I believe that this lead will be followed and that the joint committee will have a positive and beneficial influence on the formation of public attitudes to developing countries.  In this way the necessary support for Ireland's contribution to those countries will be increased.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="136" /> This joint committee is somewhat different to others in that they are not being asked to study a specific area at a specific time.  They are asked to study the entire field of Ireland's relations with developing countries in the field of development co-operation on a continuous basis and in this way to contribute to the formulation of Government policies in this area. Ireland already enjoys a high reputation with developing countries and the committee begin their work, therefore, at an auspicious time.  It is my hope that the joint committee will help the Government to build on this foundation and, in co-operation with all the organisations in Ireland engaged in development, to fashion an even greater and more durable contribution by Ireland to developing countries for the benefit of all our peoples.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the setting up of the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries.  The development co-operation budget is increasing in size and importance and it is necessary that there should be increased Dáil scrutiny of expenditure which is taking place in countries far removed from us.  I believe it is in order for me to congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State for maintaining a substantial increase in the development co-operation budget.  His predecessor as Minister, Deputy Lenihan, obtained an increase of 30 per cent and the Minister has now obtained an increase of 37 per cent at a time when inflation is running higher.  I would not want the House or the country to be given a misleading impression that the budgetary commitment by Fianna Fáil to development co-operation was any less than this Government's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some dispute appears to have arisen as to whether the amount allocated is in line with the .05 per cent increase required to bring our aid, as pledged by the Government, to .7 per cent of GNP by the end of the decade.  My preliminary calculations show that the increase in the international co-operation Vote &mdash; I appreciate that moneys also appeared under other headings &mdash; would provide an <Col N="137" /> increase very much less than the .05 per cent of GNP.  Therefore, I warmly welcome the intention of the Minister to give full details to the House of how those figures are calculated.  It is important that he should give us not only the total break-down of our aid contribution under all headings but also the figures for GNP in 1981 and 1982 which underlie the Government's claim, bearing in mind that the increase in nominal GNP is likely to be over 20 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>I believe it would be a mistake to create a false sense of euphoria or a feeling of virtuousness that would not be based on facts.  The bilateral aid budget, in particular, will have to be increased substantially in 1981 and in 1982.  The increase this year will be 55 per cent or 29 per cent in real terms against an increase in the 1981 outturn over 1980 of 47 per cent. The budget has thus grown in three years from £3½ million to nearly £8 million for which both Governments can truly share credit.  As we are now talking about large sums of money being administered outside public view in distant countries it is very desirable that programmes would be subjected to full Dáil scrutiny.  We have to remind ourselves that the purpose of development co-operation is not to salve the conscience of the rich but to assuage the basic needs of the poor.  What counts, therefore, more than the absolute size of the money we devote to this purpose is the need to ensure that the money is making a real and worthwhile impact.</P>
    <P>A better understanding is needed of the function of development co-operation that accords with our interests as well as our ideas.  Bilateral aid makes use of Irish resources, both human and material. Most of the developing world is too poor to pay for our goods.  If their standards of living could be raised, thus stimulating demand for manufactured goods, this would increase world trade, which would be of benefit to us as an exporting nation.</P>
    <P>Since the Second World War there have been many ambitious development projects that have failed because they were ill-thought out and badly executed. There are others that have served only to enrich small and corrupt élites.  These are <Col N="138" /> the dangers which could face us with an expanding aid programme.  This committee, which we welcome, will not be able to ignore the wider political aspects and implications of the aid programme although their main focus must be humanitarian.  I would not wish to conclude this contribution without repeating a tribute that has been paid to the voluntary agencies many times in this House.  I have no doubt that the representatives of these agencies will be of vital assistance to the deliberations of the committee in the months and years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Collins has just stated, this side of the House welcomes this motion because it will, I hope, lead to a situation of greater understanding on the part of all Deputies of the needs, requirements and aims of development co-operation.  It is important that this particular matter, above all else, should be taken out of the arena of point scoring and that we should look on it as a matter to be approached in a long-term manner, fit in our targets with what has been agreed with regard to the percentage of the GNP within the global negotiations under United Nations auspices and decide, whatever Government are here, that we will try to achieve the targets we commit ourselves to internationally and that we go about it in an informed and responsible way and that Deputies on all sides of the House play their part in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to emphasise one point which the Minister of State and Deputy Collins have emphasised, that development co-operation is co-operation between the giver and the recipient in the overall development of the donee country which benefits the donor country and also the world at large.  This was the main thrust of the Brandt Report on North-South co-operation.  This whole matter is of such great importance that it could not be isolated into simply a matter of one country giving money for aid to another. Unless the countries of the developed world contribute to a substantial extent in the building up of the developing world, the Third World as we call it, then <Col N="139" /> the world as a whole will be faced with serious social economic and financial disturbances on a global basis.  It is in the overall strategic interests of the world as a whole, particularly the developed part of the world, to ensure that there is a real transfer of resources to the less well-off countries of the world.</P>
    <P>Development co-operation is a very relevant and meaningful phrase in the sense that the co-operation ensures that the development of the whole world is involved here and that giving aid in this manner, by direct grants or loans, multilaterally or bilaterally, has a very real purpose.  There is one figure I would like to quote from the Minister's speech which bears out this point, that it is not just a one-way transfer but a two-way transfer of resources.  The Minister of State said that in 1981 semi-State bodies alone in the country earned around £28 million from projects in developing countries which was far in excess of total ODA, both multilateral and bilateral, for that year.  The actual State companies in material terms, by reason of their activities and initiatives for the benefit of developing countries, as well as bringing benefit to those countries, earned money in the region of £28 million, far in excess of the total ODA budget.  I gave that figure to emphasise the point I wanted to make.  We are talking here about interest under two headings &mdash; usual annual interest and interest in regard to the world at large, ensuring that we do not have the disparities in different parts of the globe which lead to revolutions and other social disorders.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement in this House on a question raised recently by the President of the World Bank.  It concerns some of the definitions in regard to the North and South of the globe, definitions in the Brandt Report and definitions of what is usually regarded as Third World and non-Third World, which may need to de redefined.  The energy situation in recent years tilted the balance of energy power in some of the countries in what used to be regarded as the Third World.  They are doing very well because they have the basic energy requirements, <Col N="140" /> particularly oil.  Other countries, particularly in the Far East, such as Singapore, have developed a standard of living which is beginning to run ahead of some countries in the developed world.  This means there is almost a Fourth World situation. Within the Third World there is a subdivision of countries which are doing exceptionally well because of their expertise or energy resources while other countries, which do not have this expertise or energy resources, are being left further behind.</P>
    <P>That is why I am glad to see that Ireland, in a limited way, has concentrated on four African countries &mdash; Lesotho, Tanzania, Zambia and Sudan &mdash; which are undoubtedly in this Fourth World category and need to be helped by our technical expertise.  Rapidly developing countries in what used to be called the Third World, must play their part particularly in recycling oil revenues towards their less well-off neighbours, as well as asking the developing world to play its part.  As I said, in this year &mdash; 1982 &mdash; there is a need for a redefinition of targets and approaches in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the setting up of this joint committee to help four African countries &mdash; Lesotho, Tanzania, Zambia and Sudan.  It might be said that these countries are lucky because there are projects under way which hopefully will not alone meet their immediate food requirements but will provide the necessary expertise to enable these people to look after themselves in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In various countries numerous people are dying because the developed world has not helped them.  It is vital that this joint committee provide a forum for an exchange of ideas to ensure that such areas are not overlooked.  As I said, some areas are very lucky because they have been adopted either under a bilateral aid programme or by voluntary organisations and are being helped so that they can take care of themselves in years to come. We must continue to expand our interest in countries which because of their geographical position can suffer from a shortage of basic commodities such as water <Col N="141" /> and which inevitably leads to drought and a great deal of human misery.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to justify spending very large sums on nuclear weapons, space shuttles and so on when humans are dying for want of a little help.  I know from experience what it is like for volunteers, missionary and lay, who offer their expertise in these developing countries.  I lived among them for a couple of years and I cannot pay a sufficiently high tribute to them for the continuity of service they offer.  The joint committee will have an opportunity to examine a project which would not be a once-off <i>ad hoc</i> project but which would have continuity and would not alone look after the immediate needs of the people but would also teach them the skills to look after themselves properly.</P>
    <P>We must also look at the area of communication. I have seen the culture of a country being altered because a country with a great deal of wealth and expertise came to help them.  It is not right that we should interfere with the cultural values of an area.  This is a very sensitive subject. It is vital that we help the people so that, as soon as possible, they will be able to look after themselves; but we must leave them with their own sense of values.  I know it does not happen intentionally, but it has happened that the culture of a country has been severely interfered with.  I have seen projects undertaken in villages where a great deal of machinery was brought in with the resultant noise and clamour.  One wonders what benefit this can be to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>From discussions I have had with the Minister of State I am aware of his concern for extreme sensitivity in bringing to those people the expertise to enable them to help themselves.  One might ask, for instance, whether it would be worthwhile to give a piece of machinery to a man who had as many as eight or nine dependants having regard to the cost of the energy that would be required to operate such machinery.</P>
    <P>The establishment of co-operatives in many areas is a very good development. After a thorough investigation plants are established and local materials used, but <Col N="142" /> I do not like the idea of materials or implements of development coming directly from donor countries.  Instead every effort should be made to modify materials available locally and to improve skills in order to bring about greater efficiency. It is vital that we have a forum for discussion on various aspects of aid to the Third World.  Regardless of what we may be doing in this area there is much more that could be done.  The Minister tells us that it will be possible for the joint committee to focus attention on various questions of development aid and to offer a positive lead to public opinion.  For many years Irish public opinion has been very much in advance of expenditure voted in this House.</P>
    <P>There are many people who have witnessed the situation of peoples in those Third World countries and they would have a great deal of expertise to put before the committee.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of paying tribute to the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Lenihan.  I recall discussing with him his efforts to establish projects and to make further finance available for the Third World.  We have gone some way towards meeting our target in that respect.  I take this opportunity also of wishing Deputy Collins, who is our new spokesman in this area, every success in that role.  I am confident that his zeal and commitment will make a significant contribution to ensuring the development of co-operation with the countries in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Keeffe) Jim O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their support for this motion.  Deputy Collins referred to the need for full Oireachtas scrutiny when substantial amounts of money are involved.  It may not be highlighted sufficiently in my speech that the sums involved are substantial and in that light I agree that there must be Oireachtas scrutiny as to where the money is going and also in respect of any suggestions put forward as to how best the money should be spent.  In this way we will be ensuring that our contribution is as effective as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the figures, I do not <Col N="143" /> consider it proper to engage in any hassle. One of the reasons for my wishing to see this committee established is my desire for all-party agreement on the need for development and co-operation and the need to expand our programme in line with the UN recommendations so that we may attain that target.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins referred to the increase of £18 million as representing 37 per cent. He is misinformed, because the increase is 46 per cent.  However, I shall not blame the Deputy too much for this error because, when one has regard to the various rumours and newspaper reports of recent times, one might be forgiven for such a mistake.  The increase is from £18 million to £26.335 million and that represents a 46 per cent increase.  In 1980 the amount was £16.2 million or .18 of GNP. In 1981 the amount was £18 million which also was .18 of GNP and the 1982 figure of £26.335 million represents .23 of GNP. However, as Deputy Collins rightly pointed out, we cannot be sure what the GNP will be for 1982 but I can tell him that the figure arrived at is based on the best advice available to the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan rightly highlighted the question of interdependence.  It is important to stress that what we are giving is not simply a handout.  Although the return to this country is not the motivation behind development co-operation there is a spin off from our activities in the development countries.  It is proper that the public should be aware of this.</P>
    <P>The reference to the President of the World Bank is interesting.  This gentleman seems to be taking a different line from that taken by Mr. McNamara.  I shall not pass any judgment in that respect now except to say that to some extent I am alarmed by some of the more recent indications emanating from the World Bank.  There are countries that have improved considerably, and obviously a case could be made for not treating those countries in the same way as we would treat the least developed countries.  But overall the position, particularly among the least-developed countries, has not improved.  Indeed, it has deteriorated considerably.  Many of <Col N="144" /> them are in a critical situation.  One of these is Tanzania, one of the countries I visited immediately after Christmas.  I do not see, for example, that a decision to increase the rate of interest to developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, will help them with their foreign exchange problems.  Perhaps it is outside the scope of this debate, but we will be watching with interest further developments in that area.</P>
    <P>It touches on one of the benefits we will achieve from the establishment of the joint committee.  We hope and expect that considerable interest will be taken in the multilateral area.  It is very difficult for us, with such a small section of the Department, to keep pace with all the developments in the multilateral area.  In view of our growing involvement in development co-operation, as far as possible we should keep an eye on what is happening.  We contribute to very many of these international organisations.</P>
    <P>As I would expect, Deputy Murphy indicated his deep and sincere commitment. This was to be expected from somebody who &ldquo;did time&rdquo; in the Third World.  Anyone who has served there, or is aware of the problems of the developing countries, will push the cause of development co-operation in the years ahead.  His point about the cultural values of these countries is well taken.</P>
    <P>The other major point to which I should refer is his view that Irish public opinion on aid to the developing countries is probably ahead of the views of legislators.  I am convinced of this.  Many people have relations or friends who served in the Third World either as missionaries or as lay volunteers and therefore they are concerned about development co-operation.  This is confirmed by a survey made available to me by the advisory council which indicated that there is an enormous fund of goodwill amongst the Irish people for development co-operation and for increasing the aid we provide through official sources to the developing countries.</P>
    <P>In my speech I mentioned persons who could attend at meetings of the joint committee who would not have the right to vote but could contribute to discussions <Col N="145" /> with the agreement of the committee.  I understand that, technically speaking, it is not correct to say they can contribute to discussions with the committee's agreement, and that technically the proper way to express it is that they will have a right to be heard with the committee's agreement.  For the record I should like to correct that.  I thank the House for their support for this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Eireann authorise the broadcasting live on sound of the Budget statement of the Minister for <Col N="148" /> Finance to-morrow and the statement of the Opposition spokesman subject to the following conditions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  that both statements be broadcast in their entirety and that they be not interrupted by commentary, analysis or commercial breaks;</P>
    <P>(ii)  that the statements may not later be rebroadcast in whole or in part; and</P>
    <P>(iii)  that copyright in the material be retained by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this motion is to allow radio broadcasting of the Budget Statement and the statement by the Opposition spokesman.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges met and had a full discussion on this matter.  I am happy to say there was full agreement that these statements should be broadcast.  The committee also considered television.  In any aspect of life one must creep before one walks.  It was a wise decision to permit radio broadcasting only as an experiment and to see how it will operate.  I believe it will be a success.  Radio is the ideal medium for broadcasting the Budget Statement and the reply by the Opposition spokesman.  There will be interest in them, and consideration can be given also to broadcasting major statements from time to time by the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The House and the committee will have an opportunity to evaluate the effect this will have on the House.  We must ensure that it does not interfere with the operation of the House, with its smooth running and with the conduct of the House.  I do not think radio should have any ill effects.  With television, people might perform if they were on camera.  In this case we have selected our performers, the Minister and the Opposition spokesman.  I am looking forward to it. It is an historic occasion which we will remember.  We will be asking for a copy of the recording to be placed in the Dáil Library as an historic record of something of importance in this House.</P>
    <P>We are opening up the House to the people.  We will have time to consider its <Col N="149" /> effects and I hope we will be able to bring many more transmissions to the people. It will not be anything like Top of the Pops or top of the TAM ratings.  We are broadcasting these statements on radio to give information.  I am pleased that the committee grasped the nettle and gave their approval without any rancour. Obviously some people will always have reservations, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>This is an innovation and we must look at it carefully.  I have no doubt but that RTE will treat the House in the manner in which it should be treated.  It is very important that the dignity of Parliament be preserved and its proceedings be upheld to the highest standard.  This broadcast will afford people an opportunity of being part of the proceedings of this House.  It must be remembered that it is the people who elect us and, apart from the occasions on which they see us in our constituencies or read about events here in the paper, they do not really know what happens in this House.  On this occasion they will know.  There is always an air of excitement and anticipation about budgets, their contents and what the Opposition may think of them.  The creation of that type of interest among the public will make them more aware of politics and of the role of this House. God knows we are not short of knockers, particularly in regard to some shows that try to depict this House as operating with less than dignity.  It is right that this type of broadcast should demonstrate that this is a Parliament of dignity, a House serious about its business and, most important of all, one which legislates for the people's benefit, making laws affecting their daily lives.  Therefore, it is right that they be afforded an opportunity on radio of feeling part of that institution.</P>
    <P>I put this proposal to the Government and they were indeed happy to agree with my suggestion that this broadcast be allowed.  I was happy also at the manner in which it was received by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It augurs well for the future of this media &mdash; and I speak here of radio &mdash; which could have an important role to play in making people more aware of their politicians, of the hard work they do and the <Col N="150" /> time they devote to it.  It might well restore peoples' confidence in their parliamentarians, something the more witty pundits might like to denounce.</P>
    <P>I look forward to this broadcast tomorrow as being as historic one and that it will prove to have been merely the beginning of bringing this Parliament nearer to and making it more meaningful for our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have indicated already, through our representation on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, their agreement to this motion.  It is as well to remember its restricted nature.  The first part of the motion states:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann authorise the broadcasting live on sound of the Budget statement of the Minister for Finance to-morrow and the statement of the Opposition spokesman subject to the following conditions:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash; conditions I have no doubt RTE will abide by &mdash; that is, again according to the wording of the motion:</P>
      <P>(i)  that both statements be broadcast in their entirety and that they be not interrupted by commentary, analysis or commercial breaks;</P>
      <P>(ii)  that the statements may not later be rebroadcast in whole or in part; and</P>
      <P>(iii)  that copyright in the material be retained by Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>I might take the last condition first &mdash; that copyright in the material be retained by Dáil Éireann.  I might extend that further and agree with the Minister of State's suggestion that the tape of this first radio broadcast of a budget speech be offered to the Dáil Library by RTE to be held here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To revert to the motion and what will happen here tomorrow, while Fianna Fáil agreed with this proposal for a live broadcast, as distinct from the original request which was for coverage on television, and while we agreed to that proposal in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges <Col N="151" /> and do so here this evening, I want to state clearly that this is a once-off experiment, that the whole process will be subject to review after the event and that all similar applications will be considered on an event-by-event basis.  We have very serious doubts on this side of the House with regard to this whole question of live broadcasting of debates here.  The difficulty we foresee is where one draws the line between what was spoken about by the Minister of State, performances, and interference in what is a deliberative assembly, elected by the people to deliberate on the affairs of State, to direct the nation for the greater good of its people. There is a conflict there between open government and availability to the general public of all of the debates that take place in this House and interference with the working of a deliberative assembly. To date in the history of this State we have been very fortunate in that newspapers, radio and television have given detailed coverage of the debates which have taken place in both Houses.  Each Member of the Houses would have his or her own view on the accuracy or otherwise of those reports.  In certain instances we might all claim bias with regard to particular reporting.  However, we have been fortunate with regard to the amount of coverage and balance we have experienced in that coverage over the years.</P>
    <P>The one difficulty we foresee in this, the public's right to know, which has been well handled by the newspapers, radio and television in the traditional manner &mdash; in regard to tomorrow we are talking merely of just two clear statements in the budget debate &mdash; is that the inevitable follow-up will be a demand for continuous coverage.  I want to say here that we have not agreed to it and have very serious doubts about the effect this would have on the democratic process.  I think it would be fair to say that anybody aware of the British experience, anybody who has spoken to British parliamentarians on this subject, has discovered that, had they that decision to take again, they would not allow live broadcasts of the debates in the House of Commons <Col N="152" /> because of the widely held view that it has not done anything to improve the image of democracy and of the operations of that House.  What has been the experience in London similarly has been that in other Chambers.</P>
    <P>We have gone along with this proposal, but I want to set the record straight and make it clear that it is to be a once-off experiment, that the doubts to which I have referred are held deeply by my party, and here I speak on behalf of my party on this issue.  I know RTE will adhere to the letter of the terms of the motion and I would appeal to them to provide the appropriate tapes for the Library of this House.  All I can say is that the two speakers whose contributions will be broadcast tomorrow will in no way let down the image of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I give this motion unreserved welcome.  In so far as it meets an entirely legitimate, democratic need, any reservations I have relate to the limitations of the motion and not to the limited extent of the provision being made here this evening.  It is ten years almost to the day since RTE first sought access to the Dáil for coverage of the EEC-entry debate.  Therefore, it has taken us a decade to convince Deputies in Dáil Éireann that there is not anything uniquely sacrosanct about the modulations of the human voice of a Deputy emanating from this Chamber.  It is ironic indeed that within 60 yards of this Chamber, Deputies grab microphones, grab access to RTE, to BBC, UTV, Canadian broadcasting, American broadcasting and will talk into almost any type of microphone in order to expound their views.  However, somehow or other the cloak of democratic responsibility hangs so heavily on their shoulders once they enter this House that they will permit their pearls of wisdom only to be recorded in a verbatim report, to be recorded in print in the national newspapers and, ironically, to be recorded in the RTE programme &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo;.  In this latter programme an objective and excellent <Col N="153" /> reporter summarises our views and puts them out.  We do not complain about it.</P>
      <P>I was a Member of this House in 1972 and I thought it a crying shame that the historic debate on our entry into the Common Market was not recorded and broadcast to the nation.  At that time the Committee on Procedure and Privileges threw out the proposal.  They refused to agree to public broadcasts on radio, either live or recorded, of selected Dáil proceedings.  When I was the Labour Party Whip in March 1973 a further request was made for radio coverage of the election of the Taoiseach and RTE also requested a recording of the debate on the appointment of Government members at that time.  I cannot be accused of lacking objectivity on this matter when I state that the then Taoiseach, the former Deputy Cosgrave, and the then Coalition Government, despite the fact that there were divisions within the Cabinet on the matter, refused permission and we had the ready acquiescence of Fianna Fáil in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      <P>We have made some small progress today and I welcome that.  It is very difficult to understand why there is such an outmoded distaste on the part particularly of Fianna Fáil, the largest party in the House, towards the proposal to broadcast the proceedings of this House. Deputy Burke said he had &ldquo;very serious doubts about the effect on the democratic process&rdquo; if we agree to allow the speeches of the Minister for Finance and Deputy O'Donoghue to be broadcast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the speech to be made by the Minister for Finance tomorrow will be subversive.  It will be going out live and it is not likely to be interrupted by any hysterical bleeps&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think the contribution that will be made by Deputy <Col N="154" /> O'Donoghue tomorrow afternoon will be an affront to the democratic process.  I have no doubt it will be listened to with great interest.  I welcome this long over-due decision on the part of Dáil Eireann and I hope it will be extended to other occasions in the future.  For example, on the occasion of the election of the Taoiseach there is no reason why the speeches nominating him and also nominating the person opposing him should not be broadcast.  It would have been very interesting to broadcast the speeches nominating the Ceann Comhairle&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Likewise, some ministerial statements could be broadcast. For example, the report of the Taoiseach on the day on the outcome of summit meetings might be broadcast.  I know there is a love-hate relationship &mdash; and that is putting it mildly &mdash; between many politicians and the media, particularly RTE.  As I said earlier, RTE produce the programme &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo;.  I ask Deputy Burke and colleagues on this side of the House on how many occasions have we objected to the summary given by RTE on that programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Never.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>RTE have a programme lasting ten minutes dealing with the proceedings in Dáil Éireann and in 13 years membership of this House I could count on the fingers of my hands the number of occasions we have objected to that programme.  Yet, a shiver of apprehension runs through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges regarding the prospect of live broadcasting of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Deputies have been unduly preoccupied about this matter. In future we should arrange for the live broadcasting of various State occasions. While I would not like to impose on the nation the live broadcasting of Question Time &mdash; not in its current form at any rate; we should spare the nation that excruciating boredom&mdash;there are many other occasions that could be <Col N="155" /> broadcast.  On major bills the opening Second Stage speech and the response by the opposition could be broadcast.  For example, there will be an interesting Second Stage opening speech on the abolition of capital punishment and that could be broadcast.  It does not necessarily have to be broadcast live.  It could be broadcast in the late evening.</P>
      <P>The person who first advocated the broadcasting of proceedings of the House was the then Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Deputy Corish. At the presentation of the Jacobs Radio and Television Awards for 1974 in Wexford on 22 February 1975 he said:</P>
      <P>It seems to me, as a Member of Dáil Éireann, that we cannot for long hope to stimulate public interest in a respect for our parliamentary institutions if we continue to deny broadcasting its legitimate access to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  For, by so doing, we are denying access to many many thousands of people.</P>
      <P>Our Parliament buildings seem to have been designed to exclude as many people as possible from gaining access to them, not in facilitating the greatest possible public presence.  But Dáil Éireann is the people's Parliament, not a club, and the proceedings of Dáil Éireann and the Seanad should be accessible to the people as a right, not a privilege.</P>
      <P>I come from a generation of politicians who grew up in the public arena without access to broadcasting of any kind.  I think we have managed to survive the combat in Montrose, and the free participation by politicians in broadcasting has only added to, not detracted from, the role of the politician in public life.  How much more fitting it would be if the people now were facilitated in their access to the centre of democracy.</P>
      <P>That was the first occasion in the history of the State when the Tánaiste of the day spoke in such terms.  I am sure he will have a certain sense of satisfaction about what has been done here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had the Year of the Disabled <Col N="156" /> and at the end of that period it is appropriate that we should provide facilities whereby those who cannot see their politicians will be given an opportunity at least to hear them live on their radios. This is a show of minimum respect which politicians should have for those sections of the community who will never have the opportunity to read newspaper reports of parliamentary proceedings. Tomorrow they will be able to hear politicians live engaging in a democratic debate.</P>
    <P>Accordingly I welcome this motion.  I have grave reservations about part (ii) of the motion providing that the statements may not later be rebroadcast in whole or in part.  I think that is nonsense as is the suggestion that other sections of the media, for instance the BBC and UTV, will not have access to parts of the broadcast. In that respect I do not agree with the motion.</P>
    <P>I do not share the view of Deputy Burke about the attitude of Members of the House of Commons in London.  I agree that some of the most irredeemable Tory Members whom I have met in Europe and elsewhere might not see the benefit of having radio equipment and even television in the House of Commons, but the vast majority of the Members there are in favour of live broadcasts of Commons debates.</P>
    <P>In regard to the final part of the motion, that copyright in the broadcast material be retained by Dáil Éireann, I do not think that is necessary, although it may be a valuable restriction.  I hope that at future meetings of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges some of us will be able to convince Opposition members of the committee that we should extend and develop this as a standing public service facility for all the people of the nation.  It is no less and no more than that, and I suggest that we do not make too much of a song and dance about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. F. O'Brien) Fergus O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was interesting to hear the views of Fianna Fáil and Labour.  As Government Whip I have given the Fine Gael side.  I am disappointed at the reticence of Fianna <Col N="157" /> Fáil in regard to this broadcast.  I do not think there is anything to be feared.  It is simply a matter of factual broadcasting, and to suggest that there would be any misinterpretation is absurd.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond suggested that we might have gone a little further.  There was unanimous agreement in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in this respect, although the members expressed different views.  I am sure that the committee were right to allow this narrow facility for the broadcast.  For the first time we will be given an opportunity to evaluate the whole scene in this respect. We may then be able to make a long-term decision in regard to broadcasting proceedings in the House.  This is a great opportunity, now that community radio is making such progress, to relay debates in the House so that local communities will be able to follow live the work here of their Deputies.  We have made a start and we should keep the effort moving. We will be able now to gauge the attitudes and we will eliminate many of the fears that exist.</P>
      <P>I suggest that this will become a great medium of direct information for the people throughout the country about what is happening in the Parliament they elected democratically.  Democracy is supposed to be open and with confidence we should let the people know what is happening in Parliament.  It is only in non-democratic countries that fears exist in regard to letting the people know too much.  The day we fear to let our people know directly what is happening in Parliament will be the day when democracy will end.</P>
      <P>I welcome this broadcast.  I know Deputy Burke has reservations about it but I think he has no cause for such fears. We here make the laws and change them and we should welcome the broadcast with open arms.  If it does not work out, well and good, but let us reconsider it after tomorrow.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Foyle Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1981:" RHead="Second Stage">
    <Title>Foyle Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1981: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Col N="158" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Fitzpatrick, Cavan-Monaghan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to make provision for increased penalties in respect of offences under the Foyle Fisheries Acts, 1952 to 1976.  The Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952, established the Foyle Fisheries Commission which is a joint North-South body with statutory responsibility for conservation, protection and development of the fisheries in the Foyle area. That Act also defines the Foyle area and lays down the fishery law for the area and the penalties for breaches thereof.  The Foyle area comprises the entire catchment area of the River Foyle which flows partly in County Donegal and partly in Counties Derry and Tyrone.  The Foyle Fisheries (Amendment) Acts, 1961 to 1976, amended and extended the provision of the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952. Legislation similar in terms to the Foyle Fisheries Acts was enacted by the Northern Ireland authorities.</P>
      <P>Most of the penalties for offences under the Foyle Fisheries Acts, 1952. 1961, have not been changed since 1952. The changed money values in the meantime and the growing level of illegal fishing in the Foyle area, including incidents of violence involving members of the Foyle Fisheries Commission's protection staff, clearly indicate that the existing penalties are not an adequate deterrent. Furthermore, the Fisheries Act, 1980, provides for substantial increases in fines for the same offences throughout the rest of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for substantial increases in penalties for fishery offences in the Moville area which is the part of the Foyle area located in County Donegal.  Maximum penalties of up to £600 and or six months in prison are prescribed on summary conviction.  For example, fines of £10 under the 1952 Act have been increased to £200 and where a fine of £25 was prescribed in the 1952 <Col N="159" /> Act it has been increased to £600 on summary conviction.  For the more serious offences provision is made for trial on indictment and the penalty on conviction for such offences can extend to £2,000 and/or two years in prison.</P>
    <P>I am seriously concerned about the high level of illegal fishing taking place not only in the Foyle area but in the country as a whole.  Our valuable salmon stocks have been seriously depleted in recent years because of illegal activities. We all have a duty to ensure that these stocks are safeguarded in the interests of our commercial fishermen, anglers and our very important tourist industry.  I am satisfied that the setting up of the regional fisheries boards has helped to improve protection and will continue to do so in the future.  The increase in fines provided for in the Fisheries Act, 1980, should also contribute to a reduction in illegal fishing and I am satisfied that the increased penalties now proposed for the Foyle area will likewise reduce the level of illegal fishing there.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise, as strongly as I can, that while I hold the office of Minister for Fisheries and Forestry I will spare no effort to ensure that the cancer of poaching is reduced to the minimum and, if possible, eliminated.  I look forward to the continued co-operation of the regional fisheries boards, the Naval Service and the Garda in achieving that target.</P>
    <P>I would refer Deputies to the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill which sets out the existing penalties and the proposed increased penalties. Similar provisions for increases in penalties for the same offences have been prescribed in a recent Fisheries Amendment (Northern Ireland) Order.  It is proposed that both the Bill, when enacted, and the Northern Ireland order should come into operation at the same time.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill and tell him that we support its provisions. The Minister is implementing legally an agreement that was reached <Col N="160" /> between Lord Elton and myself as Minister earlier last year.  We gave our word at that time that we would both enact the same type of legislation and I am glad that the Minister is doing that.  The Foyle Fisheries Commission is a good example of North-South co-operation.  We share the waters and the tributaries of the Foyle and the medial line runs down through the lough.  For some time we have had joint representation by officials from each side and an alternating chairman. Despite the reasons for this enactment it can be said that the commission has worked successfully.  I was glad that I had an opportunity of visiting the Foyle.  I can recall Deputy Harte accusing me of not visiting it and describing me as a partitionist Minister because I had not visited the headquarters of the Foyle Fisheries Commission in Derry at a time when I was visiting Inishowen on the other side of the Foyle and meeting fishermen there, in Moville, Greencastle and other ports.  Happily, we were able to remedy that and visit the Foyle.  We spent two days in the Derry area and found the officials there to be very courteous, helpful and hospitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister has said about the cancer of poaching is true and in connection with that we discussed with the officials in Derry the very serious state of salmon stocks.  There is a danger of their extinction in the Foyle and poaching has reached the most serious stage imaginable. We are dealing with dreadful people who are the enemies of any genuine fishermen or genuine Irishmen, north and south of the Border.  A senior official told me that he spoke to one of these people and pointed out to him that he was on a course that would finish salmon for all time in the Foyle.  The official said that it could well be that the salmon the poacher was trying to catch was the last one that was going up the Foyle to spawn.  The reply he got was that even if it was the last salmon he would take it out if he could.  They are the type of people we have to deal with.  The salmon counts in that area are probably at their lowest level ever.  I hope that these severe penalties have the desired effect.  I would term them as hopefully a short-term <Col N="161" /> restriction for a long-term gain.  There are shorter fishing times that have been staggered up through the estuary to give the greatest chance of escapement and it is up to us to give that chance to salmon not alone on the Foyle but throughout the country.  We will support the Minister, the Garda and the authorities in their efforts to give the greatest chance of escapement for salmon to the spawning grounds.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to use this opportunity to dispel the myth that all poachers are confined to the Donegal side of the Foyle. There is a theory there that most poachers come from the St. Johnston area.  I remember an official from the northern side telling us that there was always great activity in the poaching line before 17 March by people who were anxious to get the wherewithal to celebrate the national feast day.  I am sure there would be some activity before 12 July also on the other side.  The poachers who operate in that area are bad and they use very sophisticated equipment.  They operate two-way radios to warn them of the approach of people and they stay in caravans in the area.  They are quite brazen.  Lately there has been a determined effort by the Garda, the protection staff and the police on the other side of the Border and their constant surveillance and determination have been effective.  When I visited the area the salmon season was in full swing and we saw the results of that surveillance work.  Many illegal nets and engines had been seized.</P>
    <P>We should compliment the staff of the commission and the Garda who have a hard and dangerous job to do.  They need all our support.  The purpose of all this work is to ensure the survival of salmon in the Foyle and elsewhere and it is necessary to point out also that a certain amount of harm is done by pollution from industries, particularly on the Derry side of the river.  I hope this will be monitored and that all pollution will be eliminated. A greater check should be kept on agricultural pollution which can be dangerous in spawning grounds.  It would be a further example in cross-Border co-operation if we had a uniform code of monitoring, of penalties and checking on <Col N="162" /> developments whether they are agricultural or industrial to ensure that deleterious matter does not find its way into our waters and harm spawning grounds. We should give nature a help in our follow-up to the re-stocking of our rivers and ensure that the co-operation that has existed on both sides of the Foyle will continue.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's statement about poachers.  We share his opinion of them.  They deserve to be pursued relentlessly. Poaching must be stamped out.  It is hoped that as a result of the increased penalties there will soon be an improvement, not only in relation to the Foyle but all over the country and that our salmon stocks will so increase that we will be able to introduce less restrictive measures in the years ahead.  This is our last chance as far as the Foyle is concerned. If its future as a salmon river is not secured by this amendment the outlook will be very bleak indeed&mdash;in fact, there will be no outlook.

    <P>As this is my first time to speak on fisheries in the House, I would like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to the Ministry and wish him every success.  From this side of the House, I <Col N="163" /> shall have the responsibility for fisheries and I hope that, between us, we can make a worthwhile contribution to the future of the industry.</P>
    <P>As I said when speaking in Irish, the amendment looks very severe indeed. However, it highlights the necessity for this type of amendment, particularly in regard to the conservation of our salmon stocks.  As has been said by the Minister and by Deputy Power, poaching is now posing a very severe threat to the future of the salmon industry.  There was a time when a person poaching caught a salmon for the sake of having a meal, or he went out for the occasional salmon and was satisfied with that.  That is no longer the case.  The stage has been reached where it has become a commercial proposition. The poachers are professionals and are using methods unheard of in the past.  In this way they are cutting down the stocks, particularly in our rivers and on the way to the spawning beds.  This cannot be tolerated.  We must act responsibly and stamp poaching out at all levels.</P>
    <P>For that reason, we agree entirely with this amendment.  We hope that the commission will get full co-operation from everyone, particularly the fishermen, in trying to ensure that this type of poaching is eliminated.  Quite honestly, the amendment is being introduced in the interests of the fishermen.  If we do not conserve and protect our stocks there will be no industry.  We must appeal to the fishermen, from this House, to adopt a more responsible attitude and to think of their own future and in particular, of the future of this great industry.</P>
    <P>As has been said by Deputy Power, it is refreshing to see complete co-operation from our fellow members on the other side of the Foyle.  It is a pity that we do not have this kind of co-operation in many other fields.  The manner in which the commission has worked down the years, since established in 1952, shows how we could co-operate and work together, given the required will on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>Possibly, later on, on the other Bill which is due to come before the House I will have more to say about the whole <Col N="164" /> industry.  I will finish by saying that as far as we on this side of the House are concerned the Minister and the Department will receive full co-operation in dealing with poachers and in trying to ensure that our valuable stocks of fish are maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the support for this amendment. I take this opportunity to point out to the Minister that the River Foyle has been an outstanding salmon river.  About 30 years ago there were, in that river, significant stocks of salmon.  Unfortunately, down through the years the stocks have diminished.  While we must always have our sights on conservation and on the discouragement of poachers, the Foyle Commission, who now control the river and are responsible for the issuing of licences, by the way they have been operating have encouraged poaching on the River Foyle.  The number of licences has been drastically reduced, which has encouraged many people who might pay for licences to get into the salmon fishing business illegally.  I do not think any of us would condone that.  The Minister should consider taking a wider view as regards licence applications from traditional fishermen on the River Foyle, reviewing their cases and granting an extension of licences.</P>
      <P>For some years the poachers fished the River Foyle and the licensed net men were excluded from fishing it, which was a very serious situation.  I wish to put on record my praise of and thanks to the officers of the law who last year reversed that development of the last couple of years.  In the 1981 season we returned to the normal practice which was that the fishermen who were licensed had the right to fish the river and did not experience the troubles which had been experienced previously, particularly in the areas where draft netting was extensive, from Culmore to Lifford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the penalties that are now to be imposed in the Bill there are certain aspects that I want clarified.  It would appear that the proposed amendments increase drastically the fines and the sentences of imprisonment to be imposed in <Col N="165" /> relation to offences committed.  In addition, the amendment clearly gives the Foyle Fisheries Commission options of referring charges on indictment.  I want that clarified because it could very well happen that a person caught with five or six salmon could, on the orders of the commission, be sent for trial by jury and it would be wrong to give such wide ranging powers to the commission and a discretion as to how a person caught committing an offence should be dealt with. That, basically, is my worry in relation to the amendment that is being presented here.  Otherwise I would fully endorse the recommendations and the updating of the penalties.  The increase in the fines and penalties should be a great deterrent to poachers on the river.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that the commission would perhaps increase the number of bailiffs on the river.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity to refer specifically to a very important salmon tributary to the Foyle Fisheries which is under the control of the commission, that is, the Culdaff river which has not been properly protected by the Foyle commissioners who are responsible for it.  Otherwise I welcome the proposals in the Bill with the reservations I have made.  I would ask for clarification on the point in relation to prosecution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I want to thank the Deputies on the other side of the House for the welcome they have given this Bill and for facilitating its passage through the House.  I also want to thank Deputy Gallagher for his welcome to me as Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.  I want to reciprocate the hope that between us we will make a worthwhile contribution to the fishery industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no harm to give a very short history of the Foyle fisheries.  Back in the 1600s it was held under a charter by a society known as the Honourable Irish Society and it continued to be held under that charter until comparatively recent times, probably the forties, when that charter was challenged in our courts in so far as it extended into our jurisdiction.  Our courts upheld the claim of the plaintiffs <Col N="166" /> and decided that the charter of the English king had no validity in our jurisdiction. The result then was that there was a free-for-all situation in and around Moville and in the Foyle area.  Without introducing party politics into it, during the term of the first inter-Party Government from 1948-51 negotiations were entered into between the Northern Ireland authorities and the Republic with a view to acquiring this fishery and it was agreed that the fishery would be taken over and run by a commission known as the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  Fianna Fáil, on their return to power, enacted the Act of 1952 which is the basic authority dealing with this fishery.  It set up the Foyle Fisheries Commission and then the fisheries were purchased by the commission for something over £100,000 at that time.  I would like to join with Deputy Power in complimenting the commission on the way it has worked since it was set up in 1952.  It is certainly an example of North-South co-operation and it demonstrates how people can join hands across the Border and work in the common interests of everyone in our country. The Foyle Fisheries Commission consists of four members, two appointed by the authorities in Northern Ireland and two by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry here; the chairman alternates between North and South each year.</P>
    <P>We know from experience that the commission has worked well and has worked in the interests of the fishing industry.  Since I became Minister for Fisheries and Forestry I was very pleased to receive a letter from the secretary of the commission complimenting members of the Garda on the great work done by them and on their co-operatin with their counterparts in Northern Ireland in bringing to justice people who were poaching and damaging the industry.  I had great pleasure in sending that letter to the Garda Commissioner for noting. I would like certainly to join with Deputy Power in noting the co-operation between North and South through the commission.</P>
    <P>The object of this Bill is to increase penalties for breach of the fishery law, in other words, to increase penalties for <Col N="167" /> illegal fishing and for illegal methods of fishing and poaching.  The penalties have been brought up from £10 to £200 and from £25 to £600 together with an increase in prison sentences.</P>
    <P>I should like to put Deputy Connaughton's mind at ease in regard to prosecutions. There is provision for summary trial, that is, trial before a district justice. In such cases penalties do not exceed £200 or six months' imprisonment.  There is provision for trial before judge and jury in the Circuit Court on indictment. In those cases the penalties are as high as £2,000 or two years' imprisonment. Deputy Connaughton was rather perturbed lest the commission would have the right to decide whether a person was to be tried in a summary way on indictment. I am glad to tell the Deputy that the commission do not decide.  The Director of Public Prosecutions is the deciding authority.  He decides if and where prosecutions will be brought.  That is as it should be.  I would rather be tried before a judge and jury even though the penalties are more severe.  It is harder to get a conviction.  Whether that is a compliment to the jury system or not I shall leave to the House to decide.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> If the Deputy teased it out he might come to the other conclusion.  The object of the Bill is to increase penalties in order to eliminate poaching.  It is necessary to take a serious view of poaching.  Our salmon stocks are under severe pressure.  The records show that in the sixties about 135,000 salmon per year were taken from the Foyle area.  The number of salmon caught was 35,000 in 15 years.  I am not saying that the cause of the fall in our salmon stocks is totally due to operations in the Foyle.  It begins as far away as the Faroe Islands.  At present I and my officials are fighting a hard battle with the Faroese.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have to tell the story of how the salmon come home but we know that they do.  The Faroese catch a fair percentage <Col N="168" /> of salmon as they pass their islands.  All the salmon are not ours but some proportion of them are.  The Faroese catch as much as 1,600 tons of salmon as they pass the islands.  We are negotiating for a reduction of that to somewhere between 417 tons and 815 tons.</P>
    <P>It is up to us and to whatever Government are in power to do our best to protect the salmon.  We know that there is a lot of illegal drift-net fishing in our waters.  All kinds of illegal fishing methods are used in our inland rivers.  All these things combine to put salmon under pressure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher said everybody should co-operate to eliminate poaching and illegal fishing, particularly fishermen. I could not agree more.  It is fishermen and their families who in the long run will lose the most if our salmon stocks are destroyed.  Many areas of the country will lose out if our rivers are overfished because tourists will no longer be attracted to them.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill has been given a welcome and that all sides of the House are at one in seeing that illegal fishing and poaching is stamped out.  It is in the interests of the fishing industry, fishermen and the tourist industry.  I thank Deputies for the reception they have given the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries (Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a Bill to extend the statutory limit on borrowings by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara from the Central Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the benefit of those Members of Dáil Éireann who may not be fully familiar with the role of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in the fishing industry, I should like to outline briefly what the board's functions are at present.  The general powers of the board were set out in the Sea Fisheries Act, 1952, in very broad terms but the primary purpose of the board's establishment can be described as the assistance and improvement of all facets of the sea fishing industry.  In their early years the board actively engaged in a number of aspects of the industry including the purchasing, processing and marketing of fish but as the years went by it gradually became clear that some of the board's activities were no longer necessary and that they should concentrate more on promotional, advisory and developmental activities.  In 1962 the board's role, in the furtherance of Government policy in modern conditions, was set out in a White Paper entitled <i>Programme of Sea Fisheries Development.</i> As a result the board have withdrawn completely from active participation in fish processing and marketing and now operate in the role of a development body for the industry.  The board's present functions include the administration of a marine credit plan under which grants and loans are given for the purchase of fishing boats, engines and gear; the provision of an advisory service to fishermen to improve fishing techniques and promote co-operation among fishermen; the development of markets at home and abroad for fish and fishery products; the encouragement of private investment in worthwhile fish processing undertakings; the operation of ice-making plants at some fishing ports where such facilities are not provided by private enterprise; the operation of the National Fishery Training Centre in Greencastle <Col N="170" /> and a mobile training unit; the operation of a national mariculture grants scheme and the provision of an advisory service for those engaged in aquaculture.</P>
    <P>In addition to their grant-in-aid for capital development, the bulk of which is used to provide grants for the purchase of new fishing boats, BIM receive repayable advances each year from the Central Fund for the provision of loans at a reduced rate of interest for the same purpose. These advances are repaid to the Central Fund from the loan repayments made by purchasers of boats.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation &mdash; section 2 of the Sea Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1974 &mdash; the amount of outstanding repayable advances from the Central Fund to the board may at no time exceed IR£15 million.  That limit has now been reached and it is necessary that it be extended so that the development of our sea fishing industry may continue.  Because of the rapidly rising cost of these boats and the tendency to use increasingly larger boats together with the modernisation of the existing fleet, I consider that the limit should be raised to IR£40 million.</P>
    <P>The proposed increase may appear to be very large and may suggest that the board will be free, and are almost being encouraged, to engage in heavy investment in fishing vessels in the immediate years ahead.  Nothing could be further from what is in mind.  Due to the increasing difficulties being experienced by a large portion of the existing fleet in meeting their commitments and enjoying a worthwhile standard of living, the criteria applied by the board in the selection of applicants for new and second-hand vessels are being considerably tightened. Applicants will require more than ever before to establish satisfactorily that they have the necessary qualifications, skills and experience to operate the vessel sought successfully.</P>
    <P>I am aware that even the very best of our fishing skippers have no easy task at present in operating successfully.  For that reason the Government introduced last year a temporary aid package costing £1.6 million and comprising an increased interest subsidy on boat loans and a rebate of the excise duty on the fuel used <Col N="171" /> in fishing operations.  Other measures are in hand to make fishing operations more efficient and thereby more profitable. The training facilities for our fishermen have been expanded and are now available at local level with the acquisition by BIM of a mobile training unit.  Fish processing facilities, particularly for mackerel, have also been greatly expanded with State and EEC aid.</P>
    <P>The most important activity in the long run to assist the fishing industry is, no doubt, the steps being taken at Brussels in connection with the formulation of the common fisheries policy.  While progress towards reaching agreement on a revised common fisheries policy has been disappointingly slow some headway was made in the past year.  The new fish marketing regulation to come into operation in June should be of considerable benefit to our fishermen because of the changes made in the withdrawal from market arrangements and in the conditions governing imports of fish from third countries.  Since assuming responsibility for fisheries I have availed of every opportunity to oppose imports from third countries and I will continue to do so.  One positive effect of my efforts will be that over 20,000 tons of herring which could previously be imported annually free of duty will now be subject to the full duty of 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, given the incentive of the measures that have been taken and are in hand to improve the efficiency of the fishing fleet as well as the efforts to enhance the handling and marketing of fish, considerable strides will be made in the development of the fishing industry and I recommend this short Bill to the House.</P>

Ba mhaith liomsa tréaslú le baill an bhoird agus leis na hiascairí féin as an dul <Col N="172" /> chun cinn atá déanta acu go dtí seo.  Tig linn bheith bródúil as an méid atá déanta don tionscal iascaireachtá go dtí seo.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and, as I said in Irish, I want to congratulate BIM, the Department and the Ministers we have had on the progress we have seen in the industry over a number of years.  The board have done a tremendous job, and it is a little sad to see at the moment the disquiet we have in the industry.  In the recent past we would have been inclined to ask if we were presiding over the death of the fishing industry.  I say this because our stocks are dwindling rapidly and at the same time methods of catching fish are improving and in our own case our fleet is increasing.  If we want to see the industry progress properly it is necessary to have more money provided for exploratory fishing, for research so that we can be quite certain as to what stocks of fish are available and the amount that should be taken out annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my association with and experience of the industry I have never before seen the disquiet and lack of confidence that is showing up at the moment.  Catches are down considerably.  If you take herring, for instance, because it has been used as the bonus or plum which helps to give a fisherman a profit on his year's work, you might say that the herring industry is non-existent at the moment when we compare it with the situation we had in the past.  Catches are down considerably, prices are at a very low level and the fisherman who depended on trawling for other types of fish during parts of the year and then went to catch herring now finds that he no longer has the stocks available to him and he has not the wherewithal to meet his repayments on his boat and other overheads which a fisherman has to face.  The cost of diesel and of gear and equipment and the general overheads of fishermen are a terrible nightmare.  The prices which fishermen obtain for their fish are a bad joke when compared with the prices of other varieties of food.  I heard a report on the radio this morning on fish market prices and the types of fish most in demand were selling at between 8p and 14p per pound.  What else could be bought at such low prices?  The fisherman <Col N="173" /> have many overheads to meet such as the cost of getting their product to the market, porterage and auctioneers' fees and they are left with very little profit.</P>
    <P>For the first time in a number of years fishermen are very much behind in repayments on loans for the purchase of their boats and gear.  I have not the exact figure but I would hazard a guess that about 50 per cent or 60 per cent only are managing their repayments whereas a few years ago that figure was almost 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>BIM have done a very good job since taking over some aspects of the fishing industry.  There is, however, too much fragmentation in the development of the industry.  BIM are responsible for the development of the fleet and for providing advisory services and in recent years they have become responsible for the training school for young fishermen, but they have no responsibility for harbour development or for other aspects of the industry.  The development of piers may involve the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, the Office of Public Works, local county councils and, in some instances, Údarás na Gaeltachta.  This is not a satisfactory situation and hinders real progress.  Facilities for fishermen at our harbours are almost non-existent. Local co-operatives have been trying to do something about this but there is a lack of working capital.  Members of the co-op may be fishermen trying to pay for their boats and they do not have the necessary funds to do anything worthwhile. How many of our ports have adequate fresh water supplies, cold storage facilities, ice plants or facilities for fishermen to repair their gear?  How many have slips where boats can be put up for annual painting and cleaning, something which is absolutely necessary?  We lack all these facilities.  Such developments cannot be isolated from marketing and processing and while our approach remains fragmented the industry cannot progress as we would wish.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to know the number of people who would need to be employed on the Continent by BIM in the marketing field to do the job properly. In the past BIM have been limited in the number of personnel and the <Col N="174" /> amount of finance available.  When one considers the money and facilities which have been made available to Bord Bainne and other State agencies to market their produce, BIM would certainly appear to be the poor relation.</P>
    <P>We need long-term plans setting out our future aims for this industry.  I am not talking only about the big trawler men but also about the inshore people, the half-decker men who have traditionally fished along our coasts.  They are very important to the industry and many of our leading skippers have graduated from half-deckers to the bigger boats.  By protecting inshore people we will also do a conservation job in protecting stocks. The method used for mackerel and herring inshore fishing has been the drift net and this is the perfect method of conservation in as much as only the mature fish are caught.  I do not think anything worthwhile is being done for the fishing industry when the large trawlers can come into the small bays where those part-time fishermen operated so successfully and deplete our stocks.</P>
    <P>The methods the part-time fishermen employed in lobster and cray fishing was not a hindrance to the future of the stocks.  The methods now being used, such as tangle nets, are questionable. Cray fish, in particular, are taken out in great numbers and the quality and presentation of the fish afterwards is not nearly as good as when the old traditional fishing was used.  The Department will have to take a serious look at the future stocks of lobsters and cray fish.  The tangle nets are certainly doing great damage to cray fishing stocks.  The modern methods may be fine because more fish can be made available at a particular time but when we take the interests of the industry in the long term into account we find that many of the methods now employed are questionable.</P>
    <P>We have great potential for the development of some types of shell fish, such as oyster fishing.  In Clew Bay in the last few years oyster fisheries have been discovered. Some of those could have been utilised long before now if we had a more positive approach to this type of fishing. One of the fisheries concerned in the <Col N="175" /> Newport-Westport area is now controlled by a co-operative.  I am glad to say that they were given control by the Department.  It now means that while they have control, fishing will be organised and stocks will be protected.  This will ensure that stocks will be maintained.</P>
    <P>Oyster beds have been discovered in the northern part of County Mayo.  I am afraid if some control is not introduced the stocks will not last very long.  The Department and Bord Iascaigh Mhara do not seem to have trained personnel to do research and investigate what is available in relation to this type of fishing.  Oyster fishing can be carried out by part-time fishermen such as local farmers.  This can supplement their incomes and prove very lucrative if it is properly organised and directed.  We have been very lax over the years in tackling this problem.  I am not blaming the Department directly for this. I believe they have been working to the best of their ability on the budget available to them over the years and they probably did not have the necessary resources to go into this type of work.</P>
    <P>A lot of money is allocated to industries which start here.  We have only to compare the outcome with what could be done in concentrating more on the development of our natural resources in the manner I have described.  I ask the Minister to have a close look at this.  There are many inlets right along the coast where I believe we could develop oyster fishing to a much greater extent than we have been doing up to now.  I believe around 1840 the landlords were given permission to plant oysters and those were used to the benefit of the big houses. The stocks are still there but they have not been exploited to the full and used to the extent they should be as a worthwhile branch of our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I believe since we joined the EEC, despite the fact that some substantial grants have been made available to us for various aspects of the development of the industry, an air of uncertainty hangs over the future of our fishing industry.  We do not seem to know exactly where we are going.  There have been a number of debates on the future of the industry and <Col N="176" /> the possibility of having a common fisheries policy introduced &mdash; the Minister referred to this in his speech &mdash; but at the same time we do not seem to be making any real progress in relation to what the final outcome will be.</P>
    <P>We all realise that 1982 is crucial as far as the future of the industry is concerned. When we joined the EEC we were in the unfortunate position that the question of equal access had then been decided on by the existing member states.  This left us in an almost impossible position.  We had the derogation clause which left things more or less as they were for ten years. That finishes at the end of 1982.  I believe the time has come to be positive and take very firm decisions in relation to what will happen this year.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Fisheries and the Government must clearly indicate to Europe what we want for our fishermen.  Will we have an extension of the period or will we have a situation where the Dutch, the Germans and all the other strong fishing nations can come right up to our shores? It is a frightening thought if that is what we are to have.  That is why I believe we have, very quickly, to take positive and drastic steps to protect our industry.  We must try to restore confidence in the industry because unless our fishermen know very soon what the position will be, they will not have the confidence necessary for the industry to progress as we should like.</P>
    <P>At this stage we should set up a State committee co-ordinating the efforts of everybody concerned in the industry &mdash; Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Department, the Office of Public Works, county councils and the fishing industry.  These people should sit down and, as quickly as possible, try to blueprint what they see as the future of the industry.  I believe we should go to Europe with positive plans showing we have a constructive approach and that we want to see the advances which were made in the development of our industry continued for the next few years.</P>
    <P>Europe gained a great deal under the conditions laid down in the Treaty of Accession.  At that stage they had nothing <Col N="177" /> left; they had cleaned their own bays.  It is too bad if we, at this stage, allow them to come here and finish the job they did in their own waters.  We should be determined about this and not make any apology to our European partners in trying to convince them that we were treated very badly under the Treaty of Accession and that we want to protect and develop what we have.  We will still have something left if we get the response from Europe to which we are entitled.  The Minister will have the full support of the Fianna Fáil Party if he and the Government take whatever steps are necessary to put that case as strongly as possible to our EEC partners.</P>
    <P>The fleets of some of the EEC Member States are dwindling.  As far as they were concerned is was a question of kill &mdash; and &ldquo;kill&rdquo; was the operative word &mdash; because by modern fishing methods they have killed their stocks and their concentration is now in our waters.  I consider the dumping of fish as immoral.  There must be something wrong when a fisherman lands a catch, has the fish sprayed, coloured and thrown back into the sea.  That must be demoralising for the fishermen.  Traditionally fishermen are superstitious and talk about luck, but they cannot feel happy about going back to sea if they realise that when they catch the fish it will have to be sprayed and thrown back into the sea.</P>
    <P>An EEC scheme providing milk for our children at a cheap rate has been introduced.  This is very worthwhile and is something with which we all agree.  The EEC bureaucrats should not find it too hard to think of a comparable scheme where this fish could be made available as food.  It is ridiculous, stupid, silly &mdash; I cannot find the words to express what I want to say &mdash; to do what our fishermen are doing at present.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on agreements made by individual member states with third countries in relation to imports of fish into the Common Market.  I wanted to get information in the Library on the recent Canadian-German agreement and was told they did not have the information nor did the EEC Office, or Foreign Affairs, but that the German Embassy <Col N="178" /> would have to be consulted.  This evening I was told that the terms of the agreement would be published shortly and I would see them for myself.  I am led to believe that imports of fish from third countries like Canada are causing havoc in our markets and as a result the prices paid to our fishermen are depressed.  I would like to know where we stand on this matter. What rights has our Minister?  How are these agreements arrived at?  What form of protest did the Minister make to try to ensure that these landings would not cause the problems I am led to believe they are causing at the moment?</P>
    <P>I understand the Germans are allowed to fish inside the Canadian 200-mile limit for some kind of concession by way of a certain tonnage of fish being sent from Canada to Germany.  If that kind of agreement militates against member states, we are going against the principles on which the Common Market was founded.  The first loyalty has to be to the member states.  If one of the stronger states, like Germany &mdash; and I am subject to correction on this &mdash; can impose its will on the Community as a whole and, as a result, get certain concessions or conditions that are to its benefit but to the detriment of other member states like Ireland, Denmark and the smaller nations, we will seriously have to look at the whole position of the EEC.  Last week I tried to get a copy of The Hague agreement but I was told by one of the Library staff that none was available, that the material was confidential.  I was amazed to hear that.  To whom is the information confidential?  Surely we as Members of the Oireachtas are entitled to such information. I should like to hear from the Minister on this point when he is replying.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the plight of the part-time fishermen.  There are many anomalies so far as they are concerned. For many years there was the tradition of the use of small fishing craft around our coasts.  In this way local people supplemented their incomes but with the help of BIM they were provided with 26-footers and with half deckers.  This change eased their plight and helped them to improve their earnings considerably. <Col N="179" /> What I am emphasising is not within the Minister's area but I would ask him to consider it <i>vis-á-vis</i> two other Ministers, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare.  The case I am making is that fishermen are regarded by the Department of Social Welfare as self-employed while they are regarded as PAYE workers by the Department of Finance.  This anomalous situation must be corrected as quickly as possible.  To give an example of what I have in mind let us take the case of someone in my county who engages in part-time fishing compared with another person who goes to work with Bord na Móna or on a building site.  I am talking about seasonal or temporary employment.  When the person who has been working with Bord na Móna or on the building site goes to his local employment exchange having finished his employment, he gets his unemployment assistance or benefit without question.  I know that I am digressing somewhat but what I am saying is related to the fishing industry.</P>

      <P>While the poor fisherman who may not have earned a third of what the other man has earned during the same period must, because he is classified as self-employed, give an account of his earnings during the period in question because he describes himself as a fisherman at the labour exchange the employment assistance that he would otherwise get is reduced.  He will not qualify for benefit because of not having stamped a card.</P>

      <P>Not always.  Very often this anomalous situation leads to their being dishonest in that they will say they have not been fishing.  Apart from the fact that they are being caught in that <Col N="180" /> sort of situation they get their tax bill as self-employed people.  This bill can be for substantial sums and they then have to try to prove to the local tax inspector that they did not earn X pounds during the time in question.  I have talked about this matter to successive Ministers for Social Welfare as well as to senior officials in the Department but without success.  I do not think that the officials have given serious consideration to the matter.  The whole situation is causing a good deal of unrest among fishermen and it is leading to the dishonesty that I have described.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there is a big problem in regard to the salmon-fishing industry and I shall not labour the point other than to say that there is much unrest among salmon driftnet fishermen.  There are a number of reasons for this.  First, these fishermen consider that their operations are being restricted while at the same time they witness commercial fishing in our rivers.  The new boards have taken over the industry and we hope that they will be able to get out of the clutches of their imperial owners who in the past utilised these fisheries for their own benefit.</P>
      <P>I should like to see the Minister accelerating the purchase of some of our fisheries which are not being run properly and from which we are not getting the benefit that we should be getting.  It is annoying for fishermen to witness the type of commercial fishing that takes place in our rivers &mdash; salmon weirs, netting and so on.  One might say that the salmon going into the rivers have no escape whereas there is some chance of escape for those in the high seas.  With the old style landlord operation which, unfortunately, is still with us, fishermen have a just grievance in this matter.  It is wrong to have somebody talking about his lake or river and local salmon or trout angling clubs should be encouraged to fish in the rivers rather than having the old system operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Department are doing enough to control predators, seals and otters, which are doing so much damage to our salmon stocks.  We are not sufficiently well informed about the damage they do and often fishermen take the law <Col N="181" /> into their own hands because no one else will do anything.</P>
    <P>I hope when the fishery boards are recruiting staff we will see people who have practical knowledge, are properly trained to ensure they do their job properly and are not there just for the sake of being employed.  It would defeat the whole purpose of the Bill if people were employed who did not know what they were doing and how to tackle the future of our salmon fisheries.  They should know how to look after spawning beds.</P>
    <P>We all realise that the fishery protection system must operate, but very often the fishermen are concerned about how this work is carried out.  For instance, I have been informed of situations where the fishery protection vessels, with the aid of members of boards of conservators, came to boats that were anchored and took gear and nets without the fishermen knowing anything about it.  I am speaking as a layman &mdash; the Minister has legal knowledge &mdash; I think it was illegal to do that because the net which the fisherman uses for drifting for salmon could be used for certain types of gill fishing, cod, large type pollock and so on. The gear is confiscated, taken to some unknown destination and, if it is auctioned or put up for sale, the fisherman knows nothing about it.  When you compare that with what happens in the case of Spaniards and other foreigners who are brought before the courts regularly you will find that when their gear is auctioned they are the people who buy it back again, by getting a local person to tender for them.  This facility is not afforded to our own fishermen when their gear is confiscated and many of them would like to be in a position to buy back their nets and gear.</P>
    <P>The time has come to take urgent and positive action in relation to our future in the EEC and to find out exactly where the industry is heading.  It is crucial that we have decisions in 1982 and imperative that the Minister and the Government ensure that the best possible deal is sought for the protection of the industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate all our fishermen.  It is a tough, hazardous life. Some of them have shown great initiative <Col N="182" /> in being prepared to purchase large boats.  If we hear of somebody paying £1 million for a farm it sets headlines but a number of our fishermen have had the courage in the last few years to make that kind of investment also because they believe in themselves and in the future of the industry.  We want to see an expansion of that kind of progress and more people following the trail that has been blazed by those people who have bought boats of 120 feet or more.  That will only happen if there is confidence in the whole industry.  The uncertainty that has been hanging over the industry since we joined the EEC must be tackled and we must know the direction in which we are going in the next ten, 15 or 20 years.  The Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government must take immediate steps to ensure that we know where we stand in relation to this matter.  We on this side of the House will do everything possible to assist the Minister in his efforts.  We may appear to be critical from time to time but we try to offer constructive criticism and we will not in any way inhibit the efforts of the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government in trying to secure the best possible deal in 1982.  The industry is too important to let die but I am afraid, unless we take the steps I have outlined, that is what will happen if we do not get a better deal in Europe.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and I hope that Bord Iascaigh Mhara will have everybody's co-operation in carrying on the good work which they have been doing since they were established 30 years ago.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Cheann Comhairle as ucht cead a bheith faighte agam an cheist mhór seo a ardú sa Dáil.  Oiche Dé hAoine seo caite forgraíodh go mbeadh fiosrúchán bunaithe i dtaobh Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Mar a dúradh sa ráiteas a chuireadh amach sna nuachtáin, &ldquo;there will be an inquiry into the constitution and operation of Údarás na Gaeltachta&rdquo;.  Silim gurb i seo an chéad uair ó bunaíodh an Stát gur thug Rialtas dualgas den sórt seo i dtaobh fiosrucháin mar seo.  Tá a lán de na boird faoi láthair ag cailliúint airgid ach ni fheicim go bhfuil an Comhrialtas ag súil fiosrúcháin a chur ar bun iontu sin.</P>
      <P>Is údar mór imní an tslí in ar fograíodh an fiosruchán seo.  Níor tugadh aon réamh-eolas do Roinn na Gaeltachta, don Chathaoirleach nó do Bhord Údaras na Gaeltachta.  Dúirt Aire na Gaeltachta é féin aréir ar Radio na Gaeltachta, agus mé ag éisteacht leis, nár chuir sé féin aon mholadh den tsórt seo os comhair an Rialtais, agus cé gur cinneadh Rialtais atá ann, dúirt sé nach raibh aon bhaint phearsanta aige féin leis an gcinneadh sin: &ldquo;Cinneadh Ríaltais,&rdquo; a deir sé, &ldquo;Ní haon rud pearsanta ó mo thaobhsa é.  Ní mise a rinne an cinneadh.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Bhí a leithéid de rud ann nuair a bhí Fianna Fáil in oifig faoi fhreagracht agus mar gheall ar an chinneadh seo.  Tá an fhreagracht chéanna ar an Aire agus atá ar na baill eile den Rialtas.  Tá amhras orm le fada faoin chaoi a bhfuil an Comhrialtas seo ag dul i mbun obair an Rialtais, ach is cinnte nach bhféadfaí cinneadh den tsórt seo a ghlacadh gan treoir ó dhuine éigin in áit éigin chun comhairle a ghlacadh leis an Aire a bhfuil priomhfhreagracht aige i dtaobh an Údaráis ó thús.  Nach bhfuil sé fíor mar sin a rá go bhfuil baint dhíreach ag an Aire le cinneadh an Rialtais?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dtaobh an fhocail &ldquo;fiosrúchán&rdquo;: cén cineál fiosrucháin?  Cé bhéas ina bhun? An oifigigh na Roinne Airgeadais a bhéas ina bhun, nó oifigigh de Ranna éagsúla? An mbeidh baint ag an Ard-Aighne leis? <Col N="184" /> An bhfuil na baill ainmnithe go fóill ag an Rialtas?  An í sraith eile de Fhine Gael a bheas ina bhun?  Cad iad na cumhachtaí a bheas ag an fhiosrúchán seo?  Cé thabharfas fianaise?  An mbeidh sé faoi mhóid, an mbeidh sé faoi rún?  An mbeidh deis ag na hiriseoirí áitiúla agus náisiúnta a bheith istigh ag an fhiosrúchán?  Cad iad na téarmaí tagartha a leagfar síos don fhiosrúchán seo?  An bhfuil dáta socraithe ag an Rialtas nó ag an Aire tús a chur leis an fhiosrúchán, agus má tá, an bhfuil dáta eile socraithe crioch a chur leis an fhiosrúchán?</P>
    <P>Ceist mhór i ceist na polaitíochta.  Is é cúl-chaint i gceann de na páipéir Dhomhnaigh a chuir tús leis an gcaint seo ar fad faoi fhiosrúchán.  Aire soisialach de chuid an Rialtais seo atá anois sa Roinn Sláinte a tharraing agóid faoi chúrsaí talún i ndeisceart na tíre.  Cén chúis a bhí ag an Teachta sin an agóid i dtaobh cúrsaí talún a tharraingt suas?  An raibh aon talamh eile le díol nó le ceannach sa cheantair seachas an talamh a cheannaíodh?</P>
    <P>An dara huair gur chualamar go leor cainte faoi fhiosrúchán ná nuair a labhair maor na Gaillimhe, an teachta Ó hUigín, ball den Lucht Oibre in agallamh i gceann de na páipéir sheactainiúla Gaeilge i dtaobh, mar a deir sé, caimiléireacht san Údarás.  Chuir sé i leith an Údaráis de réir an agallaimh sin go raibh caimiléireacht ar bun san Údarás. D'fhiafraigh mise den Aire ag an am nuair a bhí an díospoireacht ar an Meastachán forlíontach anseo an mbréagnódh sé an t-alt sin.  Níl a fhios agam an ndearna nó nach ndearna ach má rinne sé ní bhfuair sé aon phoiblíocht.</P>
    <P>An triú huair a chualamar caint faoin fhiosrúchán ná nuair a labhair Aire eile sóisialach agus nuair a d'iarr sé ní amháin fiosrúchán ach fiosrúchán poiblí.  Ní hé amháin go ndearna sé caint faoi ach deimhnigh sé go raibh fiosrúchán le bheith ann.  Sin seachtain ó shin ach ní raibh tásc ná tuairisc uaidh go dtí an lá inniu.  Bhi alt i bpaipéar nach bhfuil aon aitheantas air sa tír seo, ach creidim gurb i an t-alt sin a chuir tús leis an gcaint ar fad.  An bhfuil sé ceart go gcreideann an Comhrialtas atá ann faoi láthair, chuile fhocal a scríobhtar sna páipéir?  An mar <Col N="185" /> gheall ar sin atá fiosrúchán le bheith ann anois?</P>
    <P>Céard tá curtha i leith an Údaráis.  De réir na bpáipéar is é agóid talún, amhras go rachadh airgead amú.  Má tá se sin fíor, agus má chreideann an Rialtas agus an tAire go bhfuil, nach gnó don Gharda Síochána é?  Nach iad ba chóir fiosrú a dhéanamh faoi aon cheist airgid a chur amú?</P>

      <P>Sin mar a tharlaíonn in aon Aireacht Stáit eile.  Deireann polaiteoirí éigin gur Údarás le Fianna Fáil atá ann.  Tá seachtar den Údarás tofa ag muintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá 13 baill san Údarás.  Toghadh na seachtar go daonfhlathach ag pobal na Gaeltachta. Thug an Teachta Donncha Ó Gallchobhair cinneadh, agus thug an Rialtas an cinneadh, nach mbeadh cead ag aon iarrthóir a bheadh ag dul os comhair pobal na Gaeltachta ainm aon pháirtí polaitíochta a chur i ndiaidh a ainm sa phaipéar toghcháin.  Deineadh é sin d'aon gnó i gcaoi nach bhféadfadh aon duine a rá go raibh cúrsaí polaitíochta i gceist agus creidimse go bhfuil a gcúrsaí gnótha déanta ag Bord Udarás na Gaeltachta ar bhonn neamh-pholaitiúil ó shin i leith.  B'fhéidir gur athraíodh é sin ó tháinig an Comhrialtas i gcumhacht.</P>
      <P>Tá seachtar ball tofa, mar adúirt mé, triúr acu sin is de chuid Pháirtí Fhianna Fáil iad.  Tá seisear de na baill ainmnithe. Gabhaimid síos trid an seisear go bhfeicfimid cioca atá ina mball de Fhianna Fáil.  Duine amháin acu, agus abróidh mé féin é, gur cheap mise é ar bhun gur sheas sé le pobal Gaeltachta ná raibh aon fheisíre acu ar an Údarás féin, ball a sheas thar ceann Fhianna Fáil i gceantar Ghaeltacht Chorcaigh.  Sin ceathrar atá in a mball de Fhianna Fáil as triúr déag.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá duine amháin ainmnithe thar ceann na n-oibrithe atá fostaithe ag an Údarás ar fud na Gaeltachta ar fad, fear thar ceann an Transport and General Workers Union, fear pearsanach, agus ní dóigh liom go bhféadfadh aon duine a rá gur ball de pháirtí Fhianna Fáil é sin.  Tá fear eile ainmnithe thar ceann an Údarás Forbartha <Col N="186" /> Tionscail.  Níor chuir mise aon cheist air ar bhain sé le páirtí Fhianna Fáil.  An fear atá mar chathaoirleach ar an Údarás, is bainisteoir chontae é, as an gcontae len a mbaineann an tAire é féin. Tá mé cinnte go n-aontódh an tAire liom nach dtéann sé i mbun a chuid cúrsaí bainisteoireachta contae ar bhun polaitiúil. Níl fágtha ach Rúnaí Roinn na Gaeltachta. Ta seisean ann thar ceann Roinn na Gaeltachta lena chinntiú go dtuigeann an tÚdarás, go dtuigeann an Roinn, an gnó atá acu thar ceann dul chun cinn agus forbairt na Gaeltachta.  Ní dóigh liom go bhféadfadh aon duine a rá gur fear é Rúnaí Roinn na Gaeltachta&mdash;agus tá sé i láthair anseo sa Teach anocht &mdash; a chaitheann a shaol ag plé le polaitíocht aon pháirtí polaitíochta.  Tá triúr déag ar an Údarás.  As an méid sin níl ach ceathrar a bhfuil polasaí Fhianna Fáil acu.  Ní sheasann sé sin suas.</P>
    <P>Anois, cé tá cúisithe?  Tá ar dtús comhaltaí Bhoird an Údarais fhéin.  Tá na comhaltaí atá ainmnithe cúisithe.  Tá na comhaltaí tofa agus mar gheall gur toghadh iad sin go daonlathach ag pobal na Gaeltachta, chuaigh siad amach, vótáil siad agus thogh siad iad ar Údarás dhaonlathach Gaeltachta.  Mar gheall ar sin, tá pobal na Gaeltachta féin cúisithe.  Cé eile atá cúisithe?  Creidimse go bhfuil príomh-fheidhmeannach na heagraíochta cúisithe, mar is eisean atá freagrach as polasaí an bhoird a chur chun cinn taobh istigh den eagraíocht féin agus a chinntiú go mbeidh na feidhmeannaigh agus iad siúd ar fad atá ag obair laistigh den Udarás ag dul ar aghaidh ar mhaithe le dul chun cinn na Gaeltachta agus le polasaí an bhoird a cur i gcrích. Ar deireadh, tá siad siúd ar fad atá ag obair taobh istigh den Údarás féin sa gceann áras sna Forbacha cúisithe.  Céard atá curtha ina leith?  Níl a fhios againn mar níl aon eolas tugtha dúinn ag an Rialtas fós.  Mar adúirt mé, tá bord an Údaráis, na baill tofa, na baill ainmnithe agus feidhmeannaigh agus oibrithe an Údaráis cúisithe.</P>
    <P>Cuirfidh sé sin lag-mhisneach, orthu siúd atá fostaithe in ard oifig an Údaráis sna Forbacha.  Chonaic mise i gcaitheamh na deireadh seachtaine ó fógraíodh é seo san oíche Dé hAoine seo caite an lag-mhisneach <Col N="187" /> atá curtha aige, ní hé amháin orthu siúd atá ag obair go díreach istigh san Údarás ach an lag-mhisneach atá curtha aige orthu siúd atá ag obair sna tionscail ar fud na Gaeltachta, orthu siúd a raibh aon bhaint acu i mblianta a chuaigh thart nó a bhfuil baint acu faoi láthair leis an Údarás.  Tá lag-mhisneach orthu siúd.  Caithfear an t-aer a ghlanadh agus má chreideann an Rialtas go bhfuil caimiléireacht ar siúl, dá thúisce mar sin a thosóidh an fiosrúchán anois isea is fearr é.</P>
    <P>Cén dochar atá déanta ag fógairt an fhiosruithe seo?  Ar dtús creidimse agus creidim go gcreideann an tAire freisin é, go bhfuil an t-uafás dochair déanta aige don chomhoibriú agus do na baill atá idir Údarás na Gaeltachta agus pobal na Gaeltachta go ginearálta.  Tá dochar déanta aige do na tograí fiúntacha a bhfuil ag eirí leo agus a bhfuil beagnach ceithre mhíle duine fostaithe iontu ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Níos measa ná sin, tá amhras cothaithe ag fógairt an fhiosruithe seo in intinn aon tionscloir atá faoi láthair i mbun comhráití no atá ag plé leis an Údarás faoi láthair le tionscal a bhunú sa Ghaeltacht amach anseo agus fostaíocht a chur ar fáil do phobal na Gaeltachta. Tá amhras cothaithe aige freisin i measc an lucht airgeadais a chuireann airgead i bhfoirm iocaíochtaí, i bhfoirm iasachtaí ó na bainc mhóra nó aon fhoinse airgeadais eile sa tír.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí mise mar Aire na Gaeltachta, shocraigh an bord ag an am go ndéanfaimis athbhreithniú ar an gcomórtas forbartha pobail.  Labhair mise agus príomh-fheidhmeannach an Údaráis le tionsclóirí móra na tíre seo agus d'iarramar orthu teacht isteach agus tacadh le Údarás na Gaeltachta, tacadh le dul chun cinn pobail bheaga anseo is ansúid ar fud Gaeltachtaí na tíre, agus níl aon dabht ná iad siúd atá ag cur airgid ar fáil do chomórtas forbartha pobail ná gurb iad sin tionsclóirí móra na tíre seo. An bhfuil an tAire in ann a rá an leanfar leis an cineál sin airgeadadh i mbliana nó an chéad bhliain eile.  Ní dóigh liomsa go bhféadfadh aon tionsclóir mór geallúint a thabhairt anois go bhféadfadh seisean leanúint ar aghaidh nuair atá airgead cothaithe <Col N="188" /> ag an Rialtas ins an eagraíocht ina bhfuil sé féin.</P>
    <P>Tá sé ráite ag polaiteoirí ar an dtaobh sin den Teach gur cuireadh airgead an Údaráis amú i mblianta a chuaigh thart. Tá sé ráite gur cuireadh airgead isteach i dtionscail go raibh sé chomh maith a chur i bpoll.  Aontóidh chuile dhuine gur cuireadh airgead i dtionscail nár éirigh leo ar chúis amháin nó ar chúis eile, ach creidimse má rinne an tÚdarás tada ó chuaigh siad i gcumhacht gur thógadar cinneadh láidir, cinneadh misniúil dhá bhliain go leith ó shin nó mar sin nuair a shocraíodar deireadh a chur leis an gcineál sin tionscail, tionscail nach raibh aon tsúil acu go n-eireodh leis amach anseo. Creidim gur cinneadh misniúil é sin do dhaoine a bhí tofa go daonlathach ag pobal na Gaeltachta agus ar chuir sé isteach go mór orthu féin go pearsanta b'fhéidir ina gceantair féin dá gcuirfí deireadh leo siúd.</P>
    <P>Nuair a thógadar cinneadh misniúil den tsórt sin, sílimse gur cheart go dtabharfaidh an Rialtas seans dóibh dul i mbun a ngnótha agus má tá tuilleadh de na tionscail seo ar fud na Gaeltachta anseo is ansúd go mbeadh deis acu an cinneadh céanna a thógáil ina leith siúd.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí mise mar Aire Gaeltachta bhí me géar go minic ar Údarás na Gaeltachta. Bhí mé géar go pearsanta, go priomháideach agus bhí mé géar go poiblí.  Mar urlabhraí Ghaeltachta sa bhFreasúra thug mé agallamh do Radio na Gaeltachta tá trí seachtaine ó shin inar dhúirt mé go raibh fadhbanna leis an Údarás.  Bhí mé géar ach creidim go raibh mé dearfa agus creidim go bhfuil sé fiorthábhachtach ar mhaithe leis an Údarás agus ar mhaithe le dul chun cinn na Gaeltachta go mbeadh aon duine, aon pholaiteoir, is cuma ar urlabhraí nó Aire atá i gceist, géar chun maitheasa na heagraíochta, chun maitheasa na Gaeltachta, chun maitheasa na tíre, sa deireadh thiar, go mbeimís géar, go mbeimís criticiuil ach go mbeimís freisin dearfa.</P>
    <P>An rud is mó a chuireann alltacht ormsa faoin bhfiosrúchán seo ná an tslí inar fógraíodh é.  Níl a fhios agam ar fhógair Rialtas ar bith sa tir seo cinneadh chomh tábhachtach leis an gcineál seo in abairt amháin no i ndá abairt, rud a thuig <Col N="189" /> na paipéir agus na meáin chumarsáide go ginearálta.  An rud a fheicimse atá ag tarlú ná rud ar bith a thagann chomh fada leis an tSionainn go gcuirtear stop le haon airgead d'aon áit atá taobh thiar de sin agus go bhfoire Dia ar an Aire, mar tá cosúlacht ar an Aire le breathnú air go bhfuil an-deacrachtaí aige sa Rialtas faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Cuireann sé alltacht orm freisin nuair atá cinneadh le tógáil, is cuma an cinneadh misniúil é, nó cinneadh ceart nó cinneadh mí-cheart, nach é an ComhRialtas a fhógraíonn é ach gur Aire soisialach nach bhfuil ina bhall den Rialtas ar chor ar bith a fhógraíonn an cinneadh seo.  Tharla sé i gcás roinnt rudaí eile in iarthar na hÉireann cheana.  Tharla sé i gcás cursaí cánach.  Tá sé ag tarlú anois gur Aire soisialach a d'fógair an fiosrúchán seo tá seachtain ó shin ann, agus cuireann sé i gceist an bhfuil níos mó cumhachta ag Aire sóisialach nach bhfuil ina bhall den Rialtas ná mar atá ag Aire Rialtais sinsireach a bhíonn istigh ag cruinnithe an Rialtais.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir go raibh sé soiléir nuair a tháinig na Meastacháin amach go raibh rud éigin ag tarlú do Údarás na Gaeltachta. Nuair a bhreathnaíonn tú ar chúrsaí meastacháin an Údaráis don bhliain seo, feiceann tú ar a bpointe go bhfuil gearradh siar ar mheastacháin chaipitil 37 faoin gcéad seachas mar a bhí anuraidh.  Ciallaíonn sé sin go soiléir nach mbeidh deis ag an Údarás, nach mbeadh an t-airgead acu, dul ar aghaidh le monarchana a thógáil, nó na monarchana atá a dtógáil faoi láthair ní bheidh deis acu iad a chríochnú.  Má bhreathnaíonn tú ar na meastacháin iomlán do Údarás na Gaeltachta feicfidh tú go bhfuil ciorrú 23.5 faoin gcéad agus ní thógann sé sin an ráta boilscithe ag an am i gceist ar chor ar bith.  Má chuireann tú é sin leis, tá sé suas go dtí 40 faoin gcéad.  Mar sin, b'fhéidir gur cheart go mbeimís ag súil go mbeadh cinneadh den tsórt sin á thógáil ag an Rialtas atá ann faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Feicimse gur red herring atá sa fógra ar fad.  Feicim dáiríre, nuair a labhraíonn an Rialtas faoi bhunreacht, is cuma an bunreacht le, mar a dúirt an tAire aréir, caipiteal C nó c beag atá i gceist, feicim gurb é an bunús atá leis ná go gcreideann <Col N="190" /> an Rialtas seo gur cheart deireadh a chur le Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Más fiór é sin, is céim siar é ní hé amháin don Ghaeltacht ná do phobal na Gaeltachta ach don tír ar fad.  Beidh suim agam san méid a bheidh le rá ag an Aire mar ní dúirt sé tada san agallamh a thug sé aréir.</P>

      <P>Pavlov agus a mhadraí chomh mhaith.  Tá dul amú mór ar an Teachta in a lán rudaí a dúirt sí.  I dtosach, níor fhógair an Rialtas go raibh fiosrúchán le bheith ann.  Bhí ráflaí ar pháipéir nuachta an tseachtain seo caite. I ngeall ar na ráflaí sin, cuireadh ceist ar Oifig an Rialtais an raibh sé fíor, an raibh sé i gceist fiosruchán a bheith ann agus &mdash; níl sé de nós agamsa nó ag an Rialtas bréaga a insint &mdash; tugadh an t-eolas go raibh sé ar intinn ag an Rialtas fiosruchán a chur ar bun.</P>
      <P>Is mar fhreagra ar cheist ó na meáin chumarsáide a tugadh an tuairisc, agus is é an fáth nár dearnadh ráiteas, nár tugadh an t-eolas agus nach dtabharfaí an t-eolas ach amháin mar fhreagra ar cheist dhíreach, is é an fáth go raibh an t-eolas coinnithe siar go dtí seo agus go gcoinneofaí siar é ar feadh tamaill eile ná go mbeadh rudaí socraithe maidir le foireann a fhiosraithe i dtosach agus téarmaí tagartha an fhiosraithe agus cén saghas daoine a dhéanfadh an fiosrú.  Níor socraíodh aon cheann des na nithe sin agus sin é an fáth nach ndearnadh tagairt dó i ráiteas nó ar bhealach ar bith eile go dtí seo.</P>
      <P>Dúirt an Teachta go ndearna Aire Stáit i ráiteas ag tabhairt le fios go mbeadh a leithéid ann.  Ní dúirt an tAire Stáit a leithéid.  Is é a dúirt sé ná an méid a bhí ar eolas aige siúd &mdash; agus sin ceist dó siúd &mdash; faoi chúrsaí an Údaráis, go mba cheart go mbeadh fiosrú ann agus go ndéanfadh seisean iarratas le fiosrú a fháil.

Ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl don Teachta gur deineadh an cinneadh seo chomh fada siar leis an 8 Nollaig.  Is é an fáth gur tháinig an Rialtas ar an chinneadh seo ná go raibh suimeanna móra airgid á íoc ag Údarás na Gaeltachta le comhlachtaí a bhí i dtrioblóid.  Is é an cinneadh a rinneadh ag an am ná go mba cheart breathnú isteach i gcursaí an Udaráis ar fad chun a fháil amach cén chaoi a d'fhéadfadh an Rialtas cabhrú leis an Údarás ina gcuid oibre agus cén chaoi is fearr a dfhéadfaí airgead a chaitheamh ar thógraí sa Ghaeltacht ionas go mbeadh teacht isteach acu agus go mbeadh luach ar fáil ar an airgead a chaithfí.</P>

Níl rud polaitiúil ar bith i gceist anseo.  Is é atá i gceist ná go bhfuil airgead poiblí á chaitheamh, go bhfuil sé de dhualgas ar an Rialtas chomh maith leis an Údarás cinntiú chomh fada agus is féidir go gcaithfear an t-airgead sin ar bhonn cheart agus go n-iarrfar teacht isteach as, mar airgead poiblí atá i gceist.</P>

The initial provision of £20,000 for the National Concert Hall was only tentative and a more accurate estimate of costs for the year was not feasible until the National Concert Hall Company had been established.  A Supplementary Estimate of £130,000 for the company was passed prior to the summer recess.  A subsequent adjustment of the pay provision for my Department was necessary due to pay increases awarded after the Estimates had been settled.

An application was, however, received from a person with a different Christian name and the same address, and this may be the case in question. If so, the position is that under the Housing Regulations, 1980 (as amended), it was a condition of payment that the works be satisfactorily completed on or before 30 June 1981, and a claim for payment of the grant received in the Department on or before that date.

      <P>The claimant is also in receipt of two disablement pensions in respect of accidents at work in 1972 and 1976 and the payment of these pensions due at the end of December 1981 was withheld pending review of the amounts payable.  Payment has since been made and all pension due to 29 January 1982 has been paid.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 4 July 1981 but was not entitled to payment as, according to the records of my Department, he had less than the minimum of 26 contributions to his credit in the 1979-80 contribution year which governed his claim.  Following inquiries it was established that he had been employed in the United Kingdom during that period.  On receipt of his British insurance record payment of all disability benefit due from 8 July 1981, fourth day of incapacity, to 8 August 1981, after which date he was certified fit to resume work, was issued on 22 January 1982.</P>

      <P>A review of the means of the couple concerned was carried out in October 1981 in the course of investigation of the wife's claim to a non-contributory old age pension.  She was subsequently awarded a pension of £10.75 a week by decision of the local pension committee dated 13 November 1981.  Her means, consisting of half the weekly value of a holding, entitle her to a pension at this rate.  No appeal was lodged against the committee's decision.</P>
      <P>Due to an increase in the means of the husband since his pension was awarded in 1977 a question for reduction of his pension to the appropriate rate of £10.75, with effect from 20 November 1981, has been referred to the local pension committee for decision.  If he is dissatisfied with the committee's decision he may appeal against it within 21 days from the date it is conveyed to him.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that what the Deputy has in mind is the collective cost of individuals becoming unemployed.  The information sought is not available from PRSI records. To the extent that the data sought is available, the sources from which it has been extracted are indicated below.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  The main loss in direct taxation would arise on income tax receipts and on pay-related social security contributions. Changes in direct tax revenue from year to year consequent on changes in the level and composition of unemployment <Col N="71" /> are a function of individual earnings before unemployment, the incidence of re-employment and the duration of unemployment.  Since taxation statistics are not available which would enable the information requested by the Deputy to be compiled, it is not possible to indicate the loss of direct taxation in the years in question.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> (b)  Corresponding information on the aggregate loss of indirect taxation revenue arising in respect of unemployed persons is not available; there would of course be some offsetting indirect taxation revenue generated by the expenditure by the unemployed of financial assistance received by them.</P>
    <P>(c)  Expenditure by way of unemployment relief from State funds.</P>

    <P>(i)  The tax increase figures and the estimated yields consist of excise duty and consequential VAT.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The estimate for cigarettes is based on the assumption that the increase in the duty on cigarettes would be accompanied by proportionate increases on other tobacco products.</P>
    <P>(iii)  The estimate for LPG refers to both automotive and non-automotive LPG.</P>
    <P>(iv)  The estimate for other oils includes auto-diesel.</P>
    <P>(v)  The VAT figures leave out of account zero rated agricultural inputs (fertilisers, feeding stuffs, seed, fuel, animal medicines) and positive rated agricultural inputs (machinery, and repairs, services) to the extent that farmers are compensated by means of the 1.5 per cent flat-rate system for such inputs.</P>
    <P>(vi)  The special reduced VAT rate of 3 per cent applies to building services generally and to certain agricultural services.  An increase in this rate of VAT has no direct effect on the CPT.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not clear what precisely the Deputy means by the effect on the consumer price index as provided by the estimate of £45 million in 1982.  However, an allocation of £45 million, based on the current consumption of bread, would work out at a subsidy rate of approximately <Col N="82" /> 17p per 800 gramme loaf, and reduce the consumer price index by 0.86 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the existing time table of the service to Clifden community school from the general Roundstone area is necessitated by the other work which the vehicle involved is required to do, i.e., a post primary service from the Ballyconnealy area to Clifden and a primary school transport service to Ballyconneely national school.  However, I would be perturbed if children eligible for free transport were obliged to meet the time table outlined by the Deputy and would consider it unacceptable.  In a situation like this, it would obviously help if the parents could let the Department know as soon as possible; in this case, no complaints were received.</P>
      <P>I am having the matter further investigated and will communicate the results of that investigation to the Deputy with a view to improving the situation if at all possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the primary school transport scheme, when a school is closed and amalgmated with another school, free transport for children in the closed school area is generally given only to the school of amalgamation.  The children in question reside in the area of Turin closed school which was amalgamated with Loughegar national school.  They are therefore eligible for free transport thereto, and a service is available should they wish to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Transport has been conceded on a free basis for the third family mentioned by <Col N="85" /> the Deputy and on a fare-paying basis for the first family.  These concessions were given on the basis of the situation as it existed up to 1978.  The second family mentioned by the Deputy applied for a similar concession after the management of Loughegar school had objected to the concession being granted and it was decided that while the concession would be continued for those who already had it, nobody else should be allowed it.</P>
    <P>Due to a reorganisation of services in the area, the families to whom the concession was granted now reside 1.1 and 1.4 miles from the service to Killulagh. This standard of service is considered adequate, having regard to the general standards existing throughout the country as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 369 and 370 together.</P>
      <P>I have had representations from the local community about the policing arrangements for Tyrrellspass.  The position is that the detailed deployment of members of the force is a matter to be decided primarily by the Commissioner. The precise arrangements for policing particular local areas are made by or in consultation with the local Garda officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that they consider that the current arrangement whereby the Tyrrellspass area is served from Rochfortbridge station makes the best use of Garda resources and provides an adequate service. The area also receives attention from <Col N="89" /> the district patrol car and the traffic unit car based at Mullingar.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have also informed me that they have had no recent reports of vandalism in the Tyrrellspass area.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of arranging for a Garda to reside in Tyrrellspass, the position is that, save where official accommodation is provided, the accepted practice in the Garda Síochána is that a member is free to live where he chooses provided he does not live at an unreasonable distance from his station and I do not think that a case for curtailing this freedom has been established.</P>
