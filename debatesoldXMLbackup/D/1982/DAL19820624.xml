      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 4 to 24, inclusive, and 31.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I want to ask the Taoiseach when he intends to introduce a Bill to amend section 35 (1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  As the Taoiseach is aware, the Tánaiste promised this amendment over six months ago.  There appears to be no evidence of the amendment coming forward.  Will the Taoiseach make the necessary amendment before the summer recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals are with the interested parties, the FUE and the ICTU.  I expect to be able to bring the measure to the House shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Will that measure be enacted before the Dáil goes into recess? As the Minister for Social Welfare is aware, almost 100 workers are being deprived of social welfare benefits in Castlecomer as a result of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not being deprived under the legislation as it stands.  As the legislation stands they cannot get benefit, but that matter is being discussed currently.  In fact, proposals <Col N="1468" /> have been put to the ICTU for consideration in line with the views expressed by the Tánaiste earlier.  We expect to be back before the House rises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be quite clear on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Waterford) Mr. Gallagher (Waterford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> The Taoiseach was present at negotiations with members of our party on this section which is being used by employers &mdash; it is a matter of public knowledge; there is no secret about it &mdash; to deny workers their rightful entitlements.  It happened in Clover Meats.  Currently it is happening in Castlecomer.  It is happening to casual dockers.  This section of the Act is being used and abused by employers to deny workers their rightful entitlements and literally to starve them into submission so that they will have to accept worse conditions of employment than they currently enjoy.  A commitment was given to amend that section because it was recognised quite clearly that it was being abused by employers.  I cannot accept a situation in which the Minister says negotiations are going on.  There was a definite commitment.  Before this House goes into recess, if it does go into recess, will we see that commitment adhered to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The negotiations to which the Deputy refers took place initially. Following that, firm proposals were put quite recently to both sides.  I had a meeting with the people concerned to tease out the elements involved.  Firm proposals have now been put, and I have every confidence that a measure can be introduced before the House rises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the importance of this matter I am anxious to know when these proposals were put to the ICTU.  I should not like it to go from this House, from what the Minister said, that the ICTU are in any way delaying the enactment of this very urgent legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no notice of this and therefore I cannot give the exact date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is confusing two elements.  The first is that the ICTU were asked for views in the first instance by my predecessor.  When I took office I asked for their views on this matter.  At that stage they said their views would be forthcoming and subsequently said it was a matter for me to put forward proposals in effect without receiving views, which I did slightly over a week ago.  I would have to get the date for the Deputy.  I expect to have it finalised almost immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, can I get a commitment from the Minister and the Taoiseach that this amendment to section 35 will be enacted before the Dáil goes into recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly bring forward the measure.  I expect to have it back to the Government for approval very shortly.  It is a matter for the Whips then, and the business of the House.  As the Deputy knows, we have some very important measures which we are waiting to get through the House &mdash; for instance, the National Community Development Agency Bill, which is being held up repeatedly because of protracted discussions in other areas.  It is a matter for the Whips after that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>,<i>Mayo West):</i> I want to raise a matter in connection with an incident which took place in the House last night after the first vote when some Deputies were jeered and given a slow hand clap from the Opposition benches as they walked across the floor.  A Cheann Comhairle, is it proposed that any action will be taken by you in relation to this matter?  This is a time of year when we have young people from the country and students in the Visitors' Gallery.  Surely we can expect higher standards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was anxious to get some clarification arising out of the remarks made by the Minister for Social Welfare.  He indicated that specific proposals had been made to the FUE in regard to the suggested amendment of section 35 of the consolidation Act. Would the Minister indicate to this House what these specific proposals were?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In this situation I want the Taoiseach to indicate if he is serious in saying that there will be proposals, so that we will be aware of what his thinking and policy in this regard are.  In the light of the fact that he has made these proposals available to an outside body, at least the Members of this House should be aware of them.  If he does not want to <Col N="1471" /> talk about them here in this House, he should make copies available to us on request.  I am now so requesting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday morning I sought permission to raise on the Adjournment the very serious incidence of water pollution in the Minister area and the Minister informed me that it was out of order because the matter was not one of ministerial responsibility but was the responsibility of the local authority. I look upon this as a buck-passing exercise by the Minister.  He is giving the responsibility to the local authority but not providing the finance to them to carry out their responsibilities.  I would like to raise the matter tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Pattison's query to the Minister for Social Welfare, could the Minister outline briefly to the House the nature of the positive proposals that he has put to outside organisations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows very well, it is the normal procedure to discuss with the parties involved and who are likely to be concerned the points of legislation proposed.  As soon as I have definite proposals to put to the House I will put them to the House and the Deputy <Col N="1472" /> will have every opportunity then to discuss them and present his views on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand clearly and accept that it is normal to consult outside organisations.  The Minister has stated this morning that he has made definite proposals with regard to the changing of legislation.  Surely this House is entitled on request to a brief outline of the nature of these definite proposals which he has communicated to at least two outside organisations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proper parliamentary procedure to put specific proposals regarding legislation to outside bodies? I would have thought that one seeks the views of outside bodies with a view to framing legislation but that the first people who should know about specific legislation are Members of this House, after the Government.  Am I to understand that the Minister has reversed things by putting specific proposals to an outside body for their approval prior to coming to this House or to the Upper House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister what approximate revenue will be raised by the subject matter of this resolution in 1982 and 1983.  I should like to know the difference between the amount of revenue that will be raised by this proposal in regard to benefits in kind as against the amount of revenue that would have been raised by the proposal contained in the March budget which has been somewhat amended by the proposal now in the Finance Bill in respect of 1982 and 1983.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate also the revenue of the original proposal in the January budget?</P>

      <P>I see.  Will the Minister say what implications this will have for the motor industry?  Some concern has been expressed about the matter and I should like to have his view on that point. Some people think this will lead to significant problems for the motor industry but, on the other hand, I realise that most cars are imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, I should like the Minister to <Col N="1482" /> tell us what impact this proposal will have and whether companies will have an incentive to keep renewing cars frequently rather than to retain existing cars for a longer time.  I ask that question in view of the valuation that has been used.  People will be taxed a number of years afterwards on the basis of a proportion of the new value of the car.  If they are going to be taxed in any event on the new value of the car this will give them an incentive to get a new car every year.  It might lead to a situation where people would have an artificial incentive to have new cars they might not need when, in the national interest, they would be better to keep existing cars.  This would be less of a burden on the balance of payments and would give more employment in the motor repair industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the amount of revenue that is expected to be collected in respect of the change in the benefit in kind on company cars?  I wish to know why it is considered necessary to assess the company car benefit in kind as a percentage of the cost.  These changes have been made since the January proposals and the March budget.  However, the amount is still based on the original cost of the car and over the lifetime of the car it will be a percentage each year of the original cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know why that should be the basis rather than the normal basis relative to the written down value where your take X percentage of the cost in the first year and you take the same percentage of the written down value the next year and so on.  I see no legitimate basis because, as Deputy Bruton has pointed out, the temptation will be to keep replacing one's company car with a new <Col N="1483" /> car since the assessment will be on the percentage of cost at all times.  My view is that the change being made in this company car benefit in kind legislation is not necessary.  I believe it is wrong.  I believe some civil servants are perhaps envious of people in outside employments who have the benefit of company cars and this was a way of getting at them. Of course civil servants get mileage allowances which are far greater than those given to people in outside employment. My gut feeling is that when this change was being considered in either Deputy John Bruton's time or in the time of the present Minister that was the basic idea behind the change.</P>
    <P>It was an accepted principle of benefit in kind legislation until about five years ago that one should be taxed on the actual cash benefit.  This is completely arbitrary and goes against that principle.  People will now be assessed on a percentage of the cost of the car willy-nilly irrespective of whether or not it is a benefit.  I see no justification for this.  The amount of money collected will be quite small because I imagine employers will find ways of getting around this in some way or other.  I will not go into the problems created for the motor industry at this stage but I assert that this change is completely unnecessary.  That is my honest opinion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the points raised so far are points which can more relevantly be raised on the appropriate section when we come to Committee Stage.  I understood the resolutions would be formally agreed to and discussion would take place on the relevant sections on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the points raised by Deputy Bruton, it was intended that about £2 million additional revenue would come in this year.  In the proposals in the Bill the amount will be £1.5 million approximately.  I do not think any problems will be created for the motor industry or that there will be an incentive created for new cars.  What is being done is a real benefit in kind.  That would have <Col N="1484" /> been the situation in Deputy Bruton's budget also.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy McCreevy, if one wants to be fair one must take the actual cost of a car as a determining factor.  With regard to his argument about mileage allowances, I said on Second Stage that I was looking very carefully into that aspect and it would be a logical step to move towards correcting the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem here to which I would like the Minister to direct his attention between now and the time at which we reach the relevant section on Committee Stage.  This proposal appeared for the first time on 2 June and so it does seem a bit unfair to backdate it now to 6 April.  If people had known this was in prospect they might not have entered into commitments on the basis of receiving these loans since this proposal will diminish the value of the loans and put their recipients in a different situation. They find themselves caught now. This retrospective legislation is a bit unfair.  Would it be possible for the Minister to implement this from 2 June since no notice was given of it in the budget? There would be no objection to this.  This proposal was not contained in the budget.</P>

I understood, when the Minister referred to the fact that I was the only person who claimed to have discussed amendments with this company, that these discussions concerned the problems of this company who had approached both the Minister and me.  They conveyed to me that the Minister, or someone acting on behalf of the Minister, had conveyed to them that if the Minister thought that we would object he might propose amendments on Committee Stage to relieve the position of these companies, so that they would not go out of operation because a 25 per cent charge would be put on the policies.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a considerable need to ask the Minister to clarify publicly the precise import of motion No. 22.  The Minister indicated that in future gifts and inheritances received by a beneficiary from different sources would be aggregated to determine capital acquisition tax liability.  Under the existing arrangements, as I understand it, only gifts and inheritances acquired from the same disponer are added together.  It now appears that the Bill provides that aggregation would apply to benefits within each particular class of beneficiary but not across classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A serious situation has developed here in relation to what is now contained in the Finance Bill because, as we know, section 94 provides for the aggregation of all gifts and inheritances taken by a donee from all disponers within a particular class to which the tables refer.  These tables are in the third schedule of the Capital Acquisition Tax Act, 1976.  Gifts and inheritances made before 2 June 1982 are ignored under the CAT schedule.  For example, it appears that an individual who received £150,000 from each of his parents prior to 2 June under this resolution and amendments can now receive a further £150,000 from either or both parents without liability.  Whereas up to now, one had an exemption to the extent of £300,000, it now appears, from my reading of the resolution and examination of the third schedule of the Capital Acquisition Tax Act, 1976, that somebody has convinced the Government that the figure should be increased to £600,000.  My interpretation of the last actions of the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, was that he did not intend at any stage that that should be so.  Has a new provision been made or is my interpretation incorrect?  If it is now so &mdash; and I shall finish the point &mdash; it means that whereas up to now a parent could give £150,000 to a son or daughter, and another parent could give £150,000 &mdash; a £300,000 exemption without liability &mdash; it appears that that is now being increased to £600,000.  I may be wrong but, if there <Col N="1495" /> is a drafting error, I should be glad to hear it.  As I understand it with regard to Resolution No. 22 we are on to a very major issue here.</P>

      <P>I must say I do not understand the thinking behind this section of the Bill.  I am inclined to agree with Deputy Desmond's interpretation.  I do not understand the need for the changes in the contents of the Bill, in the wording of this section.  Indeed my interpretation of that section would suggest that the changes have a sinister intention which can do no good whatsoever, in fact the reverse, can do a lot of harm.  I should be glad also if the Minister would clarify this section of the Bill and explain the need for the changes in its wording.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably the reading of the situation has led to this query.  The fact is that there will be greater liability under these provisions.  As regards the points raised about having this apply across classes, that could not be done; there were technical difficulties there. Therefore it was within the classes only that we could do it.  The point raised about greater benefits accruing from this is not true.  The situation up until 2 June was that a child could get up to £300,000 from parents.  From here on, that is not so; they can get only £150,000.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that I can raise the matter at length on section 94 of the Bill.  But my question is: is it true that there has been a quite deliberate change in the provision whereby, within the classes, it is now possible for a parent to give, or for an individual to receive from his parents, a further £150,000 in total from either or both of them without liability?  That is my reading of it; I may be wrong but I read it that way.  For example, are we ignoring gifts made prior to 2 June 1982?</P>

      <P>In other words there is there an ambiguity which could be exploited and would negative the whole intention of the Bill.  I am not a parliamentary draftsman but I have been advised as well, and I take the advice I have been given, that there is ambiguity or a loophole here that could be exploited, perhaps not at all intended by the Minister but nevertheless the danger exists of an interpretation such as that outlined by Deputy Desmond.</P>

As I have said, before 2 June one could receive up to £300,000 but, from here on, 2 June, one can get £150,000 only.  In so far as retrospection is concerned, if one has received the £300,000 before one cannot get another £150,000 now.  That was another point raised by Deputy Desmond.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister for further clarification?  As I understand it the position is the opposite to what Deputy Desmond was maintaining &mdash; that the gifts will be aggregated and the one exemption limit will apply.  Up to now a father could give a gift of up to say, £150,000, a mother could give a gift to her son of up to £150,000 as well, different thresholds related to different blood relationships, uncles to nephews and so on.  Each time a gift was given the particular exemption limit for that uncle to nephew would apply.  Now what will happen is that if there are three uncles, whereas until now they could each give up to their threshold, the effect will be that there will be one exemption limit and the three figures will be aggregated, giving one exemption limit.  Therefore it is a penalty section, the opposite to what Deputy Desmond was maintaining, and there will be greater tax revenue collected under the amendment put forward. Am I correct in my understanding of it?</P>

      <P>I think the Minister should advert to section 94 (a) 4. which says:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of paragraph 6, the tax chargeable on the taxable value of a taxable gift of a taxable inheritance, in the case where the donee or successor has previously taken one or more taxable gifts or taxable inheritances on or after the 2nd day of June, 1982, to which the same appropriate Table applied,...</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would confirm my understanding on two examples.  If you have a beneficiary who, prior to 2 June &mdash; with the exemptions that applied up to then &mdash; received £150,000 from each of his parents no liability was incurred on that £300,000. He can now receive, after 2nd June, a further £150,000 but would be liable for the duty on that £150,000 if it came from one of the parents; is that the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that he cannot get an allowance for the second £150,000 &mdash; he has already got up to £300,000 and he has got £150,000 of it from one or other of the people who will be giving him the second £150,000, so he would be taxable on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If the same person, having received £300,000 from his parents before 2 June, receives £150,000 from an uncle after 2 June, the £150,000 exemption would apply in that case under what the Minister is proposing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like this clarified somewhat further.  If I might take an example and put it to the Minister.  Let us take a situation in which a mother and father who are tenants in common of a firm, we have the acquisitions prior to the Finance Bill 1982 and they are not cumulative; then after 1982 the position will be more open.  I might illustrate it as follows: we have the father who gives the transfer, during his life, to his son of £250,000, tax free.  This is the prior-to-1982 situation. Then we have the after-1982 situation, where the mother wills her portion of £300,000 tax free and we have the £150,000 threshold.  So the farm relief would be half the value up to £200,000, and we get the £150,000.  In this example £550,000 can be transferred tax free. <Col N="1499" /> Would the Minister clarify my fears on that one?</P>

      <P>There have been a number of newspaper articles on this. That is how the matter came to my attention. There have been several articles by experts on agricultural tax.  I am left under no illusion that, whereas my former colleague, Deputy J. Bruton, was definitely holding the line and the limit was £300,000, there has been an amendment which has been quite deliberately put in.  I want an assurance from the Minister that on Report Stage the matter will be put right.  It is a very serious matter because now, in relation to capital acquisitions tax, the exemption limits have been raised from £300,000 to £550,000. That is because aggregation now appears to be permissible.  Will the Minister agree to re-examine the point raised and ensure that on Report Stage, if an amendment is necessary, it will be put in to make it absolutely clear that the point raised by Deputy Spring and I as well as my other colleagues cannot be construed in that way?</P>

      <P>Deputy Barry Desmond is trying to create an impression that details of this were announced previously. Neither the January nor the March budget went into details.  It was not until 2 June that details were announced.  the details which were announced are as we are dealing with here.  We will still be dealing with the matter on Committee Stage &mdash; we do not have to wait until Report Stage &mdash; when we can go into all the points that have been raised.  I can allay the fears of Deputies.  What was intended on 2 June is still the case.  That is the reality.  As I have already told Deputy McCreevy, there will be greater liability in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the principal features of the January budget and the relevant sentence is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1500" /> All gifts and inheritances received by a beneficiary from all sources will in future be aggregated to determine the tax liability on each benefit.</P>
    <P>The question there is of interpreting whether the &ldquo;in future&rdquo; refers to &ldquo;received and aggregated&rdquo; or just refers to &ldquo;aggregated&rdquo;.  This is the relevant consideration. The budget statement of January said:</P>
    <P>Firstly, there will be a new aggregation basis for the tax.  Under existing arrangements, only gifts and inheritance acquired by an individual from the same disponor are added together. This enables someone to obtain, for example, £150,000 from both of his parents free of tax.  In future, all gifts and inheritances received by a benificiary from all sources will be aggregated to determine the tax liability on each benefit.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;in future&rdquo; could refer to &ldquo;received&rdquo;, that is only gifts received in future.  The wording in both instances in the January budget is not crystal clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It was repeated in the March budget as well.  I have already explained that technical anomalies about doing it across the classes have arisen.  It is not possible and it would create all sorts of confusion depending on the times of transfer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>He writes very clearly.  He said in this article:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To reduce the burden of Gift Tax it is important that the farm be owned jointly by husband and wife as tenants &mdash; in common &mdash; not as &ldquo;joint tenants&rdquo;. A property does not have to be held exactly 50-50 by husband and wife; it <Col N="1501" /> can be held between the two in any agreed portion.  With good tax planning, it is possible to avoid tax on property worth £600,000 in land, livestock and machinery.  Passed on directly from father to son, this estate would carry a gift tax of £137,000 &mdash; a staggering figure.  A planned approach on a £600,000 farming enterprise would be:</P>
    <P>£250,000 given to wife or tenant in common, this in turn would be willed to the succeeding son.  £250,000, willed by husband to the succeeding son. £100,000, willed by husband to child &mdash; or wife of succeeding son.  In this way gift tax would be nil.</P>
    <P>My assertion is that the particular position here has been changed between the January budget and the March budget. Has a change been put in to give effect to this?  If it has not been put in or if it is in by way of error, it will have to come out again either on Committee Stage or on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>This resolution relates to two sections which it is intended to insert on Committee Stage &mdash; amendments Nos. 93 and 94 as new sections 61 and 62.  They will thus appear in Chapter 10 of the Bill.  That is the chapter containing provisions specifically related to preventing avoidance or evasion of tax. Both sections would have the effect of denying taxpayers the right to reduce or eliminate the tax bill by availing of possible loopholes in the law relating to taxation on chargeable gains.

      <P>Fair enough, I accept that.  I am not at all suggesting that the Minister is acting other than in the best <Col N="1503" /> possible manner.  However, I would like him to elaborate somewhat on what exactly is involved here.  Very often anti-avoidance measures devised at short notice &mdash; as this would seem to be, given that it was circulated only this morning &mdash; can have all sorts of unintended effects which can cause great problems.  An example as far as property transactions are concerned was the 30 per cent witholding tax which was introduced here on budget evening with very little prior notice.  The Minister has reduced the tax, but it caused many problems.  If better notice had been given and more time had been available to the general public &mdash; some of whom are greater experts than we are, individual experts on matters of tax evasion &mdash; they could have discussed this and the mistake, which has been somewhat remedied, in regard to withholding tax would not have been made in the first instance.  The mistake was made because the matter was sprung out of the blue, without any advance public discussion and on budget night.  It is useful to have this opportunity of discussing the Financial Resolution and I ask the Minister what exactly he has in mind so that between now and Committee Stage people who are interested in reading the Official Report or what is reported in the newspapers will have the opportunity of making their views known to the Minister and to us here.  I would be glad of somewhat more detail on the exact import of amendment No. 93 to which this resolution refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give some available details.  The proposed new section 61 is designed to combat schemes which have already come to the attention of the Inspector of Taxes and are understood to be in widespread use by tax planners.  If not negatived, such schemes could result in the loss of millions of pounds of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One scheme involves a company acquiring shares in a connected company but at far less than the true value of the shares and making use of section 9 of the Capital Gains Tax Act of 1975 to substitute the much higher market value on a subsequent sale of the shares, thereby <Col N="1504" /> greatly reducing the capital gains tax liability. Another scheme involves a person paying too much for shares in a controlled company which is almost insolvent, so as to convert a bad debt owed by this company to the person into an allowable loss which he can then offset against chargeable gains arising in other disposals.  The new section 61 will counter these schemes by providing that, where shares are acquired in these circumstances, the amount to be allowed as a deduction for capital gains tax purposes on subsequent disposal will be the actual amount paid for the shares in cases where the amount is clearly less than the true value, and the true value of the shares in cases where that value is clearly less than the artificially high price paid for the shares.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the second part of the proposed new section and how there would be a need for that. I cannot, however, understand the first part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither can I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I am raising the question.  It strikes me as odd.  If I understood the Minister correctly, the company would acquire shares in another company at less than the true market value of those shares and those shares would be disposed of later, back to the original company by some internal transaction of that nature.  I thought that capital gains tax would accrue any way between the artificially depressed value and the market value and that when they came to be sold at the market value they would pay capital gains tax on the difference between the artificially depressed price initially used and the second price. I do not understand why that is not the case already in existing legislation and why this section and the resolution which is giving it effect are really necessary in respect of the first part of the Minister's statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister said in the second part is self-evident.  That is simply converting a bad debt into a loss, which is clearly a sensible thing to do if one is a <Col N="1505" /> taxpayer but a very sensible thing to stop if one is Minister for Finance.  In the interests of good legislation, the Minister might explain the first part a little further if he can, so that those who are interested in the subject could bring their minds to bear on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The best I can do at this stage is to give the Deputy an example. Company A were set up in 1975 with issued share capital of 100,000 £1 ordinary shares, 99,900 of which are owned by company B. Company A purchased agricultural land for £100,000 which, in 1982, is worth £1 million because of rezoning.  The shares are thus worth £10 each.  Company B wish to sell the development land and to do so by selling all their shares in Company A.  I know this is difficult to follow.  If they did so, they would face a capital gains tax charge on the difference between £1 million and the indexed value of the shares on the date of issue and expenses of sale &mdash; say a total of £350,000.  The tax would be 50 per cent of £650,000, that is £325,000.</P>
      <P>Before the sale, company B execute an artificial scheme to reduce this liability. They subscribe for 100,000 additional £1 shares in company A at par.  Company A now have assets worth £1.1 million &mdash; land worth £1 million and cash £100,000. Company B owns 199,900 shares worth £5.50 each.  However, the real cost of the shares was £199,900, that is £1 each.</P>
      <P>If section 9 (1) were to apply on the sale of the shares for £1.1 million, the deductible cost of the additional 100,000 shares, which cost £100,000, would be their market value &mdash; that is, £550,000 &mdash; and the taxable gain would be only £200,000, that is, £1,100,000 reduced by the aggregate of £350,000 and £550,000. The tax bill would be reduced from £325,000 to £100,000.  That is the example I can give you.  One would have to have a table in front of one to fully understand it.  We can make arrangements as we deal with the amendments.</P>

      <P>I understood that capital gains tax was based on actual capital gains.  I would also have thought that the actual value of the shares allowed by the Revenue Commissioners would have been the actual money subscribed for the shares and that in this case the value of the shares for capital gains tax purposes on the second subscription of £100,000 would, in fact, be £100,000.  He would not be allowed to subtract £500,000, which is an artificial value of what was an actual subscription of £100,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the position would be as the Deputy has said.  When Company B subscribed the second £100,000 and paid the £100,000 at par, I had thought that would be caught.  The shares would have been sold at less than market value but under capital gains legislation it would be deemed that a capital gain would arise. I know that when a farm is sold to a relation the vendor might want to give it at less than true cost &mdash; the land might be worth £500,000 but a nephew might be let off with £100,000.  Capital gains tax arises there even though there was not an actual capital gain &mdash; it would be a deemed capital gain.  Surely the same situation would arise when company B subscribed at par, which would not be the true market value of the shares.  Perhaps there was a loophole all along.</P>

      <P>Deputy Desmond's amendments are related but there is another set of amendments by Deputies Sherlock, Gallagher and De Rossa which were circulated only this morning. Deputy Desmond's set were circulated early.  I do not think it would be right to take the two sets of amendments together.  They are different and they should be dealt with separately.  Deputy Desmond's amendments were put down first and should be taken first.  I think the Chair should give us an indication of the Ceann Comhairle's ruling in regard to amendments which will be ruled out of order.  It would assist Deputies early on if they were informed about the amendments which have been ruled out of order and which therefore will not be debated. It would be better to know now rather than have us going into the debate not knowing which amendments are out of order.  Then we would not be wasting our <Col N="1508" /> time studying and preparing material on amendments which will not be discussed anyhow.  I can imagine some of the more industrious Deputies having heaps of documents about amendments which will not be discussed.  If the Chair could do that it would help us to concentrate on the amendments which will be before us.</P>

      <P>I have not got a list in any proper order but I have a number of notes which I will read.  The first one outlines the numbers of the amendments that are ruled out of order: amendments Nos. 32, 47, 63, 65, 66, 71, 74, 75, 76, 77, 79, 109 and 110.  Amendment No. 41 also falls to be disallowed on the ground of not being relevant to the provisions of the Bill as read a Second Time.  Amendments Nos. 48, 51, 67, 72, 73, 99, 107, 111, 112, and amendment No. 64 also fall, and Nos. 49 and 50 are to be added.</P>

      <P>There is no agreement. In fairness to Deputy Desmond, who circulated his amendments in good time, his amendments should not be taken in conjunction with other amendments.  Deputy Desmond has prepared a very detailed <Col N="1509" /> set of amendments which ought to be discussed and voted upon first.  If they are successful, we can proceed to vote upon the other amendments, which are marginally more generous.  Perhaps it would be better to proceed in that way rather than to discuss these amendments together in a muddle.  There is not and there never was agreement between my party and any other party in the House or the Chair to take all these amendments together.  We would far prefer to take them separately.  Deputy Desmond's amendments in regard to raising the tax allowance should be taken together and likewise the amendments put down by The Workers' Party should be taken together after Deputy Desmond's amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

      <P>The original proposition was that amendments Nos. 1 to 24 should be debated together.  There is no circumstance in which I would be prepared to debate 24 amendments in one lump.  We know what would happen. There would be one lump of votes.  That is not the intention of the Labour Party, nor, I am sure, is it the intention of the Fine Gael Party.  I do not know what the other Deputies intend to do about their amendments.  That is their business.  I am not agreeable to discussing 24 amendments in one go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be an argument for grouping amendments Nos. 1 and 2 together. This is an important issue.  I want to have the debate on my amendments taken <i>de novo</i> without the involvement of other amendments.  I tabled my amendments last Tuesday at 3 o'clock.  I did not see any other amendments before this morning. In fact, they were not circulated until we got into the House.  I have had no opportunity to go through the other 40 <Col N="1510" /> odd amendments.  The House is being very tolerant, because additional amendments to section 5 were circulated ten minutes ago by Deputy Grogory.  I want to take my amendment in splendid isolation, and we can go on from there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am accepting that the amendments will not be taken together, but, due to the compatibility of amendments Nos. 1 and 2 with almost exactly the same phraseology, in the opinion of the Chair it is most desirable that they should be taken together.  They will be determined as the same question.</P>

      <P>I beg to differ in so far as the amounts to be substituted are different. In Deputy Desmond's amendment the amount to be substituted is £4,800.  In the other amendment the amount to be substituted is £5,000.  This would have different implications for the budget and for revenue.  They are distinctive amendments.  They would have distinctive differences on budgetary policy. On that basis alone the two amendments should be taken separately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>The important thing is that the two sets of amendments would cost different sums of money.  One would cost more that the other.  It happens that the one which would cost less comes first. Logically we should take that one first and, if that is agreed, we can go on to take the other one which costs more.  It would be wrong to take them all together. If a vote is taken at the end of a debate which has roamed over all two, the point will be lost.  People will not understand what we are voting about.  It would be better to take them stage by stage, to take Deputy Desmond's first and vote on it, and then take the other sets and vote on them.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Deputy Desmond's amendment proposes to increase the limit to £4,800 and Deputy Sherlock's amendment proposes to increase it to £5,000.  If we discuss amendment No. 1, Deputy Desmond's amendment, in isolation and have a vote on that and the matter is carried, do we then discuss the other amendment to change it from £4,800 to £5,000?  Are we going to go on like this all day?  It seems to be a matter of noughts and crosses. Amendment No. 1 proposes that the limit be raised to £4,800 and amendment No. 2 proposes to raise the limit to £5,000.  In the next amendment Deputy Desmond proposes to raise the limit to £2,400 and Deputy Sherlock wants to raise it to £2,500.  It is like betting in a race.  One seems to be pushing the odds a little bit higher than the other.  All the amendments Nos. 1 to 24 are about the same thing.  Labour puts it up to one figure and Deputy Sherlock's party puts it a little higher.  Are we going to go on with this all day?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We face financial crisis.  On Second Stage the Minister indicated, on 9 June, that broadly speaking the deficit by the end of June would be of the order of 100 per cent of the figure for the year as a whole and that this figure would be significantly exceeded by the end of September.  Then he went on to say that he hoped to claw it back in the last quarter, and we live in that pious hope.  The reality is that for any of the concessions that may be considered in the Finance Bill there are three choices to be made.  We can add to the £679 million of current budget deficit.  If we do not add to it we can impose alternative taxation to raise the cost of relief given on the general tax side.  This was the dilemma facing the Labour Party in considering whether any amendments at all should be tabled to the Finance Bill for 1982.  We have gravely depleted Exchequer resources.  We have a budget deficit which is clearly going to be above and beyond the £679 million and we are spending this year about £350 million on unemployment-related expenditure, never mind taxation relief.  We have a situation of political paralysis of a minority Government virtually unable to run the country at this point.  At the same time we have to maintain basic Exchequer finances for basic social welfare payments for the £350 million of unemployment-related expenditure I have just mentioned, for the educational services and for our health services which alone run to about £900 million for 1982. If our Exchequer situation deteriorates into Exchequer bankruptcy &mdash; and I do not use these terms lightly &mdash; we are going to move into a situation of forced devaluation where neither the Central Bank nor the Department of Finance can prevent the Commission from bringing in the IMF to run this country because at the moment there is political paralysis.  We should be under no illusion about that. The Government are incapable of governing <Col N="1514" /> because they have not a majority and are looking over their shoulder every five minutes.</P>

Deputy Desmond to proceed without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the context that the Labour Party considered what the precise measures of relief should be in the area of general income taxation. We came to the conclusion that if there was one section of the community that merited particular consideration it is the very lowest income liability threshold and that is why we have tabled an extremely modest amendment for the Minister's consideration here this morning.  We want to increase by an extremely modest amount, the sum of £200, the basic tax exemption limits for single persons, for married persons and for the elderly.  I have not been able to cost it because the only information available to an Opposition, apart from going directly to the Department of Finance which would not be appropriate at this time, is to simply avail of the income distribution data available from the Revenue Commissioners. But with great respect to the Revenue Commissioners their last report was in 1979 and the last mistakes of that nature were made when Fine Gael said that their tax package would cost about £250 million and it worked out at about £500 million.  It was not Fine Gael's fault but the fault of those who were advising them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore we have to be very careful when assessing the cost.  But I would <Col N="1515" /> estimate it in very crude terms at about £10 million.  It is of critical importance that for many elderly who are in, say, nursing homes and who are just on the tax threshold and for whom the burden and frustration and extreme anxiety created by filling in tax forms and maybe forgetting an assessement where they might be liable for tax at say £100 or £150 for the year, we raise the general exemption limits.  But one should be under no illusion that for every £100 one adds on the cost rockets quite substantially because under the income distribution tables it is quite obvious that more and more people are brought in with every increment we give and they are brought in very rapidly indeed.  So the Labour Party have proposed that the general exemption limit of £4,400 for a couple should be raised to £4,800 and that the single rate should be increased from £2,200 to £2,400 and that it should be proportionately increased for the elderly. There is nothing particularly novel in the concept we advocated.  I quote from the budget presented by Deputy Kennedy, Minister for Finance on 27 February 1980.  He said &mdash; and I agree with him &mdash; at column 725, volume 318, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I am concerned that liability to income tax can apply to persons on very low incomes, particularly young people just starting work and casual or part-time workers.  I cannot solve this problem completely but I am happy to go a long way in that direction by introducing complete tax exemption limits for people on low incomes, including those affected by sickness and unemployment. The exemption limits will be £1,700 for single and widowed persons and £3,400 for married persons.  There will also be marginal relief at a rate of 60 per cent for taxpayers with incomes just above the exemption limit.  As a result of this proposal, 75,000 persons who would otherwise pay tax this year will not now do so....</P>
    <P>The Government are particularly aware of the difficulties and anxieties experienced by many old persons in <Col N="1516" /> completing their income tax returns and complying with their tax obligatons generally.  In many cases this is out of all proportion to the ultimate liability involved.  For this reason, I propose to raise the age exemption limits to £2,000 and £4,000 respectively for single and married persons aged 65 and over.  Special exemption limits of £2,500 and £5,000 will be introduced for persons aged 75 years and over. These limits will remove 8,000 old persons from the tax net, bringing to 83,000 the number of low-income taxpayers removed from liability.</P>
    <P>In the budget introduced in January 1981 by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, then Minister for Finance, he continued with the general proposition.  He said:</P>
    <P>The introduction last year of an income tax exemption for those on low incomes was a particularly significant development in that it provided a worthwhile relief for the less well-off while at the same time ensuring that the relief was directed to those most in need.  I now propose to increase the general exemption limits from £1,700 to £2,000 for single and widowed persons and from £3,400 to £4,000 for married couples.  Marginal relief will be available for those whose incomes do not greatly exceed those amounts....</P>
    <P>I also propose to raise the age exemptions which apply to the elderly. For those aged between 65 and 75 years the limits will be increased from £2,000 to £2,300 for single and widowed persons and from £4,000 to £4,600 for married couples....</P>
    <P>These new exemption limits will remove 37,000 persons from liability to income tax and marginal relief will benefit many more.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many people will be removed by the extra £200 change I suggest. Perhaps the Minister would give me that information.  The point I am making is a critical one.  I will not come into Leinster House with anybody breathing down my neck and put forward taxation relief proposals which will be a further major imposition on the current budget <Col N="1517" /> deficit and on borrowing from foreign banks or postponing the problem of raising alternative revenue.  When making my proposals I said that in my opinion the cost of such relief could be met from other sources.</P>
    <P>As the Chair rightly pointed out about two-thirds of my amendments relating to capital taxation and income relief were ruled out of order because under our Constitution, which is crazy in this context, an Opposition Deputy cannot impose any charge on any person.  Only the Government can impose a charge by way of financial resolution and only the Government can recoup the money.  The Opposition cannot provide any relief. This is the way our budgets are structured and it is unique in western Europe.  It has been modified in the British parliamentary model&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, before the Leas-Cheann Comhairle took over the Chair there was a change of stance by the Acting Chairman at the time on the procedure that would be adopted for taking the amendments.  He gave a ruling that he would take amendments Nos. 1 and 2 as they were about <Col N="1519" /> the same matter.  He changed that, and I should like to know if that decision was based on Standing Orders or if it was just a ruling of the Chair.  I submit that amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are about the same thing, although they differ marginally in the amount of increase sought&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, what happened was that the Acting Chairman, Deputy Moynihan, said that by agreement we would take amendments Nos. 1 to 24 together.  I indicated immediately that as far as I was concerned there was no agreement and that I believed Deputy Desmond's amendment should be taken, discussed and voted on separately.  I understand that position was accepted by the Chair.  The debate has now commenced, and it would be wrong to change the ruling of the Chair once the debate has commenced. Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 have different financial implications.</P>

      <P>I was indicating to Deputy Sherlock that he would have to discuss his amendment in this debate because if amendment No. 1 failed then he could not move his own amendment.  That makes sense to me and I am sure it makes sense to all the Members of the House.  I do not think we should get ourselves into any entanglements about it.  It was accepted that that was the position.  The Chair regrets that there was not, as Deputy Moynihan had sought, agreement to take amendments Nos. 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 which were related and also amendments Nos. 13, 15, 17, 19 and 21 which were consequential.  While there might have been rejection of that earlier, it is never too late to mend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On 25 March the Minister for Finance decided to improve the general exemption limits for those on low incomes.  In his budget speech he made the following comment:</P>
      <P>The limit for single and widowed persons will be increased from £2,000 to £2,200 and from £4,000 to £4,400 for married couples.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that marginal relief will continue for those whose incomes do not greatly exceed these amounts.  He said that the changes would remove 24,000 low income taxpayers from liability. This was in the budget introduced by Deputy MacSharry.  The effect of my amendment would be to add 15,000 to 20,000 people to that number.  I do not think that is extraordinary because when the general exemption limits were introduced in 1980 some 75,000 people were given the benefit of the exemption and a further 8,000 elderly people were added to the list, which brought the total to 83,000 people.  Deputy Fitzgerald, a former Minister for Finance, gave exemption to 37,000 people in the 1981 budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that he should accept our amendment?  I appreciate the fact that it would involve a cost to the Exchequer but it should be simple enough to increase the number involved in a general exemption without any dramatic effect on the budget overall.  Persons on very low incomes, the elderly poor, students who do casual part-time work, widows who do lowly paid employment, would number some 24,000 in all <Col N="1522" /> and that would mean taking that 24,000 out of the 800,000.  This amendment would result in a small but significantly beneficial improvement in their circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a competition here between the Labour Party and the Workers' Party about to whom to give the greater reliefs.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are related and 3 and 4 are related and one says one thing and the other says something else.  This competition between political parties has gone on too long.  I have a high regard for Deputy Desmond but his statements as Minister of State at the Department of Finance are not in agreement with what he is saying now.  I find it very irritating now to hear him put forward such an excellent argument as to why we should not increase the current budget deficit while, on the other hand, he puts down amendments here designed to have that exact effect.  His excuse is that of all the things that need to be done this would be the most beneficial for those on small incomes.  It would not cost very much. That may be so.</P>
      <P>There are two aspects involved: one is the increasing of the limits and the other is the effect of that on the budget deficit. We are all too prone to propagating more reliefs.  This has been the pattern for a number of years.  Every party has been involved in it.  Every party is blameworthy. A halt must be called to this invidious practice.  We cannot sustain a budget deficit such as we have at the moment.  We will not be able to sustain it.  On my calculation the deficit next year will be astronomical.  Some adjustments will have to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not care if we have elections every day of the week so long as we get a Government which will govern, a Government which will stick to its decisions. This perpetual adumbration of more reliefs and more benefits is destroying the country.  I believe the majority of the people agree with me.  The only people who refuse to see the realities of the situation are the politicians here in this House.  I do not put all politicians in the same category, but up to the recent <Col N="1523" /> past the majority have been too prone to the sort of practices to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The budget deficit this year is very large and these amendments will increase the deficit still further.  The country comes first, not party advantage.  I oppose all these amendments on these grounds irrespective of their merits.  We cannot afford any more concessions.  I appreciate our opposition to these amendments may result in a General Election but if there has to be an election, let there be one and let us subsequently get on with governing the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The differences between these amendments are not very great. Deputy Desmond argues that our amendment seeks to increase taxation by giving exemptions to the lowest income groups. But these are the groups most in need. These are the people who benefit least. That is why we have tabled these amendments. Deputy Desmond wants to increase the exemption by raising the figure of £4,400 to £4,800 and we suggest raising it from £4,400 to £5,000 and he the figure of £2,200 to £2,400, we £2,200 to £2,500.  The cost of doing that would not be very great.  Further amendments are designed to prevent tax avoidance and tax evasion and so one could be set off against the other.  We accept the principle of Deputy Desmond's amendments and we trust he will accept the principle inherent in our amendments.  The increase being sought is justified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>The point of accepting any of the amendments which will increase the financial burden on the State cannot be taken in the present context when other amendments, further down the list, are going to continue that philosophy.  If this amendment is not accepted it is nonsense to go on talking about them individually because this is the one sector we would all like to see getting maximum relief in any budgetary strategy.  Deputy Desmond went on in detail about the reliefs given in this category in the last few budgets <Col N="1524" /> but, unfortunately, the first amendment we will have to vote against is one which would help people to get the maximum relief.  The reality is that by the technical amendments which the Minister for Finance has put down we are committed to the present Finance Bill and no amendment which will increase the budget deficit will be tolerated from this side of the House.</P>
      <P>There are anomalies and abuses in the tax system, and that is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  At a time when the Exchequer is short of resources it is appropriate to deal with abuses and to make sure that everybody pays their fair share of tax and also to bring forward whatever revision in the tax system is practicable.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to accept an amendment which will increase the budget deficit and then discuss costs as amendments are dealt with. We must get on with running the country, and should any of these amendments be successful and lead to another general election it would be disastrous for the country.  Already the delay has cost the Exchequer £300 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised at the tone Deputy McCreevy and Deputy Lawlor are adopting in relation to reliefs to the lower paid.  One would think there were no other ways of raising the finance required in order to provide this relief. We have already indicated that we have put down a large number of amendments. At this point I am not sure if any of them has been accepted because I have not gone through the list.  Everybody knows there is widespread evasion and avoidance of taxation and there are amendments down in relation to the private rented sector which would bring in far more than the relief we are trying to give <Col N="1525" /> to the lower paid.  Deputy Desmond has already made the point that the amendments which we can bring in are restricted to providing relief.  If the amendments which we have put down in relation to wealth tax were accepted by the House there would be no problems about providing the few paltry pounds we are trying to get for the lower paid.  I think it was Deputy McCreevy who said that the country must come first.  The country consists of the people and the majority of the people are the workers, so it is invidious of him to say that something exists outside this House which is the country. We are talking about taxation on the workers and it is important that we should keep that in mind.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy De Rossa.  I also admire the outstanding contribution of Deputy McCreevy in bringing reality to politics.  I applaud many of the things he has said, both inside and outside the House, because he is endeavouring, from an ideological viewpoint, to face up to the immense and terrifying problems facing us now.  I support him in his honesty in that respect.  The flaw in his argument is that he pre-supposes we have a fair and equitable tax system.  We have not; and, if he accepted that point, I would agree with him totally.  We have not a fair taxation system.  While Deputy McCreevy may see nothing wrong with that, Deputy De Rossa and I are socialists and hold the balance of power at this time.  It would be very wrong of us to let any Finance Bill go through the House when we are in a position to amend it. Deputy Desmond and Deputy De Rossa put down very modest amendments which will not in any way alter the picture he has painted.  It will bring some help and relief to people who are very badly off.  I will have no qualms in supporting either of the two amendments while at the same time endeavouring to face up to the larger question of employment and housing.  Deputy McCreevy should reassess his position in the light of what I have said.</P>

But I would remind you, coming from your background, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in the west of Ireland, that you should know such a person as a poor farmer, and there are farmers in this country who are extremely poor.  Some of them are liable to income tax by virtue of having pensions, gifts, annuities and so on and they come within the threshold limit of the exemption rates about which I am talking.  There are also wealthy farmers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I make the point that it is entirely feasible in this country that we should give this kind of taxation relief, entirely within the absolute competence of the Minister for Finance to say across the House: &ldquo;I will give you the relief, you will have to agree that we bring in additional taxation to the tune of £10 million, £12 million or £14 million &mdash; because I do not know the precise amount it will cost; I am working only on the old 1979-80 <Col N="1529" /> income distribution figures, which are the only ones available.&rdquo; If the Minister comes in here and says that, I shall go along with him, he will have my support. It is perhaps unusual that a Finance Bill can be amended within that kind of structure.</P>
      <P>In conclusion on this point I should say to Deputy McCreevy and Deputy Lawlor that I am not asking for anything for nothing.  I am not engaged in that kind of competition.  It is entirely possible to cover the increase in the budget deficit in that context.  In conclusion I would remind the Minister that he was able to give £40 million of PRSI relief and there was not a scattering of a whimper, even from the backbenchers, even from Deputy McCreevy, with respect, with whose sentiments I agree, but who does have the habit in the voting situation of sitting on the fence until it is quite painful to his posterior.  I would remind Deputy McCreevy that when the £45 million of PRSI relief was given, which is four times what I am asking for, there was no comment made as to where the money would come from; it was just paid out because we were in the middle of a by-election and nobody would dare raise the matter. So what is sauce for the goose will be sauce for the gander and we must work it out in the House on this basis.</P>
      <P>I think my amendment is appropriate. I should like to hear from the Minister what is the true cost, as estimated, and what is the number of people who will benefit.  I am open to debate; I am not interested in general elections, by-elections or whatever.  I want to get a decent Finance Bill through the House and that is the importance of the point we are discussing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say, first of all, that normally in regard to such amendments, like those numbered 1 to 24 before the House, the House agrees to take them together because the same arguments or discussions would follow on any single one of them.  However, the House has decided differently and we are dealing just with amendments Nos. 1 and 2.  In replying I will give an answer to <Col N="1530" /> Nos. 1 and 2 which, in general, is the answer to all of them between Nos. 1 and 24.</P>
      <P>The increases proposed in the Bill, while not matching those in the amendments, nevertheless are extremely generous when compared with the January budget proposals of the previous Government which provided for no increase whatsoever in the exemption limits.  The increase in the exemption limits, all of them from Nos. 1 to 24, and the associated marginal relief outlined in section 1 of the Bill &mdash; that is the amount I gave in the budget &mdash; will cost £7.8 million in 1982 and £12.3 million in a full year.  The additional increases in those figures proposed by the amendments &mdash; taking the series of amendments in the names of The Workers' Party representatives &mdash; would cost £6.5 million this year, £10 million in a full year and would exempt 32,000 taxpayers approximately from liability.  Deputy Desmond's series of amendments, then, would cost a little less, approximately £4 million this year, £6 million in a full year and would exempt 19,000 taxpayers.</P>
      <P>The increases in the general and age exemption limits, proposed in the Bill, cannot be viewed in isolation from the main structure of income tax allowances, including the special PRSI allowance in respect of high rate contributions to PRSI.  In addition to the 25,000 persons removed from the tax net as a result of the revised exemption limits, a further 7,000 were removed from liability as a result of the generous increases in these allowances.  Therefore, on the whole, the increases in the general and age exemption limits, coupled with increases in the personal and secondary allowances, are the most favourable which can be offered to lower paid and aged taxpayers in the present difficult budgetary circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition I should say that if any such change was brought about at this stage in exemption limits, child allowances or the tax regime generally, it would delay the issue of new tax-free allowance certificates for the £312 allowance and would affect direct assesment under Schedule D. New certificates of tax-free allowances <Col N="1531" /> for the £312 allowance might not be issued until as late as November next; that is the earliest date I consider possible. Then there would be delay in getting out direct assessments which would seriously affect the yield of Schedule D tax for the year 1982.  Deputies generally must appreciate, from their experience over the years, that it is important to endeavour to have a tax regime decided and operational as from 6 April; that did not happen this year.  Already we have had two issues of tax-free allowances, we are going into the third and any such changes would entail a fourth issue.</P>
    <P>I have observed some contradiction in Deputies' statements in relation to not pursuing proposals that would add to the budget deficit or the level of borrowing. That is exactly what we are now discussing here.  On one series of amendments or the other we are talking about a figure of either £4 million or £6.5 million additional budget deficit and an increase in the level of borrowing.  When one contrasts that with, I will not say abuse, but definitely very severe criticism that I, the Government and this party have received over the last number of weeks since 2 June &mdash; on the basis of changes from budget day proposals to the publication of the Finance Bill on 2 June, amounting to a large amount, fantastic according to the propaganda attaching to it, of £2,500,000 &mdash; I hope Deputies on all sides of the House realise that we are not merely talking about £2,500,000 now, for which I and the Government have been criticised, but about £6.5 million or £4 million in the series of amendments appearing under the names of representatives of The Workers' Party or those of the Labour Party.  That I cannot accept in the difficult budgetary circumstances.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendments, as I gather from the spokesmen, is to do something further for the lower paid. Everybody would sympathise with that but it is hard to decide how to go about doing it.  There may be other ways during the course of the year when it can be done, but it is not realistic to change the tax structure that we have already had difficulty in changing twice because of the <Col N="1532" /> delay caused by two budgets.  We must bear in mind that if any such changes were accepted or if they were voted through they would not become operative until November or December next, which would be right on top of next year's budget.  There may be other ways in which the lower paid can be helped and I would be prepared to look at them so far as any concrete suggestions can be made.  I have to oppose the amendments put down to section 1.</P>
    <P>I want to say a final word in relation to the overall structure of taxation and to give the reason why we have this exemption limit in personal allowances, child allowance changes, and tax band changes.  I want to emphasise again what I did and had only time to do in the context of the election, my appointment on 9 March and the budget on 25 March to ensure that, generally speaking, the individual taxpayer got the same benefits as proposed on 27 January under the tax credit system.  I succeeded in doing that with this package of measures, and changing any one item distorts what was proposed on 27 January and therefore, cannot be accepted.  There is relief given to the lower paid from £2,000 up to £8,000 for the single person.  What is in operation now is only marginal, but for all of those income categories there is a gain under the system now in operation as against the tax credits.  It is important to make that point.  It was a package of measures covering exemption limits, personal allowances, reduction in the child allowance and a change in the rate band to do effectively what was proposed under the tax credit system.  We succeeded in doing that give or take £5 per annum on the higher end of the income bracket.</P>
    <P>The PRSI concession was mentioned, and it is important that I should say a few words on that.  We gave the £45 million and we did not do anything about getting the money.  I said then, on numerous occasions since and I repeat again now, that is my job, we gave the £45 million arising from the hardship created as a result of the changes in the levels of contributions, the delay in the budget, the delay in the issue of certificates of tax <Col N="1533" /> free allowances.  All those together had a tremendous impact on thousands of workers.  We saw that impact reflected in the attitudes of people at that time as well as in this House on all sides.  The Government moved to ease that difficulty and said that through expenditure savings or additional taxation we would make that good.  That is still the position.</P>
    <P>I have been asked today to add to that situation.  It is all very fine for those proposing a loss in revenue to say that if there is a financial resolution tomorrow and if there is such a proposal another day they will willingly accept it.  That has not been the practice over the years.  If there are realistic suggestions, which can meet the wishes of all the House, any Minister for Finance will gladly look at them because of the difficult budgetary situation.</P>
    <P>I must oppose those amendments for the various reasons I have given.  I hope careful note is taken by all concerned in the House of the minor changes in relation to two items in the budget of 25 March and the publication of the Finance Bill on 2 June and the criticism levelled at us over the loss of £2,500,000 revenue on section 1 of a 96 plus section Bill and we are being asked to lose a further £4 million to £6,500,000 this year.</P>

      <P>We are discussing amendment No. 2 as well which is relevant to the other series of amendments. I said, as of necessity, I would give the reply in a global fashion, as is normal when amendments such as those have been taken consistently over the years. As far as I recall over the last 30 years they would have been taken together by agreement.  That was not done, so I said that is a matter for the House and we can continue to discuss the other series of 24 amendments in blocks of two, if the <Col N="1534" /> Deputies like, for the next two weeks, but that is not making any progress in relation to the many important points that many Deputies would like to make on other sections of the Bill that it may be possible to consider.  I have made my position clear in relation to these amendments. If there are any further questions I will be glad to reply to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister asked for suggestions as to how he could help the low paid who are the group at stake in those amendments.  The people with low incomes face problems in relation to PRSI where there have been very substantial increases.  The Minister introduces a tax allowance, which gives them very little benefit because most of them are paying very little tax against which they can offset the PRSI allowance.  That allowance gives very substantial benefits to the better off who are on the higher tax rates.</P>
      <P>The Minister had one suggestion how the lower paid could be helped, the family income supplement contained in the January budget which he threw out the window.  I do not think he can ask us to seriously accept that he is interested in serious constructive suggestions or in co-operation of any sort from this side of the House in regard to this matter when he so unnecessarily threw out the family income supplement, which was directly designed to help the very people about whom he is now pretending to be concerned, the very lowest paid, many of whom are so low paid that they do not pay any tax whatsoever.  I do not think he can look with a plaintive expression to this side of the House for help when he so unnecessarily rejected measures we had in mind in our January budget to help the low paid.  He has no call whatsoever on our support in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the point at issue here is a wider one than simply taxation.  It concerns the whole question of incentive to work.  Some years ago people who were in the average type low paid employment did not pay any income tax and income tax did not worry them, but because of a succession of changes, increases in tax levels and a reduction in the real value of <Col N="1535" /> tax allowances they find themselves, even at the lowest incomes, paying income tax. We, likewise, find that other people who do not work at all, who are on welfare of one description or another, are actually able to have a bigger take-home pay on the same gross income than a person working, because tax is deducted from the working person's gross income tax but not from that of the person who does not work.  We offered the Minister a way of helping the low paid at work, of restoring the incentive to work, in the form of our proposal in the January budget to tax short-term social welfare benefits.  As well as throwing out the family income supplement which would have helped the low paid at work, he also threw out that proposal, although it would have made the situation equitable as far as the low paid at work were concerned <i>vis-à-vis</i> those with the same income on social welfare benefits who now get more than those at work.  The Minister had an opportunity to put these people on an equitable basis by taxing short-term social welfare benefits.  He has no call on our support in this situation.</P>
    <P>This is a Finance Bill which represents the central thrust of the economic and financial strategy of the Government. Are the Government, through the spokesmanship of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, asking us to support that financial strategy?  Are they mad? That financial strategy is based on one of the most ridiculous tax proposals ever put forward, namely, the advance payment of value-added tax.  This will bring forward artificially into this year money from next year without at all improving the budget deficit situation in the long term.  We will not support that sort of strategy.  It does not really tackle our economic and financial problems and the Minister must himself know that it is creating a highly unreal situation.</P>
    <P>The issue in this Finance Bill is not just a question of this £4 million.  That is not a very large amount.  The issue which we are discussing here is whether we want this Government to continue governing this country.  That is an issue upon which <Col N="1536" /> we in the Fine Gael Party have not the slightest doubt as to where we stand.  We want them out.</P>

I know that he will say that the Minister has referred to some matters, which he has, and the Chair would allow the same freedom to the Deputy, but would hope that he would not extend the consideration of amendment No. 1 to the point where every Deputy who rose would feel free to wander too far from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  I refer now to a matter raised by the Minister.  As the Chair allowed him to refer to it I am sure it will afford me the same latitude.  That concerns the question of the missing £45 million to pay for the allowance which the Minister decided to give, predominantly to the better off at work, in regard to PRSI.  At every available opportunity I have sought from the Minister where he is going to get this money, what taxes, what expenditure cuts he has in mind.  He has consistently refused this information, although he had no trouble in giving the concession when it seemed to cause him embarrassment not to do so in the run up to the Dublin west by-election.  He had no difficulty then in giving a concession costing £45 million.  He has very great difficulty in telling the House now where he is going to find that money.  He says, when asked, that he will find it by expenditure cuts or, if not, by taxation.  He does <Col N="1537" /> not say by what taxation or how much, or by what sort of expenditure cuts.  This is a Government who will not tell the people their plans, but ask this House to give them confidence on this section of the Bill.  We cannot have any confidence in a Government who deliberately conceal from the people their plans in regard to taxation.</P>
      <P>Suppose we pass this legislation, where are we then?  We know that there is a further £45 million which the Government will have to find some way or other. But they want us to pass this legislation on faith.  We are not prepared to leave it to the Government to find that £45 million any way they like, by the imposition of duties orders introduced during the Recess, which the Dáil will have no opportunity to debate until October or November.  We are certainly not prepared to let them use the same procedure which they used before the March budget, to introduce tax increases before that budget was introduced, without debate in this House.  We are not going to allow them to raise this £45 million that way during the Recess to get out of this House safe, not having told us where they are going to get this money.  Once the House is safely dissolved and they sink with relief into their chairs, they can issue an order raising all this £45 million by the imposition of duties orders of one sort or other.  We have been seeking at every opportunity that arose, to get this Government to say where they are going to get this money first when the motion for the allowance was introduced, then on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill, then on the Order of Business and otherwise. They have refused to say.  That is financial irresponsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing which business people and the people at large cannot stand if they want to plan for the future and arrange their own personal financial affairs is uncertainty.  There is no prospect of certainty about anything in this country as long as this Government last.  Nobody can plan anything, because they do not know from one day to the next what the Government are going to think up.  We want to clear the decks, we want a Government who can govern and who <Col N="1538" /> if they say they will do something, will do it, who will stand over their word and not continually concede.</P>

      <P>In my small contribution to the debate on these amendments, I would not blame any member of the electorate for wondering at the relevance of this House, in view of the antics which have taken place since last January.  We then had a budget brought in by Deputy Bruton, which suffered defeat certainly on two of its major principles.  We had in the meantime an election in which the issues were put very clearly before the people, particularly in relation to the point mentioned by the Deputy on the family incomes supplement, and to other <Col N="1539" /> matters.  It was made very clear and accepted that those items would be abolished in any subsequent budget introduced by this party.  The Deputy cannot cry crocodile tears and pretend that, if given the opportunity, he would rectify our financial affairs and improve on this Government's performance.</P>
      <P>One cannot be faulted for questioning the honesty and integrity of Deputy Bruton when he suggests that the money could be found in some other way.  His attempt last January failed and we are now six months ahead but have not managed to get the necessary legal requirements completed to collect the full revenues necessary to run the State and to embark on a course of rectifying the national finances.  It is sheer hypocrisy to start suggesting &mdash; I am not very worried about it &mdash; that we should have another General Election.  I am confident of the outcome of such a contest, but I do not think the electorate would thank any side of the House that created a situation in which we would have a third such contest in 12 months.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has outlined what is necessary in order to correct the financial situation.  With respect to the members of The Workers' Party and to Deputy Kemmy who is not now here, I say to them that they have not got the monopoly of representation of the workers in this House.  Until the day of the general election in February I was a PAYE and PRSI contributor and I know and appreciate the problems and the difficulties being experienced by such contributors. Those workers have a sense of responsibility to the community at large. It has been said that this inanimate object, the State, does not exist outside. Of course it exists.  Everyone of us, all the workers in the country, are part of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Bellew will appreciate the Chair's difficulty. I must direct the attention of every Deputy to what is in the amendment being discussed.  Although Deputies objected to taking a number of amendments together &mdash; the Minister in replying said he was referring to a number of amendments &mdash; in spirit the Chair is allowing a certain amount of latitude which I hope will not be abused by any speaker.  I am asking Deputy Bellew, having referred to the background, to address himself more specifically to the amendment which calls for the substitution of one figure for another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBellew" hpid="Mr. Bellew Mr. Bellew">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bellew</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as relevant as I can.  Specific matters were referred to by the proponents of these amendments and it is important that there should be discussion on those points.  We are entitled to put the other side of the coin.  Deputy Kemmy spoke of jobs and housing, both critically important problems, but it is necessary to provide finance for these things.  The rules of the House constrain one from discussing loss of revenue. Deputies so far have avoided suggesting how the shortfall might be made up, and if we are to accept the integrity and the honesty of the spokesmen for Fine Gael and Labour particularly, and of The Workers' Party, one wonders why they have been avoiding their responsibility by failing to suggest alternative methods by which the shortfall could be made up. Deputy Bruton spoke of specific proposals, but these were rejected by the electorate in February, and from that point of view they are not a viable proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this time of year we must bear in mind the practical difficulties attached to amending tax-free allowance certificates and the frustrating and demoralising effect it would have on PAYE contributors. This is not the appropriate time to amend the amount from £4,400 to £4,800 suggested in Deputy Desmond's amendment, or to £5,000 as suggested by Deputy De Rossa.  It is undeniable that <Col N="1541" /> there should be restructuring of the taxation system, but practical difficulties would not allow it to be done now.  The recommendations of the Commission on Taxation can be considered at a later stage.</P>

I understand that the House is discussing amendments Nos. 1 and 2, and if we are to assess the impact of the amendments it would be desirable for the Minister first of all to give us a costing on amendment No. 1 and then on amendment No. 2.</P>

      <P>With regard to what Deputy Boland said I understood that there was a costing of £4 million to £6.5 million.  I should like to query what the Minister said.  He mentioned a figure of 32,000 people in the PAYE sector who would benefit if the amendment of The Workers' Party was accepted and 19,000 people if the amendment of the Labour Party was accepted.  Deputy Bruton mentioned the family welfare supplement and the Minister in reply said that there may be other mechanisms under which this category of taxpayers would get maximum assistance.  Will the Minister clarify what he meant by that statement?  Is it his expectation that something in that area will be forthcoming in the report of the Commission on Taxation?  When does the Minister expect that that report will be made available?  Will the Minister give due recognition to the recommendation on PAYE in the report and bring it forward as quickly as possible?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party amendment sets out to remove from the tax net 19,000 people who are at present paying tax at the lower rate.  The Minister's cost of that is £4 million this year and about £6 million in a full year.  The Labour Party are engaging in a democratic process by tabling such an amendment.  I am at a loss to understand the contributions from the Government backbenches.  I <Col N="1542" /> must ask myself: where were those responsible people last January when they voted against a proposal to increase the price of drink?</P>
      <P>We are looking for the approval of the House &mdash; this is the correct procedure &mdash; for our suggestion.  The Minister mentioned the relief to be granted at a cost of £45 million.  We all welcome relief given to any taxpayers, but the kernel of his relief is where the money will come from. That question remains unanswered.</P>
      <P>There is grave concern about the question of public accountability.  In my view public accountability means that if relief totalling £45 million is given to any sector it must be costed and public representatives told where it will come from.  Fianna Fáil backbenchers have suggested that we are competing for votes, but our proposal is realistic.  I must take the Minister to task on his refusal to proceed with the proposal contained in the January budget to implement a tax on discretionary trusts.  In the course of his statement on 25 March last the Minister said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree with the Chair and I believe the latitude may not be necessary on later amendments.  On taking discretionary trust, in March the Minister said he had considered this approach and concluded that this would be an insensitive and over-simplified approach to the problem.  He told the House that he was referring the matter to the Commission on Taxation.  The imposition of tax on discretionary trusts would affect a very select number of people in our society. For the Minister to say that that is an over-simplified approach, and to say today on this amendment that he is unwilling to offer relief to the most needy and deserving in our society lacks logic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1543" /> The Labour Party are adopting a responsible approach in regard to the democratic process, and I urge all Members to adopt a similar procedure when suggesting proposals for tax or PRSI relief.  If that is done we will not end up with proposals that lack economic planning.  I urge the Minister to reconsider his position in regard to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the contribution by Deputy Spring I should like to state that on numerous occasions I said that the £45 million would be provided through expenditure savings.  I said we had undertaken a total expenditure review in all Departments and that Departments would report to the Department of Finance and the Government by the end of May.  Those reports are now being examined to see what expenditure savings can be made.  When we see the extent of the expenditure then, and only then, will additional taxation arise.  That is the situation and I stand firm on it.</P>
      <P>Discretionary trusts have been mentioned by a number of Members.  I have already stated that I was referring that to the Commission on Taxation, and that has been done.  I expect the Commission to comment on that matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland asked me why I had given the overall costs of the 24 amendments as against two.  That was done because, as is normal practice, the items had to be worked out by computer.  The 24 amendments are being discussed together and the same reply is relevant to them all &mdash; they all raise the same issue about exemption limit increases &mdash; and it follows that I should give the costing for them all.  If, for example, there is a change in the single allowance it is doubled for the married allowance and so on. That is why I gave the global reply.  I do not have the detailed costings of the 24 amendments and I will not be able to give that information until the matter is put through the computer again.  It would be necessary to wait until tomorrow for that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the first contribution we have heard from Deputy Bruton. The Deputy referred to the need for <Col N="1544" /> helping the lower paid and said his way of doing that was through the family income supplement.  About one-eighth of the people who were entitled to that supplement applied for it.  I will not delay the debate by itemising the wealthy contractors and dealers of one kind or another who would have qualified for that family income supplement.  Deputy Bruton said he could not support the financial philosophy of VAT on imports at the point of entry or the bringing forward of corporation profit tax, but we know what his party and Government were prepared to do.  There was very little for the lower paid in his budget when one takes into consideration that it was intended to impose VAT on footwear and clothing and remove food subsidies. That is the alternative.  The proposal of Deputy Bruton in January last affected the lower paid a lot more than the imposition of VAT on imports at the point of entry or bringing forward corporation profits tax to the stage where such corporations will be paying tax six to nine months later than their financial year while the PAYE worker pays on a Friday night.  I do not think the Opposition are realistic when they talk about the differences between the two types of approach on taxation.</P>
    <P>As I have said on many occasions, the level of PRSI contributions in operation are identical to what was proposed by the then Government on 27 January. The only exception is the £45 million. There was absolutely no suggestion at any time from any source within Fine Gael or Labour, who made up the Coalition, of helping the lower paid because of the extent of the PRSI contributions. It is all very fine now for those on the Fine Gael benches who consider themselves infallible and who consider whatever they say to be speaking <i>ex cathedra.</i> They do not consider that anyone else is honest.  The only honest politicians and realistic people are in Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>The Opposition will get their answer to that as they did <Col N="1545" /> before.  From 27 January until 9 March the infallible group, particularly in Fine Gael, who were standing firm on their 27 January proposals, which included VAT on footwear and clothing and the abolition of food subsidies, made every effort to change that stance to try to see if they could achieve government.  That is an undeniable fact, as those who speak with such honesty, sincerity and infallibility know.</P>
      <P>We have been getting lectures from every side of the House on budget deficits and the level of borrowing.  What these amendments do is increase both.  Those who vote for them should realise exactly what they are doing.  There is no other explanation for it.  Those who have been preaching about the level of the current budget deficit and the high level of borrowing should answer how they can remain credible if they vote for these amendments which will increase both.  As an ordinary five-eighth and not too well educated individual, I should love to know how people can still retain their credibility and do that.  Perhaps someone will explain to me.</P>

      <P>The Minister made much of the corporation profits tax and our objection to bringing forward the date of payment and that of VAT.  I do not say that at some time in the future, with due notice, payment dates for particular taxes should not be changed.  There is nothing wrong with that if it is considered in a proper context. I object to artificially and basically fraudulently reducing the budget deficit for this year by bringing forward the tax for next year.  It is the fraudulent character of the exercise as far as the budget deficit is concerned, not the substance of the measure, that we strongly object to.  It is on a par with the attempt to conceal reality with the attitude of the Government towards Ardmore, the Gregory deal and the £45 million PRSI allowance. They will not tell us what they are doing. They do not know what they will do. They do not know where they are going, and should not be governing.</P>

      <P>We should all like to see the threshold limit raised to this figure. For a long time I have listened to lectures on the economy.  During the last election I can remember cards being pushed through letterboxes indicating the alleged lavish borrowing of Fianna Fáil.  Recently I heard the former Minister for Finance speaking in terms of economic and financial rectitude.  These are great terms.  I took a trip to the library and got out a dictionary.  I had a look at &ldquo;rectitude&rdquo; to see how it is defined.  After going through its origins somewhere back in the 14th century, I found &ldquo;quality or fact of being straight&rdquo;, &ldquo;straightness&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Straight&rdquo; is the biggest trick-of-the-loop I have discovered from the Coalition.  There is no other way to describe it.  They are not going straight.  They are doing U-turns and twists time and time again.  If the former Minister for Finance wants to talk about economic rectitude he should look up the various meanings of the word in the dictionary.  I am quoting from the Oxford English Dictionary, volume 8.</P>

The second usage of the word is a &ldquo;straight line; direction in a straight line&rdquo;.  On this amendment if you are on the Coalition side of the House you can take a straight line but in which direction are you going?  You are going in your own direction, on your own judgment of how you define rectitude.  I will not delay too long on that because I am anxious to go on further.</P>

Fine Gael and probably the Labour Party are embarking upon the sale of the century and we can talk in terms of correctness of intellectual judgment and artistic judgment and its conclusions.

A definition of a rare use of the word is that it is a right.  Would the former Minister for Finance care to comment on his support for this amendment under the definitions of rectitude in this dictionary?  I accept that he is genuine and straighforward from the point of view of rectitude, moral straightness, uprightness, goodness, and integrity.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not need any reference <Col N="1550" /> books to understand what Deputy Bruton was saying.  We all agreed with his policy of going straight and putting our finances in order.  He is now opposing the Government's attempt to reduce our budget deficit.  We are told that these amendments should be made, but the Opposition do not say from what source the money should come.  Deputy Desmond might tell us where he proposes to get the increased revenue to make the necessary adjustments.</P>
      <P>We are told these amendments would cost between £4 million and £6½ million. We know the Government introduced changes in the PRSI which will cost £45 million.  The Minister for Finance explained that this will be provided by means of cutbacks.  Do Deputy Bruton and Deputy Desmond want further cutbacks in order to implement their amendments? For the past number of weeks and months they have been talking about the problems of the PAYE workers.  We all know PAYE workers pay their taxes every week, yet the Opposition are objecting to companies being asked to bring forward their payments of corporation tax.  Are they playing the two sides of the fence and trying to have their loaf and eat it?  That seems to be the policy that is being adopted.  We hear from that side of the House that the finances of this country have to be put in order.  Yet they are not prepared to help the Government to do that at the moment.  What they feel is that the country should not be governed by a Government who are prepared to tackle the problems now before us. We have the problem of budget deficits. Yet here today we see another attempt by people on the Opposition side trying to increase that budget deficit without saying where the savings can be made to allow the implementation of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton spoke at length this morning but he still did not tell the House where savings could be made.  I ask him and Deputy Desmond to tell the House what changes can be made to allow a change in the tax bands.  It is very different from what was proposed in the Coalition budget brought in in January that was voted down by this House.  I suppose <Col N="1551" /> it is a case of putting down amendments to try to bring down the Government, but the people do not want this type of politics to be carried on.  They want to see Government by a Government prepared to carry on and do the necessary work.  Whether we like it or not we must all pay tax.  But if we expect services and payments to be made to the less well off we must accept hardship.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond's amendment is only a paper exercise.  It is a matter of opposing for the sake of being anti-budget or anti-Finance Bill.  The difference of £400 concerned would have been more than eaten up had the proposals of the Coaltion budget in January been implemented namely, the imposition of VAT on clothing and footwear.  Deputies Bruton and Desmond have not said where the money would come from to implement this amendment.  They know that it just cannot be done except by increasing the budget deficit.  If Deputies Bruton and Desmond want to see the budget deficit increased why do they not get up and say so publicly rather than talking in different ways at different times about the budget deficit?  They are here asking for the budget deficit to be increased by between £4 million and £6.5 million.  I ask Deputy Bruton to tell the Minister for Finance where that saving can be made.</P>

That is, he explained that he made the move, then he set up a review body to look into the expenditure saving and after that he would see what taxation needs to be implemented.

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be some delaying tactics.  The support that Fine Gael have given to Labour is soundly based on the provisions of the Coalition budget of 27 January last with particular reference to the proposal for a family income supplement which would have been available to those families with incomes of £4,000 or less.  It was proposed to pay these families £4 a week by way of family supplement, and where the income was extremely low that direct family supplement would have increased to £500 per annum.  The present Government did not implement that proposal. Indeed it is a serious weakness in their budget that they have ignored the least well off in our community.  It is for that very valid reason that we can support the Labour Party amendment.</P>

      <P>I am addressing myself to the problems of the least well off in our community.  I have no hesitation in saying that they deserve our support, and <Col N="1553" /> that is the reason we are supporting the Labour Party amendment.  We are also anxious to get rid of this Government and their Taoiseach, who is eminently unsuitable to lead a Government of this country and should be removed from office at the earliest possible opportunity.  We are using this vote to show our lack of confidence in the Taoiseach and the Government, and will take it that if when the vote is taken there is a defeat the Taoiseach will have the integrity to resign and to take it as a vote of no confidence in him.  The last budget proposed by the Coalition Government was a socially progressive one which took special account of the less well off in our community, particularly by increasing social welfare benefits by 25 per cent and by substantially increasing children's allowances from £6 per month to £11.25 per child for the first five children and £17.50 for each child thereafter.  That was a socially conscious and socially progressive Government. Fine Gael have a proud record in defending the less well off in the community.</P>

      <P>I am very interested in the way the debate has gone so far.  I never heard such hypocrisy from Fine Gael in all my life.  They talk about looking after the less well off and the underprivileged.  This is the reality of what they were going to do.  They were going to withdraw food subsidies amounting to £47 million, and the Labour Deputies in the Government said &ldquo;Yes, Dr. FitzGerald, we are with you all the way&rdquo;.  That is lovely stuff.  More was to follow.  VAT of £58 million was to be <Col N="1554" /> imposed on footwear and clothing.  Then before the election they did a backtrack or what the political correspondents call a U-turn.  Then they said if the children were under ten years of age they were all right and men and women would be going around to see birth certificates.  I cannot understand that hypocrisy.  Looking across at the wealthy people on the opposite bench &mdash; and more luck to them &mdash; I realise they would not understand this problem.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree it is necessary to have time limits?  It is very unfair, if a person has won his appeal, that the Minister's direction is not carried out by the local authority. Deputy Deasy has a case where a person is waiting eight months; I have a case of a person waiting 18 months since the appeal was decided, and there was a delay of several months before the appeal was decided.  This man has been waiting two or two-and-a-half years for urgent repairs to be carried out to his house and the Department confirmed that the repairs are urgently required.  I suggest it is necessary that there should be a time limit in regard to implementing the Minister's directive.</P>

      <P>This gives rise to serious anomalies.  For instance, tenants waiting for a decision on the sale of their houses continue paying their rents.  I know people who have been waiting two-and-a-half and three years.  They are still paying rent which should be considered <Col N="1556" /> as repayments on the price of their houses.  As a member of Dublin Corporation I raised this matter and asked that these rents should be treated as repayments if they continued for longer than six months, but the local authority said they did not have the power to do that. Would the Minister consider giving them this power?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have that matter looked into.  When I came into the Department I made an order that 40 per cent of the proceeds of the sale of houses should supplement the authority's revenue. This revenue can be used to carry out the necessary repairs on houses.  I did not get any letters about delays of this nature but I will look into it and will also consider inserting a time limit.</P>

Dublin Corporation made a loan initially, as is the normal procedure, for the moneys to be funded from the Local Loans Fund.  I was a member of Dublin Corporation at that time.  If the Deputy wishes to cast aspersions on that arrangement he is at liberty to do so but he is not accurate.  I can give the House the dates on which the original loan was applied for and the letter from the Minister for the Environment to Dublin Corporation which is dated 19 April.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that it would not be an optimum usage of money from revenue to finance a long-term asset of this kind. The Department of the Environment are not going to do that.  My Department would not be a party to providing moneys for a long-term asset in the manner which the Deputy suggests.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>The Government are especially concerned about the question of urban regeneration in Dublin because of the extent and urgency of the problems there and because it is the capital city and is, therefore, applying certain special measures there as a matter of urgency and on a pilot basis.</P>
      <P>As part of this approach legislation is being introduced to provide for the setting up on an Inner City Development Authority to replace the Dublin Inner City Group which has existed since 1979. There will be a budget provision of £2 million in 1982 for the group and for the new authority</P>
      <P>The Urban Development Areas Bill, 1982, which I have introduced provides for the establishement of urban development commissions to secure the regeneration of designated urban areas.  Two of these will be located in Dublin and the legislation also provides for the designation of other areas and the establishment of commissions where there is a special need for urban renewal.  In the light of experience with the pilot projects in Dublin, consideration will be given to a similar approach elsewhere.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the urban renewal situation in other areas, including Cork and especially in the main urban centres, will be considered and whatever further support may be possible and appropriate for inner urban development and renewal in those areas will be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be stressed that the basic system remains, both in Dublin and elsewhere, by which urban renewal objectives which are defined in local development plans may be supported both by local authority investment and <Col N="1573" /> by the exercise of development controls. The local authority investment programmes relating to housing, in particular, and to roads, sanitary services and environmental schemes are particularly relevant in this regard.  It is not possible to distinguish in detail between urban renewal and other objectives in the use of these various resources by local authorities but the overall allocations to Dublin Corporation for the years referred to for the services mentioned are given in the following table which, with your permission, I will circulate with the Official Report:</P>

    <P>Further provision to a maximum of £15 million will be made for this programme if necessary.</P>
    <P>Inner city areas would benefit, of course, from the local authority's ongoing programmes in such matters as housing maintenance, but details as to how individual areas benefit are not available. Finally, urban renewal in the Dublin area, and elsewhere, will benefit from the budget provision of £1.5 million for a revolving fund for the purchase and renovation of run-down residential properties, and from the new charges proposed on derelict sites and office developments, for which proposals are at present being considered.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I went to Cork, made no specific commitment to give money to Cork city and made no commitment to come back to Dublin and make commitments to Cork City.  Very regrettably, in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> on a couple of occasions information was reported which greatly embarrassed the city manager, Mr. McHugh, who actually issued a statement to <i>The Cork Examiner</i> on 14 May totally disassociating himself with the comments that were made by a certain Deputy on that particular question. He also telephoned my office about it and was very embarrassed about what had happened on my trip to Cork.  At this stage, so that no further misinterpretation is given to my visit to Cork, I want to clear it once and for all in the House that I went down to see on the ground, following a deputation from Cork to Dublin, the situation relating to urban renewal and the needs for Cork.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I regard that as a very constructive proposal. But I am sure the Deputy realises, being a qualified professional architect, that it is impossible, as I said in my reply, to distinguish in detail questions of urban renewal.  I referred recently in the House to the very excellent exhibition that the Institute of Architects have in Merrion Square where this whole question was significantly displayed to great effect.  I have encouraged my officials to go along to that exhibition as part of that exercise.

      <P>I am aware that a number of vessels, formerly registered in Spain and re-registered in Britain and the Channel Island, have been fishing in our waters. However, I understand that the British authorities have introduced measures which are designed to restrict the registration of non-EEC fishing vessels in Britain for the purpose of gaining access to Community waters.  In regard to vessels registered in the Channel Islands, I am considering amendments to existing legislation which would have the effect of specifically excluding such vessels from fishing in our waters.</P>

Vessels have already been arrested in our waters and there have been convictions.  In relation to the Channel Islands, we will have to discuss that situation with the Attorney General's office to see how we can amend our legislation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if he or the EEC Council of Ministers have made, or intend to make, approaches to the Faroese concerning the excessive quantities of salmon they are netting thereby seriously damaging the Irish salmon fishery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In negotiations on the conclusion of an EEC-Faroe Islands Fishing Agreement for 1982 the Irish delegation insisted, as part of the agreement, on a substantial reduction in Faroese salmon catches.  Because of this stand, the Faroese Government agreed to a reduction in their salmon catches from a projected catch of 1,650 tonnes in the 1981-82 fishing season to 750 tonnes in 1981-82 and to 625 tonnes in 1982-83.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that there are roughly 38 boats from the Faroe Islands <Col N="1582" /> fishing for salmon and we are closely examining the situation.  The Deputy will be aware that certain discussions have taken place already.  An international convention has been held in connection with salmon fishing in the North Atlantic and they have made certain decisions regarding not only the Faroese but also Greenland fishing for salmon.  We are keeping in close touch to see that the decisions of this convention are carried out.  It is of concern to me that the quotas decided upon at that convention would be implemented.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister please check that these quotas are being implemented? Is the Minister aware of the drastic drop in catches for Irish salmon fishermen in the 1981-82 season, which has been attributed largely to the netting by these Faroese fishermen?  Would he agree that that is most likely to be the cause of this drop?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that it would have a considerable effect on the catches. It would not, however, be the complete reason for the drop in salmon catches. Salmon catches have declined generally over the last few years and others as well as the Faroese have a responsibility here. One must look to conservation measures as well.</P>

In view of the concern which I expressed, the board are at present reviewing the situation.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Is it not a fact that there is not alone the fact that the rent and rates are costing nearly £½ million a year but that it is extremely inconvenient for fishermen who have to avail of these offices?  Is it also not a fact that the staff are very strongly resisting their removal out there and, if they did move, that the cost of compensating them would be very considerable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>One must look at this in the overall context of what was proposed at that time.  The view put forward at that time, which was carefully measured and assessed in the interests of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, was to have the board's staff all housed under the one roof.  At present that is not the situation.  It was also decided to provide further accommodation for the board because they are at present very short of accommodation. The overall intention, which was a good one, was to house the entire staff in the one area and to provide for expanding accommodation requirements in an ideal location such as Dún Laoghaire, right at the harbour.  It was a very worthwhile project and one which merits further consideration at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Is it not a fact that all concerned with An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, with the exception of my predecessor, the present Minister for Agriculture, were against the idea of moving out there, but that they were under pressure and fell for this crazy scheme which was initiated by the chief executive of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara?</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wishes to refer to this as a crazy scheme he is entitled to do so, but I do not accept that.  I do not accept that everybody was opposed to the proposed move to Dún Laoghaire. There will always be a certain amount of resistance to staff moving and part of this resistance is met by the allowance or whatever that may be paid.  These issues can be considered in the general review which I have asked the board to undertake. <Col N="1585" /> My idea now is to provide BIM with the accommodation required and to get all the staff under one roof.  The ideal location for the headquarters is Dún Laoghaire which is an attractive location by any standards.  I can see merit in staff being anxious to move to that centre rather than opposing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I was referring to the strategy of the Coalition's budget.  The Coalition proposed to tax poor people on food, a very essential item.  Deputy Bruton and other Fine Gael Members seem to be worried about the underprivileged now, but there was not too much concern in January when they were asking our people to pay a whopping £47 million as a result of the removal of food subsidies. They also proposed to impose VAT on footwear and clothing amounting to £58 million.  Deputy Desmond, in the course of the Second Stage debate, told us that if we imposed certain taxes we would be robbing Peter to pay Paul.  I would not agree with some of the figures the Deputy produced when he was asked where the additional revenue would be raised.  To be fair to the Deputy, I accept that he does not have the up-to-date information on the costings.  We must ask ourselves, whether we opt for the £4 million or the £6½ million relief, where the money will come from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the family income supplement <Col N="1680" /> proposed by the Coalition, the £9.60 per week that was to be taken off a husband's income and transferred to a wife, I should like to state that such a procedure would make little of the husband and seem to indicate that he was not supporting his family.  Of course, we all know that the people pegged that out on top of its head.  We changed that system and passed over the supplement directly.</P>

      <P>The Coalition were swapping the pockets.  It should be remembered that only one-eighth of those eligible for that supplement applied for it even though the Minister for Finance carried out an extensive advertising campaign.  Even with the assistance of high powered PRO people the Government failed to rescue that situation and get the people to apply for the supplement.  The Coalition failed.</P>

I have no doubt that the main Opposition party are not concerned that the bands should be changed.  Deputy Bruton brought in a budget and had an opportunity then to insert in the income tax code what he is asking the Labour Party and The Workers' Party to do now. If Fine Gael had tabled an amendment of their own, I would give them credit for it but it is hard to believe that they did not bring forward one amendment of their own that they could stand over and speak on.  That reflects the true voice and merit <Col N="1684" /> of Fine Gael.  They do not believe in these amendments.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I have always held the view, particularly since the introduction of PAYE, that it is essential to have a fair and equitable system of taxation.  Under the PAYE system of taxation, the wage-earner, worker and lower paid have no option whatever but to pay up to the last penny.  It is taken directly out of their pocket and they cannot make any private arrangements for themselves.  There is an onus on every Government to ensure that the system of taxation is fair and equitable so long as they operate this system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to be a member of a Government which, for the first time since the State was founded, did something to introduce equity in taxation.  We did this <Col N="1686" /> by introducing the capital gains tax.  Prior to that the dealer in lands, the speculator in shares, the dealer in house property and so on could make £50,000 a year, which was a phenomenal amount of money at the time, without attracting one brass farthing of taxation because that was not regarded as income but as a capital gain.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I will be brief and concise.  I was proud to be a member of the Government who introduced the capital gains tax and who, by way of that tax, got at the speculator, the dealer and anyone who was in receipt of a big income but who was not paying tax.  We left behind a good and workable money-earning tax system but Fianna Fáil on coming into office altered that capital gains tax legislation.  They pulled out its teeth, rendered it harmless and left it in such a way that while it remained in name it was not bringing in any worthwhile revenue.  In the budget that we introduced in January we proposed to restore the teeth to the capital gains tax, to give it back its power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fair system of taxation is necessary. That is why I am happy to support this amendment in the names of my friends in the Labour Party.  The amendment is framed so as to help the lower income group.  As the Bill is drafted it is proposed to ask a married couple earning £4,400 jointly to pay income tax.  In other words, <Col N="1687" /> a couple with a combined income of less than £100 per week, that is, less than £50 per spouse, are to be asked to pay tax. That is unjust, regardless of who may be responsible for it.  The amendment proposes to increase the figure to £4,800.</P>

But we will not become more competitive and neither will we increase production or cut down inflation by discouraging people from working.  The present taxation system is turning people away from work.  A man who is a lorry driver tells me that in the changed tax bands, he will be in the 60p bracket.  Is there any encouragement for that man to continue in his job?  This is a good amendment and one that should be supported.  If accepted, it will encourage people to go back to work.  Fianna Fáil cannot offer any good reason for not being able to get the few million pounds extra that would be necessary to implement the change proposed.  They have no problem in finding between £40 million and £50 million for a little bit of this city.  They are able to give £500,000 to this or that local authority as a stop gap measure.  That will not encourage work.  Therefore, in the interest of equity in taxation and of encouraging people to work, I am supporting the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be crystal clear as to the procedure we are adopting. The first motion which you will have to put before the House is that £4,400, the existing limit, should stand.  In the event of the House deciding that these words should not stand, you will have to put the question immediately that the figure of £4,800 should stand, that being the content of my amendment.  Presumably, Deputies would then vote on that.  I understand also that in the event of the £4,800 figure being accepted, that becomes the substantive decision of the House and amendment No. 2 is thereby negatived, because the House has decided that the new rate should be £4,800 and other amendments relating thereto are irrelevant at that stage. Deputy Sherlock and his colleagues should be under no illusion that this is a serious matter, that they have to decide in the first instance if they wish to see £4,400 remaining as it is and, secondly, if not, they must decide whether they wish to support the Labour Party amendment for £4,800.  That is their prerogative.</P>

We are in the process of discussing on Committee Stage a very simple amendment from the Labour Party the cost of which we have quite deliberately reduced to £4 million for this year or £6 million in a full year. Lest there be any illusion on the part of The Workers' Party I would not support an amendment that it should become £4,000 or £5,000.  We stand or fall on our amendment.  We are not here as cannon fodder for any other party who put down amendments.  Let that be absolutely clear.  I must say this with great deference to The Workers' Party so-called Deputies behind; they will have some difficulty on this whole question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I did that, no offence whatsoever meant in that regard.  This is not a personal matter at all.  However, I say to the five Deputies behind me: I find it somewhat incredible that when we had a Financial Resolution in relation to the budget a short time ago, Financial Resolution No. 3, which contained for the year ahead the personal allowances, including the £4,400, Deputy Bruton put down an amendment seeking to transform it into a tax credit system and behold, The Workers' Party Deputies fully supported the Financial Resolution. The Labour Party voted against it and in my opinion reacted honourably.  Now, because the Labour Party puts down an amendment to increase the £4,400 limit to £4,800 The Workers' Party have apparently undergone a traumatic change of mind.  That must be put on record, because if we are going to have a general election we will not have it on the terms of supporting Government Financial Resolutions right through the lobby of the House and careering into <Col N="1692" /> selected constituencies and then saying: &ldquo;We stand for further PAYE relief, further taxation relief right down the line&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision of Deputies to stand for Dáil Éireann and participate in the democratic process, but they cannot have it both ways in the parliamentary proportional representation democratic process.  I in no way ask for support &mdash; it is up to the Deputies to decide how they wish to vote on this amendment.  I will leave it at that.  Further, to copperfasten the point, if the Deputies have put down amendments as they have done &mdash; any Deputy can put down amendments; they shoved in a shoal of them last night about 6.30 or 7 p.m. to the General Office &mdash; one wonders at the tremendous change of mind that has occurred in this regard since the Second Stage of the Finance Bill only seven days ago.  The Finance Bill contains, as the Minister outlined in detail, the personal tax changes.  They fully supported the Government on that. Therefore, let it be clearly on the record that we are asking the Minister to accept our modest amendment, our necessary amendment, and we are not going to support the £5,000 lark in that regard.  I want to make that absolutely clear.</P>
      <P>Finally, may I say to the Minister &mdash; and he may want to respond &mdash; that the Labour Party have other amendments down in relation to the Finance Bill.  I am not in the business in moving amendment No. 1, of indulging in a Dutch auction, of upping the ante &mdash; if one amendment is accepted, you are screwed in the next amendment and the one thereafter and so on.  That is the way the Finance Bill is structured.  If you wish to discuss a matter, you must table an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to behave in a wholly irresponsible way in regard to any amendment.  In relation to some of the amendments I put down I do not know the precise costings because the Labour Party do not have all the data available to the Department of Finance.  I do know that some of our amendments &mdash; and additional amendments follow on &mdash; in section 3, for example, will cost a substantial amount of money.  I am acutely aware of that and I am quite prepared to say to the Minister that I propose to act <Col N="1693" /> in a wholly responsible, constructive way in this matter.  I ask the Minister would he be prepared in that context to accept our amendment.  Inevitably I think the choice must rest with the Minister in that regard.  I make that point not in any sense of merely endeavouring to defeat a Government for the sake of defeating them; I make it to make progress with the Finance Bill.  The Minister has indicated that he currently has a departmental expenditure review going on which apparently is to yield £20 million.  No doubt that review can be extended; no doubt the £4 million and £6 million in a full year can be accommodated without destroying the integrity of the current budget deficit which we want to maintain in consideration of the financial solvency of the country.  I have no doubt that also can be maintained and I just want to ask the Minister if he has any response to make.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to thank Deputy Desmond for his explanation regarding his approach to the amendments.  It is very easy for any Deputy to make the case in relation to £4 million in the case of the Labour Party amendment and £6.5 million this year in the case of The Workers' Party amendment. The Minister and the Government are being asked to accept these.  I do not intend to delay the proceedings and I have desisted from contributing to the debate and answering some of the points made in the last couple of hours.  If we look at this, the first series of amendments, which cost £4 million to £6.5 million, and then go on right through the series of amendments up to No. 90, or whatever it is, the same point can be made.  We have amendments down in the names of other Deputies.  We have an amendment from Deputy Bruton in relation to VAT on imports which would cost £140 million.  Step by step, amendment by amendment, the same case is made to the Minister and to the Government: it is only £2 million, only £4 million.  I said at the outset in relation to this amendment that it is £4 million and that it goes on to the budget deficit, on to the level of borrowing.  Multiply that by 90 other <Col N="1694" /> amendments and you run into hundreds of millions.  I made the position clear in my first intervention on the amendments and I have no alternative but to oppose it.</P>

      <P>The whole thrust of the Fine Gael approach to this amendment seems to be that they have something better to offer.  Possibly they made a mistake this morning in seeking to have amendments Nos. 1 and 2 separated from the rest of the amendments because they have spent the rest of the time talking about everything else in the Bill.  The point was made that they did not ignore the less well-off, and they did not.  They proceeded in their budgetary efforts to place tax on clothes and shoes, to remove the subsidies on butter, etc., and unfortunately at that time they were supported in that move by the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>In speaking this morning to amendments Nos. 1 and 2 Deputy Bruton stated that they had tried to put tax on social welfare benefits because they considered that would be of benefit to the lower paid. Really I cannot see the logic of that when you consider that the social welfare benefits which people receive have been paid for by themselves, that these recipients have paid tax on the contributions they made in relation to the social welfare element.  The whole thrust of the Fine Gael approach on this amendment has been to try to pre-empt a debate on the rest of the Bill.  We are in this House to try to debate a Bill for the organising of the finances of the State.  Either we are serious about trying to improve this Bill or we are not, and it would seem that Fine Gael are not serious about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that the Labour Party are making a serious attempt.  They have stated that they want a debate on this section and on all the other sections.  I regret that they have indicated that they will not support our amendment on the tax exemption limits, because our amendment will benefit 32,000 of the lower paid, whereas the Labour Party amendment will benefit 19,000.  Therefore, there is a significant difference between what the Labour Party are proposing in relation to benefits for the lower <Col N="1695" /> paid and what we are proposing in this regard.  As to the cost, it has been stated that the Labour Party proposal will cost £4 million and ours approximately £6.5 million.  But we have indicated that the rest of our amendments on this Bill show clearly how this money can be raised in terms of wealth tax etc., trying to close the various loopholes in our tax system, and taking wealth from those, who continually avoid paying income tax of any kind.  When you consider that the PAYE sector &mdash; who, as has been said already in this House, pay their tax every Friday night &mdash; are contributing 80 to 90 per cent of the income tax, whereas another large sector of the community such as the farming sector are contributing something like 1 per cent, you can recognise a serious anomaly there.  If this House is serious about rectifying that anomaly, the House should support our amendment, which is looking for an increase in exemption rates to £5,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The case has been well made from these benches for the necessity of getting Government approval for this amendment on behalf of the lower paid and those who are overtaxed.  We know that throughout the country in recent years there has been a great deal of discontent about the taxation position of this group.  In that spirit we put forward this amendment.  It is also important for the country to discover the nature of the scaffolding upholding this Government, their conditions and so forth.  It is important that we know how the rest of this Finance Bill is to be taken. This amendment is the litmus test of the Government's approach towards amendments. My party in Government have borne the heat of the day in dealing with the problems of our economy in the spirit of normal exchange of debate in this House.  We can take lectures from the Minister on difficulties facing the economy, but it comes ill from those benches when you think of their behaviour in recent months and years and their profiligate mismanagement of the economy which has brought the country and the economy to this threatened sorry <Col N="1696" /> pass.  At any rate, after many speakers and many hours of a debate, while we welcome the spirit of loquaciousness which has descended on the Government benches, dissidents and supporters alike we now think that it is time for a vote. We have heard enough.</P>

      <P>This is what must be on the record.  At an earlier stage it was proposed to take amendments Nos. 1 to 24 together and this was rejected out of hand.  Two reasons were put forward. Deputy Desmond said that because his amendment was submitted earlier &mdash; how much earlier does not make any difference &mdash; he wanted it taken separately. Three or four Fine Gael Deputies, starting with Deputy Bruton, said strongly that by reason of the fact that amendment No. 2 proposed to increase the tax allowances it was separate and should be taken separately.  That was the decision accepted by us at that time.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, you need have no concern they will not be taken separately.  The point at issue which you seem to be evading, with great respect, is that in accordance with Standing Orders to amend a technical section of the Finance Bill the first vote to be taken is on the motion that the words stand.  The words in the Bill relate to £4,400.  We vote on that and, as you well know, in the event of those words being voted down, you are obliged to continue with my amendment which is taken separately and proposes that £4,800 be inserted instead.  Then we vote on that. Any other interpretation is wholly unacceptable.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 20, to delete &ldquo;£2,200&rdquo;, and substitute &ldquo;£2,400&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to increase the basic tax exemption for a single person from £2,200 to £2,400.  As the Minister is aware, as a result of the exemption which he gave in the March budget a single person earning £2,200 had an existing tax liability of £120 and that was reduced to nil by the Minister in extending the allowance for single and widowed persons from £2,000 to £2,200. We propose to extend the limit to £2,400</P>
      <P>At the moment a single person with a total income of £3,000 will have a current tax liability of £237.50 less the marginal PRSI relief given subsequently.  We are suggesting that the relief be extended upwards.  It means that a person earning around £45 to £47 per week would not be liable to tax.  I do not know how many single or widowed persons would be given the exemption.  However, we consider it an equitable measure and we ask the Minister to consider sympathetically this request from the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>Ths amendment is extending to single people the same increase in their allowance as was to be extended by the amendment that has just been defeated.  It is logical that they should run together.  The Minister was not able to give a separate costing but I can understand that.  We will support this amendment as we consider it reasonable in the circumstances.  It is within the confines of the tax allowance system.  As the House is aware, when we were in Government we did something to change the tax allowance system to a more fair credits system.  It is the best that can be done to help the lower paid; in this case we are dealing with the single lower paid as distinct from married people about whom we were concerned in the previous amendment.</P>

I gave a global reply on the 24 amendments to section 1.  I repeat that the increases in general, coupled with increases in personal and secondary allowances, are the most that can be <Col N="1707" /> offered to lower paid and aged taxpayers in our present difficult budgetary circumstances. The same principle underlies all 24 amendments and my reply in each case would therefore be similar.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point Deputy McCreevy has made.  There would have been a great case for the line he is adopting in respect of the last two votes because of the constitutional decision in regard to the treatment of married couples; there is a constitutional necessity that a married couple be treated the same as two single people in terms of <Col N="1712" /> their allowances.  Had Deputy McCreevy made the point he has now made at that stage there would have been something in it but that does not apply in this instance.  This is concerned with older members of the community who get an additional tax allowance.  It is an entirely open policy matter on which we can, as a House, have a view, that there should be discrimination of a greater degree, relatively speaking, than exists at present given that the previous amendments have not been passed in favour of older people.</P>
      <P>We have made the decisions about the basic allowances and what is at stake now is whether we should give a further additional allowance to older people, which is a new issue from the one we have been discussing up to now.  Whereas the Minister made the case that for him £4 million was too much, and that he could not afford the generality of the amendments proposed by the Labour Party, I am quite sure that the cost of this amendment &mdash; which is merely extending an allowance to older taxpayers &mdash; would be very small indeed.</P>
      <P>We are now afforded perhaps a fortuitous opportunity, nonetheless very real, to give something helpful to the older members of our community in terms of an increased tax allowance.  I believe we should definitely support this amendment. Having succeeded in the other two votes, albeit by a very narrow and insecure margin, perhaps the Minister could see his way to accepting this amendment. The cost will be minimal and it will be constructively helping the older members of our community in regard to taxation. As the House is aware, there has been a considerable amount of controversy about the fact that old age pensions are liable to income tax.  I do not want to get involved in that argument.  I can see that if one excludes certain categories of income from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying just before we had our well-earned break, there is a lot of agitation because old age pensioners are taxed at all.  People feel if they are receiving pensions which have been funded by contributions they made during their lifetime which was out of taxed income, even though they got tax allowances in respect of the contributions, they should not be taxed a second time on the pensions.  I am not advocating that case because I believe one has to bear in mind that the more categories of income you exempt altogether from tax the more opportunities you are giving for tax avoidance.  Obviously, if you exempted pensions you would have a situation contrived whereby people would be taking huge incomes in the form of pensions once they passed a certain age and not paying any tax at all on those pensions simply on the basis that the pensions <i>per se</i> had been exempted.</P>
      <P>I am not advocating that case but I believe we have to recognise that this case has a fair degree of support and that there is a considerable amount of anger among older people because they pay so much tax on their pensions.  Deputy Desmond's amendment affords us an opportunity of doing something to help the older people who are paying tax by increasing the exemption for them.  I believe it is a very valid amendment.  I do not believe it will cause any constitutional difficulties because it does not discriminate between married and single people. The Minister should consider accepting it.  I would be interested if the Minister could let us have a costing for this amendment separate from the other amendments because obviously it will not cost £4 million.  I imagine it would cost significantly less and it would be useful to have that information.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy B. Desmond and Deputy Bruton in relation to the cost element, as I said at the outset <Col N="1714" /> this morning, the computer in the Revenue Commissioners costed all of the two series of amendments proposed and I gave those figures already.  I do not have individual breakdowns of the cost.  I do not want to repeat myself, I know there has been a distinction made between the first four amendments and amendment No. 5, but already that distinction is recognised when we see the £4,400 coming up to £5,000 for those over 65.</P>
      <P>As I said, in reply to the first amendment, which was a general and global reply in relation to the 24 amendments to section 1, these particular areas cannot be looked at in isolation.  The purpose of the exercise I undertook on 9 March was to devise, within the existing systems of taxation, the same benefits for the individual taxpayer as were proposed in the 27 January proposals.  That included exemption limits, personal allowances, child allowances and tax band charges. Any one part of that overall package cannot be divorced from my main interest in providing, within the existing structures generally, the same benefits for all taxpayers, and that we succeeded in doing.  I am sorry that I do not have the cost for which the Deputies have asked. Perhaps on Committee Stage it may be possible for the Revenue Commissioners to get that information for me out of the computer.  So far, that has not been the position.  If I can get this information at a later stage, I will very gladly give it to the Deputies.  For the reasons which I have already mentioned in relation to the other amendments, including the aged taxpayers, the most favourable treatment which can be offered, bearing in mind the difficult budgetary circumstances, have been implemented in the terms of the Bill outlined in section 1 at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>For the sake of illustration, the figure to which we are referring in this instance is the substitution of £5,400 for £5,000, which in itself is a substitution for the figure £4,600 in section 2 (6) (a) of the 1980 Act.  This Act, in turn, is referred back to the principal Act, that of 1967, which states: &ldquo;In a case where the individual would, apart from this section, be entitled to a deduction <Col N="1715" /> specified in paragraph (a) of the said section 138 ...................&rdquo; I would like to determine exactly what figure we are talking about here by reference to section 138 of the original Act. Could the Minister help us in this matter? I understand that this refers to a case of a husband whose tax is assessed for the year of assessment in accordance with the provisions of section 194, or who proves that his wife is not living with him but is fully maintained by him for the year of assessment and that he is not entitled in computing his income for tax purposes of that year to make any deduction in respect of the sums paid by him for the maintenance of his wife.  He would get a deduction of £2,230.</P>
      <P>Could we establish, by reference to the section concerned, what exactly we are talking about?  It is rather unfortunate that the legislation is so framed that to determine what exactly one is referring to, not only must one refer to the Finance Act of 1980 but back from that to the Finance Act of 1967.  When we get there, we find that the relevant section of the Finance Act of 1967 does not give us the answer, but refers us back to another section of the 1967 Act, section 194.  This concerns an assessment in respect of the income of both spouses.</P>
      <P>Are we, in fact, talking about what we think we are talking about?  This looks like a reference to people who are separated, rather than a reference to the aged. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the position?</P>

      <P>I was afraid that I had made my case on the wrong basis in the first instance.  May I say, without repeating myself unduly, it is a pity that the Minister has not been able to provide the costing of this amendment.  This is an amendment which stands on its own feet, independently of the other amendments upon which we have already made a decision.  Would the Minister, or those advising him, know approximately how many people are at the moment claiming reduction of their tax on the basis of this section?  I would have thought that that figure would be reasonably readily available. The Minister might be able to tell us how many people claimed last year, if the information for this year is not available. That would give us some idea of the order of magnitude of the costing.</P>
      <P>The whole thing costs £4 million and it may transpire that somewhere in the region of 10 per cent of all taxpayers come within this section.  Assuming that the average income of people over 65 is likely to be less than for those under 65 and, for the sake of argument, that 10 per cent of taxpayers will be involved, one could assume, I would have thought, that the cost of this concession would be in the region of 7 per cent to 8 per cent of the total figure for all the amendments. We are talking now of 7 per cent of £4 million &mdash; a very small amount, really.  If the Minister has had qualms or trouble about the formula, he should not have much trouble about giving a concession costing such a small amount of money to people over 65.  I am surprised that he has not been able to give us this information, but I am not making any unfair criticism either of him or of those advising him.  One does not need a computer to give this sort of information.  Ministers have been able to do so in the House long before computers were invented.</P>

      <P>We probably have more <Col N="1717" /> public servants in the Department of Finance even though it is not a particularly overstaffed Department, I must say &mdash; than we had in the years when they were able to give the information without the aid of computers.  We should not be pleading the excuse of the Revenue computer as a basis for not giving reasonable information like this, which would be useful to us in looking at this amendment. In my view, for what it is worth, this amendment would cost somethere in the region of £200,000 to £300,000, that is all &mdash; a very small amount of money.  Given that it is helping people over 65 and also that there is a concensus in the House that people over 65 need special help as far as tax is concerned &mdash; we all agree that they should get a rent allowance which others are not getting &mdash; it is not inconsistent, philosophically or fiscally, to grant some special extra tax allowance to the over 65s.  Deputies who might have felt constrained to vote for the Government, if the Government decided to oppose this amendment &mdash; which I hope they will not &mdash; on the grounds of £4 million being too much, I am sure that they could swallow £200,000 to help the old with their tax.  That is not too difficult to accept, from either a financial or ethical point of view.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Deputies concerned who are, in a sense, determining the affairs of the House at the moment to consider supporting this amendment. Clearly, if the Government accept this, there is no great issue of principle involved or, if the Government are defeated on this amendment, they would not necessarily feel in the same compromised position as if they had failed to carry the earlier amendments.  This would cost only a minimal sum of money in respect of people of an age who deserve help.  I suggest that the Minister accept the amendment and I ask Deputies who supported the Minister in previous division to support this amendment. It would cost only about £200,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for not having the breakdown or the information I have been asked for.  If I were to agree to these exemption limits I would be making <Col N="1718" /> allowances for more rich people than poor.  The marriage allowance must be double that of the single allowance.  That is a reality.  It is not entirely a matter of cost.  What is being done here involves a combination of income limitation, tax band allowances and to give the same advantage to individual taxpayers <i>vis-à-vis</i> credits versus allowances.  As I said in relation to amendment No. 1, the Bill provides for increases of the size expected in respect of single and married and aged people.  We cannot do better in existing difficult budgetary circumstances. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>If I can get the additional information requested later in the Committee Stage I will give it to Deputies.  As Deputy Bruton said, before the computer age it was possible to get such information.  If I can get it I will gladly give it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Bruton's view on the amendment.  Effectively what we are saying to the Minister relates more to the 75 years-plus group than the 65 to 75 group.  There are not many of them, but in terms of actual income it has been clearly established that the over 75 years group tend dramatically to have declining incomes, or at best fixed incomes.  I do not have precise information of the numbers claiming the age allowance.  It would be interesting to know how many people claim the age allowance at ages 65 to 75 years and those of 75 plus.  I do not think it would be exaggerating to say that one could reasonably estimate the cost at not more than £400,000.  Therefore, the relief we are looking for in the amendment would cost very little.  The Minister can say what he likes about his objection to accepting any of these amendments, but when framing the amendments I deliberately kept the cost of accepting them to a very small amount of money.  However, it could have a considerable impact on the people concerned, especially those of more than 65 years of age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have found information which will indicate the order of magnitude involved.  Widows and widowers <Col N="1719" /> caught in the tax net are more likely to be older than 65 years.  In the 1977-78 tax year there were 183,000 single males and 166,000 females paying tax.  There were 72,000 married couples with the wives earning and 247,000 married couples with wives not working.  That adds up to a substantial number of taxpayers.  There were only 9,000 widowers and 23,000 widows in the tax net out of 702,000 paying tax.  That is a very tiny proportion. I am not saying there are many widowers and widows of under 65 years of age.  The people concerned in the amendment are a tiny proportion of those paying tax and I think Deputy Desmond's estimate of £400,000 is far too generous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>One can make this case in respect of each of the 24 amendments and the overall picture would be as I have already stated.  We have provided an income limit in these cases equal to £100 a week for the over 65s. We cannot look at each amendment in isolation.  Deputy Bruton would have to accept that we cannot pick out one of the categories involved and say, &ldquo;We will do it for that section because it would cost only £X millions&rdquo;.  We must always watch <Col N="1720" /> the trigger mechanism that operates throughout exemption limits.  I do not think anybody can pick out a suggestion like this, or the one contained in the next amendment, and suggest that it should be implemented.  However, because of the points that have been raised in the course of the debate and in the absence of the information in regard to cost and numbers &mdash; the point was made by both speakers about the age structure of such people &mdash; I undertake to examine the matter in the context of any review of exemption limits during the course of the preparation of next years' budget.  That is as far as I am prepared to go.  I will see if it will be possible to do anything in the preparation of next year's budget.</P>

I have been searching through the various Financial Statements presented since 1978 and I still maintain that one is talking about a figure in the region of £300,000 or £400,000. That is tenable and because of that I will press the amendment, to a division if necessary.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be familiar with the argument in relation to the basic exemption relief for a person aged between 65 years and 75 years.

      <P>For the reasons I have already given on numerous occasions I will not delay the House.  However, I have some information regarding this amendment and the previous one which I will give the House.  To take amendment No. 7 first, the number of people over 75 availing of age exemptions is 7,000 of whom 2,500 are married and 4,500 are either single or widowed.  The figure in the 65 to 75 age group is 27,500 of whom 14,500 are married and 13,000 are in the single and widowed category. Again, I must apologise for not having the actual cost but if it comes to hand during the course of the debate, I shall give it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This confirms that my estimates were almost accurate.  Having <Col N="1724" /> regard to the number of people in the tax net the proportion involved is tiny.  For the two amendments the total is 35,000 while the total number of people in the tax net in the year 1977-78 was 702,000. That number is probably similar now, though it may be slightly more.  Therefore, in relation to these two amendments we are talking of about 5 per cent of the total number in the tax net.  If the cost of all the concessions amounted to £4 million, the cost in the case in question would be in the region of £200,000.  That would be in respect of both concessions and given that of the 35,000 who are over 65, only 7,000 are over 75, I would expect the cost of the concession we are talking about here to be in the region of £40,000. That is a very small sum of money.  Considering that the Government have decided to buy a castle in Galway for £400,000, what we are talking about here is only one-tenth of the cost of that castle.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister should very seriously examine what I regard as the relative social inadequacy of children's allowances in the tax situation. We have failed to pay sufficient attention to this matter.  There is a body of authoritative social research which gives the cost of maintenance of a child within the family unit and one is talking about 40 per cent of the adult rate for certain age groups.  It is quite exceptionally high.  I have no doubt that in the context of our tax structure the tax allowances for children are quite disproportionate as against allowances for single persons and for married persons.  The amounts given in tax allowances for children have become regressive over the past two or three years.  I say that notwithstanding that children's allowances, which are across the board, by and large have also areas of regression in them because farmers as we well know&mdash;there are 150,000 farmers very many of whom are married but the vast bulk of whom pay no income tax &mdash; get ordinary children's allowances and do not make a tax contribution.  Definitely in my opinion there is a very serious social discrimination against PAYE payers and those generally liable for income tax but who only get at this stage an actual £100 per child. Admittedly, the cost is quite high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1728" /> I do not propose to press this amendment to a division but I ask the Minister in the context of next year's budget and of the report of the Commission on Income Taxation &mdash; I am rather dubious about what that commission would suggest in regard to children's allowances and this whole area &mdash; to have a social study done on this aspect within the Department of Finance.  The Department, with their pervasive influence over budget content, with respect to the staff concerned, exert tremendous influence over the Minister.  That is not inappropriate, but the Minister should also be a man in his own right prepared to write his own budget speech.  Invariably there tends to be reluctance to give relief on the childrens' allowance side.  I strongly urge the Minister to examine particularly the social cost of child maintenance within the family, within the single parent family where it is also very high, and within the family with one parent, a widow or widower.  I have no doubt that there is an imbalance in our tax structure discriminating against children, a unique imbalance that has come about in the past seven or eight years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton when Minister made a brave effort in the context of the family supplement scheme and general turning about of the tax structure to achieve equity, but I think time was too short and the amount of work to be done too great. The end result is that we have now lapsed back into the old personal allowances and tax bands.  I am not putting my amendment to a division because amendments Nos. 25 and 26 together involve something in the region of £20 million.  I should like to see that money go to large families and families in greatest social need.  I am not so sure that my amendment achieves social equity but there is a serious anomaly in connection with children's allowances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Richie Ryan when Minister for Finance also made a tremendous effort in this connection when he suggested the clawback in relation to elements of children's allowances which were given indiscriminately to everybody in the community, as is still the situation.  We all recall the vilification which Deputy Ryan <Col N="1729" /> incurred at that time when he suggested a change in regard to the money given out to the population irrespective of income.  That does not happen in any other European country; there is a tax relationship in the money given out.  Taking these points into consideration I urge the Minister to examine the situation which is now discriminatory and unjust and lacks basic equity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it can be shown by reference to the records in regard to tax and benefits for families with children that families with children have lost very substantially in benefits and allowances against tax in the last five or six years. Probably a crucial point in the whole matter was the decision which granted a married couple the right to the same allowance as a single person.  The Government financed that change at the time largely by failing to increase the benefits for families with children.  In our tax structure a married couple with six children proportionately speaking were much better off five or six years ago relative to a married couple with no children than they are now.  This is a socially regressive trend, and to a large extent an unconscious trend in our tax policy.  I do not think any Minister at any time said: &ldquo;We are being too generous to large families&rdquo;. They just slipped into the situation because of other decisions that had to be taken at different times.  We have ended up with a tax system which in my view is fundamentally unjust to large families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking from memory, which I think is reasonably accurate, the child benefit in Britain is about three times as generous as it is here even though our old age pension and social benefits are the same or even less than equivalent benefits in Britain.  This shows that we are concentrating all the benefits on people who are voters, adults.  If you are an adult you get the benefit but no benefits are being given in terms of families with large numbers of children because the additional children have no vote.  I think that is what has happened in a sense, that in voting strength large families are a small minority &mdash; even though in terms of population <Col N="1730" /> they are not a small minority.  Progressively, for a number of years past we have been making the situation worse and worse for large families.  We have failed to increase child allowances &mdash; in fact we have cut them &mdash; although my budget and the budget of the present Minister did increase child benefits, and the present Minister's budget increased child benefits fairly substantially, but they are still about one-third the equivalent rate in the UK even though our other social benefits are roughly line ball with those in the UK.  I urge that this is very unjust. I do not believe that child tax allowances &mdash; which is what this amendment is about &mdash; are the best way of giving benefits to large families because they are of most benefit to large families in the 60 per cent tax band and they are of no benefit to large families who are not paying tax.  We should aim to have a generous, means-tested child benefit which would go direct to all families on low incomes, regardless of whether their income comes from social welfare or work.  At present persons on social welfare get child benefits, which are reasonably generous and which are built into their social welfare allowances, but if the head of such a household goes out to work he ceases to get the child benefit element in his social welfare payment and all he has is a very ungenerous child tax allowance to set against the income he derives from work.  Also if he goes out to work he pays tax, whereas if he stays at home on the same income from social benefits he pays no tax at all on it.</P>
    <P>We should aim to do away with the child benefit element in social welfare payments and use that money to give it to everyone on a low income whether at work or on social benefit.  Probably we should aim to abolish child tax allowances altogether and give the money thereby saved in the form of a means-tested child benefit to the low income families whether they are at work or not, and we should aim to have that benefit at least as generous as the one that obtains in Britain at the moment.  This is a reasonable opportunity to put my views forward on this.  I do not expect the Minister to comment on them at this stage but I hope we <Col N="1731" /> will have another opportunity to discuss these matters.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister to comment on the point in relation to the dependent relative allowance.  That allowance was introduced in the 1949 budget by the late Deputy Paddy McGilligan as Minister for Finance.  It has remained almost exactly the same since it was introduced.  It had hardly been increased at all until I proposed to increase it in my budget of January and now the Minister is increasing it again. Deputy Desmond seeks to increase it further. If this dependent relative allowance had been index-linked since it was introduced in 1949 it would be around £500 or £600 now.  Probably when it was introduced it was equal to or not much less than the personal allowance given to the taxpayer himself but it has remained at £95 until very recently, whereas the personal allowance has gone up to about £1,000.  We should discuss the reason why this has happened.  On the face of it it seems unjust that the allowance to a taxpayer who is keeping an aged relative, his mother, mother-in-law or father-in-law or any other relative who is not able to earn a living, should be treated so ungenerously that the allowance has remained static since 1949, while we have increased enormously all the other allowances.</P>
    <P>I am drawing now on advice that I got in the Department of Finance, so I more than suspect that the reason that we have not increased the dependent relative allowance is that it is impossible to police it and to find out whether the dependent relative is really dependent on the taxpayer. A person can put in a claim for his Uncle Mick who might have been dead for ten years and the Revenue Commissioners have no way of finding out whether he is dead or alive.  Certainly they have no way of finding out if he is dependent on the taxpayer or has an income of his own.  Uncle Mick could be Nephew Mick who succeeded his uncle and the taxpayer could still be claiming for him so long as he is not in the tax net. It seems that we have not increased this provision because we are not sure that <Col N="1732" /> we can enforce it adequately, but that is illogical.  If we believe that the thing is so wide open to abuse, why should we not do away with it altogether and not waste money on it?  Alternatively, we should increase it but police it properly.  We should give a reasonable dependent relative allowance but make sure that it is available only to people who are dependent on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Now that we have a combined PRSI system where everyone has a number whether he is in the tax situation or welfare situation, it should not be too difficult to devise a dependent relative allowance system that would be enforceable, that would ensure that only people really dependent on the taxpayer would get it. I would like to ask the Minister if he has considered this point and if he can suggest if it would be possible &mdash; not at this time, not until he is satisfied that he has a method of ensuring that the dependent relative allowance will not be abused and to go any further at this stage would not be a great idea &mdash; before next year's budget to re-examine the whole operation of the dependent relative allowance to ensure that we have an allowance that is capable of being policed accurately and given to genuine cases.  I would like the Minister to give me his comments on this and to state if he agrees that what I have said is correct about the dependent relative allowance in his experience and, if so, what he would propose to do about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to reflect that if the dependent relative allowance was increased he would save money in other areas where relatives are put into Eastern Health Board and other homes when, if the allowance was more generous more families would be more willing to keep their dependent relatives. On the one hand he might increase the allowance but he might find that he would have a saving in the other area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Starting at the end of those two comments, largely I cannot disagree with any of the points that have been made with regard to the dependent relative allowance.  For the information <Col N="1733" /> of the House, 126,000 people are affected by that allowance.  What Deputy Bruton said in relation to the administrative and controlling problems and so on is largely true.  I cannot disagree too much with what he has said and I will undertake to have examined very carefully the points he has made in the context of seeing how best we can streamline this whole area in relation to dependent relatives.</P>
      <P>The last point made is arguable.  If you increase the allowances too much people might, just for the benefit of the allowance, take out of institutions people who are not fit to come out.  The Deputy rightly made the other point that if the allowance was reasonable many people who are put into institutions would not have been put in in the first case.  We have a two-sided argument there.  I have taken careful note of the points made and in the context of future reviews in this regard I will see if there is any way that we could streamline this approach.</P>
      <P>On the main point, the child allowance, taking the points that Deputy Desmond has raised, it is quite true that we have now reached the situation where we are writing out the child from the tax system and compensating in other ways under the social welfare code.  The point he and Deputy Bruton made is that we should have a very close examination of this matter.  There is a difference between what Deputy Desmond and what Deputy Bruton said about what should be done. I gathered from Deputy Desmond's approach that, as he proposes in his amendment, there should be an increased child allowance.  On the other hand, Deputy Bruton put forward the suggestion he already put forward in his Programme for Government and in his budget statement of 27 January, which was to take away the tax allowance completely and combined it and the children's allowance for some sort of child benefit. There is a bit of a contradiction in what was said by Deputy Bruton and Deputy Desmond.</P>

      <P>I am not saying there <Col N="1734" /> is or there is not.  It shows there are different views and different approaches to this question <i>vis-à-vis</i> the social welfare code, children's allowances, child benefits and the taxation code or a combination of them.  I will see if we can make any progress regarding the situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> social welfare and tax allowances. I will look into it very carefully to see if there is any way in which we can streamline that consession.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances of the overall package of measures to which I referred on previous amendments, I have to oppose this.  Deputy Desmond said he will not press it.  We are talking about £18 million and £20 million in a full year which is a sizeable amount of money.  I have taken careful note of the points made about dependent relative and child allowances.  I undertake to have them carefully examined.  I am much more confident than Deputy Bruton may be that I will be introducing the January budget and I hope that in some way I may be able to include some of the points made by both Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In this instance it does not seem to be relevant which of us will be introducing the budget.  We seem to be pretty much in agreement on what should be done.  Might I make a further suggestion to the Minister in elaboration of what I have already said?  In respect of the dependent relative, probably the best thing we could do would be to introduce, if possible, a dependent relative tax credit.  If you have a dependent relative allowance it has the effect that it tends to give a disproportionately large benefit to somebody who has most of his income on the 60p rate.  If in the course of changing it into something which could be capable of being properly policed we could introduce it as a credit, it would be of equal benefit to all taxpayers.  That might be the best course of action to adopt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be interested to see what the Commission on Taxation will have to say about it.  I hope they will not suggest that the dependent relative allowance should be abolished because it is too inconvenient to find a system which works.  That might be the temptation they would have. <Col N="1735" /> It was introduced for a legitimate reason in 1949 and it has been our successive failure to make it capable of working properly.  The fact that it has not worked properly in the past derives from the fact that we did not make an effort to make it work properly.  We should try now, and a tax credit would probably be the best outcome to have in the January budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have a look at that point as well.  We are all anxious to secure a system which has greater equity.  That is why the Commission on Taxation were set up two years ago.  I understand that on 5 July or 7 July the commission will present me with a report. I will deal with it immediately and present it to the Government, and the Government will express their view on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be a matter for the Government.  The commission were set up to enable us to have more equity within the system.  When we consider all the various exemption limits, and allowances, and dependent relative allowances and child allowances, and so on, we realise that we have sought to assist those areas under the taxation code or the social welfare code.  Whether the allowances will go up at a given time or come down depends on the finances among other things.  Perhaps there is a different approach towards helping these sections of the community.  I hope the commission have directed their attention to it and will give us some guidance on what decisions might be taken in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 11, Part I of the Table, to delete &ldquo;£3,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£4,500&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If carried, this amendment would have the effect of restoring the tax bands to what they were in the last tax year.  This is not a proposal to restructure the entire tax system.  I am not under the illusion that I am introducing a budget.  The Fianna Fáil budget proposal set out in the Finance Bill aims to reduce the 35 per cent tax band by one-third, from £4,500 to £3,000 for single people and from £9,000 to £6,000 for married couples. Even without inflation this would mean an increase in tax for many workers. Combined with inflation it represents a plan for a massive increase in the PAYE yield both as a proportion of workers' pay and as a proportion of total taxation. As a result huge numbers of workers will find themselves pushed into higher tax bands with many paying 60 per cent by the end of the tax year.</P>
      <P>I pointed this out in my statement on budget day when, sadly, some of the other socialist Deputies, in The Workers' Party notably, were welcoming this budget as reasonable, well-balanced and a tremendous improvement and benefit. Indeed, they could find no fault whatsoever with it.  I have been glad to notice that recently The Workers' Party have had second thoughts on the matter and I hope they will now reverse their vote of 25 March last and vote for this amendment to oppose this massive imposition on PAYE workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With this single but significant exception, I must say Deputy Desmond's new financial proposals represent a considerable improvement on those he supported in January.  I would give my support to <Col N="1737" /> most of them.  I reject Deputy Desmond's suggestion that only the very well-off would benefit from my proposal.  A single man or woman on £6,362 in 1982-83 will pay 45 per cent tax, that is on £122 or so per week which is more than £20 below the average industrial wage.  If a person earns £8,362 over the year to next April, that is, about £160 a week, he or she will pay 55 per cent tax plus 7.5 per cent PRSI.  In other words, on any extra pound some of these people could be paying more than 60 per cent tax all told, more than the richest people in the country.</P>
    <P>A single person earning £10,362, or under £200 a week, will pay 60 per cent tax at the top rate.  By the end of this year, with inflation and the cost of living rising rapidly, these kind of earnings could hardly be described as princely. Similarly a married couple with only one earner bringing in about £12,000 over the course of the tax year may be better off than many but could not be said to be rich in a country with no wealth tax, a small tax on big farmers, and very low capital and profits tax.  Should they be asked to bear the penal burden of hitting the very highest tax rates?  Young workers who are paid well below the average industrial wage will now find themselves paying £52.5 per cent of every extra £1 between PAYE and PRSI, making it difficult for them to marry and set up home.  I can hardly believe the Labour Party and The Workers' Party want this kind of situation.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that Fine Gael and Labour opposed the Fianna Fáil proposal on budget day, 25 March, and then proposed an amendment to increase the lower tax bands again I must express my disappointment at their attitude since that date.  Deputy Michael Noonan of my own constituency, Limerick East, made a strong statement on that day protesting that the budget produced a situation whereby people on extraordinarily low levels of income would be moving into very high tax bands.  Today, however, he apparently finds this acceptable.  Deputy Bruton described the amendment on 25 March, quite similar to the one I am <Col N="1738" /> proposing today, as designed to help the lower paid.  I hope to hear something from Deputy Bruton today on that score. While I would prefer a system of tax credits as a more flexible and fairer system of taxation, my amendment nevertheless does benefit the lower paid and should be supported by all Members of this House who believe in genuine tax reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Kemmy quoted my statement after the Minister's statement on the budget I feel it is desirable for me to comment at this time. When I made that statement I meant what I said.  I did say that it was reasonable because we have now seen the contentious issues removed from the budget that was supported by Deputy Kemmy on January 27.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the issue and the fact is that we saw that these very contentious issues were removed from that budget and then I said it was reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But let us come to the issue now before us.  I want to refer to the increases in the personal allowance to the various categories. From 1981-82 a single person's allowance was £1,115 and that goes up to £1,450; for a married couple it was £2,230 and goes to £2,290.  I would not take that line because broadening the tax bands took away whatever was granted in those increased allowances.  Suffice it to say that in any consideration one gives one must have regard to the category of people at this time who would benefit from the amendment as proposed.  I do not think that Deputy Kemmy is entirely right when he refers to the people in the lower tax bands benefiting from the amendment if it were implemented.  First and foremost it is estimated that the proposal would cost about £50 million.  This is a very substantial amount of money and there has been no indication of how that money would be got.  Deputy Kemmy mentioned the resource tax amendment which would raise about £7 <Col N="1739" /> million.  In any case, it is not money that would be well spent in so far as it hands out substantial benefits to taxpayers in the higher income groups.  For example, a married couple earning about £19,000 a year would benefit by £20 a week from this measure but it would not mean anything to a married taxpayer with less than £11,500 a year, especially if he is not claiming interest relief on a mortgage. For those earning interest relief it will mean nothing for those with incomes up to £16,000.  Like the PRSI allowance the biggest benefit goes to those on the highest income; the more income the more the State foregoes tax revenue.  This is not the correct approach to the matter. Of course we have nothing against increasing the exemption limit or retaining the tax bands but if that revenue is to be recouped there has to be reference to the people in the higher tax brackets and those people are the people who will benefit if the amendment as proposed were implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will only be a moment.  I just wanted to say that it is quite obvious, when one studies the figures, that the order of the reliefs is such that the people on the smaller incomes achieve a proportionately higher reduction in the amount of tax which they pay. Surely this is the direction in which we have to try to move if we are to achieve a certain amount of tax equity which we are all trying to achieve.  For example, on income tax payable under PAYE on earnings of a married couple with three children a person on £7,000 would save about £120 a year in income tax.  Let us move up the scale to people on £15,000 who would pay an extra £125 a year in income tax.  Between £7,000 and £15,000 the scale tips the other way.  The people on £7,000 have a saving and the people on £15,000 pay more.  So the bands as they stand in the Bill are quite sensible. If they were the other way around it would be quite a serious situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, if one takes mortgages into account which most people here have to pay one finds the same thing.  A single person paying mortgage interest of about <Col N="1740" /> £2,000 per annum and earning £8,000 would pay an extra £90 or so in taxation under the present schedule which is not that great.  A person on £20,000 pays the best part of an extra £600, taking the mortgage relief into account.  While we could all write our own budget and put in our own figures and argue those figures the main thing that we have to be satisfied on as legislators is that the direction is the correct direction.  We can argue about the detail of that direction, but I am satisfied from these rates that the less well off gain more proportionately than the better off.  After that the only argument left is whether or not one has to raise any income tax.  As I said on Second Stage, the options are very limited.  If one raises taxation one increases the borrowing or one contains public expenditure. There is very little scope left for increasing taxation.  There is virtually no scope left for increased borrowing.  We will have to do what we can in the area of controlling and getting better value for State expenditure.  I am satisfied that under this schedule the drift is quite correct. If we were to adopt the amendment it could tip the scale not to the less well off which I know is the aim of the amendment but it would certainly tip the scale towards the better off because one would be widening the band to give them extra relief.  I do not think that is the direction we should go if we are to achieve tax equity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard the figures quoted against my amendment by Deputy Brennan and Deputy Sherlock and perhaps there is some truth in the statement made by Deputy Brennan about widening the tax bands.  I pointed out that the PAYE system is not flexible and I would prefer the tax credits which would give us the opportunity to do what I would like.  Nevertheless <Col N="1741" /> I will not have my figures disputed because they were carefully researched and analysed and will bear scrutiny by anybody.  I have no intention of amending them.</P>

      <P>I have not the slightest doubt that when he tabled his amendment he intended providing substantial tax reliefs across the board to those in greatest need.  He said those earning above £6,362 would benefit.  I share his view but there is a problem.  The average weekly earning of an industrial worker in transportable goods industries is £148 gross.  Under Deputy Kemmy's amendment, he does not gain one penny.  It was argued that he might get something on £120, but it would not be of any great consequence. I estimate that this would cost about £52 million and all that would go to the top 22 per cent of taxpayers.  Even examining the Revenue Commissioners' Report of December 1979, and looking at the total range of incomes, in terms of distribution of incomes, there is not much doubt that the relief proposed by Deputy Kemmy would not be substantial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been subjected to a great deal of almost personal abuse because of my attitude to taxation.  I believe we should pay our taxes, and that we cannot abolish income taxation or PRSI.  It is important to point out that under the existing Finance Bill a married couple earning £7,000 a year, which is below the average earnings of a PAYE worker, pays £1,000 taxes or 14.64 per cent of total income. We want an equitable tax system and I believe we can bring about such a system, but I do not believe there can be massive general reductions in overall income taxation. I believe that a very equitable PRSI system can be introduced.  The current system is chaotic, unfair and unjust, particularly for workers earning less than £9,500.  I do not believe one should pick <Col N="1742" /> figures out of the air and apply them across the board.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of propaganda going around about taxation.  One would swear the whole country was paying 45 per cent to 55 per cent income tax.  It is important to point out that under this Bill a married PAYE worker with PRSI allowance does not become liable to income tax at the rate of 45 per cent until his income is £11,800 a year.  It must be remembered that the media people sometimes pick this up because they earn above the average worker's earnings, as do politicians.  There are very few people in this country actually earning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Some people say that a person earning £10,000 or £12,000 is crucified on the 45 per cent rate.  The short answer is that there are not that many people earning that amount of money.  The average factory worker earns £148 a week gross, including overtime, shift allowances and week-end working, and the average take home pay is about £7,500.  Dublin Corporation workers got an increase of £7.50 a week sanctioned by the Labour Court, which brought the basic rate up to £132 a week. If the average local authority worker gets another £10 or £15 a week, his wage will be only £148 a week.  It is very important that all the people in the middle income group, those working in the media and politicians, who talk about people paying 55 per cent tax should appreciate that a married worker with a PRSI allowance does not become liable for income tax at the rate of 45 per cent until his income reaches £11,812.  If he has additional allowances for mortgage interest, medical expenses, life assurance, he would not reach the 45 per cent rate until his income is well in excess of that figure &mdash; he might have another £1,000 to claim and that means he might have to earn about <Col N="1743" /> £12,700 before he pays the 45 per cent rate.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of propaganda going around about income tax and PRSI.  About £1,600 million is collected in income taxation, of which the PAYE workers pay about £1,400 million.  The system is wrong, in terms of inequity and discrimination, to the tune of about £300 million or £400 million.  The system should be broadened.  I tend to part company with other Opposition Deputies here because I think the farming community should be paying an extra £60 million or £70 million in income taxation, the capital gains side should be increased by another £60 million or £70 million, and there should be a property tax.  What has happened is that a very large number of people have salted away substantial amounts of money in commercial banks under the £70 interest exemption and they used that money to buy property in the £70,000 and £80,000 bracket.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not that much out of order because as Deputy Kemmy correctly pointed out he is chasing tax equity, but we must chase it in the right direction.  If I had £52 million to hand out today to support Deputy Kemmy's amendment, I could not do it because this will benefit the top 25 per cent of taxpayers.  If I had that £52 million, there are many areas in which I would spend it &mdash;on large families, the elderly and those in greatest need.  I would say to Deputy Kemmy not to force a division on this. Report Stage has yet to come.  He has raised the general question of bands and he is quite free to table other amendments. He would not necessarily get our support at that stage but my view is that we should consider the whole matter.  In the 14 years I have been in Dáil Éireann this is the first time the Dáil has discussed a Finance Bill in depth.  The tragedy is that we have not had a committee of the Dáil to deal with taxation.  As a result, an <Col N="1744" /> enormous amount of political mythology and waffle about taxation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Kemmy where he pointed out that it would be far better if we could discuss this type of proposal in the context of tax credits.  As long as Deputy Kemmy is forced, by the abandonment of the Government of tax credits, into a situation of trying to seek relief in the tax code on the basis of extending bands that are on top of allowances it is inevitable that disproportionate benefit will be given to the better off.  This is an inevitable consequence of the fact that our system remains an allowance system.  I am glad the Deputy has expressed so clearly his support for the idea of tax credits.  If we could move towards tax credits we would be able to consider this kind of system.</P>
      <P>The problem for taxpayers this year is to some extent a problem of perception. The Government were trying to imitate our tax credit proposals while still retaining allowances.  That meant that artificially and in a very misunderstood way, so far as the taxpayers were concerned, they had to reduce the 35p band dramatically. If that had been done in the context of tax credits, even though many people would not be any better off in the end, there would not have been any rebellion because it would have been in the context of a reformed tax system based on credits and people at the bottom of the scale would come out better off with family income supplements.  However, as long as the Government try to imitate tax credits while still using allowances there will be many strange results such as the dramatically reduced 35p tax band.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because implementation of Deputy Kemmy's amendment would cost a substantial sum I do not think it can be contemplated at this time.  However, I sympathise with him in trying to achieve greater equity in the tax code.  While I find difficulty with his amendment I see myself in agreement with him on the need <Col N="1745" /> to move towards a system of tax credits. I hope that between us we will be able to create an opportunity in not too distant future to introduce tax credits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point made by Deputy Bruton, extending the tax bands gives greater benefits to the higher paid under any system, whether tax credits or allowances.  There has been a discussion on tax equity in relation to the amendments.  If the amendment was carried it would cost £53 million in 1982 and £82 million in a full year.  People in the 35 per cent band would not receive any benefit; those in the 45 per cent band would have a benefit of up to £200 per annum; those in the 55 per cent band a benefit of up to £500 per annum and those in the 60 per cent band would have a benefit up to £700 per annum.  I do not know how anyone can see equity in that.</P>
      <P>Here is an example &mdash; we have had many such examples during the day, although they were relatively minor in comparison &mdash; of political opportunism and of misreading deliberately what was done.  It has been described by Deputy Bruton as being artificial.  There was nothing artificial about it.  It was open, above-board and was explained quite clearly.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said it was artificial but there was nothing artificial about it.  Here is an example of political opportunism.  As Deputy Bruton pointed out, there would not have been the same reaction if what is being proposed was done by tax credits rather than by narrowing the bands.  The fact is that at the end of the day what matters for taxpayers &mdash; and I include myself &mdash; is the amount they have to pay and they are not too concerned about the mechanism used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals introduced by me were presented as a package of measures, the rate bands, exemption limits, personal allowances and child allowances.  As I said on many occasions, the package was introduced to give the same benefit to the <Col N="1746" /> individual taxpayer as was done under the proposals of January.  Amendments Nos. 27 and 28 in the name of Deputy Kemmy cannot be regarded as serious in their attempt to help the taxpayers or to give any equity in the tax system.  Neither do the amendments take any account of Exchequer finances.  If anyone studies my proposals they will see that the individual taxpayer will get the same benefits as were proposed under the tax credit system in January.</P>
    <P>I oppose both amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Desmond made the point that very few people have £200 a week.  That could well be so and, if it is so, it is an indictment of our economic structure and a reflection on our society. On £200 a week today one would not live like a Farouk.  Even if some few people are earning £200 a week there is an element of contradiction because you cannot complain on the other hand about 100 people gaining by my amendment. The picture painted by the media of a great number of workers groaning under the yoke of PAYE is not wrong because the tax marches and the reaction of people generally have shown that this is no illusion.  We have a number of lower paid workers and that is all the more reason for some genuine and drastic tax relief.  My amendment is designed to spread the tax load more equitably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton's point that the PAYE system is a crude system is correct.  PAYE is designed to take money from the workers every week but it does not respond in the same way in giving rebates and refunds.  There is no flexibility in it. I fully support what Deputy Bruton said. On the occasion of the March budget Deputy Bruton moved along the same line as I do and I regret that he cannot support my amendment tonight.  The Minister says he is objecting and he gives some examples but he did not advert to how my amendment would work.  He took the worst possible examples and I hope to check his figures later on to see if they are accurate.  He took aspects of the amendment which are not favourable. He ignored the favourable aspects. My amendment is designed primarily to <Col N="1747" /> redress some of the imbalances in our taxation system and I make no apology to anyone for doing that.</P>

      <P>We are being treated here to gross hypocrisy.  It almost borders on the obscene.  The proposal is to add £53 million to the budget this year and £82 million in a full year.  The Deputy is totally irresponsible in tabling this amendment.  Not only that but he has the gall to query the veracity of the figures given by the Minister with regard to the effect his amendment would have.  The figures given by the Minister show that of those in the 35 per cent tax band the figure is nil and in the 45 per cent tax band it would be up to £200.  In the 55 per cent tax band it would be £200 to £500 and in the 60 per cent £500 to £750. Does this really come from a Deputy who purports to represent the less well-off sections, who purports to support a party whose claim is at all times, though they voted consistently today in a different direction, that their ambition is to keep down Government expenditure and support cutbacks in the public sector?  Today they have voted consistently for the addition of extra taxation by their demands here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kemmy spoke of political parameters and the political philosophy of Deputy Bruton.  They seemed to share the same philosophy and political parameters on a surprising number of occasions today.  I am surprised the Deputy has done so little homework in the preparation of his amendment.  We have discussed several amendments today and the one thing that can be said about them all is that their proposers did their homework. That can at least be said for them. On this amendment, however, the Deputy comes in here in an utterly irresponsible manner and proposes the addition of an extra £53 million this year.</P>

Remembering the support Deputy Kemmy has given Fine Gael he should get the support of Fine Gael now.  He has gone with Fine Gael all along the line.  He has voted with them and he is entitled to expect Fine Gael to vote with him this evening.  They have ridden roughshod over every other principle. They rode roughshod last night in voting against an Estimate they themselves introduced here last January.  The Deputy is entitled to their support.

      <P>It is true what Deputy Desmond said.  A married couple earning up to £11,800 can claim benefits such as VHI, tax relief on mortgages and many other concessions.  If a farmer has a valuation between £20 and £40 his allowances are halved.  If he has other employment that is also taken into consideration and he will have to produce approved, audited accounts.  If farmers over £40 valuation make extra money they will be liable for income tax under the Act. There is a feeling in certain quarters that <Col N="1750" /> farmers are paying very little or no tax, but over the years there has been a substantial increase in what they pay.  In 1975 £1.1 million was collected and the following year it increased to £3 million.  In 1981 they paid £20 million and this year it is estimated they will pay £22.2 million. Deputy Desmond may not be aware of this as he represents an urban constituency. Some of the media have been saying of late that the farmers are getting off more lightly than others in regard to payment of taxation.  Farmers have the usual allowances and this was the case when the previous Government were in office. I am not making a case for the farming community but the number of farmers involved in paying tax is about 43,000, which is an increase on last year of approximately 1,800.</P>

I am fed up with that and it is not fair. Nobody wants to pay income tax.  Even Members of the House want to pay as little as they possibly can.  Deputy Kemmy mentioned the £45 million which was given in tax relief recently.  Is the Deputy opposed to that relief?  He seems to have some reservations about it.</P>

The Minister explained in great detail earlier that there was now an inquiry into expenditure and where savings could be made.  He stated also that, if additional taxation had to be raised, that would be done.  It is all very fine for Deputy Kemmy to say he has reservations in regard to the £45 million but he must take into account that it benefited a great many taxpayers throughout the country.  If we were to insert a means <Col N="1751" /> clause into the taxation system it would create difficulties from an administrative point of view.

    <P>About my being briefed, well, Deputy Connolly is obviously the most briefed man here judging by all the reading he does at Question Time.  Indeed, the less <Col N="1753" /> said about that the better.  Sometimes some of the reading engaged in, such as that in relation to a question I asked him yesterday about a road, let him off the hook.  He did not know what he was reading; he was like a parrot.  I would say that perhaps his own briefing could be examined somewhat more intently.</P>

      <P>It has been said that perhaps Deputy Kemmy is not too well briefed.  I think that charge is quite correct in regard to this amendment, that he is indeed not too well briefed when he asks a question as to where the PRSI concessions went.  It has been pointed out to him many times already in the course of the discussion on this amendment that the effects would be greatest for those in the £11,000 to £14,000 gross earnings bracket.  If the Deputy took even a cursory glance at the PRSI regulations he would discover that the additional allowance applied to people on incomes up to the £9,500 bracket.  If he wants clarification as to where the bulk of the concession on PRSI went, if he looks up the regulations he will discover it.  As has been said, he should brief himself a little better.</P>

I know that Deputies opposite do not want to accept the truth of the arguments being put forward here but they do represent the truth.  Deputy Kemmy's amendment is aimed at benefiting those in the best positions, those with the highest incomes.  The PRSI benefit at least was directed at those within a certain defined category which did not come within an ass's roar of the categories Deputy Kemmy wants to benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this amendment.  I spoke earlier today regarding section 1 and the various amendments.  What I said then holds equally with regard to these amendments. Regarding the increase in the taxation bands or tax free allowances I should say that while the present income tax code and tax free allowances obtain they are always going to benefit people <Col N="1755" /> with the greater incomes.  The scheme announced by Deputy John Bruton in regard to income tax credits has a lot to recommend it.  I have no hang-ups about the present system of tax-free allowances. I see everything to recommend the idea of tax credits.  They are not included in this Finance Bill.  Personally I have no hang-ups about it.  It is a system that might well be looked at and I would have no objection to its inclusion in a subsequent Finance Bill because I found a lot I could agree with in regard to the tax credit system.</P>
      <P>In regard to the amendment put forward by Deputy Kemmy, from an ideological viewpoint I can well understand why the Deputy put forward his point of view as to why this tax band should be increased or at least remain at its existing level.  Also, viewing the current budget deficit, the present state of the economy and the problems confronting us I am sure Deputy Kemmy will appreciate my viewpoint.  I know Deputy Kemmy sincerely holds the view that the lower income classes should benefit from the taxation system most.  But from my viewpoint at least a different view must be taken of that.  As I said earlier today it is easy to put forward the idea of taxation relief.  I do not blame Deputy Kemmy, The Workers' Party, Fine Gael or Labour for putting forward those viewpoints because the history of our system has been that if one gives concessions then one benefits at the polls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy B. Desmond who raised the question of the pay-related social scheme in respect of which we had given a concession of some £45 million. Lest anybody have any doubts I should say I am not in agreement with that viewpoint, that one should give in, under electoral pressure whether it be in respect of a general election or a by-election, irrespective of the merits of that case.  I would not like anyone to be under any illusion that Deputy Charlie McCreevy changed his viewpoint on that. I do not believe it is in the interests of democracy to have the view that when an election is to take place, whether it is a <Col N="1756" /> general election or a bye-election, it is the easiest thing in the world to agree to that type of pressure.</P>

      <P>I am coming back to it now.  I agree with Deputy Kemmy when he wants to increase the taxation band to give more relief to people so that they will have to pay less tax.  If we encourage that viewpoint we should go ahead and explain this.  Deputy Kemmy or any other Deputy in the House is free to put forward his viewpoint to give more relief. The same argument that I used in regard to the relief in section I of the Bill applies to this.  If we are to agree to the increases in the bands it will cost the State money and I do not think that is the right thing to do at the present time.  I believe the amendment put forward by Deputy Kemmy will have that effect.  I understand from his viewpoint why he is putting it forward but from the overall point of view I hold I believe we should reject it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 12 and 13, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Notwithstanding anything in the Tax Acts, Part II of the Table to section 8 of the Finance Act, 1980 (inserted by this section) shall apply to persons with dependants who are widows, widowers or single parents.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide the same tax relief for single parent families including widows and widowers with dependants as for married persons, particularly those who are struggling on low pay.  It is just as difficult, possibly more difficult, for those families to survive on their incomes as for married persons.  This is particularly true of single parents, especially in the case of a deserted husband or male single parent who is not in receipt of the deserted spouse allowance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is possibly greater for those families who do not have a second parent to deal with the financial problems, particularly in relation to families not entitled to claim the deserted spouse's allowance.  This is an important social reform which would not <Col N="1758" /> cost a great deal of money.  The amount involved would probably be less than £5 million and we have already indicated here today where that kind of money can be raised.</P>
      <P>One Deputy speaking in relation to another point said that there was no scope for increased taxation.  I wonder did he mean that there was no scope for increased PAYE taxation.  It is probably true that the PAYE sector are paying as much as they can afford to pay.  However, that is not to say that there is no scope for increased taxation.  Again and again, it has been pointed out here that there is ample scope in sectors which pay little or no taxation.  Deputy Connolly referred to the farming class which according to statistics pay something in the region of 1 per cent of all income tax collected.  What is required and what this amendment is attempting is to introduce some form of equity within the taxation system.  It is obviously not sufficient simply to try to juggle around with figures and the amount of taxation collected at present under PAYE.  The ultimate aim must be to broaden the whole base of taxation. Given the present situation and the possibility for Deputies on this side of the House to introduce measures for the raising of taxation, we must try to bring in measures which will result in some kind of equity.</P>
      <P>The point should be made again that there is a small number of people involved.  This would not apply to all persons who are made widows or widowers, or to all single parents, only to those who have dependants.  Most Deputies would have some experience of the situation about which we are talking, where there is a constant struggle by either the mother or father who is left alone, to try to cope, more often than not, with a young family, trying to hold down a job and ensure that the children are cared for, have clothing, schoolbooks and so forth.  This amendment would go some way towards alleviating this situation. I appeal to the Minister to see his way to adopting this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to what Deputy De Rossa says, I would like to <Col N="1759" /> reply that if the married rate bands were applied to single parents &mdash; and when I say single parents I mean widows and widowers with dependants, as well as single parents as described in the amendment &mdash; it would be open to a married couple who have children to elect for assessment as single persons under section 193 of the Income Tax Act of 1967, inserted by the Finance Act of 1980.  By each accepting responsibility for one or more of the children, they would then become entitled as single parents would, to be assessed to tax at the married rates of tax.</P>
      <P>For example, a married couple with a total income of £17,000, who pay at the moment £4,442, would reduce their liability to £3,826 by this device.  It would appear that it would be unconstitutional, following the decision in the Murphy versus the Attorney General case, to legislate against the married couple being taxed at, in effect, quadruple the rate bands if the single parent were granted the double rate band.  In the Murphy versus the Attorney General case, the Supreme Court decided that it was unconstitutional for a married couple to be charged more tax than if they were unmarried.  The extension of the double rate band to single parents would cost about £4.6 million in a full year.  It has been argued that it is a comparatively small amount but we have been dealings with smaller amounts in earlier amendments. The cost in 1982 would be £3 million and in a full year it would be £4.6 million, if married couples were not included.  If we were to include married couples the cost would be £23 million in 1982 and £35 million in a full year.  I regret I have to oppose the amendment for those reasons, as well as the constitutional reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 11, before section 4, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;(1)  Notwithstanding anything in the Tax Acts, income derived by way of interest on savings to a bona fide group water scheme shall be exempt from tax for the year 1982-83 and subsequent years of assessment.</P>
      <P>(2)  For the purpose of this section a bona fide group water scheme shall mean only a scheme registered as a group water scheme within the meaning of the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1978.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Connolly is in the House because he has shown great interest in this &mdash; it is something he has advocated. About two months ago I was surprised at what I learned in regard to a group water scheme in my constituency. It was brought to my attention that those responsible for a group water scheme had collected contributions from their members in anticipation of work being done. If they lodged that money in the bank while waiting for the work to be commenced, and there is no question of making a profit because the money will be spent in a relatively short time, they would be charged income tax on the interest it would accrue in the bank, even though the money will be used for a co-operative project which would otherwise fall on the State, and the entire expense would have to be borne by the taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am talking about money collected voluntarily by a co-operative to provide a group water scheme for themselves.  It is a matter of people coming together to take on a responsibility of the State, to do work which the State would otherwise have to do.  They have to pay income tax <Col N="1762" /> on the interest the collected money would accrue.  I have raised this matter with the Revenue Commissioners because I could not believe such a situation could come about.  I received a letter from the Chairman of the Commissioners which was the opposite to what I had hoped to be the case and confirmed the fact that interest on money on deposit in the name of a group water scheme organiser was liable to tax.  One must bear in mind that the people involved are voluntary workers who had probably made themselves unpopular with their neighbours when collecting the money.  It is ludicrous if they are liable to tax on the interest that may be paid on their deposit.  We should try to rectify this.  I am sure that the acceptance of the amendment would not mean any additional cost.  I am prepared to defer to the Minister if my definition of the situation is not as perfect as it should be.  However, I took some time to prepare the amendment which is fairly accurate in its wording.  I hope the Minister will accept it without demur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has stated, the cost in terms of revenue foregone from the bodies in question would be insignificant.  The granting of any such exemption creates possibilities for tax avoidance and the Deputy must appreciate that.  It would not be an easy matter to confine the scope of any exemption to group water schemes alone.  If exemptions were to be granted to any particular category of taxpayer this inevitably would give rise to requests for similar exemptions for other groups also engaged in what may be described as worthwhile projects like group water schemes.  The Deputy has rightly pointed out that the only income arising to group water schemes appears to be investment income, that is interest on balance held on deposit prior to the completion of such water schemes and after such completion in respect of moneys required for maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an alternative to a legislative provision for the exemption of deposit interest arising to group water schemes the amounts of which, as the Deputy appreciates, are very small.  Such groups <Col N="1763" /> might consider the possibility of investing temporary surplus funds as far as would be practicable to do so in tax-free securities, for example, savings certificates. That would meet the aim of the proposed amendment and at the same time avoid the need to introduce legislation which might be used as a vehicle for tax avoidance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am telling the Deputy that it will be possible for the groups to consider investing these temporary surplus funds in tax-free securities, for example, savings certificates. They would not have to pay tax on interest gained in that way and that would avoid the need to introduce legislation which might be used as a vehicle for tax avoidance, a grave possibility in regard to any concessions that may be given to group water schemes.  As a former Minister for Finance the Deputy will appreciate that once one gives in on such an issue one hundred other examples giving the same justification as group water schemes &mdash; I am referring to projects like community halls, sports complexes and so on &mdash; will be mentioned.  For that reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a former Minister for Finance this amendment seems to be impracticable and difficult to consider.  Every Deputy could make a claim for social reasons that interest relief should be granted for savings accumulated.  If we agreed to that we would be pulling down tremendous trouble on our heads.  For example, I could claim that I have money on deposit to send by children to secondary school or university, that I am saving for a pension, that I am saving for health expenses, or that I am saving to buy a house.  People could claim that they were saving money to create employment and we all know that it is the aim of most companies nowadays to have some liquidity so that they can survive the ups and downs that occur.  Why not make the interest earned on that exempt?  I do not <Col N="1764" /> dispute that group water schemes are in need of assistance but for a person who is trying to run the finances of the State the acceptance of this amendment is impracticable.  It would open up a new argument.  All Deputies could make strong social cases as to why interest should be exempt.  It is a mine field and we should not enter it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of problems about the suggestion put forward by the Minister so that group water schemes could avoid having to pay tax on interest earned.  They would require a degree of flexibility in regard to the lodgment of moneys particularly if they are paying it out on a current basis from a bank account.  If the organisers want flexibility they would not be in a position to avail of the savings certificates scheme because it does not have a cheque-writing facility or the flexibility an ordinary bank account has.  The suggestion the Minister has made is helpful and it is something that should be made known to the organisers of those schemes.  It is my view that very few of them are investing their money in this way.  Practically all group water schemes have money on deposit and technically they are liable to income tax on it.  I would be surprised if any of them have the bright idea that the Minister has mentioned and I am sure he would not have come up with that if I had not put down my amendment.  To that degree, even if we do not succeed in having the amendment passed, we are making progress.  Deputy Connolly, the Minister of State, is in a position to give this advice to the organisers of these schemes.</P>

      <P>The Deputy mentioned saving for a house and that could mean a bigger one than the person owns.  Hospital <Col N="1765" /> expenses and so on are personal matters while group water schemes relate to industrial and provident societies which set up specifically for co-operative purposes, non-profit making purposes defined by law that goes back to 1893. An industrial and provident society cannot make profit and because of its co-operative non-profit making character, as defined by law, is in a very different situation from a person who might invest money.  I should like to remind Deputy Brennan that his party opposed the proposal that another form of industrial and co-operative society, agricultural co-operatives, be liable to income tax.  It is because they are co-operatives that they are not liable to income tax.  Why should group schemes be liable to income tax on their deposits if agricultural co-operatives are exempt?  That is worth bearing in mind before anybody makes analogies about this matter.</P>

The Minister has made a suggestion which I will have to consider and I propose to withdraw my amendment with the possibility of introducing a variation of it on Report Stage.  I do not accept that this would be the basis for other exemptions.  Group water schemes are unique.  They are carrying out something which is basically a State function.  Individuals are taking it over voluntarily.</P>

I was a trustee of a very large group water scheme for a number of years.  We never had any surplus money.  Many of the representations I receive inform me that contractors are waiting for their money and if the trustees do not pay up in time they have to pay interest to the bank.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Bruton say that some of these have surplus money. Most of those I have spoken to are very anxious for my Department to pay the grant.</P>

      <P>In page 12, subsection (3) (a), between lines 40 and 41, to insert a new subparagraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(v)  by 10 per cent. per annum of the original market value of the car for each year of ownership.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in respect of benefit in kind in regard to cars.  As we said on the Financial Resolution in relation to this section, the position is that people will be taxed on a proportion of the value of the car they have from their company when it was new.  They may be taxed in the third or fourth year in which they are using the car when its value would be far less than when it was new.  Under the Minister's proposal they will still be taxed on a proportion of its new value.  What I am proposing is that the new value of the car, for the purposes of the section, be reduced by 10 per cent per year which is not a generous reduction considering the depreciation in value of the car.  The Minister's proposal will encourage people who have company cars to hold them for a year and then get rid of them.  This will <Col N="1768" /> be bad for the balance of payments and a wasteful use of equipment.  Such people will be at an artificial disadvantage if they retain a car for more than a year.  This amendment is a reasonable improvement on the proposal made by the Minister and I hope he will accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment because it would render the section ineffective.  What was originally proposed in the budget was much more severe than what is now in the Bill.  As I said earlier in reply to questions and amendments, I and the Government were severely criticised by Deputies in Fine Gael and by many people throughout the country for altering the budget provisions when we introduced the Finance Bill on 2 June.  In one case there was a difference of £½ million between what was intended in the budget and what was in the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The people who criticised us for the supposedly enormous changes which were made between budget day and publication of the Finance Bill now want me to accept a further reduction in revenue in the case of benefit in kind and company cars.  It does not make sense.  I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister is deliberately failing to understand the purpose of my amendment.  The purpose is not to render the new tax measures ineffective in regard to benefits in kind.  It is simply to improve them so that there will be no artificial incentive for people to keep buying new cars when they could retain their existing ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not seeking to undermine the Minister's proposal.  The revenue implications will be minimal.  Perhaps the Minister might tell me if there are substantial revenue implications, which I do not intend, because of the way the amendment is drafted.  If the Minister can supply me with that information I will be happy to withdraw my amendment with a view to redrafting it in such a way that it will not have any unintended effect of significantly reducing revenue but only the intended effects of removing any artificial <Col N="1769" /> incentive to people to keep buying new cars rather than retaining old ones.</P>

In these circumstances I am happy to withdraw the amendment. I do not wish to destroy the proposal but merely to improve it.  Therefore, I will submit an amendment for Report Stage designed to remove all the disincentives involved but I trust that the Minister will arrange to have made available to me details of the basis on which he is rejecting the amendment now.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> There has always been a problem with Finance Bills in so far as the question of this benefit in kind is concerned.  It has always been difficult to decide on where we should draw the line in these cases.  I have always been convinced that business people, commercial travellers and so on should be given full allowances in respect of business expenses incurred.  These are the people who motivate business, who sell our products.  On this occasion the Minister has been fair.  We hear a good deal here about tax evasion and tax avoidance.  In this context it is the duty of any Minister for Finance to try to ensure that the loopholes are closed in any taxation measure.  The Revenue Commissioners advise the Minister on such matters and they are in the best position to assess a situation.</P>
      <P>There are many people who have the benefit of company cars and other perks and we must ensure that in legislating here we do not create a situation in which people entitled to such benefits are not put in the position in which there are disincentives so far as their work is concerned. We are talking about people who contribute in a substantial way to our economic expansion.  Frequently, they make efforts in this area that are beyond the call of duty.  What we are giving here by way of concession is not generous by any standard but having regard to our economic situation it is as far as any Minister could reasonably be expected to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many amendments being proposed to this Finance Bill but we must realise that the concession sought in each of those amendments would represent an <Col N="1771" /> additional charge on the Exchequer.  It is easy for any Opposition Deputy to put forward an amendment but so far none of those concerned has told us where the money for the concessions involved can be found.  Surely this question is fundamental to the Finance Bill and to our entire economic structure.  I have been here for the introduction of the past 18 budgets and I have known similar problems to arise on each occasion.  No matter what figure the Minister might write in to any part of the Bill, there is bound to be some Opposition Deputy who will propose an increase in that figure.  That has always been the case but the Minister is the one who must take responsibility, who must answer to the public as to what is in the Bill.  The Opposition do not have that responsibility.  Naturally, any Minister for Finance would be only too happy to be in a position to concede these various amendments but we all know that that is not possible and that any Minister who would do so would be reneging on the trust placed in him.</P>
    <P>I consider the Minister's proposals to be fair.  We all appreciate the benefit of a car being placed at someone's disposal. The majority of us here use private cars. We realise the cost of running a car so we must be fair and acknowledge that anyone who is supplied with a company car is deriving substantial benefit in kind.  But we must devise a fair system.  We must try to ensure that there is a fair apportionment of that benefit and this is what the Minister is doing in this measure.</P>
    <P>Successive Ministers for Finance have used a fair rule of thumb in determining what concession should be made in respect of this benefit but none has ever succeeded in satisfying everyone concerned. They have always been criticised by commercial travellers, company directors and so on in respect of the measures taken but we have to be realistic.  This sort of benefit in kind represents a certain amount of loss of revenue to the Exchequer and at this time of scarce finances, at a time when £1 million or even £500,000 is a major contribution to the Exchequer, <Col N="1772" /> we must try to reach a balance as between what is fair on both sides of the camp.</P>
    <P>Any concession granted must be paid for by the public.  We do not want additional taxation at this time when we are trying to keep our inflation under control.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my thanks to you for allowing me to raise this very serious matter on the Adjournment. After the events of today I suppose I can consider myself lucky to have that opportunity. The reason for raising the matter is the pending closure of the Dubarry Shoe Company factory in Westport, County Mayo.  The company have two factories, in Ballinasloe and in Westport, the smaller being the one in Westport which in now due for closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister is well aware, it is situated in the west and the pending closure in indicative of the effects of the recession which have begun to creep into the west and are having a very serious impact on the social fabric of life there. It calls for drastic Government action and more than genuine concern by the IDA. I call upon the Minister to declare the area one of his priorities for bringing in industry and ask for a very genuine effort with the IDA to ensure that a suitable industry is established as an alternative, <Col N="1773" /> if the Minister finds himself unable to save the factory.  It is necessary that Government support be channelled in there.</P>
    <P>Westport is a small town of approximately 2,000 people.  The area for generations has been ravaged by emigration. It has a vast hinterland but has a poor physical output in terms of agriculture and people from the western end of Westport, from Louisburg or from Leenane, from Newport, Achill and Ballycroy regard Westport as their town and centre of commercial and industrial lives.  Many other small factories in Westport transport workers from the surrounding areas into the town.  Any pending closure of any factory therefore has serious effects on the lifestyle and social fabric of the people.</P>
    <P>What hope can one offer them?  Is there nothing but neglect of the area? Will the Minister be able to save the industry or provide a suitable alternative? The fact that the area has been ravaged by emigration for years has led to a sense of frustration or an attitude of mind that successive governments have been neglecting the west.  In my constituency the Taoiseach was good enough to give us a Cabinet Minister and a Minister of State and I am sure that both of them have at heart the interest of the workers in this factory and are working genuinely within the Cabinet to see that the Minister for Industry and Energy does his best to ensure that the trained work force and this factory are not lost to the area.</P>
    <P>What have the Government put into Westport since taking office?  Nothing really.  There has been a deal of talk and promises but nothing concrete has yet come to light.  If the closure goes ahead I assure the Minister that it is another nail in the coffin of the west and certainly will not be taken lightly.  The only viable industry in Westport at present is Allergan Pharmaceuticals.  As the Minister, beside the Minister for Industry and Energy knows, if that factory were to close or indeed some others it would result in a ghost town in the west.</P>
    <P>The Allergan plant was brought there mostly through the efforts of the former Deputy Staunton through his negotiations <Col N="1774" /> with the IDA and the Minister at the time.  I know that the present Minister for Industry and Energy is working on the introduction of another industry through Westport, Rincon from the US. This matter has been long delayed and there have been many announcements about it with questions raised here and so on, but there is no definite evidence of the plant being established there yet.  In replying, the Minister might indicate if there is any further development, as that might alleviate the problem of pending unemployment in the area.  There is a suitable advance factory empty in Westport and a small cluster unit also unoccupied.</P>
    <P>There is the spirit of self-help and interest in the people of the town and surrounding areas and if they get encouragement and some incentive from the Minister for Industry and Energy I can assure him that he will get every co-operation from them in order to safeguard their livelihoods and their families.  The closure of Westport Textiles some years ago dealt a severe blow to the industrial and commercial life of the town and put many people in the dole queues.  It caused further unemployment and was a severe blow to the morale and confidence of the people of the district.  The IDA at the time made genuine and strenuous efforts to get an adequate replacement and the Northern Feather Industry brought in as a replacement, although not employing as many as the Western Textiles plant did generate some much-needed income in the vicinity.  At that time the co-operation of all businesses and people in the town was quite evident from the fact that a day-long march was held around the town.  Many speakers were invited there including trade union officials, industrialists and so on.  Businesses co-operated by closing for one hour to show their solidarity with the workers who were then being disemployed.  The same spirit and motivation are still there.  I am sure that if the Minister were to go there and meet the workers or the people concerned he would find that there is a willingness to co-operate and do whatever has to be done to ensure that the factory <Col N="1775" /> be saved.</P>
    <P>The present Dubarry plant has been there for approximately five years.  The Dubarry company took it over from a consortium of local businessmen who had been running it for up to 30 years previously. The plant mostly manufacturers moccassin shoes which are made of leather.  Sixty people were employed and these are trained and skilled people. Approximately 80 people who might be described as out-workers work on a subcontracting basis, mostly hand-stitching various parts that go into the shoes.</P>
    <P>The effect of the withdrawal of wages from these workers and the out-workers would be very serious on the living standards of the people in the area.  Regular wages coming into a household in any area, but particularly in rural areas, mean that families can enjoy a reasonable standard of living to which they are entitled. They can enjoy the benefits of employment, build and furnish houses, repay SDA loans and all the other things that working families are entitled to do. The fact that redundancy and unemployment are staring them in the face at present does not increase confidence or boost the morale of anybody there.  The Minister for the Gaeltacht knows the labour exchange in Westport is situated on a hill known as Hill 16.  I am sure the Minister for Industry does not want to add to the queue of unemployed on Hill 16 next week.</P>
    <P>The reason given for the closure of the plant is a decline in sales of shoes.  The capacity of the two plants would be around 10,000 pairs per week.  The company say that due to lack of sales and the decline in business the Westport plant is not viable and that they intend just to continue with the plant in Ballinasloe. The plant in Westport has valuable, sophisticated machinery, trained personnel, skilled workers and, as I stressed in the beginning, there is great co-operation and genuine willingness among all of the workers to do what is necessary to save this plant.  If the Minister would negotiate with the IDA to purchase this plant, the workers themselves will form a co-operative, and with their skills and experience <Col N="1776" /> and the machinery available to them, do whatever is necessary to continue on in a different line of shoe-making or perhaps continue on the same line in the hope of sustaining the plant and the employment.  I urge the Minister to consider this very seriously with the IDA.  As the Minister for the Gaeltacht knows, the plant is there, it will be in the possession of the IDA, and if the co-operative idea could be forwarded it would save a good deal of embarrassment and keep the confidence of the people alive.</P>
    <P>On 14 June this year the Federation of Irish Footwear Manufacturers produced their figures for imports and exports of shoes for this country.  The chapter head 62.04 deals with leather and canvas shoes which affect directly the Dubarry company and their output.  The Dubarry people's work is practically all in leather. The total imports from January to March 1981 under all headings was 3,069,332 pairs of shoes at a cost of £19.378 million. Total imports for January to March 1982 were 3,787,682 at a cost of £22.417 million. That shows an increase in the amount of shoes imported and in the value.  I am sure that the Minister is only too well aware of the broader impact and consequences of that.  Under that heading 62.04 which deals with leather imports from January to March 1981 we imported 2,454,944 pairs of shoes at a cost of £16.375 million.  From January to March 1982 under that heading relevant to leather output 2,671,437 pairs of shoes were imported at a cost of £17.322 million. That is a very substantial number of pairs of shoes imported here and again it is an increase on leather over last year. The bulk of those imports come from Britain followed by Italy and down the line from various other countries and the figures show a significant increase in imports from third countries.  I am sure the Minister is only too well aware of the consequences of that.</P>
    <P>The fact that something like 12.3 million pairs of shoes were imported last years means that many of the shoe industries and manufacturers in this country are operating under great stress and in a very competitive market.  With the effects of the recession that means that people <Col N="1777" /> tend to buy cheaper shoes if they can get them instead of the higher priced Irish shoes which in quality might be up to standard and in some cases are not.  The Moccassin shoe manufactured in Westport, made of leather and hand-stitched, certainly is a quality shoe in itself.  Competition from other countries and particularly the growing number of imports of shoes from outside EEC countries, which might be of only simulated leather, means that the output of Irish manufacturers tends to drop.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for the Gaeltacht, that I expect that both of them will be working as hard as possible for the retention of this industry or, if that is not possible, for a suitable alternative by the declaration that Westport be a priority area as soon as possible.  IDA concern is not enough. We send people to school for experience and employment, but that is not enough because they get school education, experience and then unemployment.  In this plant steel workers, trained personnel, have worked for many years.  The machinery is there, the plant is there, the know-how is there.  I urge the Minister to pursue the idea of a co-operative venture which is put forward by the workers themselves and to consult with the IDA and let them buy the plant if possible.  I understand that the Dubarry company would sell it at a reasonable price in order to ensure that the industry would be kept viable and that the workers would be retained in the plant with a consequent improvement and a continuation of the social life of the area.  The IDA are very concerned about this.  I spoke to their personnel in Galway yesterday.  They visited the plant with an interested party from abroad.  I am not aware of the results of that meeting but I am sure the Minister has some information on it.  I know also that the local urban council with some of the workers from the plant and others are due to bring a deputation under the leadership of the chairman of the UDC to Dublin next week to meet personnel in the IDA headquarters.  If the concern of the IDA were such and as strong as they say it is perhaps they could have gone to Westport and met the deputation <Col N="1778" /> down there on the plant site.</P>
    <P>I am greatful to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  The pending closure of this factory, small though it is and small though the numbers of workers is relative to other plants throughout the country, is of vital concern for the social life of this whole district.  If the Government are sincere about their efforts in putting employment into our towns, keeping our people at work, providing jobs for our young people and maintaining the standards of living we are all entitled to, if we are not to have again the spectre of emigration stalking across the west of Ireland and consequent claims from all sides that successive Governments have never lived up to their promises or reputations in trying to keep people at work, I expect the Minister for Industry and Energy, advised as he is by the Minister for the Gaeltacht, to make a statement that will be suitably acceptable to the people of Westport and that will make his loyal supporters there, and the supporters of the Minister for the Gaeltacht, realise that the man has the potential which they expect him to live up to.  If the plant is not saved I assure the Minister that we will all be in trouble and the Government will suffer serious embarrassment as a result of the closure and loss of jobs to the town and surrounding areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to say that I very much regret the proposed closure of the factory of Dubarry Shoemakers Ltd. at Westport and that concern and regret are shared not alone by Deputy Kenny but by my colleagues, Deputy Flynn and Deputy Gallagher. The company commenced production in Westport in 1977 having taken over the factory from another company.  In recent times they have employed 61 workers and I am very conscious of the adverse impact which the closure of the factory will have on these workers and on the Westport area generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out yesterday in the course of a reply to a question by Deputy Michael D. Higgins, the company had <Col N="1779" /> decided to close the Westport factory mainly because of a serious downturn in the market for their products.  The company had been producing Moccassin shoes at Westport and also at Ballinasloe where they employ about 170 workers. They had been selling about 65 per cent of their output on the home market and about 35 per cent on the export market, mainly in the UK.  However, the situation now is that the company have demand for only the output of the Ballinasloe plant.  To ensure their future viability, the company have had to rationalise their operations and, unfortunately, this rationalisation has culminated in the company's decision to close the Westport plant and to keep the Ballinasloe plant in full production.</P>
    <P>In the context of the company's decision it is not in Ireland alone that the footwear industry is experiencing difficulties. Redundancy, short-time working and a build up of stocks are features of the industry in most, if not all, member states of the European community including the UK where consumer spending has been seriously depressed in the past two to three years and whose market, as I have already indicated, has been accounting for a significant portion of the Dubarry output.  In fact, the EEC Commission reported some time ago that the total Community production of footwear for 1980 was almost 8 per cent below the level of production in 1979.  This fall in production, which is continuing as far as can be ascertained, is attributable to the recession which has depressed demand for footwear and also to increased imports from third world countries, as Deputy Kenny remarked.</P>
    <P>Regrettably imports of footwear into Ireland are accounting for an increasing proportion of the Irish market.  Most of the imports originate within the EEC and no action to prevent these imports can be taken, as I am sure the Deputy will understand. As regards imports from third world countries, these come mainly from far eastern countries and I am glad to say we have been successful in securing restrictions on imports from some of the more significant of these countries.  The <Col N="1780" /> possibility of obtaining restrictions on imports from some other of these countries is being actively pursued by us with the EEC Commission at present.</P>
    <P>Returning to the Dubarry situation, the IDA have been making efforts for over six months, when the indications were that this factory would close, to secure a takeover of the Westport factory with a view to averting its closure.  In fact, about six months ago the company agreed not to close the plant then in order that the possibility of finding a purchaser for the plant could be explored.  Despite intensive efforts, the IDA have not been successful as yet in locating a buyer but, as I said in course of my reply to Deputy Higgins's question yesterday the IDA's efforts in this regard are being sustained. I am aware of a visit there by a potential buyer but it is too early to make a specific comment at this time.</P>
    <P>For the information of the House and the Deputy, the IDA approved 25 projects with a job potential of more than 600 in the period 1978 to 1981.  This figure includes the takeover of Westport Textiles by Northern Feather with 100 jobs and the other project referred to by Deputy Kenny, Rincon, which has been approved for the IDA 24,000 sq. ft. advance factory which was announced prematurely by a colleague of his.  I assure the Deputy that the project has not been lost and efforts are continuing to get them to move in there as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Last week on a visit to the US the very weak climate for investment not only in the US but also in Europe was brought home to me very forcibly.  In the US, from which we get a very substantial amount of international investment, because of the very high interest rates, the dear cost of money, the real cost of money and their own internal economic situation, they have the worst unemployment situation since 1938.  One shudders to think what happened in 1939 in an effort to produce some solutions to their major problems.</P>
    <P>The situation is particularly difficult at this time, but there can be no doubt about the sincerity of Fianna Fáil not only in relation to Westport but the entire Mayo <Col N="1781" /> area.  Swift action was taken to get Northern Feather established, and the same swift action is being maintained by Fianna Fáil and will be intensified in the Dubarry situation and in an effort to bring the Rincon project to fruition as soon as possible.  We have always maintained a very sincere approach to the West of Ireland realising the difficulties they have suffered over the years.  Our commitment to them has been recognised by the people in that area and they can <Col N="1782" /> be assured that we will maintain our efforts to look after the west, sometimes at cost and at risk to some of the projects we announced down there and which met with a certain amount of opposition.  We will pursue our efforts and my two colleagues on this side of the House will ensure that I will deliver in Westport.</P>

    <P>As indicated in the reply to Questions Nos.  11 and 12 special consideration is being given to the urban renewal situation, especially in the main urban centres, with a view to providing whatever further support may be possible and appropriate for inner urban development and renewal in those areas.  The Minister of State, Deputy G. Brady, made a special visit to Cork on 11 and 12 May to examine the postion there as part of his process.</P>

    <P>The figures for net EEC transfers to Ireland include all Irish receipts from operations carried out through the Community budget in the relevant years, less Irish payments in the same years to the Community budget and other contributions arising out of Community membership. It should be noted that a large part of EEC receipts is channelled to the beneficiary without passing through the Exchequer, e.g. most FEOGA gurantee payments which account for the bulk of Irish receipts from the Community.</P>

These services cost £1,000 million of Exchequer moneys in 1982 on the basis of a particular balance of services provided publicly and privately.  The financial consequences of upsetting this balance cannot be estimated with any accuracy but the Exchequer costs would be very substantial.</P>
    <P>(3)  Cost at (b) (ii) includes the potential full year cost of additional benefits accruing net of savings on non-contributory pensions otherwise payable in the case of the self-employed.</P>
    <P>(4)  Costs at (b) above assumes that existing social insurance benefits not mentioned in the private members motion, such as, invalidity pension, disability benefit, maternity benefit and pay-related benefits would continue, as at present, to be payable to employees only.</P>

      <P>In order to mark the year of the disabled Bord Fáilte published, for the disabled, a special guide to restaurants and accommodation and a guide to activities and facilities for the disabled.  A special section was included in the Tidy Towns competition to encourage local communities to participate in the International Year of the Disabled.  Bord Fáilte continue actively to encourage hotels, guesthouses, etc. to provide suitable facilities for the disabled; special grants are available for this purpose.</P>

The information sought by the Deputy could therefore only be complied by the expenditure of an inordinate amount of staff time.

      <P>All adjustments in diplomatic and consular fees from 1956 to August 1981 have been made on the basis of changes in the consumer price index in relevant intervening periods.  On 1 August 1981 passport and other consular fees were increased by 100 per cent by Government instruction and on 20 January 1982 passport fees were increased by a further 25 per cent by Government instruction.  It would not, without an unwarranted expenditure of time and resources, be possible to supply the Deputy with the information he seeks in relation to the period between the introduction of consular fees and 1956.</P>

      <P>As Minister with general responsibility for the implementation of the 3 per cent quota system for the employment of disabled persons in the public service, I am pleased to report significant progress.</P>
      <P>During 1981, as a result of the quota system, the number of disabled persons recruited into the public service increased by 50 per cent to 900 persons approximately. Approximately 170 disabled persons were recruited into the civil service in the year and are employed in various Government Departments, including eight in the Department of Labour.  The special programmes organised to facilitate the recruitment of disabled persons will be continued and expanded so that our 3 per cent target will be achieved as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The breakdown of the 170 persons recruited into the civil service by category of disability is: Speech Impairment, 2; Hearing Impairment, 17; Vision Impairment, 9; Mental Handicap, 4; Physical Handicap, 80; Epilepsy, 13; Cardiac Malfunction, 4; Others, 41.</P>
      <P>All categories of disabled persons mentioned by the Deputy are included.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in March 1981, certain groups such as the blind have special employment needs.  The interdepartmental committee, at my request, continue to explore ways of increasing further the employment opportunities for visually impaired and sightless persons.  Considerable progress has been made by AnCo in the implementation of its ten-point programme mentioned in the reply to the Deputy's question of March 1981.  For example:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>almost 500 disabled persons attended AnCO training courses in 1982; over half of all training centres are now fully accessible and the National Rehabilitation Board are advising on how the remainder can be made accessible.  All new centres will be fully accessible; AnCO now <Col N="1614" /> employs 28 disabled persons, five of whom were recruited during 1981; a management team on the disabled has been established; an internal education/ awareness programme on training and working with the disabled has been implemented; promotional literature related to training and employment now includes reference to disabled persons; a film entitled &ldquo;What Handicap&rdquo; which will be launched this year was made by RTE in consultation with AnCO and the NRB. AnCO also part-funded the making of the film.</P>
    <P>CERT continues to make provision for the training of disabled persons on their courses.</P>

      <P>Fees charged by the Department of Labour arise in respect of licences under the Employment Agency Act, 1971, petroleum spirit licences under the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, and negotiation licences under the Trade Union Act, 1941.  The fee in respect of licences under the Employment Agency Act, 1971, was increased from £5 each to £100 each in 1979.  The fees for petroleum spirit licences were fixed in 1979.</P>
      <P>In each of the original fees had been increased regularly in line with the cost of living index, less revenue would have been collected by the Department than has been received over the total period involved.</P>

      <P>During 1981 some 170 handicapped persons were recruited to the civil service, mainly by way of special confined competitions which were held by the Civil Service Commission.  The handicaps of these persons covered all the categories mentioned by the Deputy. However, while in addition to sightless telephonists, a number of visually handicapped persons were recruited, the blind have special employment needs.  In consultation with the Civil Service Commission and the Department of Labour, my Department, therefore, are giving attention to the possibility that the opportunities for such persons to obtain employment in the public service can be further improved.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service Commission will continue to hold special competitions confined to handicapped persons as a means of implementing the Government's commitment to increasing the employment opportunities for handicapped persons in the public service.</P>

    <P>The estimated cost to the Exchequer of civil servants in 1982 is £560 million or 9.4 per cent of Current Government Expenditure.  The estimate of £560 million represents the sum of provisions for civil servants in Departmental Estimates and a provisional allocation to civil servants of the global sum in Vote 51 &mdash; Increases in Remuneration and Pensions.</P>
    <P>Notes</P>
    <P>(1) The figures show the numbers of non-industrial civil servants, industrial staff and non-industrial staff employed on a contract basis (mainly sub-postmasters) in January each year.</P>
    <P>(2) Cost to the Exchequer is taken to mean pay costs including overtime, allowances and employer's PRSI contributions where appropriate.</P>
    <P>(3) Current Government Expenditure data is taken from table headed &ldquo;Main Heads of Current Government Expenditure&rdquo; of the Pre-Budget Tables.  From and including 1977 the data reflects the reclassification in 1982 of certain expenditure items as capital &mdash; see note on Table 3 of the 1982 pre-budget tables.</P>
    <P>(4) Following a special survey, it was found that the numbers serving in mid-1981 were 69,533.  It would appear from this figure that in previous years, the returns furnished to the Department of the public service by individual Departments had been incomplete.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to Cloneen Sports and Social Club, Cloneen, Clonmel, County Tipperary, which made application to my Department in November 1981 for a capital grant towards the construction of club facilities, under the community, youth, recreational and employment programme. The position is that this club was not among the applicant groups selected for assistance under the programme by the former Minister of State, who allocated the entire sum of money made available to my Department for the purposes of the programme.  However, in a letter of 2 March 1982 to the secretary of Cloneen Sports and Social Club, the former Minister of State announced that he was prepared to approve them for a grant under the Department's youth employment scheme.  This scheme is completely independent of the Department's capital grant programme &mdash; the <Col N="1629" /> community, youth, recreational and employment programme &mdash; and is operated on entirely different lines.</P>
      <P>In view of this decision, my Department wrote to the club secretary on 16 March 1982 stating that their application for capital grant assistance could not be acceded to and enclosing the necessary data for application under the temporary sport scheme for youth employment.  To date the necessary completed application form for assistance under this scheme has not been returned by this club.  However, should the club decide to submit an application under this scheme, I will ensure that it will receive every consideration in my Department.</P>

By reason of the broad nature of these programmes it is not possible to provide information in the form requested by the Deputy.  I am, however, arranging to send to the Deputy a copy of two reports published by the National Committee for the International Year of Disabled Persons.

      <P>The arrangements with CIE for the operation of the free travel scheme are based on providing the service during off-peak hours.  CIE provides an integrated bus service in Dublin city in which buses from the outskirts travel to the centre and from there to outlying districts on the other side.  There is no obligation on passengers to leave a bus at city centre stops and the journeys of very many undoubtedly go through the city centre to varying points on the outgoing stage from the centre on the other side.  An <Col N="1645" /> alteration of the arrangements on the lines suggested by the Deputy would be impractical and would radically alter the nature of the free travel scheme.  It would also involve considerable additional costs to the Department of Social Welfare and would have to be extended, at least, to other major cities.  There are no plans for such an alteration at the present time.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit from 7 July 1981 and was paid from that date to 4 January 1982 when his title to injury benefit expired on the expiration of the statutory period of 26 weeks payment. He was paid disability benefit from 5 January 1982 onwards and has been paid <Col N="1647" /> to 16 June 1982, date of the latest medical evidence received.</P>
      <P>Payment of disability benefit was duplicated for the period 25 February 1982 to 18 March 1982 resulting in an overpayment of £106.92 for that period.  Arrears of benefit amounting to £72.81 for the period 19 March to 7 April 1982 were withheld to offset part of the overpayment and the balance was recovered by weekly deductions of £6.83 from payments due for the period 8 April 1982 to 12 May 1982.</P>
      <P>On receipt of the Deputy's inquiry the claim was reviewed and it was established that after making allowance for the recovery of the overpayment of £106.92 the claimant was paid the correct amount of benefit due for the period of his claim up to 16 June 1982.  A list of cheques issued showing the amount overpaid and details of the amounts withheld to recover the overpayment has been sent to the claimant.

    <P>Until April 1981 the free telephone rental scheme applied to persons aged 66 years or over receiving pensions from my Department who were living alone or with one other person only who was permanently incapacitated.  From April 1981 the scheme was extended to include recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance from a health board under the same conditions but with no age limit.</P>
    <P>The conditions regarding living alone or with one incapacitated person only were eased from July 1981 when persons otherwise qualified became eligible for the allowance if they are living alone or with one or more incapacitated persons. From July 1981 also, invalidity pensioners who formerly were required to be aged 66 or over to qualify for the allowance became eligible with no age limit. From April 1982 the scheme was further extended to include blind pensioners under 66 years.</P>
    <P>The free travel scheme was extended in April 1982 to include recipients of British or Northern Ireland invalidity pension resident in the Republic and receiving the payment for an unbroken period of 12 months.</P>
    <P>The prescribed relative allowance scheme was also extended in April 1982 to invalidity pensioners under 66 years who require full-time care and attention.</P>
    <P>My Department continue to co-operate with the Minister for Labour towards the implementation of a 3 per cent quota scheme for the employment of disabled persons in the public sector.</P>

      <P>The person concerned attained 66 years of age on 8 May 1982 and claimed a contributory old age pension but as he had less than the minimum average number of contributions required over the prescribed period he did not qualify for payment of the pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As he had been employed in Great Britain his entitlement to a <i>pro rata</i> pension under EEC Regulations was examined and it was found that he was entitled <Col N="1651" /> to this pension at the rate of £18.21 a week.</P>
    <P>His eligibility for non-contributory old age pension was investigated at the same time and he was awarded this pension at the rate of £18.75 a week on a provisional basis pending the decision of the old age pension committee and the pension book was issued on 16 June 1982.  Two pensions may not be paid simultaneously and he was granted the greater one which is the non-contributory pension.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 13 January 1982.  Inquiries were necessary to establish the class of contribution rate appropriate to her employment and these inquiries were recently completed.  Her claim however was refused by a deciding officer on the grounds that she was not available for employment.</P>
      <P>It is open to the person concerned to appeal against the decision of the deciding officer if she is dissatisfied with the decision in her case.  A form on which to lodge her appeal may be obtained from her local office.</P>
      <P>As the person is a married woman dependant on her husband she is not eligible to apply for a qualification certificate which is a prerequisite for the receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>The central feature of the organisation established in 1959 was the integration of the FCA with the Permanent Defence Force into a combat force of six brigades with supporting elements.  The 1979 reorganisation entailed principally the separation of units of the Permanent Defence Force and units of the FCA so that the field combat force is exclusively drawn from the Permanent Defence Force and the FCA has been assigned a mainly local defence role.</P>

      <P>The normal retiring ages for such officers of the rank of Commandant and Lieutenant-Colonel in the Permanent <Col N="1656" /> Defence Force are 56 years and 58 years respectively.</P>
      <P>In 1974 as one of a number of urgent measures to conserve the numerical strength of the Permanent Defence Force, and in the context of a shortage of Junior Officers (below Commandant rank), a scheme was introduced whereby line Commandants and Captains may be retained in service beyond their normal retiring ages of 56 and 54 years respectively, up to 60 years of age.  Commandants and Captains retained under this scheme fill administrative appointments appropriate to the ranks of Captain and Lieutenant respectively so that Junior Officers filling designated administrative appointments can be released for operational duties.</P>
      <P>The position of line Lieutenants-Colonels was reviewed in 1976 against the background of a much expanded Permanent Defence Force and new operational requirements of the Defence Forces.  As a result of this review a scheme to permit the retention in service beyond the normal retiring age of 58 years of Lieutenant-Colonel up to 60 years of age was introduced.</P>
      <P>The number of officers in rank of Commandant and Lieutenant-Colonel who served or are serving beyond their normal retiring ages under the foregoing schemes during the period from 1978 to 1982 is as follows:</P>

      <P>The requested information is furnished hereunder: (a) The normal period of annual training is 14 days and this will be the case in 1982.  (b) It will be appreciated that the role of women in the Defence Forces will be expanded and developed in an orderly manner in accordance with the military requirements.  In this connection there is no requirement at present for the enlistment of women in the Reserve Defence Force nor is it anticipated that there will be by December 1983.  (c) The number of FCA and Slua Muirí enlistments, members placed on the non-effective list, and voluntary discharges in 1959, 1969 and 1981 are as follows:</P>

    <P>FCA and Slua Muirí: In addition to completing the specified periods of full-time training or instruction, members of the FCA or Slua Muirí must have attended at least two local training parades (or their equivalent in field days, overnight camps and/or employment on security duties) for each month of their service since the commencement of the training year concerned.</P>
    <P>(c)  Gratuities payable to members of the Reserve of Officers (First Line) and the Reserve of Men (First Line) <i>vis-à-vis</i> those payable to members of the FCA and Slua Muirí and the likelihood of changes in 1982: There is no fixed relationship between the rates of gratuity payable to the Reserve categories mentioned. The rates of gratuity have evolved over the years having regard to the different conditions of service of each category. The Reserve of Officers (First Line) and the Reserve of Men (First Line) consist of personnel who have served in the Permanent Defence Force and are therefore fully trained.</P>
    <P>The rates of gratuity are kept underreview. The rates were last increased with effect from 1 January 1981.</P>

      <P>The number of volunteers on the Civil Defence rolls of local authorities as at 31 October 1959 (the date nearest to 31 December 1959 for which figures are available) and 31 December 1981 were 4,858 and 38,156 respectively.  Of the latter figure about 21,000 are active members. The same rolls show the number of enlistments in 1959, 1969 and 1981 as 1,043, 1,205 and 2,874 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expenditure under the Civil Defence Subhead of the Vote for Defence for the years in question was: <Col N="1665" /> 1959/60 &mdash; £63,599 (0.96% of total net expenditure under Vote as a whole); 1969/70 &mdash; £122,846 (0.85% of total net expenditure under Vote as a whole); 1981 &mdash; £967,915 (0.57% of total net expenditure under Vote as a whole).  (For the years 1959 and 1969 the annual accounting period ran from 1 April to 31 March).</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's policy for the protection of the population from the effects of radioactive fallout is based on the idea of domestic refuge rooms which would be prepared by the householders themselves, at the time, to cater for that hazard. Advise in this regard is contained in the Department's booklet &ldquo;Bás/ Beatha&rdquo;, which is available to the public free of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information contained in the booklet is still substantially correct.  However, it is being re-examined with a view <Col N="1666" /> to providing a slightly expanded more modern presentation.  As part of the reexamination, the Department is considering various options for spreading the information in question.</P>
    <P>Steps to improve the various arrangements for the protection of the civilian population against radioactive fallout, which are under consideration at present and in which it is hoped to achieve progress in the next twelve months, are mainly as follows:</P>
    <P>the provision of additional instruments for the detection and monitoring of fallout radiation; further development of the present communications system principally by making greater use of radio transmission; an enlargement of the shelter arrangements following exploration of the possibility of providing increased protection against fallout in new public buildings at the time of construction and completion of a current examination of proposals designed to make available to the general public and professional personel technical documentation on the construction of purpose-built shelters; the preparation of an instruction package as an aid to existing facilities for the teaching of civil defence as part of the civics course in schools and other information packages as may be appropriate.</P>

      <P>The present position in regard to the matters referred to by me in reply to a parliamentary question on 10 March 1981 as being undertaken at that time to mark the International Year of Disabled Persons is as follows.  The requests which I made to local authorities to have regard to the needs of and facilitate the disabled in relation to access to and circulation within buildings and their use of roads and footpaths relate to works of an on-going nature.</P>
      <P>I understand that the entries for the &ldquo;Design Award Scheme&rdquo; relating to public and private buildings, which was held under the auspices of the National Rehabilitation Board have been assessed and that the awards will be announced soon.

    <P>With regard to employment of the disabled I declared on 25 June 1981 special qualifications for offices of clerical officer, clerk typist and clerical assistant in local authorities.  These offices are confined to candidates who are registered with the National Rehabilitation Board and are assessed by that board as handicapped. Local authorities are empowered to create such offices and to appoint qualified candidates thereto on the basis of a competition.  I understand that some local authorities have held such competitions and others are in the process of doing so.  Since March 1981 my Department <Col N="1674" /> have taken on ten clerical assistants and one service attendant who are disabled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether it is his intention to provide additional temporary gardaí to serve the towns of Skerries and Rush, County Dublin, because of the increased population and number of day visitors to each of these towns during the summer months.</P>

      <P>The detailed deployment of members of the force is matter to be decided primarily by the Garda authorities.  They have informed me that they are not in a position to allocate extra manpower to Skerries or Rush stations for the summer season but that should any particular problem arise in either of these centres during this period the divisional officer will take appropriate action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Doherty)</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the special recruitment programme to improve employment opportunities in the civil service for disabled persons my Department has employed eight disabled persons since 10 March 1981.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works have provided special sanitary facilities for disabled persons in my Department's headquarters and plans are being prepared for the provision of ramps at both the Department's headquarters and at 4/5 Harcourt Road where part of my Department's staff are to be located.</P>
      <P>In March 1981 the Garda Commissioner sent a circular directing that discussion be undertaken by Garda with the Office of Public Works staff at local level with a view to providing improved facilities to assist access by disabled persons to Garda buildings.  Those facilities are being provided.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available from existing records in my Department and any value it might have would not, in my opinion, be commensurate with the amount of staff time that would be needed to compile it.  In any case it would be quite inappropriate to increase some fees <i>pari passu</i> with the rise in the cost of living.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware of the deplorable condition of the former St. Vincent's School at Hart's Corner, Dublin 7, and that at present it is used as a hangout for delinquents; and if, in view of the fact that this premises is now owned by his Department, he will outline <Col N="1679" /> what he intends to do about bringing about urgent improvements at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>The former St. Vincent's School and other buildings on the site at Hart's Corner, Dublin, were badly vandalised and partly dilapidated before this property was acquired by my Department.  I am making arrangements to have these buildings demolished and to have the site fenced. These works will be commenced as soon as possible.  Planning is in hands for the future development of the site.</P>
