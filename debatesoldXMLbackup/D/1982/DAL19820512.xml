      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the Government's efforts at the United Nations Security Council to secure peace and an immediate end to hostilities in the Falkland Islands crisis, he will avail himself of Ireland's membership of the United Nations Security Council to make similar efforts to bring an end to the 18 month war between Iran and Iraq.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the conflict in the South Atlantic, the Government have from the outset actively sought to ensure that the resources of the United Nations, which we have always regarded as the pre-eminent forum for the resolution of disputes and the prevention of armed conflict, should be brought fully into play.  In this connection, the Deputy will be aware of my statement yesterday in which I indicated the Government's welcome for the role being played by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and their hope that his efforts will meet with success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the military confrontation between Iraq and Iran, it will be recalled <Col N="910" /> that on 23 September 1980, Ireland joined with our partners in the European Communities in expressing our concern at this confrontation.  On that occasion also, the Nine approved of the call made by the Secretary-General of the Islamic Conference for an immediate cease-fire; and with reference to the consultations undertaken by the then Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, declared their willingness to support any international initiative aimed at encouraging a political settlement of the dispute.  In addition, we agreed with our partners to continue to follow developments with the closest attention and to remain prepared to support the search for a solution.</P>
    <P>In line with this stance, Ireland has welcomed the mediation efforts undertaken under the aegis of the United Nations Secretary-General by the former Prime Minister of Sweden, Mr. Olaf Palme. Mr. Palme, as special emissary of both the present Secretary-General and his predecessor, has made five visits to the area of conflict &mdash; the most recent being at the end of February last &mdash; and the Security Council is regularly briefed by the Secretary-General on the progress of Mr. Palme's efforts.</P>
    <P>In addition to United Nations involvement, there have of course been extensive efforts by both the Non-Aligned Movement and the Islamic Conference Organisation to end the fighting and bring about a resolution of the differences between Iraq and Iran by negotiation. The Secretary-General reviewed the possibilities for each of these mediation efforts when I met him in New York last March.</P>
    <P>The position, then is that a variety of efforts, including in particular, a continuing effort in the United Nations framework, has been under way to end the confrontation between the two countries. Sadly, however, the differences between the two sides have so far prevented these efforts from being successful.</P>
    <P>The Government are of course deeply concerned at the loss of life and material damage which has been suffered in this conflict.  I join with others who have <Col N="911" /> appealed for an immediate cease-fire and negotiations to end the conflict.</P>
    <P>In view of our membership of the United Nations Security Council, the Government naturally keep under review all major issues of international tension or conflict with particular regard to whether there is any step open to us to ease tension or end conflict.</P>
    <P>Given our deep and continuing concern with the conflict to which the Deputy has referred, and our consistent support for the role of the United Nations, I can assure the Deputy that we shall certainly avail of Ireland's membership of the Security Council to contribute at any time and in any way that seems likely to be helpful to the restoration of peace between these two countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. de Rossa Mr. de Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible for the Taoiseach to state whether, in view of the escalation of hostilities reported between Iraq and Iran during the past week, he would give immediate instructions to our representative at the United Nations to take some initiative at that level?  I ask this question since the situation would appear to be that there is a conference convened in Baghdad for September of the Non-aligned nations and since there is now serious doubt that that conference will take place if these hostilities continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I appreciate the point of view the Deputy is putting forward. It would not be necessary for us to issue any specific direction to our representative at the United Nations and on the Security Council because our policy is well known and our representative there keeps in constant touch with the situation.  As a matter of fact, I discussed it again fully with him, arising out of the Deputy's question, and the Deputy can be assured that if at any time any specific or particular action can be taken by our representative, that will be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Apparently the representative is more reliable than some of the Taoiseach's Ministers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Taoiseach whether, in the context of his description of the conflict between Iraq and Iran as a confrontation, he would not agree that a more accurate description would be a naked and unprovoked war of aggression on the part of Iraq against Iran?  In those circumstances might I ask the Taoiseach whether he would approve of the imposition of sanctions against the aggressor nation, Iraq, in that conflict, in like manner as was done in the case of the South Atlantic conflict?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think any such statement by me, or any such action by us, would be most unhelpful in present circumstances. I should just like to repeat that any resources at our disposal should be directed towards securing cessation of hostilities and an end to the conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. de Rossa Mr. de Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the very strong moves the Government have taken in respect of the Falklands crisis which, to my mind, is not nearly as serious a situation as that existing in the Gulf and the inherent dangers in the Gulf situation to world peace &mdash; most observers agree that it constitutes a flashpoint between the two world powers &mdash; would it not be possible at this stage for the Government to take at least the same strong public moves at the United Nations in order to deal with that situation? Would the Taoiseach agree that there would seem to be an imbalanced approach here, that we are concerned to the extent of taking the matter up publicly at the United Nations in relation to the Falklands crisis while no apparent moves are being taken in relation to the conflict between Iraq and Iran?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In any of these situations it is necessary to be very careful and as wise as possible in order to ensure that any action taken might not be counter-productive. In the UN at the moment in regard to the Falklands crisis our aim at present is to give every support possible to the efforts of the Secretary-General. The Deputy will understand that Mr. Palme is a special emissary of the Secretary-General to the Middle East situation, <Col N="913" /> to the Iran-Iraq conflict, and therefore at present at any rate it would seem that the best thing we can be doing is assisting Mr. Palme in his efforts. Unfortunately, we must all acknowledge that so far his efforts have not met with any great degree of success.  The best thing we can do as long as Mr. Palme is acting as special emissary of the Secretary-General is to endeavour to use our good offices on both sides &mdash; and we have good offices on both sides &mdash; to encourage a settlement by means of Mr. Palme's efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach consider using his good offices to issue a request to Iraq that as a move towards peace in that area they would withdraw their forces behind their own boundaries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only repeat that any action of that sort which would appear to be a unilateral move by us on one side or the other would not be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach indicate what distinction he is trying to make between our decision to support Resolution 502 calling on the Argentines to withdraw from the Falklands and the proposal that the aggressor in this instance withdraw to the territory of Iraq?  I do not think anybody in the House understands what the distinction is that the Taoiseach intends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no British there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who has studied the situation would, I think, recognise that the best contribution we can make is to try to use our good offices in regard to both countries which are engaged in the conflict in the Middle East and that it would be most unhelpful to intervene in any way which would appear to take sides in the issue and that the sensible thing is to endeavour to support Mr. Palme in his efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Taoiseach <Col N="914" /> and I would ask him to reply and explain to the House the nature of the distinction that he is making between the two cases of aggression in respect of one of which we have with the full support of parties in this House called for the withdrawal of the aggressor and in the other of which he has expressed the view that it is inappropriate to do so?  Could the Taoiseach explain why there is a different approach in the two cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not necessarily see that the two situations are at all similar or that our action and activity in regard to the two separate situations need necessarily be along the same lines.  Each of these situations of world conflict must be looked on by itself, on its own merits and having regard to the elements obtaining in any particular situation.  That is what we endeavour to do.  In regard to the Middle East conflict about which this question is addressed to me, I believe the best thing we can do at this stage of that conflict is to support the special emissary of the UN Secretary-General.  In regard to the Falklands crisis our attitude again is quite clear and consistent.  We believe that we should now concentrate on encouraging and supporting the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to secure a peaceful diplomatic settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach says he cannot see any similarity in the two situations would he tell us wherein lies the difference as in each case a country with a territorial claim pursued that claim by aggression?  What is the difference that has led the Taoiseach to act differently in the two cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I am called upon here to elaborate in any detail on the special aspects of two different areas of conflict&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>You are called upon; I have just called upon you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Sufficient for us is the fact that these two conflicts do exist, both causing loss of life, both having inherent in them a danger to world peace and <Col N="915" /> therefore what we should do in relation to both separate conflicts is approach them as separate issues and be as constructive as we can in regard to both in trying to ensure a cessation of hostilities and the restoration of peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that as in the case of the conflict between Iran and Iraq there is need to be as careful and as wise as possible in our approaches to ensure that any action taken is not counter-productive.  In the context of the Falklands crisis there is a need to be careful and wise to ensure as far as possible that any ministerial pronouncements or Government statements made are not counter-productive in securing peace in the region?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt whatever that our action in regard to the Falklands crisis at every level is helpful and constructive and is entirely in accord with our traditions as a peace-loving member of the community of nations.  I regret very much that the Opposition for their own petty party political purposes should seek to adopt this peevish obstructive attitude in regard to our efforts.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach, since he has reduced it to this level of reply, would his contacts with Iraq, his personal contacts and his visit to Iraq which was postponed when he was leader of the Opposition, have any bearing on his current attitude to this matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been traditional that, because of the very sensitive nature of the Department of Foreign Affairs, it is desirable, in my view certainly, to have all the matters in the Department of Foreign Affairs handled by the Minister himself. I can only point to the disastrous experience of the previous Government in having a Minister of State there who was quite superfluous and supernumerary.</P>

        <i>Mayo West)</i>: In March 1981 additional lines were made available in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada and in June 1981 Gandon House Public Office was opened.  Both of these measures relieved pressure on the switchboard in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada.  At present there are 78 incoming lines to that office.  The high level of unemployment and of claimants generally has placed increased pressure on the telephone system and I am aware that there can be difficulty at times in contacting particular sections in the headquarters of my Department.  The problem has been under examination in consultation with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and surveys carried out by that Department show that there has been an improvement in the position in recent times.  I am however pursuing the matter urgently to see what further facilities can be provided and how these can best be used to give a better service.</P>

        <i>(Mayo West):</i> The data on PRSI contributions for the contribution years 1979-80 and 1980-81 as supplied to my Department from the computer records of the office of the Revenue Commissioners comprise the records of all the individual employments in those years.  Experience has shown however that large numbers of insured persons would have been in two or more employments and in many instances would have paid contributions under more than one RSI number.  On the basis of the available records it is estimated that the total number of insured persons in each of those years was in the region of 1.1 million. This figure includes insured persons who were sick or unemployed for all or part of those years and also persons employed on seasonal work, students doing holiday work and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The returns for the contribution year 1981-82 are only now being forwarded by <Col N="928" /> employers to the Revenue Commissioners and, accordingly, the analysis for that year has not yet commenced.</P>

        <i>(Mayo West):</i> Dental benefit under my Department's dental benefit scheme is provided by dental practitioners in private practice who sign an agreement to provide services under the scheme at an agreed scale of fees. They are not employees of the Department and may not be compelled to sign agreements if they do not wish to do so. Equally they cannot be prevented from resigning from the dental panel if at any time they so wish.</P>
      <P>At present six dentists provide services under the scheme in County Mayo and my Department would welcome applications from other dentists in that county, who formerly participated in the scheme, to resume such participation under the same conditions as those applying to their 620 colleagues throughout the country who provide such an excellent and much appreciated service for insured persons.</P>
      <P>In the neighbouring counties of Galway, Sligo, and Roscommon approximately 40 dentists provide services under the Department's dental benefit scheme. There is provision under the scheme whereby insured persons may be recouped travelling and other expenses necessarily incurred in obtaining treatment from a dentist practising under the scheme in another area if such treatment is not available from a local dentist.  In this way insured persons in County Mayo may get dental treatment under the scheme from a dentist outside their own area if treatment is not available locally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo West):</i> The insured person concerned claimed dental benefit in July 1980 and was supplied with an acrylic denture.  She signed a declaration <Col N="930" /> to the effect that it had been fitted to her satisfaction.</P>
      <P>In January 1981 she claimed that the denture supplied had become ill-fitting and requested a chrome cobalt denture which was supplied.  She again signed a declaration that the denture had been fitted to her satisfaction.</P>
      <P>In October 1981 the claimant notified my Department that the chrome cobalt denture was ill-fitting and the matter was referred for a second opinion to an examining dentist.  He reported that, while the denture fitted the original mould, it did not appear to fit properly at the time of the examination.</P>
      <P>The dentist involved then offered to supply a new chrome cobalt denture free of charge and in the meantime supplied a temporary acrylic denture, also free of charge.  The new chrome cobalt denture was tested by the dentist, with a dental technician present, and arrangements were made for a final fitting but the claimant failed to attend for this fitting.</P>
      <P>The Department paid a subvention towards both the original acrylic and chrome cobalt dentures, the balance being paid to the dentist on both occasions by the claimant.  Any question of a refund is therefore a matter between the claimant and the dentist.  The latter has however sold the practice and has left the country.  The dentist who purchased the practice is prepared to complete the fitting of the chrome cobalt denture prepared by the previous dentist.</P>
      <P>As regards the dental benefit scheme generally I am satisfied that there are adequate safeguards in the scheme for the investigation of complaints.  In addition to the system of examining dentists my Department has a dental adviser available to advise on all matters, including complaints, arising out of the treatment of insured persons.  Although approximately 200,000 claims for dental benefit are received each year there are very few complaints against the dentists participating in the scheme.</P>

Pay-related benefit could not be paid at the time with the disability benefit payment as details of his earnings in 1979-80, the relevant tax year, were not available to my Department.  The necessary information was subsequently received and a cheque for the amount of £38.04 being pay-related benefit due from 17 September 1981, 13th day of incapacity to 3 October 1981, was issued on 8 January 1982.  The claimant has been informed that if he did not receive this cheque, the issue of a duplicate cheque will be considered on hearing from him.</P>

        <i>(Mayo West):</i> Information on the rights of beneficiaries under the various schemes administered by my Department is provided by way of advertising, leaflets and booklets, talks and lectures by officers of the Department at courses and seminars and through information centres where people can learn of their rights and seek assistance in applying for them.  I should mention that the various voluntary agencies also play a very valuable role in this regard which is much appreciated.  Because of the variety of schemes administered such a range of methods of providing information is necessary and is aimed at securing the greatest possible coverage at reasonable cost. Advertising in the national and provincial papers and on radio and television is undertaken when this is considered to be appropriate.  Extensive advertising is undertaken when new services are introduced or existing services improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the multiplicity of <Col N="932" /> social welfare services a large-scale advertising campaign through the press, radio and television setting out the eligibility conditions for each service would be extremely costly and would be of doubtful value in improving take-up services unless it were to be repeated at frequent intervals.</P>
    <P>I accept fully that the public must be given all possible assistance in ascertaining their entitlements to social welfare benefits and it is my intention to use all the means at my disposal to continue to improve the system of providing information on the services and to make use of the advertising media where this is seen to be appropriate.</P>

      <P>Firstly, the Minister has not answered my question, but I am very grateful for the information which he has given.  One of the reasons for putting down this question was my anxiety to know the reason for the delay in the decision on the question of eligibility for unemployment benefit in this case.  The Minister has not explained that reason. He has stated the decision.  Is the Minister aware that there was no trade dispute at this firm since 15 March 1982, that the workers concerned have been reporting for work, are available for work and willing to work ever since that date but, for reasons on the management side, a decision has been made to close down operations? Surely it is really stretching the interpretation of the relevant section of the Act beyond the limit to suggest that these people should be debarred from unemployment benefit because of a non-existent dispute?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo West):</i> The explanation given to my Department is that there has been a dispute and while that is the case social welfare payments cannot be made.  The deciding officer discussed the matter with the management of Castlecomer Mills on 28 April to clarify the matter of the negotiations taking place.  He was informed that there had been a number of unofficial strikes in the company since its inception and that the plant would remain closed until agreement was reached for an end to that type of unofficial action which was taking place.  The deciding officer, having examined the evidence, considered that there <Col N="941" /> was a dispute within the meaning of section 35 (6) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 and decided that claimants were disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits under the provisions of section 35 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 with effect from 15 March 1982.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astounded at the Minister's statement, which I think I heard correctly.  The substance of it was that these people were disqualified because the management side had said that there was a history of disputes.  A legitimate claim for unemployment benefit made on 15 March 1982 is now being disallowed because of alleged disputes in the past.  Surely this is stretching the section of the Act far beyond any reasonable interpretation.  Last week, we discussed the situation at Clover Meats, but this is even worse.  People are told that they are in dispute with their company because of alleged disputes which were over and done with years ago.  Surely this is completely ridiculous?</P>

      <P>For the benefit of Deputy Garret FitzGerald and the rest of the Members of this House, when I took the position as Ceann Comhairle last July I said it was my intention not to muzzle Deputies in any way but to give every latitude with regard to questions. I tried, within the rules operating here, to allow latitude on this.  I am afraid it got out of hand and, if I may recall a private conversation with Deputy FitzGerald, he told me I was perhaps too soft and I replied that I would try to observe the rules more stringently.  When it is possible I will allow latitude and I would be delighted to allow more questions.  The rules are too restrictive at present and they make it very difficult for Members and equally difficult for me to operate as Ceann Comhairle.  I propose that the matter should be brought before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for you to change, not for me.  I feel that would be in all your interests and especially in the interests of the Opposition. I as a Deputy know the problems, restrictions and frustrations that we all suffered. I hope this matter can be resolved and that there will be a successful outcome to the discussions on this so that matters such as Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Alan Shatter have raised can be brought forward on the Order of Business to allow you all to have a chance to discuss problems.</P>

You suggested you were being too soft and I courteously agreed that you were being very generous in the matter.

Because Members may not be aware of it, the point should be made that not only are there problems in the District Court, but there is no documentation, or ministerial <Col N="999" /> statutory instruments produced, to enable proceedings to go to the Circuit Court.  Unless this matter is dealt with this week, the whole administration of justice will grind to a halt.  This is a valid point of order to make because the problems I am now pointing to I anticipated in an Adjournment Debate on 1 April this year, during which the Minister for Justice did not have the courtesy to appear and in which, by way of April fool&mdash;&mdash;</P>

One difficulty may flow from that, that is that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is inclined to operate a very rigid interpretation of the rules and Standing Orders. Might I respectfully suggest that it is necessary that both of you be on the same wave-length?  Otherwise, Members of the House will not know where they stand, when they are in order or when they are out of order.

That is also the reason why it will require time <Col N="1001" /> to go through both Houses.  If it will not be circulated before early June the time limit for its adoption would leave very little time for an adequate debate.

    <Title>Irish Shipping Limited Bill, 1982: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wish to say that this is not the second time but the third time that this was called and I was not harking back to a previous call when I attempted to start my speech, I think that I deserve an apology from the Leader of Fine Gael for that reason. He accused me in the wrong.</P>
      <P>The immediate need for the proposed legislation derives from the intention of the Government to institute a special financing arrangement for the &ldquo;Panamax&rdquo; bulk carrier which is presently under construction at Verolme Cork Dockyard Limited for Irish Shipping Limited.</P>
      <P>The cost of constructing the new vessel at Verolme is £28 million.  Under the original financing plan Irish Shipping Limited would have been liable for £14.2 million of this and the balance would have been paid as shipbuilding subsidies by the Department of Industry and Energy to Verolme directly.  The special financing arrangement which is now proposed and which will cover the total cost of the ship will incorporate a leasing contract in respect of the vessel on attractive terms, thus enabling the company to draw from sources of funding not otherwise available for Exchequer purposes and outside the ambit of the Exchequer borrowing requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an integral part of the proposed arrangement that the Government should give certain formal assurances to the participating banking institutions. These would be similar in kind to the <Col N="1008" /> assurances given under existing legislation whenever Irish Shipping Limited borrows in the normal course.  In effect, the Government would guarantee that, in the event of Irish Shipping Limited not being in a position to discharge its obligations to the banking institutions under the proposed arrangement, the necessary moneys would be made available by the Exchequer.  This guarantee would, of course, embrace the obligations of Irish Shipping Limited in respect of the leasing contract.</P>
    <P>The Government are empowered already to give such assurances in the case of other State bodies &mdash; for example, Coras Iompair Éireann, under the State Guarantees (Transport) Act, 1962 &mdash; but these powers do not yet extend to Irish Shipping Limited.  The legislation which I am proposing today will remove the obstacles which presently exist to leasing and other contracts being entered into by Irish Shipping Limited with the benefit of a Government guarantee.</P>
    <P>The past year has been one of considerable activity for Irish Shipping. Through its new subsidiary company &mdash; Oceanbank Limited &mdash; the company has sold a 25 per cent share of both Irish Continental Line and its shareholding in Insurance Corporation of Ireland and the Property Corporation of Ireland.  This transaction released funds to the company which helped it to finance the purchase of a secondhand car ferry &mdash; the &ldquo;St. Patrick II&rdquo;&mdash; and to lengthen the existing ferry the &ldquo;St. Killian&rdquo;.  These developments have substantially increased carrying capacity on the Rosslare-Continental routes to the benefit of both tourist and commercial users.</P>
    <P>The company has also been very much involved in the reinstatement of the Belfast-Liverpool service, previously operated by the P&amp;O Company.  The new service began on 1 May and is operated by the former &ldquo;St. Patrick&rdquo; now renamed &ldquo;St. Colum I&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping's main activity, the operation of a fleet of deep-sea ships, has had to contend with a fall in freight rates due to the present stagnation in worldwide shipping resulting from recessions <Col N="1009" /> in the US and other industrial countries. The company, nevertheless, hope to benefit from the upsurge in activity in the bulk carrier trade in coal.  The National Board for Science and Technology in its study of Ireland's coal shipping requirements estimated that the business of shipping coal to Ireland will increase from £18 million in 1984 to £29 million in 1986 and may reach £47 million by 1988.  There is valuable business here for Irish shipowners and I have no doubt that Irish Shipping will be able to trade profitably the bulk carrier now being built in this market.</P>
    <P>The final accounts for the year ended 31/3/1982 are not yet available but the indications are that the company will maintain its profit record and will improve on the profit of £3 million which the company returned in 1981.  The company will also be reporting an increase in passenger carryings by Irish Continental Line of the order of 2 per cent.  This is certainly a very satisfactory situation and very much to the credit of the board and personnel of the company &mdash; it is very good news to hear in times when such news is scarce &mdash; having regard to the tough trading conditions of recent years.</P>
    <P>I accordingly recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall start by making two complaints.  One is that the explanatory memorandum would be of more assistance to the House if it was circulated with the Bill rather than at the time of Second Reading.  It arrived at the same time as the Minister's speech.  Having looked at the memorandum and listened to the Minister's speech, I regret to say that it is not of much assistance.  My second complaint is that the Minister's speech was remarkably short on information. It assumes that Members will recall and know precisely the financial arrangements which were made at the time the contract for the vessel was placed.  That was some time ago and Members may have forgotten.  Certainly members of the public might not be aware of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One unfortunate consequence of the scarcity of information is that the nature <Col N="1010" /> of the Bill, to provide guarantees for Irish Shipping, could give the misleading impression that what we are about is giving subsidies for Irish Shipping.  That would be unfair to this company which has traded at a profit without subsidy from the Exchequer in a fiercely competitive market.  It is a market which is complex, difficult and cyclical.  The company has survived through many years and has consistently shown a profit at the end of each trading year.</P>
    <P>The Bill we are debating is providing for guarantees.  The Minister gives no explanation of what this is all about.  I propose to ask him questions in the hope that he might clarify the matter and refresh our memories about the financing of this ship.  The genesis of the Bill lies in the previous Fianna Fáil administration asking Irish Shipping to have this vessel constructed at the Verolme shipyard.  If left to themselves Irish Shipping would not have gone to this yard to construct the vessel because the price was twice as much as the best price they could have got in open competition, a difference between £14 million and £28 million.  The Government were anxious that the vessel should be constructed in Cork and they arranged that Irish Shipping would finance the open commercial market price of the vessel and the Government would provide the balance by way of subsidy to the yard.  That meant the Government would have to find £14 million to pay as a direct subsidy to the shipyard.  I do not know what that would work out at in terms of the price of the job.  It would be interesting to know how that subsidy would relate to job subsidies in other enterprises.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that special financial arrangements are proposed.  We are not given any details of what these will be.  He said they will cover the total cost of the ship and will incorporate a leasing contract in respect of the vessel on attractive terms.  We are not told the total sum involved.  We are not told who will provide the vessel, what bankers, financial institutions or consortium of the same will put up the funds.  We are not told the terms of the lease to Irish Shipping.  The Minister said &ldquo;attractive terms&rdquo; and I <Col N="1011" /> should like to know what they are.  I presume that the lessors will provide the total cost, £28 million, for this vessel and then they will lease it to Irish Shipping. However, we are not told this but left very much in the dark.  If they are financial institutions they will lease to Irish Shipping on terms which will remunerate their investment of £28 million at commercial rates.</P>
    <P>Does this mean Irish Shipping will have to pay rent for a vessel costing £28 million when the original deal was that all they would have to find was the commercial cost of the ship, £14 million?  It is very important that this point be cleared up. If Irish Shipping are to be allowed to deal on the original terms, that is be involved in a vessel costing £14 million, will the Exchequer meet the difference between the cost of remunerating £14 million or £28 million or whatever the end cost of the vessel will be?  We should have that information.  Irish Shipping should be put into a position of having to take a lease only on the basis of a vessel costing £14 million, that is on the basis of the understanding and arrangement they entered into with the Government when the contract for the vessel was placed.</P>
    <P>The company's success and strength has been the fact that it traded according to strict commercial norms.  It only agreed to have this ship built in Cork provided the cost to it was the commercial cost and not the inflated cost which had to be paid to Verolme to build the ship.  It is important for the morale of the company that its commercial viability and integrity is not interfered with and that the Minister will ensure that whatever leasing arrangement is made, as far as Irish Shipping are concerned, they will be tied purely to the commercial cost of the vessel.  It is very important that the Minister should assure this House, the public and the commercial scene in which Irish Shipping have been operating that there is no question of Irish Shipping becoming a lame duck State company or the recipients of subsidies or of any special treatment.  Irish Shipping are very proud of their commercial record and <Col N="1012" /> very jealous of their commercial integrity.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the difficult commercial scene in which they operate, it is very important that the confidence of their customers and of those involved in shipping throughout the world should not be disturbed in any way by any suggestion coming from this House by reason of this Bill being called a &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; Bill that Irish Shipping are to be the recipients of subsidies.  I urge the Minister to assure this House that any subsidies to be paid on foot of this contract will be paid to Verolme and not to Irish Shipping.  This is very important.  It is regrettable that the Minister did not give us all these details in the course of his speech and clear the air so that we should know exactly what is proposed, how much money is proposed, who is to be involved and the attitude of Irish Shipping to this change in arrangements.  We should like to know the length of the lease and its terms, who the lessors are, and other relevant information so that we could see exactly what was happening and judge whether the original bargain with Irish Shipping that they would get this ship on commercial terms is to be maintained.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also indicate the present position with regard to payments to date to the shipyard.  The ship has been in the course of construction for 18 months and obviously substantial payments have been made.  It would be useful to know how much has been paid, by whom it has been paid and whether the funds have come from Irish Shipping or from the Exchequer.  The latter is unlikely because it is quite clear that the Exchequer is in a straitened position and is not able to find the subsidy to the yard which was originally envisaged.  We must assume that any payments made so far have been made by Irish Shipping.  Have those payments been more than might normally fall to be paid by a shipping company to a shipyard having regard to the present stage of construction?  What will happen to the payments made so far in relation to the leasing arrangements? Are they to be put up by the unknown lessor and repaid to Irish Shipping, the full cost being taken on to the lease, or is <Col N="1013" /> the amount on foot of the lease to be the gross cost less what has been paid so far? One would want to be assured that what has been paid so far has not been in excess of what a shipping company would normally pay at this stage of a contract.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to the activities of Irish Shipping during the past year and I wish to commend Irish Shipping on these activities and on their commercial expertise, particularly in the formation of the new subsidiary company and the various amalgamations and partnerships which have arisen from that.  The effect will be a widening of the commercial base of Irish Shipping in a very positive and sensible way which will give them an interest in diverse activities which are concomitant with the basic operations of the company.  The commercial skill exercised in the conceiving of that deal, negotiating it and putting it together so quickly, smoothly and profitably redounds tremendously well to those charged with the running of Irish Shipping, and I compliment them on what they achieved.</P>
    <P>We wish them well in the reinstatement of the Belfast-Liverpool service.  The Irish Sea is a notoriously difficult route on which to achieve profits and it will be a test of their expertise.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the study carried out by the National Board for Science and Technology in relation to our future coal requirements, which will be very substantial.  The great bulk of this coal will be imported by another company owned by the same shareholder as Irish Shipping, namely, the State; in other words, the coal will be imported by the ESB.  I hope that the Minister would continue the representations made by me to the ESB to the effect that, other things being equal, Irish Shipping would be the preferred carrier for the coal to be used by the ESB in their new generating station at Moneypoint.  Irish Shipping would not ask for any preferential treatment because in effect that would mean asking for a subsidy.  It makes common sense that the shareholder of both these companies should ensure co-operation between them, provided it would be commercially proper.  I ask the Minister to assure the House that he will make it very <Col N="1014" /> clear to the ESB that he would like to see their coal-carrying business in the hands of Irish Shipping, provided that they will be as competitive as any other operation in the market.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Irish Continental Line will be able to report during the coming year a better increase in passenger carryings than the Minister mentioned in his speech, namely 2 per cent on last year. That is not a large increase.  I appreciate that in times of recession passenger and commercial traffic is likely to fail to grow to the level one would wish and one can only hope that any lack of growth will be met by economies in the management of the company's operations.  Irish Shipping are very experienced in dealing with the cycles which are a part of the shipping trade and are able to cut their cloth according to the measure of the trading climate.  They have proved this in their deep sea operations over the years and I have no doubt that they will be able to manage their ferry operations equally efficiently.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to this Bill but I have some questions to ask on Committee Stage regarding the meaning of various sections.  I have no objection to provision being made for the giving of guarantees on the borrowings of Irish Shipping.  However, we want to make it very clear that those borrowings, if they are to be incurred and require these guarantees, will be incurred for the purpose of subsidising a shipyard in Cork and not for the purpose of subsidising Irish Shipping. In fairness to the company, that needs to be spelled out here and I am sorry the Minister has not done so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extremely serious Bill and one which the media might regard as just another Bill relating to the capital requirements of a State-sponsored body.  I suggest that this is a very new situation and one which dramatically illustrates a complete change of policy by the Government in relation to the capital requirements of the State-sponsored sector.  This is the first clear evidence of such a major change of Government policy when they decided to reduce substantially in the <Col N="1015" /> budget the capital requirements of the State sector.</P>
      <P>In December 1980 the matter of the bulk carrier was debated in this House. At that time the carrier was to cost £25 million and it was to be funded in two parts &mdash; £14 million and £11 million.  Of the £14 million Irish Shipping were to put up £7 million in equity and were to borrow £7 million.  They were to be given a further £11 million by way of direct subvention. As was stated in the Official Report, the vessel was to be funded by &ldquo;a combination of equity to the company, borrowing by the company and the payment of subvention to the yard&rdquo;.  The Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, of which I was a member, reported as follows:</P>
      <P>Irish Shipping will pay £14 million for the vessel which will be funded by borrowings (50%) and equity (50%). The balance of the cost, £11 million, will be made up by a direct subvention from the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism to Verolme Cork Dockyard.</P>
      <P>Today we have been presented with a dramatically different situation.  The Minister's speech was an incredible one. He stated:</P>
      <P>The special financing arrangement which is now proposed and which will cover the total cost of the ship will incorporate a leasing contract in respect of the vessel on attractive terms, thus enabling the company to draw from sources of funding not otherwise available for Exchequer purposes and outside the ambit of the Exchequer borrowing requirement.</P>
      <P>The question must be asked: is this not a total change of policy in relation to the funding and payment for this ship?  It is a completely different arrangement.  I put the question directly to the Minister: where is the £11 million which the then Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism specifically said would be given by way of direct subvention to Verolme to build this ship?  It is gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that this Bill <Col N="1016" /> will not be passed unless we get the information. The cost of the ship has increased from £25 million to £28 million.  If this House has any sense of financial propriety, there is no way it can pass a Bill of this kind without inquiring what is the leasing contract and who are the participating financial institutions?  Let us have it out in the open.  What are the leasing arrangements?  What are the proportions applicable to Verolme, Irish Shipping and the State?  We are entitled to have this information.  This kind of practice was started when the Taoiseach said that the Government would no longer provide £90 million for the State sector in 1982 and the amount was slashed down to £60 million.  This will affect Aer Lingus, CIE, Irish Shipping and many others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to quote from the 15th Report of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies dated 3 March 1981, which a distinguished member of the Minister's party, Senator Eoin Ryan, signed as chairman of the committee on behalf of the members.  I will quote the section relating to this ship, the ship that Irish Shipping did not want to build in this country.  It could have been built in any other country for £14 million but they were told they must build it in Cork at a cost of £25 million.  The cost is now £28 million and it may even <Col N="1017" /> be £31 million by the time we are finished. The ship is supposed to be ready next December but the question is if it will be ready by that time.  The report stated:</P>
      <P>The Irish Shipping Act, 1980, was enacted to make provision for the capital and borrowing requirements of Irish Shipping in respect of the new bulk carrier and for the financial needs of the Irish Shipping over the next few years.  The contract for the new vessel &mdash; a Panamax bulk carrier of 72,000 tons dead weight &mdash; was signed in February of this year.  The final cost of the vessel will be &ldquo;in the region of £25 million&rdquo;.  Irish Shipping will pay £14 million for the vessel which will be funded by borrowings (50%) and equity (50%).  The balance of the cost, £11 million, will be made up by a direct subvention from the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism to Verolme Cork Dockyard.  The Committee has already outlined what it described as &ldquo;quasi-dividends&rdquo; which Irish Shipping has had to pay.  The purchase of the new bulk carrier may well fit under this description.  Sufficient details are not available at present for the Committee to make any definite comment on the matter.  However, the Committee is of the view that where costs of a non-commercial nature have to be incurred by Irish Shipping on the instruction of Government, such costs should be clearly identified in the accounts and an indication given of the extent, if any, to which they affect the commercial performance of the company.</P>
      <P>I am a firm believer in an efficient, dynamic State-sponsored enterprise. This Bill attacks the financial integrity of a major successful State-sponsored company. They employ about 900 people and have a payroll of £6 million to £7 million per year.  We do not know what implications this Bill will have so far as the company are concerned.  Section 5 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the expiration of every financial year, lay before each House of the <Col N="1018" /> Oireachtas a statement setting out as respects each guarantee given during such year or given at any time before and in force at, the commencement of such year&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  particulars of the guarantee,</P>
    <P>(b)  in case any payment has been made by the Minister under the guarantee before the end of such year, the amount of the payment and the amount (if any) repaid to the Minister in respect of the payment,</P>
    <P>(c)  the amount of moneys for which the Minister would, if the guarantee were enforced immediately upon the expiration of such year, be liable under the guarantee.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister seriously suggest that we will pass this Bill &mdash; I do not know the precise date when the construction of the ship began but the Minister would have that information &mdash; without knowing what payments have been made under what departmental sub-heading and what subventions have been made from the Department of Industry and Commerce &mdash; or what was left of it after we dismembered it?  What exactly was made by way of payments direct to Verolme or to Irish Shipping Limited or to the contractors? We are entitled to know.  Where are the disbursements?  Where are they guaranteed? Who are the financial and private banking institutions?  I put these questions because it is absolutely essential that we know the answers.</P>
    <P>Finally, in particular I draw the attention of the House and everybody in the House to a new policy of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The Minister early in his Second Stage speech said:</P>
    <P>...outside the ambit of the Exchequer borrowing requirement.</P>
    <P>This is the new self-financing subsidy policy of the Fianna Fáil Party.  From now on everything in this country will be outside the ambit of the Exchequer borrowing requirement, otherwise it might show up at the end of the year that the State in fact had borrowed.  Every State-sponsored body from the Sugar Company to Aer Lingus to CIE to Bord na Móna to <Col N="1019" /> the devil knoes who will be told: &ldquo;Off you go to the private banks.  We will give a guarantee.  We will give a letter of comfort if you run into trouble&rdquo;, but it will not appear in the Exchequer borrowing requirement at the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The guarantees will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The guarantees will, but that will not be regarded for political purposes as being of any consequence.  I should say political party propaganda purposes because that is what invariably is done with the definition of the Exchequer borrowing requirement and, as we all know, ultimately it has a major impact. Therefore, I ask the Minister to elaborate for us what exactly he meant when he said:</P>
      <P>The special financing arrangement which is now proposed and which will cover the total cost of the ship will incorporate a leasing contract in respect of the vessel on attractive terms, thus enabling the company to draw from sources of funding not otherwise available for Exchequer purposes and</P>
      <P>&mdash;I stress this&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;outside the ambit of the Exchequer borrowing requirement.</P>
      <P>What exactly is meant by that?  What formal assurances are being given to the participating banking institutions?  We are entitled to know who they are, and with the interest rates and exchange rates that we have today it is of critical importance in relation to any discussion that we have full details of participating financial institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have a great deal more to say on Committee Stage in relation to this Bill.  I concur completely with my colleague, Deputy Cooney, on his general endorsement of the general activities of Irish Shipping Limited who are one of our finest State-sponsored companies. They are one of the relatively few companies of whom we on the joint committee had no hesitation at our conclusion in March 1981 shortly before the general <Col N="1020" /> election in congratulating the board, management, staff, masters and crews of Irish Shipping Limited on the highly efficient manner in which they discharged their responsibilities.  It is of critical importance now that the radically new arrangements which have transpired, which are completely different from those proposed originally in relation to the financing of this ship, should be subjected to very considerable public scrutiny in this House on both Second Stage and Committee Stage of this Bill.  Therefore, we await with great interest the comments of the Minister for Transport and his elaboration on the politically scanty information given to us in his Second Stage speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express praise for and appreciation of Irish Shipping Limited who have an excellent record.  The people who established Irish Shipping Limited can be described as far-seeing.  The company are one of the authorities who were set up by an Irish Government and on whom we can look with very great pride.  The setting up of the company has been a successful venture.  Undoubtedly any requests by the Minister for Transport of the present or any Government in this House for any sums of money required for the financing of Irish Shipping Limited will be approved in the House.</P>
      <P>Before the establishment of Irish Shipping Limited the high seas did not carry what we can describe as any seaworthy transport backed up financially by the Irish Government.  We may have had a number of privately owned seaworthy carriers but it was only after the establishment of the company that we in this country began to undertake in a big way courageous and difficult voyages to faroff ports and destinations.  Irish Shipping Limited should be complimented on the manner in which they recruited their personnel for those difficult voyages.  The staffs of all the carriers of the company are well trained, very well disciplined and dedicated to their work and duties at port and on sea and at every seaport at which they dock they do so with very great distinction and great credit to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> We seldom get an opportunity to pay a tribute to a State-sponsored body which has a good financial record.  This opportunity should be availed of today to pay a tribute to Irish Shipping Limited who have a record for making profits.  Too often we have had discussions in this House on grave financial losses of taxpayers' money, as if there was a bottomless hole and the taxpayers money was being piped into it, but that is not the case with Irish Shipping Limited.  For that reason we must salute everybody concerned, management, staff and the workers on board the carriers.  The company pay well and get good service from their workers.  So far we have not heard any sounds of staff discontent in Irish Shipping Limited.  On the contrary, people have been encouraged to work, good rates of pay for work well done have been paid and there is outstanding co-operation among workers on the carriers. This reflects great credit on the personnel of that company.</P>
    <P>This Bill will provide special financing arrangements for the &ldquo;Panamax&rdquo; bulk carrier which is being constructed at the Verolme Dockyard Cork at a cost of £28 million.  In present financial circumstances that figure is a very modest sum for a carrier of that size.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if I have followed this debate properly but am I to understand that it might have been possible to have a similar vessel constructed outside this country for a smaller sum or an equivalent sum?  I want to put on record that we and the Government have a duty to ensure that Irish workers are employed constructing boats, ships or carriers for Irish Shipping Limited and other interested companies.  If Irish Shipping Limited had decided to have the carrier constructed outside this country, many voices would have been raised in this House and among people from all over the country because Verolme Dockyard might have been forced to put their workers on short time, half time, or they might even have had to close down.  It is the act of a sensible Government to channel all possible work into a source which will provide productive employment for our workers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1022" /> I have already paid a tribute to Irish Shipping Limited and I would like now to salute the management, staff and skilled workforce employed in Verolme Dockyard Cork.  I also want to congratulate Irish Shipping Limited on their outstanding record and the ventures under consideration and planned for the future. This Bill gives each Member an opportunity to salute everybody connected with that dockyard.  Long may they have orders to construct carriers not alone for Irish Shipping Limited but for foreign firms.  We can only hope that this dockyard will at the end of the world recession be able to compete with the best shipbuilding authorities in the world and that they may acquire many orders from other countries and flourish.  The then Minister and Government, whoever they might be, will be behind those engaged in our shipbuilding industry and will encourage them to seek orders at home and abroad so that our skilled workforce will be able to continue constructing ships and carriers at Cork.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Desmond has left the House because I do not believe in commenting on a man in his absence.  I am at a loss to understand why Deputy Desmond did not query the millions he is now querying when he was in the Department of Finance for six or seven months.  If he was worried about the manner in which this money was being spent; I do not see why he could not have taken up the telephone and queried his colleagues or got in touch with the Verolme Dockyard people from whom I always received the greatest possible courtesy. During the short time I was Minister for Defence, when I visited the dockyard I was received in the most friendly spirit possible and in an atmosphere of willingness to co-operate in every way.  If we want to check up on whether £11 million is due, what happened to the millions of pounds which were paid, the standard contract price of £28 million, the £14 million provided in the Estimates for the Department of Industry and Commerce, or the further £11 million which was guaranteed, we can do so.  The Minister for Finance or any other Minister has nothing to hide in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1023" /> When will we approach debates in a sensible way without looking for the shadow of something suspect?  I do not think there is anything suspect in relation to the work at Verolme Dockyard.  Naturally they must have money to keep their business going.  If they are to make progress with the carrier, they must get money.  If they require money by a special date, I do not think there is anything that needs to be hidden.  Every penny voted in this House to Irish Shipping for the carrier which is under construction in Verolme Dockyard goes into the pockets of Irish workers.  Where else should it go? Are there people in this House who would like to see it going anywhere other than into the pockets of Irish workers?</P>
    <P>Assuming this carrier could not have been constructed for the sum of £28 million, I would have no hesitation in defending the case for the payment of a larger sum.  It would be Irish money spent on Irish workers in an Irish dockyard by an Irish company.  Everyone connected with Irish Shipping has been dedicated to the company.  Clouds of suspicion should not be created in the Irish Parliament about the spending of money which will keep Irish workers in employment.  Such criticisms may be made in good faith and with the intention of eliciting information on where public money is going.  The money being spent by Irish Shipping on the construction of this carrier is keeping the dockyards going, keeping Irish workers employed, and maintaining the craft and skill of boat building and ship building.  I have nothing but praise for all that.  I hope the good work will continue.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the purchase by Irish Shipping of the secondhand car ferry, the &ldquo;St. Patrick II&rdquo; and the work carried out on the existing ferry, the &ldquo;St. Killian&rdquo;.  It is very welcome news that these developments have increased substantially the carrying capacity on the Rosslare-Continental routes to the benefit of tourists and commercial users.  Our tourist industry has suffered and is suffering enough. It is vital that every facility should be made available to attract tourists to come here with their own cars.  The same applies to the commercial carriers.  There <Col N="1024" /> has been a considerable growth of commercial trade particularly since our entry into the European Economic Community. The work of Irish Shipping has provided a close connection between ourselves and other countries across the sea. I do not know what plans Irish Shipping have for the future.</P>
    <P>I am sure everyone connected with Irish Shipping will read the Official Report and particularly the report of the debate this afternoon.  I appeal to everybody connected with Irish Shipping, and particularly the board and management, to be courageous about the future, and to look to the future with hope.  Where possible, they should equip themselves with seaworthy vessels so that, when the recession ends, they will have at their disposal carriers to bring coal here and to bring traffic in and out of the country. We look to Irish Shipping to do this efficiently. Without Irish Shipping we would be isolated so far as the sea is concerned. The world recession cannot last for ever. If Irish Shipping purchase good seaworthy secondhand carriers now, perhaps they will get them at a cheaper rate than at the end of the recession.  If there has to be borrowing for that purpose, when the recession ends it will be seen to have been a good, sound investment.  There is nothing wrong about borrowing if one can foresee that it will yield a return.</P>
    <P>We see that Irish Shipping Limited have purchased a secondhand car ferry, a wonderful addition to their fleet and an asset to this country.  In addition to being an asset to Irish Shipping Limited and this country, it will convey people here who will spend money on hotels and so on, helping the tourist industry and also assist enormously in a higher standard of commercial and business activity. Furthermore, if Irish Shipping Limited see other secondhand ferries or carriers they feel would be good value, it would be very wrong of them to put off their purchase until we are able to pay, because we shall never be able to pay.  In the 40 years in which I have been a Member of this House I remember one balanced budget only.  Each successive Minister for Finance cuts down on <Col N="1025" /> expenditure, awaiting better times &mdash; a fantasy.  Each budget appears to be an annual dream, a stretching out for the rainbow that seems always to recede further and further, even when the outstretched arms reach further and further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I contend that, if borrowing has to be engaged in for the purchase of secondhand ferries or other ships Irish Shipping Limited see as being necessary to their activities, they should not hesitate in any way but rather enter into such commitments because most certainly they will prove to have been profitable at the end of the recession.  I feel also that commercial users will benefit and they at the end of the recession will expect a higher standard of speed and efficiency in regard to sea journeys between our ports and those abroad, to mention but a few, Liverpool, Rotterdam and others.</P>
      <P>That is why Irish Shipping Limited should now be examining their present position and that which will obtain for the remainder of this decade and that taking us into the next century.  In equipping oneself for activity on the high seas one must commence before the need arises and plan ahead several years.  Now is the time Irish Shipping Limited should be giving what might be described as an international lead in regard to equipping themselves for the high seas between now and the end of this century.  I am convinced they have the will to do so and that everybody connected with them has the courage to face up to that challenge. All that is needed is the political will on the part of political parties to give them full backing because such venture will yield tremendous benefits for this country in times to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to note also that Irish Shipping Limited are very much involved in the Belfast/Liverpool service, the service begun on 1 May, which it is to be hoped will be availed of by many and that the high standard of efficiency of Irish Shipping Limited will be reflected on that service route.  We are all aware that Irish <Col N="1026" /> Shipping Limited's main activity, that for which they were established originally, was the operation of a fleet of deep-sea ships, which they have done extremely successfully to date.  If the board of Irish Shipping Limited feel it necessary to engage the services of some world shipping experts, I hope they will do so &mdash; I think there are many Members of this House who would so advocate &mdash; so that they may be first in their field in regard to development and planning for the years ahead.</P>
    <P>We are aware that difficulties arose in relation to freight rates not only for Irish Shipping Limited but for all other shipping interests throughout the world.  The Japanese have encountered such difficulty. That difficulty has been experienced also in the United States, all resulting from the recession within the United States and in other industrialised countries.  However, despite that recession, Irish Shipping Limited have behaved very well and have come through these difficult times with flying colours.  Indeed, that can be said even by those of us who might be inclined to be critical.  We Irish are extremely slow to praise but very quick to criticise and condemn. Were we quicker to give a clap on the back and praise, where warranted, our appreciation would undoubtedly fall on the ears of those who would give greater financial return to this country.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the recession will not continue always.  In my opinion we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Anybody who was listening to the speech by Mr. Van Lennep, Secretary of the OECD in Strasbourg recently would clearly understand that we were getting through the worst part of the world recession and that the most serious effects of it have passed.  That is why I say there will be an upsurge in activity in the bulk carrier trade in coal and heavy merchandise.  If that occurs why should Irish Shipping not get in now and be well equipped to take full advantage of the benefits that will be readily available for them at the end of the recession? The carrier trade in coal should be seriously examined.  If we are to have coal burning stations in the period up to <Col N="1027" /> 2000 the high volume of coal we have in the Leinster coalfield, in Arigna and elsewhere and the high standard anthracite we have in the Leinster coalfield and the Castlecomer and Tipperary areas may not be sufficient to keep these stations going.  Because of the possible benefits available we must look to Irish Shipping to make a serious study of Ireland's coal shipping requirements.  Such a survey is urgent, necessary and important and should be undertaken.  I hope Irish Shipping will be able to operate the bulk carrier now being built very profitably on the coal market and on the commercial end of this business.</P>
    <P>This is a most welcome opportunity for the House &mdash; I am sorry there has not been great participation in the debate &mdash; to give the Minister for Transport our views and to pay tribute to the work of his predecessor, Deputy Cooney, in regard to this matter.  We want to ensure that all Irish Ministers and Governments and all Members of the House give their fullest support in the strongest possible manner for the borrowing or raising of money by any means considered necessary for the provision of every possible resource and equipment that Irish Shipping will need for future development.</P>
    <P>Apart from participation in the Belfast-Liverpool service and in the Rosslare development, there must be new openings as yet unexplored.  I ask the Minister to give the green light to Irish Shipping to submit any proposals they feel appropriate, together with costs, so that we may look into their future.  I believe that what is preventing the submission of extension and development plans is that they are not putting on paper their full requirements because they know they will be shot down on cost. That should not prevent submission of expansion and development plans.  If world shipping experts are to be consulted, I believe it pays to consult people with experience who know the business. I am sure the services of the best experts can be obtained by Irish Shipping Limited so that they and we may know their future prospects and be in a position to provide the financial assistance they <Col N="1028" /> need.  If necessary our Government should be able fully to participate with other members of the EEC in seeing what money can be got from that source and, if it can, to get it for the benefit of Irish Shipping.  Although the EEC seems to be in a state of semi-bankruptcy, it must be that somewhere on the shelves in Brussels, Luxembourg or Strasburg there is a policy in relation to development of future deep sea carrier operations for all member states.</P>
    <P>We have a very good case to make because of the creditworthiness and extreme efficiency of Irish Shipping as well as the extreme efficiency of the Verolme Dockyard which is engaged in the construction of deep sea carriers.  I wish we had frequent debates in this House to stimulate greater interest and activity on the part of Members in regard to the work of Irish Shipping, its future progress and its proud record so that we could see how we as Parliamentarians could give them encouragement for future development. They have a very important role to play.  I wish to express high appreciation of the support which the Government are giving to Irish Shipping and the support given by the former Government. Let us not be cheeseparing.  These people are expert at their jobs.  If greater development which will yield profit is possible, let us be courageous enough to row in with them and say &ldquo;You will have the full support financially and otherwise of the Government and of Parliament in general&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBellew" hpid="Mr. Bellew Mr. Bellew">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bellew</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a brief contribution.  I do not propose, and indeed I would be unable, to follow either the eloquence or scope of Deputy Flanagan's contribution; but, as a new Deputy I want to thank him for his frankness and absolute honesty in this debate.  It was refreshing to hear his contribution and the welcome he gave to the Bill we are discussing.  I would like to join with him in welcoming this Bill.  I listened on the monitor to Deputy Desmond's contribution which I can only describe as cant and humbug.  I am amazed at the amount of unconstructive contributions this Deputy makes on many other matters as well as <Col N="1029" /> on this Bill.  He queried certain job costs involved in the construction of this bulk carrier but when he is speaking on other matters he can produce figures like a magician producing rabbits out of a hat and he never seems to be short of the answer he requires when putting any particular case.  He continuously seems to omit, deliberately or otherwise, the human factor and the care and welfare of human beings.</P>
      <P>It is very important that the House should agree to this Bill to allow the construction of this bulk carrier to go ahead to give Irish Shipping this vessel which is required for their projected commercial needs, to protect and safeguard the country's strategic needs and to give much-needed employment in our ship building industry in Verolme dockyard. Those are very worthwhile things which every Deputy should support.  I believe it would be very difficult to find a shipyard anywhere in the world which would be prepared to commit themselves to a fixed price contract for a ship of that size.  We constantly see reports in newspapers and trade magazines of the losses incurred by shipbuilding firms throughout the world on ship building contracts.  I do not see how we, as a small nation with a small ship building industry, can be any different from any of the great ship building yards around the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not unduly worried about the cost of this ship, keeping in mind that it will ensure that a considerable number of our work force will be employed on its construction and that the ship, although in its trading throughout the world may not be used in any strategic sense for the benefit of the country, will be there if a situation should arise when it is needed. It is only right that we should reflect that Irish Shipping Limited were founded because of a difficult international situation which required that we should have our own independent means of transporting essential commodities from their countries of origin to this country.  It would be tantamount to national treason to suggest that we should not keep Irish Shipping Limited as efficient as possible so that they are at all stages capable of providing the transportation of all our <Col N="1030" /> strategic materials which would be required in any situation, to ferry those commodities into our ports to keep our industries turning over and our people employed.  If we had not got Irish Shipping it is not difficult to visualise that a certain lady in another country might be confiscating any ships we depended on to send on an expedition to the South Atlantic. One can only wonder where we would be in that situation.  The Government and the Minister should be encouraged to go ahead with the financing of this particular bulk carrier and to ensure that at all times Irish Shipping have the expertise and the finance they need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I will take up the very constructive speech of Deputy Oliver Flanagan with regard to this Bill, having thanked Deputies Cooney and Desmond for their contributions.  I was very impressed by Deputy Flanagan's speech. He has the benefit of experience in the House, he knows what the situation was when he came in here for the first time, he knows how progress was made, what particular agencies and what particular companies made that progress.  He said at the start of his speech that at the beginning there was no ship flying an Irish flag supported by the Irish Government and he paid tribute to the far-seeing people who were responsible for the establishment of Irish Shipping.  This Bill is about Irish Shipping and the progress of Irish Shipping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan pointed out that the ships of this line brought credit and prestige to the country in any ports they found themselves in, apart from the fact that they were engaged in a sound commercial proposition and benefiting the country commercially as well.  The reason for bringing the Bill before the House is to give Government guarantees for certain financial arrangements.  Deputy Flanagan put his finger on it when he said that the Government were concerned when this ship was to be built that it should be built by Irish workers.  I was astounded that Deputy Barry Desmond, representing the Labour Party, could come into the House, talk about this Bill and this <Col N="1031" /> ship without once mentioning that in having it built in Verolme dockyard in Cork work was being provided for Irish workers and they were being sustained in employment as well as their families.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It was blindness on the part of Deputy Desmond that he did not think in terms of the placing of this contract at a cost which was far above what it could have been built for elsewhere as he said, but the purpose in so doing was to provide employment for the skilled people in this industry in this country rather than improving the GNP of Japan or some other country.  Deputy Oliver Flanagan saw, with his historic imagination, that the draftsmen, the engineer, the welder, the riveter and the fitter in Verolme in Cork and Cobh were entitled to get first consideration from an Irish Government and that so far as possible they should have been kept in employment. A recognition of the skills available in that area is something that is worthwhile, too.  For far too long a recognition of those skills available in this country has not been forthcoming anywhere in the world.  I recall a small matter recently whereby the Arklow yard built a boat in which a very famous sailor sailed around the world.  From reading the English papers in regard to the event one would never know that the boat had been built in Ireland by skilled Irishmen.  We must take every opportunity we can get to make work available to the skilled people in this line and that is what we are doing in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could sum up what Deputy Flanagan said in this regard by indicating my belief that Deputy Desmond was brainwashed for seven months into regarding the balancing of books as more important than the provision of work for our people.  It reminds me of a very famous occasion when a general in Sicily was addressing <Col N="1032" /> his men at the moment of truth.  He belonged to a nation that was the most seafaring nation in the world at that time. He was addressing the men before a crucial sea battle and he told them that everything depended on them because in the end it is men and not ships that make a nation.  Here we have ship making men and making a nation.  The Government, when they decided to build this ship and to finance it, were right.  It is something we should be proud of.  I am very pleased with the general optimistic and expansionary tone of Deputy Flanagan's contribution. He said, and I am making note of this and asking my officials to make note of it too, that we should be encouraging Irish Shipping Limited to expand not merely within but without &mdash; to try outside for orders in the future so that their commercial toing and froing around the world should enrich the country as it has been enriching it in the past.  In my Second Stage speech I indicated the most recent figure available from the company in terms of profits.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan referred to a number of points I made in general on Second Stage debate about developments with regard to the &ldquo;Saint Patrick&rdquo; and to the extension of the &ldquo;Saint Killian&rdquo;.  As I may have mentioned here before, I have a particular interest in &ldquo;Saint Killian&rdquo; since he was from Mullagh in County Cavan. He was killed in Wurzburg.  I regard as a tribute to the area from which he came any extension of a ship named after him. As the House knows &ldquo;Saint Columba&rdquo; was also an Ulsterman.  The &ldquo;St. Colum I&rdquo; is now plying between Belfast and Liverpool in substitution for a company which discontinued providing that service between the north-eastern part of the country and Liverpool.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan mentioned also the possibilities of development arising from studies made in the OECD and of plans available in Europe.  He finished by asking us to give the green light to Irish Shipping Limited to accept whatever proposals for development we may get from them and to consider any such proposals with the greatest possible sympathy.  That is the kind of positive contribution that we seldom get in this House.  Coming <Col N="1033" /> from a man of long experience here, a man who knows, not from textbooks, what we started from and where we have arrived at, that approach is very welcome.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Cooney's contribution, there is not to be found anywhere in my speech any implication that we are subsidising an ailing company in this exercise of guaranteeing certain borrowings with regard to the construction of the ship in question.  There is no implication that we are subsiding what Deputy Cooney said would be regarded, if we were so subsiding it, as a lame duck.  If the Deputy examines my Second Stage speech he will find that what we are doing is asking for a Government guarantee for a method of financing the Panamax carrier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an element of subsidisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be clear on one point, that is, that Irish Shipping Limited will have no heavier commitment now than the commitment they undertook at the beginning.  I can give Deputy Cooney an assurance on that.  There will be no burden placed on Irish Shipping Limited apart from the amounts thay were asked to pay in accordance with the original arrangement.  I wish to put on record also that Irish Shipping Limited are in full agreement with the arrangements being made by way of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooney said he was anxious that the company would undertake the bulk of coal carrying for the ESB.  On coming into a Department one often is not aware of everything that was done by one's predecessor and I appreciate very much what the Deputy said about his having been in touch with the ESB and indicating to them that he regarded it as desirable that Irish Shipping Limited provide the transport for the coal, presumably, to the new Moneypoint station, which will be a heavy user of coal.  Since I took office I too have written to the ESB telling them that I would regard it as more than desirable that Irish Shipping Limited carry the coal for the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, Deputy Desmond did <Col N="1034" /> not refer to the main purpose of this contract being placed with Verolme Cork Dockyard.  The contract was placed in the interest of the provision of work for the skilled people in the various categories who are available to us at Verolme. We are not forcing Irish Shipping Limited to have the vessel built there and to pay more than they would have to pay on the open competitive market.  The financial arrangements were made in order to make up the difference between what they could have got the ship built for elsewhere and what it is costing at home.  What we are doing in this Bill is getting a Government guarantee for certain financial arrangements in order to enable this to happen.  Again, I emphasise that there is no extra burden being placed on Irish Shipping Limited.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond was in doubt as to whether the Government were providing the £90 million by way of equity for the various State companies that are in need of equity.  I can assure him that we are providing this money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the Minister be announcing the division of the money as between the various companies?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The thing is supposed to be all about precisely what I dealt with in my Second Stage speech, with special reference to the most important area as far as I am concerned &mdash; it was ignored totally by Deputy Desmond &mdash; and that relates to the provision of employment for Irish citizens with skills.  Deputy Cooney <Col N="1035" /> asked me to state what disbursement has taken place up to now.  I should like to tell him that £1.42 million of State equity was provided to get things launched.  Irish Shipping Limited have spent £10 million since then and they got that by way of bridging loan in agreement with the Minister for Finance and pending finalisation of the leasing arrangements. State equity, a loan and a subsidy was the original proposal.  Privatisation was proposed later and that involved leasing funds from the private sector to take the place of State funding.  The negotiations are very delicate and we cannot give details at this stage until the arrangements are finalised but full details will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in due course.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise that the funding as now proposed is as favourable to Irish Shipping Limited as was originally proposed.  It has the full agreement of the company.  Today all speakers paid tribute to the commercial, business and financial expertise of the company and I am sure that if they agree to the proposal before the House there is no way that the arrangements can be impugned.  The original funding was to be £7.1 million equity and the balance by way of a subsidy. The cost is now estimated to be in the region of £28 million.  The £10 million temporary borrowing and £1.42 State equity has been spent already.  The proposed financing is an arrangement with financial institutions to put up the full cost of the vessel which will be repaid by leasehold payments over a period of approximately 12 years.  Those arrangements have not been finalised as yet but full details of them will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas when that has been done.  I should like to thank the Deputies for their contributions.  We know we are supporting a company of which we can be proud.  Deputy Cooney, a former Minister, will agree that it is very consoling to have representatives of a company not looking for money but for ways of making more profit.</P>

      <P>Has all the £10 million been expended by Irish Shipping Limited in relation to payments to Verolme? That is the reason why I queried <Col N="1037" /> the financial structures of the payment of the £28 million for this bulk carrier and the House is entitled to know precisely what we are entering into.  It appears &mdash; I have no previous knowledge of the arrangements &mdash; that £1.42 million of State equity money is being provided and I presume it has by now been transferred to Verolme as payment for work done since the contract was signed in February 1981 and since completion date is December 1982.  I presume that the £10 million has been paid over.  Am I correct in my assumption that so far this ship has had expended payments on it of £11.42 million?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;unduly.  Could I make the point that a bridging loan of £10 million has been obtained.  Bridging finance even for a State company, is extraordinarily expensive in these high interest rate times.  That has, presumably, been paid over to Verolme by now at the half way stage.  How much has it cost?  I alleged initially that it was mostly on intuition rather than the real facts as emerging.  It seemed, on the basis of the original arrangement which was put to this House, that in December 1980 the ship was going to cost £25 million.  £14 million was being funded &mdash; if you like &mdash; by Irish Shipping, by way of £7 million equity and £7 million by borrowing &mdash; £7.1 million in each case to be exact&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1039" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the State was giving a direct £11 million subsidy of State subvention to Verolme.  What do Verolme get at the heel of the hunt out of all of this at the end of the construction period?  What is the State's subvention to that company at the end of all of this?  I ask this as one who has a deep interest, I can assure the Minister, in the future of the shipyard, like my former colleague, Labour spokesman Deputy Corish who, in December 1980, welcomed the proposed construction at Verolme.</P>
      <P>However, I am a firm believer that if anything is going to be built in this country, whether it be a fertiliser factory, a bulk carrier, an ESB power station, or an airport, or whatever we build, we must know, appreciate and understand the true cost of what we are doing.  That is the thrust of my argument.  I would like to know the true cost here.  Apparently, a degree of leasing banking funds will be made available and, the Minister has disclosed, repaid over a period of 12 years. Apparently, the arrangements are not yet finalised and I appreciate that there are degrees of confidentiality, that when the Department of Finance enter into, or guarantee legal arrangements, we do not want all the details trotted out for everyone to have an analysis of them.  The State here in the Dáil guarantees £28 million at the top.  We have already put in £1.42 million of State equity.  We are entitled to know where exactly the money is going.  Otherwise joint committees, State-sponsored bodies and public accounts committees are all irrelevant. We will be talking in two or three years' time as to what happened.  It would be good to know now.  I support the Minister. Let us finish matters up, but let us know what we are doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what Deputy Desmond has said, that probity and clarity are important in so far as the financing of these areas are concerned.  He proceeds to list a number of ventures and as far as I can see, an attempt at guilt by association is being made.  The fact is that the <Col N="1040" /> figure as given originally by Deputy Desmond are the correct figures.  He said £7.1 million, £7.1 million and £11 million.  As of now, the estimate is £28 million and the interest paid during construction will be included in the lease, which is normal practice in this case.  What I can tell him now, as firmly as can be said at this stage, is that we are dealing with £28 million and we are dealing with guarantees in this Bill because we were instructed by the Attorney General that we did not have any powers with regard to Irish Shipping without taking these steps.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the sum which is going to be put up by this consortium to buy the ship, the Minister says that we will not know the sum total until all the bills are in.  Is that what he is saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I dare say that the Deputy will agree that even in building a small room as an addition to this House, an exact figure of the final cost cannot be given before work commences.  We are giving a figure as tight as it is possible to estimate as of now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the rent &mdash; as we will call it &mdash; which the consortium will get for the vessel has it been decided how much Irish Shipping will pay and how much the State will pay, or the percentages or proportions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question is how much the State will pay and how much Irish Shipping will pay.  What we have told Irish Shipping and what I have told the House in reply to the debate is that Irish Shipping will find the financial arrangements as good as originally outlined. What has now been referred to by Deputy Desmond has been referred to already in this House.  In other words, Irish Shipping will not have to pay any more than under the original estimate. That is why Irish Shipping are in total agreement with the arrangements put before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us <Col N="1041" /> what the arrangements are and how much it will cost?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The original, as Deputy Desmond has said was £7.1 million equity, £7.1 million loan.  That was the limit of their responsibility under the original agreement and that will be the limit of their responsibility under the new arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Shipping might not have any liability at all under the equity, unless they had profits to remunerate the equity.  The loan from Shipping Finance Corporation would involve them in repayments, we can understand that. Surely it is possible for the Minister to calculate a notional return on the £7.1 million equivalent of equity which will now be in the funds provided by the consortium?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will have gathered from what I have said already, the original commitment was for £7.1 million loan.  The terms of the loan were 8 per cent for 8 years.  As I have stated, there is no deterioration in the conditions from the original arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies could make a rough calculation.  I cannot be held tightly, but if you take 12 by three you will be roughly right.  The current charge will be about £3 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the House that the actual arrangements have not been finalised.  I have given the Deputy the only figures I can in present circumstances. It is over a 12-year period.  It will be a charge to current account which will be subscribed annually, and as far as Irish Shipping are concerned the terms will not be a disimprovement on the arrangements originally proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to get the operation under way, Irish Shipping had <Col N="1043" /> to take out a £10 million bridging loan. Presumably they have had to meet the interest charges on the bridging loan and that is radically different from the proposal of December 1980 when they had to take a £7 million equity stake and had to borrow £7 million.  Then they got a £10 million bridging loan with which to build a ship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that has been repaid to them, with interest, by the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>But the State will carry the interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>What we want to know is how much it will mean in the Book of Estimates next year, how much it will cost?  Will it be £3 million or £12 million?  I do not want the House to misapprehend because when we look at the Irish Shipping accounts for 1983-84 it will be easy for people to stand up here and get hammered, being told that the workers in Cork would be losing their jobs.  The workers in Cork, riveting the ship today should know the cost and the way the costs will be repaid.  It will be over a short term, but in 12 years the ship will be on the high seas carrying steel, timber or coal, it will not be a supertanker class, and it will have to be earning an enormous capital return to be a profitable venture for Irish Shipping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Desmond should not have any worries about people's views on the financing of the ship.  He is entitled to probe in detail any expenditure being made, he is entitled to probe all the financial arrangements for the building of the ship.  The only criticism I make of him is that he is not entitled to take other things into account.  The arrangements that are being made, and they have not been finalised, do not put me in a position to say that £X or $X will have to be repaid annually.  I gave a figure of £3 million as a kind of indication, but <Col N="1044" /> the lease will be at variable interest rates and that makes it difficult to do exact sums.  It will depend on international rates at given times.  I cannot give the House figures as if I were reading from a minute.  The Minister for Finance and the Irish Shipping board are making the arrangements at the moment.  The matter has reached a stage when they are in total accord and are well pleased with the way things are going.  Irish Shipping will not be worse off financially out of the deal than they were out of the original deal proposed to them.  I should like to be able to read out the exact figure year by year.</P>

      <P>In regard to the general principles behind this, of the so-called privatisation which is referred to in the memorandum which the Minister gave us, I have no objection to such movement into the private sector to get money to ease out the Eschequer requirements. However, when a guarantee such as this is involved and the Minister says such a guarantee takes it outside the ambit of the Exchequer borrowing requirement, I suggest that he does not take it strictly outside the ambit of the public sector borrowing requirement.  It is not quite frank to suggest that this will ease the Exchequer requirement.  The total Exchequer liability will not be diminished by this arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy appreciates that involving the private sector in projects like this one is worth while. I am sure he realises that everything must be paid for.  Nobody denies that.  When money can be made available for worthwhile projects it should be availed of. That is what we are doing.  I understand negotiations were going ahead during the Minister's period of office and, having been advised by the legal people to that effect, we are giving legislative statutory backing to the whole process.  I should like to say how appreciative I am of the contributions which were made in the House.  I regard it as important to have people who probe and try to clarify financial arrangements in such a way that the public may be satisfied that money is being provided for a very worthwhile project for a company who have served <Col N="1049" /> the country well as was so eloquently stated by Deputy Flanagan.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that while it is technically correct to use the phrase &ldquo;special financial arrangement&rdquo; and while he indicated it is outside the Exchequer borrowing requirement, it may convey to the public some blessing on the concept of privatisation which we strenuously contested over the last two or three years?  The Minister will recall that former Ministers for Finance, Deputies Colley and O'Kennedy, indicated to us that the Attorney General need have no worries and that strictures laid down by him in relation to borrowing incurred under privatisation was purely a myth being perpetuated by Opposition Deputies at the time.  It was indicated that the correct approach was being followed now.  There is a public sector borrowing requirement which is of major concern in relation to job creation and capital projects of this nature.  It is not merely the question of the Exchequer borrowing requirement which is involved.</P>

One point I made to him was that I hoped that this aspect would not cannibalise all other aspects so that he would leave out all other considerations. With regard to the reference to previous Ministers for Finance, I do not recall the instance to which he refers.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Bill, its necessity was pointed out to us by the Attorney General and it was because of that we brought it before the House.  I am grateful to the House for putting it through all stages.  There were such powers already in existence with regard to CIE.  We have now gone most of the way towards providing such powers for Irish Shipping and I thank the House for doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>European Association of Programmes in Health Services Studies (Corporate Status) Order, 1982 &mdash; a copy of which Order in draft form was laid before Dáil Éireann in 1980.</P>
      <P>This draft order is being made under the International Health Bodies (Corporate Status) Act, 1971.  The only other corporate status order that has been made under the Act is the International Federation of Voluntary Health Services Funds (Corporate Status) Order, 1971.</P>
      <P>The association has now established a permanent secretariat in Dublin.  The order sought will enable the association to be incorporated in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The European Association of Programmes in Health Services Studies was established in 1966.  It consists of 29 corporate members from 13 countries. These members are universities and institutes with educational, training and/or research programmes in health administration or health services studies.  The Institute of Public Administration is the Irish corporate member of the association. Membership of the association is also open to individuals, associates and honorary members.  It is a charitable non-profit-making organisation.</P>
      <P>The aims and objectives of the association are to promote collaboration between European countries in the organisation and conduct of educational and training programmes in health services studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The association arranges for information to be exchanged, organises study visits, encourages studies and research and runs an annual symposium and workshop for faculty of its corporate members. It has, in co-operation with the <Col N="1051" /> World Health Organisation, and on its own initiative, conducted surveys and issued reports on training in health services and hospital administration in Europe.</P>
    <P>The scale of the association's activities has, however, been restricted by lack of resources.  During the past year, however, the W. K. Kellogg Foundation in the USA made a grant of £174,000, to the Institute of Public Administration on behalf of the association.  The grant, which is to extend over a period of four years, is to enable the association to reach its full potential in fostering co-operation in education and training for the health services.  The grant will be used to pay for a full-time director and secretariat; to organise symposia and study teams e.g. to upgrade curricula; to arrange faculty development fellowships on a basis of exchange within Europe and between Europe and North America; and to support visits for study purposes.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the association is a body that should be welcomed to this country and its status is such that I consider the corporate status order should be approved.  I have, in accordance with the Act, consulted the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism and he has no objection to granting corporate statute to this body.  I have consulted the Minister for Finance and he has no objection to the proposal on the understanding that it involves no commitment for the Exchequer to provide financial assistance for this body.  I have no proposal before me to give financial assistance to this body.  Should the question arise in future years, the matter will be taken up with the Department of Finance.  I have consulted the Minister for the Public Service and Foreign Affairs and they have no objections.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, commend this resolution to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support the making of this order and the granting of corporate status to the European Association of Programmes in Health Services Studies.  The aims as outlined by the Minister are to promote collaboration <Col N="1052" /> between European countries in the organisation of conduct of education and training programmes in health services studies.  This is a very commendable aim which deserves credit and support.  There are 13 countries involved and our country is represented at this point by the IPA, but it is interesting to note that membership is also open to individuals.  The value of this for individuals and organisations associated with studies into training in the health services is unquestionable. That in this case the demand on the Exchequer will be virtually nil is obviously an extra attraction and the association, who have established themselves here in Dublin, are to be commended for their initiative in gaining the kind of funds from the Kellogg Foundation that will enable them to expand their activities, to set up a directorate and to expand the secretariat which is already established.  The new phase of their activity which will see increased activity in this area is to be welcomed.  Certainly many of our health services could benefit from the cross-reference with the experiences of other countries where advances ahead of ours have been made or where we might like to avoid repeating experiences they have had.</P>
      <P>I would indicate one area where there is a great need for training development in this country, and that is the training of child care workers who themselves have identified a great need for development. The European Association of Programmes in Health Services Studies may fill the gap in this area and expand understanding of the need for development in training.</P>
      <P>I am happy to support the making of this order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health has recommended this resolution to the House and I am sure, and we accept his word, that no risks are involved in relation to the European Association of Programmes in Health Services Studies. The European association was established in 1966 and this is the first occasion on which we have had anything official about this association in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a few questions for the attention <Col N="1053" /> of the Minister.  I would give a cautious welcome to the association simply because I do not know very much about them and for that reason I accept the Minister's recommendation to the House for approval.  In Europe a movement in relation to world and European population growth is growing steadily.  Here we find that, while the great problem of providing food, clothing and shelter for the steadily growing population exists, European movements and organisations are recommending for study ways and means of restricting population growth.  Ireland is one of the countries in Europe that can take pride in having a steady growth in population and the fact that we have a higher proportion of people under 30 years of age than most other European countries.  In Strasbourg recently my attention was directed to the increasing trend towards the promotion of family planning.  The methods of family planning advocated in most European states are not, in my opinion, to be recommended for this country, but I am expressing only my views for the record on the motion now before the House.  I have studied a document circulated to parliamentarians in Europe relating to the grave concern of European states at the growth of the population.  An atheistic view is adopted that European states should consider ways and means of bringing about a steady decrease in the present rate of population growth.  One of these is research into various forms of contraception and the application of what they describe as modern methods of contraception and contraceptives.  It is well that this association be forewarned in relation to family planning.  The vast majority of people in this country are prepared to take only very cautious steps in this connection. If this association are to carry out this research and these surveys and investigations I hope that it will be borne in mind by all 13 countries referred to by the Minister that we have a certain quality of life in this country, perhaps not as good as we would wish, but we have a rich heritage.  I am glad that the question of abortion will be dealt with by a referendum, I hope during the present year, and that for all time the result of that referendum <Col N="1054" /> will show our concern for the protection of human life and of the unborn child.  It is right that we should make it clear to all and sundry, particularly in relation to investigations which will be undertaken by this movement in relation to population growth, that we want to have a frequent opportunity of discussing their progress and their reports and to comment accordingly.</P>
    <P>Study which has been done in Europe in relation to the curbing of population is not only designed in pagan fashion but designed to restrict the greatest gift which God can give, the gift of human life and the gift of maintaining and preserving life.  I am glad that the Government have decided to hold a referendum in relation to abortion because we will be enabled to proclaim with a loud voice to Europe and the world that the Irish people are prepared to defend the great gift of human life, the dignity of human life and respect for human life from the moment of conception to the grave.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that this organisation will devote all their studies to devising a remedy for the growth in population but I am advising them to be cautious in what they apply to Ireland and advising them also that our membership and approval of this movement does not commit us to any recommendation they may make as a result of research or surveys.</P>
    <P>We recommend that this association concerned with health should give more thought to the necessity for cancer research.  This country contributes next to nothing for cancer research and it is extraordinary that vast numbers of our people are dying each day from two diseases, cancer and heart diseases of various forms.  If research is to be undertaken, can we expect to receive from this association information as to the part we can play in preventive measures in relation to cancer?  We have some of Europe's best cancer experts and they have revealed that most forms of cancer can be cured in the early stages.  Can we expect this association to supply the necessary data to bring about a greater public awareness of measures to be taken for the prevention of cancer?  Can they also state what amount is being contributed <Col N="1055" /> by Europe as a unit for world research into a cure for cancer, a disease which is responsible for depriving mothers and fathers of their children?  It is alarming that in recent years very young children have been dying from cancer.  They cannot be said to have developed the disease as a result of smoking because children of such tender years do not smoke.  I have detailed the kinds of information we would be grateful to receive.  We should also like to know what forms of cancer are hereditary.</P>
    <P>People should be more familiar with cancer and preventive measures should be known to every citizen.  Schools should give instruction in preventive measures and cancer should be freely spoken of without fear so that we can wage war on this horrid disease which is killing so many of our people.</P>
    <P>The expertise of our cancer experts can be associated with the very best but their expertise and the results of research will be to no avail unless the relevant information penetrates every home and unless the knowledge is imparted to each citizen. I hope we will hear more from this association about cancer research, that the personnel and the secretariat of the organisation will be available to various organisations concerned with health and that they will also supply relevant statistics to individuals and groups.</P>
    <P>Such an association will be able to obtain statistics relating to the dangers of smoking.  I say to the Minister that no Department is more vital than his and every penny spent on health propaganda and publicity is a sound investment.  I hope that this association will be able to give us the results of their research into the effects of smoking which has been carried out since 1966.  I refer to cigarette, cigar and pipe smoking which I believe are responsible to a large degree for cancer. Those who are dying from lung cancer are mainly pipe and cigarette smokers. There must be some move by some group in the interests of public health to sound a note of warning about smoking. I should like the Minister to give us some information about what this association have been doing in Europe since 1966 in <Col N="1056" /> relation to this matter.  Will the establishment of a secretariat in Dublin help to educate people about the causes of cancer and heart disease and how those diseases might be prevented?  Any move in this area would be a help in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be said about Dr. Browne, a former Member of this House, he has one thing to his credit, because he was the person who courageously tackled the problem of tuberculosis.  He arranged for the building of sanitoria and the provision of beds for people whom I saw dying in hovels in my constituency and elsewhere.  In the 1945-47 period they had not a pillow on which to rest their heads until Dr. Browne undertook to tackle the serious problem of tuberculosis. Because that disease was tackled at that time by a courageous young Minister the result was satisfactory.  Now the Minister for Health has an opportunity of leading the way in relation to dealing with heart disease and cancer in the same way that Dr. Browne had in 1948.</P>
    <P>Research is necessary to deal with the problem of alcoholism.  As a country we must try to cut our high consumption of spirits.  Our mental hospitals are crowded with alcoholics.  Any information from this association on how to deal with this problem will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The association is to report on health administration.  Members of this House know that the health boards are top heavy with officials and the bulk of money being provided by this House for health services is going on administration and bureaucracy instead of spending the money on the sick, the aged and on those people who want to be restored to health. It is about time we considered the whole question of health administration from the point of view of the taxpayers.  We should compare the clumsy administrative means by which health boards are administered with the way the county health authorities administered the health services many years ago.  I do not know if the present system is the right one, any more than if the system in the past was right, but it is no harm to study the whole question of health administration. I know that a considerable amount <Col N="1057" /> is needed for the health services but I do not think we should spend so much on administration and any savings under this heading must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>It is my view that the association should educate the Irish people on how to eat and drink.  Our eating habits are wrong and our drinking habits are disastrous. The Irish do not know how to drink.  We mix drink and we take drink on an empty stomach.  We eat the wrong foods.  Here is an opportunity to educate the people about the foods they should avoid, such as white bread and white sugar.  They should be encouraged to use brown sugar and brown bread.  They should have a balanced diet with vegetables and fruits. If we consume the right type of foods our population will have better health standards. If this association guide us on this way I would be all for it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement of the Minister. However, I am more cautious about welcoming the European association until I read more about them and see some results.  If they carry out research and studies, that would be welcomed. They will be given an encouraging hand so long as they do not force on us recommendations that may be alien to our way of life and to our long-standing traditions.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputies for their contributions.  I will see to it that the association hear of the views expressed by Deputy Flaherty and Deputy Flanagan. Deputy Flaherty emphasised the need for co-ordination of training programmes in respect of the health services. This is one of the areas in which the association will be involved.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan issued a word of caution and he was concerned that Ireland's position should be clearly seen by the association.  He referred to the fact that we have had a steady growth in population, something of which we are all very proud and glad to see, and he expressed his concern from what he hears about Europe in relation to suggestions that a population might be reduced as a means of curing some of the present difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to endorse what has been <Col N="1058" /> said in this House.  We plan to bring in a constitutional amendment by referendum to provide against abortion.  Deputy Flanagan was concerned about this.  I want it to go out loud and clear from this House what is our intention as a Government. We intend to provide in our Constitution a clear right to life for the unborn so that this position will be clearly stated.  We intend to do this very early: it will be done this year.  I wish to give Deputy Flanagan that assurance.  We recognise the danger, which is one to which he has referred, of not putting an amendment into our Constitution.  I support the views put forward by the society which is pressing for the protection of the unborn child.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan raised the question of cancer research and the great urgency for co-operation in this area.  I agree with what he says about this because this area must be tackled very vigorously on an international basis.  He referred to Dr. Browne's achievements in clearing up tuberculosis.  The original tubercular bacillus was discovered in 1882 and that provided the basis for the identification of the bacillus.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to go into the other points raised by Deputy Flanagan, but we have recently established a bone marrow for leukemia unit on cancer and we will pursue that.  I am sure the association will take the deputy's views into account.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Quinn on Tuesday, 11 May 1982:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give a second reading to the Bill</P>
    <P>(i)  in view of the probability that its provisions are repugnant to the Constitution;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1059" /> (ii)  because of the actions which the Government have taken in the Budget to ensure that a major part of the increased value of development land will accrue to the public through the substantially increased capital gains taxes on disposals of such land; and</P>
    <P>(iii)  because the Government intend to take whatever additional measures may be necessary to ensure that land is made available to local authorities for development free of any element of speculative gains, in line with the aims of the Kenny report, and to review the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 and 1976 in regard to the zoning of land by local authorities and the operation of Section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955 in relation to planning decisions.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I outlined the difficulty I had, the faults I found in the Minister's amendment and I picked up some of the points he made in his speech to which I had some objection.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an attempt to deal with an element of the most serious social problem facing any Government and this Oireachtas that it is possible to imagine. We are talking about a proportion of the cost of what is for the vast majority of married couples &mdash; and I am particularly concerned about married couples tonight &mdash; and single people the biggest investment of their lives: purchasing a house. Deputy Quinn estimated that the cost of the site was about 25 per cent of the cost of the house.  Successive Governments since the foundation of the State have endeavoured by various means to encourage people to buy their own houses, and the balance of the population were catered for by the State providing the houses and letting them at a subsidised rent.  In that sense the State are caught in the net of exorbitant site costs for their own housing programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on a number of occasions, the <Col N="1060" /> house purchased most cheaply is the house for which cash is paid.  The minority of the population who have enough money to buy their own houses are not caught in the same way as the rest of us who have to borrow money to purchase our houses.  When a person purchases a house over an extended period, the house may be very much dearer when it is finally paid for because of the high interest charges, but that is something else.</P>
    <P>Various efforts have been made over the past 15 years to deal with this problem by various Governments, by Fianna Fáil who commissioned the Kenny Report and two Coalition Governments.  As the Minister acknowledged last night we had the last Attorney General looking at this problem and on two occasions the Labour Party have listed for Second Reading a Bill to control the cost of building land.  I am sure the Independent Deputies are equally concerned about this matter.  Any Member who holds a clinic to which young people come who are purchasing their own houses will recognise the financial strain under which these young people live.  We should ensure that that strain is not added to by the high cost of the site.</P>
    <P>We all recognise that something must be done about the cost of the sites.  I am referring particularly to land on the outskirts of expanding urban areas where, through a fortuitous accident of birth or maybe somebody inheriting land or having a farm, a person gets a windfall profit from the sale of that land.  I question the word &ldquo;windfall&rdquo; in this case.</P>
    <P>The danger of legislating in this area is that, willy-nilly, people who do not want to sell or who do not want to make a very big profit will be pulled into the net.  In justice, they must be given a price for their land which would allow them to move, if necessary, out of their present holdings and establish themselves in another area without loss, and &ldquo;loss' includes disturbance and any other costs incurred.  We would all love to see caught the speculator who deliberately buys land and holds it in the hope of making a big profit.  They are the people we must get.</P>
    <P>As I said, everybody agrees that something <Col N="1061" /> should be done to solve this problem and all Governments have attempted to do something and failed.  I suggest that the way forward is not to be continually kicking this subject around like a political football, because I do not believe any Deputy is less concerned than another, but to pool our talents and brains to solve the problem.  The time has come to set up a committee of this House composed of Members from all sides so that we can bring forward legislation acceptable to all and which would not be doubtful from a constitutional point of view, as the Minister alleges Deputy Quinn's Bill is.</P>
    <P>After 15 years we would be less than fair to the people we say we are so concerned about if we did not adopt a common approach towards solving this problem. I ask the proposers of the Bill, the Labour Party, to withdraw the Bill, and the Minister to withdraw his amendment. Let us set up a committee and guarantee that, when we come back here again to debate this very important social problem, we will have legislation which will go through the House and be acceptable to all sides of the House, and will solve this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is now mainly an urban society.  The process of urbanisation and urban renewal plays an important part in the quality of life enjoyed by our citizens.  As part of the solution to this problem, it is vitally important that the State and the local authorities should have power to control the price of land required for housing and other forms of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing is an essential social necessity, and it is the statutory duty of the State to ensure that families are provided with houses in which to make their homes. Untold harm is being done to Irish family life by reason of the fact that very often <Col N="1062" /> young married couples have to live in temporary dwellings, in overcrowded conditions with in-laws, or as tenants of unscrupulous landlords.  The family is the basis of society in Ireland.  It is not recognised that breakdowns in marriage can be attributed to the fact that it takes so long for local authorities to provide adequate housing.  Very often this delay is caused by the difficulty experienced by local authorities in acquiring land for housing.</P>
    <P>In January 1971 the Government set up a committee which submitted what became known as the Kenny Report. Their terms of reference were: (1) To consider in the interests of the common good possible measures for (a) controlling the price of land required for housing and other forms of development, (b) ensuring that all or a substantial part of the increase in the value of land attributable to the decisions and operations of public authorities (including, in particular, decisions and operations relating to the provision of sewerage and water schemes by local authorities) shall be secured for the benefit of the community. (2) To report on the merits and demerits of any measures considered, with particular reference to their legal and administrative practicability.  (3) To advise on what changes in the present law may be required to give effect to any measures recommended.  That was proper and correct and nobody could disagree with it.</P>
    <P>In or around that period the price of land began to soar, very often by reason of the fact that the local authorities provided services such as water, sewerage, drainage and re-zoning facilities.  Then came the racketeers.  Possibly we have the same situation at local level, but the problem may not be as great as it is in the metropolis.  What happened?  Ken Rowan came back to Ireland with £8,000. Today he is a millionaire twice over.  Last year it was reported in all the papers that &ldquo;wealthy landlords in Dublin stand to grab £110 million over the next few days as their lands are re-zoned for housing and factories&rdquo;.  Under this deal &mdash; and I will mention the name; and this was announced publicly as well &mdash; Gerry Jones sold his farm of 190 acres, which he <Col N="1063" /> bought for £60,000 19 years ago, for £7½ million.  Gallagher was in trouble with the banks recently because he failed to sell property which he bought with £10 million borrowed from the State company Irish Life.  He could have picked up £5 million of the taxpayers' money. Patrick Gallagher whose firm are now in receivership has been described as playing monopoly with the streets of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The policy pursued by successive Governments in the past was to encourage people to move from the rural to the urban areas.  A growing population with increasing numbers of young married couples concentrated in urban areas provides a strong potential source of upward pressure on land prices in those areas; hence the need for a policy to control the price of the land.</P>
    <P>The Kenny majority report put forward suggested methods for dealing with the disproportionate increase in the price of serviced and potential building land. The failure of successive Governments to implement the recommendations in the report which could be said only to be in the interest of the common good is an example of the powerful lobby and influence of the people of wealth and property.</P>
    <P>If it is contended that the enactment of legislation and its implementation could be repugnant to the Constitution, I should like to point out that Article 43.2.1.º states:</P>
    <P>The State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice.</P>
    <P>It is about time that the Government moved towards a policy of social justice. The best way to gain experience of this whole matter is to be a member of a local authority.  Members of local authorities look to the central Government for the right decisions to enable them to do their work: the provision of services, housing being a priority.  I said earlier that untold harm was being done to Irish family life by reason of the fact that young married couples have not got adequate housing <Col N="1064" /> accommodation and have to live in circumstances which cause marriage breakdowns in some instances.  As members of local authorities from time to time we have all exerted pressure on local officials to acquire land, to build up a land bank so that that land would be available for housing when the need arose.  Of course the need is there always.</P>
    <P>Some years ago there was a restriction imposed by central Government on the amount of land a local authority could acquire.  That was bad enough in itself but recently &mdash; and it rather surprised me &mdash; the Minister issued what appeared to me to be a regulation or an order taken down from the shelves, the dust being shaken off, and sent to local authorities telling their managers that they or their officials, whether they be architects, engineers or others, dare not buy land until such time as an inspector from the Department of the Environment had carried out an inspection.  I say to the Minister that he should withdraw that order immediately, that it makes no sense whatever for the simple reason that we know full well that local managers, their engineers and architects or land purchase officers will carry out that task efficiently. What they require is the capital to so do. But to maintain that the high cost of local authority housing can be attributed to the fact that in the first instance, in the purchase of land, local authorities did not take certain factors into consideration does not stand up.  I shall be pleased if the Minister will state that he will withdraw that order straight away, at least allowing local authority officials to proceed with their mandatory task of acquiring land, developing that land and preparing it for housing, without having to await inspection by an official of the Department before they conclude any deal.</P>
    <P>We heard also that it was the policy of the Department of the Environment to have a devolved housing programme. Can anybody maintain that we have a devolved housing programme when a local authority must submit each proposed scheme to be scrutinised for its unit cost?  One might contend that this has not to do entirely with the Bill we are discussing. <Col N="1065" /> I contend that it has because there are enough problems to be overcome by local authorities in the acquisition of land without having them hamstrung by regulations such as that issued recently by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>This Bill could be deemed to constitute a half-way measure in giving some guidelines to local authorities on this most important question, that of enabling them to designate and acquire land.  It is our policy in The Workers' Party to demand the full implementation of the recommendations of the Kenny Report which we see as the only solution to this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-Central):</i> The debate on this Bill would appear to me to be unnecessarily taking up the time of this House.  The handful of Members present &mdash; looking at the total absence of Members on the benches across the House &mdash; indicates the sincerity on the part of the Labour Party who are promoting the Bill.  Of course we heard from Deputy Peter Barry that this Bill was not being supported by Fine Gael, which verifies what I have said, that it is purely a time-wasting exercise particularly when one considers that the very same Bill, in every detail, was introduced in this House in 1980 by Deputy Quinn.  It was debated over a period of four days, I think in the month of June 1980, was supported only by Labour Deputies but not supported by the Fine Gael Party. Indeed, no member of the Fine Gael Party even contributed to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, I might point out that that was not so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady (Dublin North-Central) Mr. Brady (Dublin North-Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-Central):</i> In concluding the debate on that occasion Deputy Quinn conceded that the Bill was not perfect and that quite a number of alterations would be required before the Fine Gael Party might consider supporting or accepting it at any time.  Yet we have the situation now in which the very same Bill has been re-introduced in this House by the same Deputy, again not obtaining support from Coalition colleagues. <Col N="1066" /> All that happened two years ago.  I should have thought that two years was sufficiently long for the Labour Party, had they been sincere in their efforts, to effect the alterations Deputy Quinn admitted were then required.</P>
      <P>One can only conclude that this Bill is a convenient exercise, perhaps because of the pending by-election.  Fianna Fáil have always prided themselves on being the party of reality.  Our approach always has been to effect social and economic change on a progressive basis, indeed not to adopt any radical schemes which might sound fine in theory but which, in practice, might carry all sorts of unforeseen circumstances or results.</P>
      <P>It would appear to me that the programme outlined in this House by the Minister for the Environment last evening is fully consistent with the Fianna Fáil approach over the years.  We must remember that the land market and the building industry constitute major elements of our economic development and that any ill-considered action which might upset them certainly would cause severe hardship and difficulties in relation to all aspects of house ownership, house building and the construction industry generally.  Therefore it is necessary to move extremely carefully in this area, as the Minister suggested last evening. We must also ensure that any action we might take would not render it even more difficult for people to house themselves by drying up the supply of building land and sites, or by driving up the price of such land or sites.  We must ensure that any remedial action we might take is not of a kind that would involve a great deal more bureaucracy with more money being spent on staffing and administrative costs than on the actual land purchase. Indeed this was the result of one effort made in Britain in the sixties to introduce a system such as Deputy Quinn seemed to have, in mind in re-introducing this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last evening Deputy Quinn spoke of what he saw as self-imposed constraints which prevent us from dealing adequately with the problem of building land which, he said, in turn did nothing for the common wellbeing of the vast majority <Col N="1067" /> of our people.  I wonder if this is really the case.  How many of us would like to envisage a situation in which local councils, local officials, the Minister or his officials could decide which landowners should be singled out and given the honour of becoming public benefactors, as Deputy Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan-Monaghan)</i> described the situation under this Bill when it was introduced in 1980? I do not think this Bill and its provisions could be said to be for the common good especially as we have here a very high proportion of people who own land in some form or other.  Deputies should not be fooled into thinking that this Bill applies only to large tracts of development land owned by some faceless people, or some faceless company because that is not the case at all.  The Bill will enable local authorities to acquire existing dwellings, offices, shops, factories and indeed buildings used for social purposes provided, in the opinion of the local authority, they are essential for the overall development of the area or that they are under-utilised in some form or other.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires that where a local authority applies the provisions of the Bill only the current use value should be paid for any of this kind of property rather than the open market value.  This seems to be giving really savage powers to local authorities.  We have the greatest respect for those who serve on local councils and for local officials, but I wonder how anybody could seriously propose to impose this kind of responsibility on them.  It would be grossly unfair and unjust to the people concerned, to the officials and members of the local councils.  The local government system would end up in chaos and be brought into total disrepute.  It would lose the support it now enjoys among the local community.  That I think would be a sad day for the country.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Barry spoke for 20 minutes on behalf of Fine Gael but in that time he did not say a word about the provisions of the Bill we are debating. Tonight he spoke for about eight minutes and devoted most of the time to the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1068" /> Last night he said he was intrigued by the Minister's speech.  I was even more puzzled at Deputy Barry's contribution and his ability to talk for so long without actually dealing with the legislation before us.  Surely it is no accident that the Deputy managed to avoid for so long any reference to the Bill.  He made some small reference to it tonight &mdash; that the Fine Gael Party could not support the Bill.  This is exactly the same stance which that party took in 1980.  Could it be that Deputy Barry and members of his party are faced with a situation in which they found the Minister's approach far more to their liking than Deputy Quinn's Bill but he could not bring himself to say that? Fine Gael have been in Government for half the period since the Kenny Report was published.  They did nothing to implement the report and have not proposed any alternative.</P>

        <i>(Dublin North-Central):</i> The Minister's speech last night showed that the Government are serious about taking measures to deal with the problem in line with the aims of the Kenny Report. The Minister went to some trouble to spell out the approaches that are being actively considered and he explained what has been done already.  This is surely a more honest approach than that adopted last night by Deputy Barry.  It would seem that the party wants to run with the hare and chase with the hounds. Governments cannot do this and Fianna Fáil Governments have always behaved in a very constructive manner and are certainly not prepared to govern in that fashion.  I am confident that the Minister for the Environment, with the support of the Government, can be relied on to produce a constructive programme, an action programme in relation to the whole matter of building land.</P>
      <P>The present Bill was obviously introduced to bolster up the declining fortunes of the Labour Party when the by-election is being fought.  Our society has always accepted the right of private ownership of property.  Our Constitution enshrines that.</P>

I say this because Deputy Quinn's Bill is potentially the most discriminatory piece of legislation to come before the House in my time as a Deputy. It specifically requires local authorities to designate special areas of land in their functional area and state that in these designated areas a different pricing system will apply while in the undesignated area the present free market system will operate.  Is this the Labour Party's idea of treating all citizens equally and giving equal rights to all?  The group of people who would be most affected by Deputy Quinn's proposals are the small farmers &mdash; I am quite sure Deputy L'Estrange will be concerned for them&mdash;who live in the vicinity of towns and might find themselves in the position of making a modest sum by selling part of their land for building sites.  Certainly the people of Dublin 4 or the Donnybrook set would not be affected by these proposals and the same applies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This section attempts to provide criteria to guide the local authority as to what land to include in a designated area but it fails in this because it uses such phrases as &ldquo;the lands will probably be used&rdquo; and &ldquo;in the opinion of the local authority&rdquo;.  This kind of phrase immediately raises the possibility of argument as to what degree of probability must be present or what are the considerations on which the local authority's opinion is to be based.  That sort of loose, vague provision, which raises questions as to its meaning, almost invariably leads to arguments that are settled only in the courts after prolonged and costly proceedings.  This will result in greater expense and higher prices for people who are seeking to purchase homes or to be housed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" /> Apart from the drafting points I have raised, there is also the major point of the principle involved in the provisions of section 6.  This section, in conjuction with other provisions of the Bill, would simply bring about an almost total blight on development in an area.  The local authorities are given special powers to designate and acquire property if it is under-utilised, but there is no definition of &ldquo;under-utilised&rdquo; in the Bill.  How can a local authority decide if a house, a shop, a factory, a garden or a storage shed is under-utilised?  Opinions about whether property is under-utilised will vary widely.  The Bill in this respect appears to try to confer on local authorities arbitrary and undefined powers which could, unfortunately, lead to a certain amount of abuse, although it is more likely that local authorities could find those kind of powers so dubious that they would not attempt to use them at all.</P>
    <P>In section 10 of Deputy Quinn's Bill the House is being asked to throw out fundamental concepts embodied in the Planning Act, 1963.  Subsection (1) abolishes the principle enshrined in sections 26 and 30 of the Planning Act, 1963, that planning permission can be refused, revoked or modified only as a consideration of the proper planning and development of the area.  The Bill requires this principle to be swept aside completely and replaced by a new principle that a planning authority may refuse to grant planning permission for the development of land in respect of a designated area in relation to an order which has been confirmed, on the grounds that such land is included in that order.</P>
    <P>It appears to be the intention that the normal planning criteria, be they related to an amenity or any normal orderly planning, will not operate in the case of a refusal of planning permission in a designated area.  The only thing that will matter is that the local authority have the power to expropriate the owner from an existing use value.  It can be seen that sections of this Bill would cause serious confusion and would work unduly harshly against the vast majority of the population.  As if this bulldozer attack on planning principles were not bad enough, <Col N="1073" /> the Bill also removes all the carefully contrived structures built into the 1963 Planning Act in relation to compensation.</P>
    <P>Anybody who reads the complex provisions can see that, in providing for compensation arising from refusal of planning permission, the rights of the individual property owner as well as the common good have been taken into consideration. This will automatically be cancelled out under the provisions of the Bill.  If this Bill were implemented it would mean the elected members of local authorities would be burdened with responsibility for drawing up the demarcation lines between areas where there would be, on one side, restricted marketable land and, on the other side, an open market.  In a restricted area the local authority would have the absolute say in the acquisition of all land for private development and public works.  The only exceptions would be land on which development has commenced in respect of which planning permission had been granted, land used for community, recreational and sporting purposes and land which is the property of a public authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not provide the criteria for establishing the conditions under which the local authority would form an opinion that the overall development and renewal of an area is or is not necessary. We all accept that this type of vague provision invariably ends up in cases being brought to court with consequential expenses and long drawn out delays causing expense to every party concerned.</P>
    <P>We are all concerned to ensure that land at reasonable prices for the purpose of house building is available and is maintained. We are also concerned that abnormal increases in the price of land should not benefit the big speculator at the expense of the ordinary citizen and our young people who are seeking housing for the first time.  I am sure nobody in the House would approve of that.  This Bill would add chaos to the overall situation of housing and the construction industry, not to mention the chaos it would cause to local authorities.</P>
    <P>I have already outlined the difficulties <Col N="1074" /> that would arise under the Bill when a local authority would have to acquire the land or take it compulsorily.  We are also assuming that the houses that might be built would be local authority houses.  If we assume that private houses are acquired in that area, the authority then resell the land to a private builder, thus increasing costs.  We all accept that the vast majority of houses built in the Dublin area each year are built by the private sector.  I believe that should be encouraged.  It should not be left to local authorities to build all the houses needed. That simply cannot be done.  The major demand for houses by young couples is for those built privately.  That is where we should be concentrating our efforts. We should try to encourage young couples to save for the purchase of their own homes.  We should try to make it easier for them to obtain loans, to meet repayments and, above all, to ensure that housing is available to young couples at reasonable prices, prices which an ordinary young couple starting life are able to afford.</P>
    <P>Although our laws are not perfect, I believe they can be improved, but this type of Bill we have before us would not improve the position in any way whatever. It would add chaos, difficulties and disappointment to the lot of people seeking homes, particularly our young married people, apart from the other technical difficulties that would arise.  We have heard Deputy Barry say that Fine Gael will not be supporting this Bill. Should Deputy Quinn or the Labour Party decide to bring similar legislation before the House again one would hope that they would at least do a little more homework first and not bring before us what is a rehash of something that took place two years earlier.  In acting in this way the Labour Party are being cynical. They are trying to take advantage of a political opportunity at this by-election time.  Deputy L'Estrange will understand that, he being an expert on that sort of ploy.</P>

If any Deputy thinks seriously that the kind of system proposed by the Labour Party would work, he should think again.  Does any deputy think, for instance, that any majority of elected members of a local authority could do what this Bill, if enacted, would oblige them to do?  It happens sometimes that zoning decisions taken by local authorities seem to add to the value of the land zoned but the Bill proposes that decisions to designate land would have the effect of reducing it in value and such reduction could bring the land value down to a half, a quarter, or even only one-tenth of its market value.</P>

I find it a tedious rehash of the bankrupt arguments put on to the record of the House in June 1980 and which can be found at Volumes 321 and 322 of the Official Report.  That speech ended on a very interesting note.  This Bill has been described as putting society on a slippery slope on which there would be a drift away from the market value of land.  Earlier, reference was made to the Bill being ill-timed.</P>
      <P>It is very interesting to note that not once was the phrase &ldquo;overdue&rdquo; heard in the speech.

      <P>In the 30 minutes available to me I had to make many choices as to how I would use that time.  I thought, for example, of looking around the House and listing the names of all those I know to have benefited from speculation or who had contacts with different people who benefited from the sale of land but I decided that to proceed in that manner would occupy most of my time. Consequently, I decided to address <Col N="1077" /> myself instead to the principles of the Bill.</P>
      <P>To those who are interested in legislation of this kind I want to say that it is legislation that will not be welcomed by those who are in favour of speculation, that it will not be welcomed by those who wish to make vast private fortunes from social investment in services, who, for example, have sat on land or who have bought buildings and allowed them to decay, waiting for zoning decisions and for decisions for change of usage.  Neither will the Bill be welcomed by the spokespersons of such people, political and otherwise, but it will be welcomed by all those people who every weekend meet Deputies from all sides of the House to explain their housing needs.  Each weekend all of us meet the many women who push prams and go-cars to our clinics, so called, to seek our help in regard to housing.</P>
      <P>It is very interesting that the Labour Party should be accused of cynicism.  Is it not regrettable that the political spokesperson for the largest party in the House would not be influenced more by the people with housing needs rather than by those who own property and who are in a minority, who are only a fraction of the people Deputies meet at weekends and who are in need of housing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously we are to have a tedious rerun of the old objections that were prepared for the Minister in 1980.  It might be appropriate to dispose of a few of them rather quickly.  There is one in particular which I will address to you, Sir, as Chairman of this Assembly.  It is an objection that I regard as subversive in its suggestion.  I refer to the suggestion that was made in the Minister's speech last night and one that was made also by his party in June 1980 that people who sit in this Legislature should be inhibited from introducing a Bill of this kind in anticipation of constitutionality.  I put it to the House that it is a matter for the President and the Council of State to decide to what it is appropriate for the President to affix his signature or on what to seek an opinion from the Supreme Court.  It is impertinent in a speech to this <Col N="1078" /> Legislature to suggest that we must be impotent while a fear exists that any one of these other organs within the Constitution may express unfavourable or negative opinion.  To suggest that is to suggest a diminished role for the Legislature.</P>
    <P>I shall explain this very simply.  If, after having been discussed by this House and by the Seanad, this Bill were found to be unconstitutional, it would perhaps join other Bills that had also been found to have been unconstitutional but all the Bills that have been found unconstitutional would be a perfect record of what representatives in this Assembly had considered necessary to bring before their fellow elected Members.  Then the scrutiny could shift to the constitutional provision that is being used as a block to socially desirable legislation.  Instead, we have a repetition once again of the extraordinary spectacle of the Constitution being waved as an impediment to socially desirable legislation.  That is a cowardly and dishonourable point and one that does not fit honourably within a reasonable interpretation of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There are other points that have been made by many speakers but which can be grouped together under one suggestion, that is, that the Bill is inoperable in some of its provisions.  However, the mover of the Bill, Deputy Quinn, said explicitly that we would welcome suggestions and proposed amendments to the Bill.  My reply to Deputy Barry, who suggested that we withdraw the Bill, that the Government withdraw their amendments and that the matter be sent to a special committee is that there is nothing to stop the House going into Committee on the Bill so that we can hear all the wonderful, positive suggestions people have to offer for making it a better piece of legislation than it is in its draft form. A semi-constitutional issue arises here.  Is the onus on the Labour Party to have every dot and comma of a Bill perfect in draftmanship before it can be introduced in the House?  That suggestion is absurd and it reflects the unique advantage the Cabinet enjoy within the Irish parliamentary system of having an exclusive and monopolised claim on the services of the <Col N="1079" /> permanent civil service.  To make the suggestion that sections could be better in drafting or in wording is just one of those ways of seeking a cheap advantage from a parliamentary system that is unique in this feature and is different from other parliamentary assemblies in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the fundamentals of the legislation before us. Like Deputy Brady, I read the debate of June 1980, when a similar Bill was introduced, as reported at volumes 321 and 322 of the Official Report.  On that occasion many speakers decided to give an opinion about the importance of land as a concept to the Irish people.  People who were against the Bill said that land had a curious hold over the minds of the Irish people.  The suggestion was made tacitly that the Land War in the last century was carried out so as to establish the principles of greed and speculation in this century and that, if one took away the possibilities of vast unearned fortunes being made from speculation, one would be working against the principles of Davitt and those who followed him.  Only those who have a record of abusing history could make such a suggestion, and it was made two years ago.  We all know that the land movement at the end of the last century was a response to the social and population pressures in which &mdash; the phrase used was congests &mdash; the countryside was filled with people who could not sustain themselves on the land.  People below the subsistence line died while others emigrated.  The pressure for land was that it be used socially, that smallholders be allowed to make a living from it.  It is a corruption to suggest that that impulse is the same impulse as in the mind of the speculator that exists today.</P>
    <P>I should like to reply to a fundamental of this contained in the suggestion made by Deputy Brady.  To suggest that to stop speculation is to interfere with that sacred concept in the Irish mind, private property, and that it will equally attack free enterprise is wrong.  How much a price, even within the mixed economy or the capitalist system that prevails here, have <Col N="1080" /> we paid for this disastrous social attitude? How can buying a building, waiting for it to fall down in a few years' time and then waiting for the area to be rezoned be called enterprise?  How can buying a farm, sitting back and waiting for it to increase in value when it is rezoned be called enterprise?  Today we see it in another sense within their own miserable economic system, the proponents of private enterprise.  How many millions are tied up in decaying buildings waiting for decisions so that vast miserable private fortunes can be made?  How much money is tied up, for example, in land on the periphery of cities waiting for rezoning decisions that will generate private fortunes? Those private fortunes which are made on the backs of the homeless, will be spent in such a way as to win the adulation of the public, the support of the public and the votes of the public so that they can sit in this assembly and it will not be a source of embarrassment to know that they began their seedy careers in speculation and in making money out of the misery of the homeless.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the house will rightly be opposed by those people, but I should like to tell the House the reason it is being introduced by the Labour Party.  We believe it is time to address ourselves to a question we have been neglecting and all Governments have been neglecting.  I am generous in my criticism in that respect.  We have to make a fundamental choice.  The population is expanding and land is fixed.  Do we take the fixity of land as a principle for exploitation against an expanding population or do we address ourselves to the fixity of land as a problem and devise a land policy that will be able to handle the immense possibilities of the expansion of the population?  That is not some peripheral socialist suggestion.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when replying, might like to refer to why such a suggestion from the National Economic and Social Council last year in report No. 55 made a plea for a land policy.  The council suggested that something should be done about the Kenny Report or, if that was felt to be insufficient, that something better than it should be adopted.  The Council suggested that, if the Kenny <Col N="1081" /> Report were not the model, a new strategy on how to approach the question of land should be devised.  That was not the suggestion of a socialist but of the commissioned researcher who published his findings in that report, entitled Urbanisation, Problems of Growth and Decay in Dublin.  Did that report say, &ldquo;Go into the Dáil, Minister, and tell Members what you said two years ago&rdquo;?  Or would such a report have said in 1980: &ldquo;Let us think of reasons why we can block this&rdquo;?  Will the legislator be thanked for having put on the record, nearly a decade after the establishment of the Kenny Committee, the fact that it has found things wrong again this week about the suggestion of developing a land policy?</P>
    <P>In this city there are people without shelter and there are people with shelter who will work for one-third of the working week to generate the money to pay the building societies for the roof over their heads.  There are other young people who are thinking of getting married and they know they will work for the financial institutions for one-third of their lives.  Will they thank the legislature?  We will say that we found it difficult to reconcile with the Constitution but they will reply: &ldquo;If you did that why did you not allow it to go through your Legislature and through the constitutional process?&rdquo; If the Government party believe that there is wonderful support for the objections to the Bill, I challenge them this evening to put it to a referendum, to put it side by side with the referendum they have agreed to hold this year so that we can see the support they will get and the support the Labour Party will get for removing this constitutional impediment, if it is held to exist.  It is not an argument to suggest that there are constitutional impediments or to come up with the lesser argument that sections of it are inoperable, how one would decide about the size of a garden and so on.</P>
    <P>Are we given intelligence, benefit and privilege in society to work for the State or to be elected to represent the State to produce such piddling objections to a Bill like this?  Why not respond to the Bill and say: &ldquo;Yes, we accept the principles of it but we will ask the Labour Party to put <Col N="1082" /> it back for a while so that we can sit in committee with them to improve it&rdquo;? That is not the response.  We are being opposed on Second Stage on the principles of the Bill.  The people who do not vote for it will be people who will be lining up on the opposite side of the road to the homeless and those who are being exploited in housing.  We should be clear about that.  We have not had an indication of an improved Bill but a list of things that may be introduced, clawbacks of profits.</P>
    <P>I should like to address myself to some of the alternatives.  To say that it is intended to tax the gains of speculation is obviously better than having tax-free speculation, as we have had for so long in this State.  However, it involves the principle of speculation and one cannot have an adequate land policy unless one looks at speculation itself and at the manner in which it takes place, unless one is willing to strike at it at its source.  How can one say that even a partial solution like that, which is better than nothing, is an adequate substitution for legislation like this?</P>
    <P>There is, abroad in the public, a sense of urgency about this legislation.  I will go so far as to say that not only is there support for a Bill like this among the general public and those who understand and feel strongly about housing, but that if the Association of County Managers were asked about this they would be in favour of legislation like that.  However, that will not happen after the vote is taken on the Second Reading of this Bill. They will not be asked.  The Bill will have been defeated again.</P>
    <P>If you asked people who work, for example, as public representatives all around the country &mdash; who, it is suggested, would not have the capacity to take the decisions which this Bill would ask of them as put by Deputy Brady a few minutes ago &mdash; what they think of this Bill, they would tell you they want such legislation, that something should be done about this minority of people who insist on abusing constitutional provisions to make vast private fortunes at the expense of the majority who need housing.</P>

      <P>There are other very important aspects of this Bill.  It would provide the land upon which houses would be built.  The point has already been covered by Deputy Quinn as to the proportion of the total cost of housing that site cost constitutes.  I do not want to enter into dispute as to whether this is as low as ten per cent, as some people put it in 1980, 35 per cent, or whatever.  The fact is that if you can produce legislation like this, you have controlled one of the primary aspects of high housing cost.  That is the philosophy of this legislation, it is no less than that.  The public need requires that.  We must do it.  Supposing we do not do it, the high price of housing land, in relation to the cost of local authority housing provision &mdash; and I would not want to delay on that because the Government have already dismissed it as less important than private housing as we have just heard &mdash; and even in relation to private housing, is obviously, passed on in the house price.  One effect of this legislation would be to control that element.  It would not do the three or four things which Deputy Barrett, then Minister for the Environment, suggested in June 1980, and which was suggested last night by his successor and by Deputy Brady.  You could summarise those objections of two years ago as follows:</P>
      <P>It will strike terror into all those who have dearly held the concept of private property in their hearts.  It will discourage private builders from moving into the building area.  Unemployment will follow, decay and blight.  The public would not support such a constitutional decision as is being suggested by the Labour Party.  A layer of bureaucracy will be created.</P>

    <P>It will impede the provision of housing, <Col N="1084" /> private and public.  Similar legislation to this has failed in Britain.</P>
    <P>And then there is a little rider:</P>
    <P>But, however, in Wales where they went on the open market, the Welsh Land Authority performed a little better than the rest of Britain.</P>
    <P>Of course, the reason is given.  It bought its land on the open market.  If you are going to let the market put the price on land for both public and private housing, what you are essentially doing is accepting the principle of speculation on one of the principal components in land price sales and also simply making a social need fit the market and provide the rewards which that market will confer on the few people involved in speculation, from the grass to the putting of the final bits of furniture into the house.  Let us say that &mdash; market considerations. However if you believe that, say to the people in a constitutional referendum &ldquo;We have been put in doubt as to whether these private property clauses should be given precedence over other social provisions&rdquo;.  Do not hide behind them, I say to the Government.  Test the people.  It is a long time since 1937.  There were even daft people like myself who read the history of that Constitution and how it was written and who might argue that the right of people to make vast private speculative profit would never have been envisaged by Mr. de Valera. Perhaps it was not.  If so, let us find out. Let us have a referendum on these clauses and get a straight answer.</P>
    <P>Then the seedy, subversive suggestion was made in 1980 which, no doubt, will be repeated now, that the Supreme Court might not decide in favour of this legislation. Last night we heard how the Supreme Court had taken certain decisions in relation to rent restrictions and might be likely to make a similar decision on a Bill of this kind.  That is an improper suggestion from an elected assembly in the Dáil.  The Supreme Court is free to make up its own mind in relation to every piece of legislation which is placed before it.  To suggest, in anticipation, a decision of the court is to hide behind something <Col N="1085" /> which you have not the courage to face up to yourself.</P>
    <P>In the situation where local authorities, in the absence of this legislation, had to buy building land on the open market, let us be clear on the effect which that has had historically.  Members of the Department of Local Government can advise the Minister to refute this in his reply.  I would like to feel that I am wrong on this, but my own work suggests that this is the case.  Sometimes local authorities will attempt to build up a land bank and, while they are acquiring land, few houses will be built.  Then, they attempt to build houses and the amount of land which they have remains frozen.  Then the houses are built and they are out of land and have to go on the market again for land.</P>
    <P>Look at the structure of local authority finances in that period and you will find that it did exactly what we are being accused of doing in this Bill in relation to unemployment &mdash; it created a stop-go effect in relation to the provision of houses.  It produced unemployment, uncertainty and bad planning in that regard.  It did all the things which it is suggested that our Bill would do.  It has not just been doing them recently, it has been doing them for many decades. Sometimes the local authorities can be building houses and sometimes acquiring land.  Under the present structure, they cannot be doing both and because of that, they are purchasing land on the open market and producing not only uncertainty in relation to the provision of housing and far fewer houses than are needed, but bringing chaos and unemployment into all aspects of the building industry.</P>
    <P>To summarise, the great, dramatic movement in population in Ireland, it has been said, has been from rural areas into cities and towns.  When the last census was analysed, preliminary results would seem to suggest that it is now not only Dublin which is experiencing an acute housing shortage, but also the towns.  In the Dublin area, the problem is a suburban one, in relation to the facilities required in the greater Dublin area.  This is a very important aspect.  We have allowed that urbanisation, that regional <Col N="1086" /> imbalance to happen.  It brings about rural decay which is the other side of the coin, houses being neglected and abandoned in rural areas which are deprived of traditional industries, areas from which people have come to other areas where there is pressure on schools, on transport, on all the things which are needed, and has created urban diseconomy there.</P>
    <P>This has come about because of the opposition fundamentally and totally to the concept of planning.  We have generally opposed planning.  We claim to have an industrial policy, a policy in relation to energy, and in relation to employment, and that we have been able to &ldquo;manage&rdquo; with our plan.  Within planning, in particular the planning of urban space, we have had a dreadful result.  Our population has come flocking and disbanded to urban areas and, at the same time, we have had no legislative response to create the framework in space in which that population might acquire the most necessary basic need they have &mdash; shelter. We have made no provision for that.  So the homeless join the people who live within the unplanned educational sector and the unplanned industrial sector but there is a difference.  Deputy Quinn made reference to class.  It is very interesting to look at the history and shape of cities and see how cross space class divisions were measured, people requiring space around them which had a certain view, the position of riches on the hills in the cities of the world.  Today the major expansion of our population is taking place within cities and towns.  The fixity of land is being used to confer a benefit on speculation.  The expansion of the population is being ignored.  It has been told it must dance to the tune of speculation. The response of this Legislature has been to say that they believe that when the Constitution was written ownership of land had to be protected as an aspect of private property and must be protected today as the principle for generating private speculative fortunes.  Our response is that it must go on because it is constitutional and proper and, at best, we will tax the greatest volume of ill-gotten gains.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> Meanwhile, the population expands, creating homeless people and housing which is too dear and I warn my fellow legislators in this regard.  If we go on ignoring the problem of unemployment and the unplanned economy with its consequences on employment, if we put homelessness side by side with that people will seek a solution and it will not be a solution that we will be allowed the luxury of debating in this House.  If this Bill is defeated it will not be a defeat for the Labour Party, it will be the refusal of people to address themselves to probably the most serious problem next to unemployment that society faces.  I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I understand the intention behind the Bill, that it is prompted by gross abuses by certain people which happened in the past in land speculation. Having said that, we recognise also that it is all very well to introduce a Bill like this but Deputy Higgins seems to think that because most people &mdash; even in his own party &mdash; consider it to be unconstitutional we should enact it anyway and let the courts decide.  He also seems to think that to do otherwise would be a disgrace.  My philosophy as a public representative has always been that my first priority in this House is to uphold the constitutional rights of the citizens and that is a very important right.  We cannot deliberately pass legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When I was a member of Dublin Corporation I found it hard to understand why sites were costing so much to builders on land which had been purchased by the corporation many years before at a much lower figure and sold at a very much higher figure.  I thought the corporation were speculating in making huge profits on land which they had acquired years before.  I thought this land should be sold for sites at a price which would make it economical for young house purchasers to buy.  It was explained to me that as the years went by, and as <Col N="1088" /> the price of land increased, in order for the corporation to acquire more land they had to charge an inflated price so that they could continue to purchase land. That taught me the lesson that the State then becomes the speculator and that you are caught in this cycle.  Many things combine to make a house very expensive, not least the professional fees paid to architects.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party admit that the Bill is not perfect and would like to see it debated in more detail on Committee Stage.  One difficulty is that if a person wants to buy land in a designated area, permission has to be given by the local authority.  All private dwellings in land and property would come to a standstill. It might mean that a farmer could not sell off a few sites to his neighbour's children to enable them to build houses so that they could live in their own area.  There are a number of other points to be considered. One point is that where it was considered by the local authority that the land was being under-utilised they might step in.  In that case one is leaving oneself open to asking who is going to make this judgment?  While people are rebelling against bureaucracy, we are creating an even greater inanimate bureaucracy which might not have the ability to see how this will affect people's lives.  The Government have stated that they have taken steps, initially through taxation, to try to bring back some of the money by increasing capital gains tax in the recent budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wonder why Deputy L'Estrange came into the House this evening. He has had plenty of opportunity to speak as he has been here since the debate began.  The Minister said last night that in order to crack down on exorbitant profits from dealing in building land and to ensure that a significant proportion of windfall gains resulting from the provision of local services are <Col N="1089" /> returned to the community, significant changes were decided on and announced in the budget statement on 25 March.  A capital gains tax of 50 per cent on gains from disposals of development land was announced, 5 per cent higher than the rate proposed in the Coalition budget.  I did not hear any praise for Fianna Fáil for having brought that level up a bit <Col N="1090" /> higher than the Coalition, which was partnered by the Labour Party.  I do not like speculation.</P>

      <P>The certificate of tax-free allowances for 1982-83 in the sum of £69.58 weekly, which issued to the taxpayer at the commencement of the current year, was a provisional one based on the allowances available to him for 1981-82.  An <Col N="950" /> amended certificate for £86.16 weekly, which takes account of the increases announced in the budget, was issued direct to his employer on 10 May 1982, and when it is put into operation, any tax which has been over-deducted from his pay since 6 April 1982, will be refunded to the taxpayer by his employer.</P>
      <P>As the taxpayer's PRSI contributions fall under class A1, he will also qualify for the extra relief of £6 per week in his tax-free allowances and a further revised certificate will be issued to him as soon as possible.</P>

As the subscriber continues to be dissatisfied, it is proposed to carry out further checks on the metered usage in consultation with the subscriber.</P>

There is no special provision in relation to mature students; (b) it is open to a person who qualifies academically for a higher education grant in the leaving certificate examination of a particular year and who does not wish to enter on a course of third level education immediately, to apply for the grant in the year he/she sat for the leaving certificate and avail himself/herself of the provision in the grants scheme whereby a grant may be deferred for two years or, in exceptional circumstances, for more than two years; (c) revisions of the means test provisions of the higher education grants scheme are introduced by way of the relevant scheme <Col N="973" /> approved for the year in question.  It is considered that such practice should be adhered to; (d) in accordance with the provisions of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968, a primary degree or other course must, in order to be approved for the purpose of the tenure of a higher education grant, be of a minimum duration of two years.

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the course for persons wishing to qualify as solicitors in the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland school, Blackhall Place, Dublin, i.e. the professional course of six months duration and the advanced course of six to eight weeks duration.  These courses are covered by the higher education grants scheme, for the purposes of which they are combined and regarded as being equivalent to a one-year post-graduate course.  Accordingly, a student who qualified for a higher education grant under the terms of the scheme of the year he/she sat for the leaving certificate examination and who has completed an undergraduate course with the aid of that grant may have his/her grant extended, subject to the terms of the grants scheme, in respect of the professional and advanced courses in the Incorporated Law Society school.</P>
      <P>Two-thirds of the annual rate of the maintenance (if any) and fee elements of grant, subject to the maximum amounts prescribed under the grants scheme, are payable in respect of the professional course and one-third in respect of the advanced course.  The maximum of the annual rate of the fee element of a grant is £592 in the present academic year (1981-82).</P>

      <P>The person concerned attained age 66 years on 7 March 1982 and claimed old age contributory pension from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the conditions for the receipt of old age contributory pension requires a person to have a yearly average of not less than 20 contributions in order to qualify.  The yearly average is calculated over the period from 5 January 1953 or year of entry into insurance, if later, to the end of the contribution year <Col N="986" /> immediately preceding the one in which he attains pension age.</P>
    <P>My Department's records show that the person concerned had a total of 485 qualifying contributions in the 28-year period from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1981.  As this is equivalent to a yearly average of 17 contributions, he does not qualify for an old age contributory pension.</P>
    <P>The question of his entitlement to a non-contributory old age pension has been referred to the local social welfare officer for investigation.</P>

      <P>The person concerned did not claim an increase in the rate of unemployment assistance in respect of her three qualified children and consequently her claim was treated as appropriate to a person without dependants.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 19 December 1981 and was paid to 23 February 1982 under her old insurance number.  At that stage she was requested to furnish her RSI number and to quote this number on all future medical certificates submitted in support of her claim.  As no further medical certificates were received from her, payment of benefit ceased.  As a result of inquiries it has now been established that she is still incapable of work and, accordingly, a cheque for the amount of benefit due to 11 May 1982 was issued to her on that date.</P>
