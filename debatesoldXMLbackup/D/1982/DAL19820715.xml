      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 4, 13, 14 and 3.  It is proposed that, in relation to the proposed Joint Committee on Building Land, business will be interrupted at an appropriate stage today to deal with the relevant message from the Seanad and to dispose of any consequent order which may arise.  By agreement, the speech of every Member contributing to the Adjournment Debate should not exceed 30 minutes, except for the concluding speakers from each of the parties who shall be called on tomorrow as follows: The Workers' Party at 1 p.m., the Labour Party at 1.45 p.m., the Fine Gael Party at 2.30 p.m. and the Government speaker at 3.15 p.m.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, on the last two days, and on one occasion last week questions down to the Minister for Finance were <Col N="2574" /> answered by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance.  At exactly the same time as questions were being taken here at 2.30 p.m.  I was standing on my feet in the Seanad speaking on the Finance Bill going through that House on both those occasions.  This week my absence was raised here by Deputies opposite, knowing well that I was present in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>For the legal mind of Deputy Fitzpatrick I will make it a point of order.  I am sorry if it offends the Deputy.  The point of order I raise is this. Does this House recognise that Ministers have responsibilities and duties to perform in the other House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>When they are doing so are they not relieved from duties in this House and do not Ministers of State take their places?  Has not this practice continued down the years in this House? I do not mind personally, but it is most unfair of Opposition Deputies to raise such a question when they know that at the very same time the Minister concerned was standing on his feet speaking in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave way to the Minister for Finance on what I understood was to be a point of order in relation to the answering of questions addressed to the Minister for Finance.  I asked yesterday if it came to the turn of the Minister for Agriculture to answer questions if he would be present at any time during the remainder of Question Time.  I asked whether he would be present for Question <Col N="2575" /> Time today and his Minister of State indicated that it was quite possible that he would be present today.  In that event I asked that just one question would be postponed from yesterday for answer today to enable the Minister himself to answer it.  I am merely asking if the Minister for Agriculture will be present today.  If the Minister for Agriculture has a commitment in the Seanad, in view of my time there I would appreciate that entirely.  If the Taoiseach indicates that the Minister for Agriculture will be engaged in the Seanad from 2.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. I will accept that entirely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Boland's memory is short, but I happened to be in this House in the period of the Coalition Government when Ministers of State answered questions for their Ministers without any objections from our side of the House.</P>

      <P>Order, please. Deputy Boland is asking a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked whether the Minister for Agriculture would be present in order to answer Question No. 1 on today's Order Paper.  If he is not present then presumably it is because the Taoiseach has arranged for him to be away on more important duties than answering questions in the House and we can draw our own conclusions from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have any arrangements been made regarding the Adjournment Debate in <Col N="2576" /> the order in which speakers will be called by the Chair?  Some arrangement was enforced regarding the times at which speakers would be called to make closing speeches on behalf of their parties tomorrow afternoon but there are no arrangements in relation to the order in which speakers would be called from the various groupings in the House.  In a recent debate here Deputies representing a group three in number were afforded virtually the same amount of speaking time as Deputies of this party who were in Opposition and represent 63.  This is not acceptable from our point of view and the Chair will agree that it is not in the best interests of representation that a minority group would be afforded the same amount of speaking time as the main Opposition party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair tries to ensure a fair share of representation. I recall the incident.  I thought they just offered and there was no one else at that time.  I will endeavour to ensure proper representation and proper balance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As a general principle the number of speakers in a debate of that kind should be broadly proportionate to the membership of the three main parties, but we would be happy to join with the other parties in ceding some of that time to ensure that Members get an opportunity to speak; otherwise they might be squeezed out altogether.  We are happy with the practice of allowing Independents to follow on our party and we will be looking for three out of every eight speakers speaking to the House.</P>

      <P>Last evening there were Deputies who sat here for the duration of the debate on the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill but who were not called while at the same time other Deputies who did not have the courtesy to remain in the House during the debate came in towards the end and sought to be allowed to speak.  That is a gross injustice to those who are prepared to sit here during a debate.  Some of those Deputies who arrived late suggested that some of us curtail our contributions. Anybody who is sufficiently interested in a debate should be in the House to hear it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill can be divided into four general areas.  The first and most substantive area is the ESB's power and duties in relation to financial matters, and, specifically, expenditure and borrowing for general or capital purposes.  Under the legislation as it stands there is a limit on capital expenditure by the board which is extended, by amending Acts, from time to time.  The present limit, which was set in the Act of 1981, stands at £1,400 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of expenditure on approved capital projects now in hands, it is clear that this limitation will be reached in the latter part of this year.  An increase in the statutory limit is therefore necessary, but I am proposing in the Bill to change the nature of the limit from one based on expenditure to one based on borrowings.  There are a number of reasons for doing this.  The scale of expenditure for capital purposes, which the board must incur is now such that the <Col N="2579" /> greater part of it &mdash; currently about 80 per cent &mdash; must be financed by borrowings. A change to a borrowings limit will, therefore, not only more accurately reflect this commercial reality but also more realistically reflect the real control which the Oireachtas can exercise, which is over the amount the board can borrow. The change to a borrowings limit will also bring the ESB legislation into line with more recent legislation affecting other semi-State Bodies such as the Gas Act, 1976 which covers Bord Gáis Éireann.</P>
    <P>The limit which is specified in the Bill is £1,600 million, in aggregate, of borrowings which have not been repaid by the board.  At present the level of the board's unrepaid borrowings stands at £840 million. After taking account of money, which can be allocated from internal resources, it is estimated that the amount of new borrowings required to meet the capital programme up to 1985 will be £735 million which will bring the total to just under £1,600 million.</P>
    <P>This limit set in the Bill will, therefore, be sufficient to cover the board's capital operations up to the early part of 1985. At that stage it will be necessary to review again the financial requirements of the board and, if necessary, to seek the approval of the Oireachtas for a further increase in the limitation on borrowings.</P>
    <P>The Bill also updates the statutory requirements relating to guarantee of ESB borrowings by the Minister for Finance, again the objective being to bring them into line with more modern practice.  A limitation of £1,600 million is proposed on the total amount of such guarantees to coincide with the limitation on the board's total borrowings.</P>
    <P>Apart from the foregoing provisions on borrowing limits, I consider it is desirable to formalise the arrangements for Ministerial control over the capital expenditure programmes of the board.  It has been the administrative practice that the board submit for Ministerial approval their proposals for the construction of new generating capacity and the estimated capital outlay thereon.  There are also the arrangements, in the annual budgetary context, under which the <Col N="2580" /> annual capital programme of the ESB is included in the capital budget.  The capital expenditure programmes of the ESB are very substantial indeed and they impact on the economy both in specific and general ways.  I believe, therefore, that the principle of Ministerial review of such programmes should be formally covered in the statutes governing the board's operations.</P>
    <P>Deputies may feel that the provision proposed in sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Bill is too all-embracing.  However, the provision as it stands has the merit of simplicity.  Deputies will know that the capital expenditure programmes of the board in relation to new generating plant cover a period of many years.  It may in certain cases be necessary to give broad approval in principle with provision for review of the project in the light of changes in demand for electricity.  A substantial element of flexibility would, therefore, be necessary in relation to the giving of Ministerial approvals.  It will also be necessary to look at the Board's capital expenditure proposals on an annual basis, in the context of general economic policy.  Furthermore, there may be relatively short-term proposals for capital expenditures by the board which would need to be considered on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  Deputies will appreciate that if an attempt were made to draft legislation which would comprehend the variety of circumstances which I have mentioned the result would be unduly complex.</P>
    <P>I have discussed the matter with the ESB and we have agreed that arrangements can be settled between us and the Minister for Finance, which will enable the provision in the Bill to be operated satisfactorily without inhibiting in any significant way the day-to-day activities of the board in regard to capital projects and expenditures.</P>
    <P>These are the principal elements in the financial provisions of the Bill.  A number of minor, technical financial amendments to existing legislation are also proposed to improve administrative efficiency, from the viewpoint of both the board and the Minister for Finance.  For instance, the requirement on the board, under the <Col N="2581" /> Act of 1954, to create a &ldquo;form of security&rdquo; when borrowing is being removed. Differences of legal opinion over the interpretation of this obligation on the board have given rise to delays in the negotiation of loan agreements.  It is proposed to remove the obligation on the board to create a form of security but the option of doing so will remain to the board if lenders insist on it.</P>
    <P>The second area covered by the Bill relates to annual payments to be made by the board to the Minister for the Environment in lieu of rates on the board's generation and distribution plant.  Under existing legislation, the board are exempt from the payment of rates on such plant. The previous Government, in their consideration last year of departmental Estimates for 1982, decided that the ESB should pay £10 million this year as a contribution in lieu of rates.  Provision for the receipt of this sum was made in the Estimate for the Department of the Environment.  This was to be regarded as a temporary arrangement for 1982, pending official valuation and rating of the board's exempted property.</P>
    <P>The Government have, however, concluded that in the special circumstances of the ESB there are arguments in favour of the concept of a payment, fixed by the Government, to be made annually by the board in lieu of rates and the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>The third area covered by the Bill relates to amendment of certain provisions in the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942, so as to remove any doubts which might exist about the powers of the trustees of the board's superannuation committee to invest in real or personal property, and also to remove the existing requirement on the board to consult with the Minister for Finance before investing funds in securities authorised by law.  This brings the relevant ESB superannuation provisions into line with those applicable to other State bodies.</P>
    <P>The final area dealt with in the Bill is the involvement of the board in fisheries activities.  These activities stem directly from the generation of electricity from hydro-electric stations on rivers which <Col N="2582" /> are the habitat of migratory fish such as salmon and eels.  Legislation in the past has given the board the authority and responsibility to acquire, manage and preserve fisheries affected by their hydro-electric schemes.</P>
    <P>Initially work involved the construction of salmon hatcheries and the contribution of these hatcheries to the country's salmon stocks has been of vital importance in the face of nationally declining runs of salmon.  In response to a Government request, the board have agreed to increase their overall salmon smolt production, and the fish thus produced will be released into salmon rivers in need of restocking on an annual basis. The board have assisted anglers in Wicklow and Cork by cultivating brown trout in cages in Poulaphouca and Inniscarra reservoirs, and, to judge by reports from angling clubs, this has been a great success. The board is also the principal eel exporter of the country, and has assisted the State and other eel fishery owners in marketing their catches with those of the Board.</P>
    <P>This brief review underlines the success achieved in the board's fisheries activities to date.  It is important for the good of the fishing industry in general that the board should be given expanded powers in this area.  At present the board has statutory powers in relation to specific fisheries on rivers on which it has constructed power stations.  In order to enable the board to engage in fish farming in the open sea, and in rivers on which it has no fishing rights, it is necessary to statutorily empower the board to engage in the range of activities comprehended by the term &ldquo;aquaculture&rdquo;, as defined in the Fisheries Act, 1980.  In the present text of the Bill, section 9 uses a definition which is contained in section 54 of the Fisheries Act, 1980.  I am now advised that, since this section of the Fisheries Act is not yet in force, it is necessary to have a definition incorporated in the Bill itself and I am introducing an amendment for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The ESB occupies a position of very considerable importance among public sector institutions.  Their operations and the service they provide affects the entire <Col N="2583" /> economy and every citizen.  It is a major source of employment and its expenditure budgets are very substantial by any standards.  For example, in 1982 the total expected capital expenditure by the board is estimated at over £230 million of which some £125 million will be spent on generating plant and about £87 million on transmission and distribution networks.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, right and reasonable that this House, and I as responsible Minister, should be concerned with reviewing the overall activities and the trend of policies of the ESB, without inhibiting the board's freedom to pursue its day-to-day business.  Before concluding, I would like to refer to two broad policy issues which are related and which I know are of much concern to Deputies as they are certainly to me.  The fuel mix of the ESB's generating capacity is of vital importance because it affects our balance of payments and the use of certain valuable indigenous resources.  It also has a major effect in the second area to which I would like to refer, namely, the level of ESB charges to consumers.</P>
    <P>A main element of strategy on ESB fuel use must be to diversify away from oil as a primary energy source.  Apart from the volatility of oil costs, the risk of major disruption of international markets is always present.  In this context the coming on stream of the new coal burning facility at Moneypoint will be a major diversification.  The proportion of our installed generating capacity that depends on oil has been falling off in recent years, and this trend will be maintained. The proportion which stood at 54 per cent a year ago, now stands at 51 per cent and by the end of the decade it will be about 35 per cent.</P>
    <P>The other prong of our fuel strategy must be to maximise the proportion of native fuel used by the ESB.  Of the 1,362 megawatt capacity approved for commissioning between now and the end of the decade, 88 megawatts will be fired by peat, including extensions to Shannon-bridge and Lanesboro generating stations, and 45 megawatts will be fired in a new station at Arigina using local low <Col N="2584" /> grade coal.  The ESB are already using native natural gas in some of their power stations and, while the premium domestic market is building up for this gas, its use by the ESB is helping to stabilise electricity prices to the consumer and creating savings on oil imports which assist the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>Electricity tariffs have been in the news lately.  Over the past two years or so these have increased quite substantially although, of course, they were granted on the basis of allowable cost increases incurred by the board, including fuels, salaries and other unavoidable increases in overheads.  The level of increases has, however, been disturbing not only for domestic consumers but also, and especially, for industry.  It has been possible to limit the most recent increase granted to the board to 5 per cent, which is the most moderate for some years.  I was also glad to announce, that, while allowing this increase for general purposes, there would be a reduction in the night-time electricity tariffs which would be of benefit to industry.  Furthermore, I removed the fuel variation charge from ESB bills which had become a source of confusion &mdash; and indeed some annoyance &mdash; to electricity consumers.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that I will be concentrating my efforts to ensure that this desirable moderation in electricity increases which we have been able to achieve will be maintained in the immediate future at least.  The Government have, in fact, decided that the position on electricity prices generally should be fully reviewed, particularly in the light of recent reports that, at least in some respects, our electricity prices compare unfavourably with general levels elsewhere. I am arranging to have this review carried out and I will be taking a personal interest in the results.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of the activities of the board which could be mentioned.  A number of these have been dealt with in the House recently, either in the course of questions or on other occasions.  I have a high regard for the professional and technical competence of the ESB organisation, which has served this nation well over the years.  I would <Col N="2585" /> emphasise, however, that I consider the broad policy objectives of the board, and the means of achieving these, as major areas of direct concern to me.  I have a very satisfactory working relationship with the board and senior executives of the ESB and have every confidence that I will have their full co-operation in seeking to achieve the paramount objective of providing all consumers with a safe and continuous supply of electricity at the absolute minimum cost to them and to the economy.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Electricity Supply Board is the first or most senior of our State companies and indeed could be described as the most successful.  The expansion and development of the Electricity Supply Board really is the story of the development of this nation.</P>
      <P>It is true that we have become very dependent on electricity.  We look to the ESB as the main source of our energy. For a long time energy was supplied by the board at a cheap rate but, those days are gone.  I have said that we have become very dependent on the board for the energy used in our households, in industry and in our agricultural sector. As a matter of fact if, suddenly, the ESB and its network were to go out of action for some unknown reason the country would be paralysed and brought to a standstill overnight.  Therefore it is extremely important that the ESB run their business in a way that will produce electricity, energy, at the lowest possible cost.  It is even more important that the Government conduct their business and manage the country in a way that will not make it impossible for the ESB to supply us with energy at a reasonable cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noted that the Minister said in his concluding remarks that the cost of electricity here compared unfavourably with its cost elsewhere.  Unfortunately at present the price of a lot of things in this country compares unfavourably with their counterparts elsewhere.  As I shall be saying later, for example, interest rates are coming down in other parts of the world but seem to be going up here. <Col N="2586" /> There is something generally wrong with our economy.  We are becoming less competitive in foreign markets.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, if electricity is becoming comparatively dearer here that is partially due to the cost of oil.  That has been the position since 1973 but, apart from that, there are other things making it difficult for the ESB to compete.  I do not use the word &ldquo;compete&rdquo; in its literal sense of whether we can afford electricity but rather that it makes it difficult for the ESB to produce electricity on terms as favourable as those elsewhere.  That is not necessarily an indictment of the board or of the way in which the board manage their affairs.  It is as likely to be an indictment of the country as it is in general likely to be an indictment of the Government.</P>
    <P>In the last six months we have had two Bills.  On 25 July 1981 a very short two-section Bill was introduced here which fixed the borrowing powers of the board at £1,400 million.  The present Bill proposes to fix the borrowing powers of the board and the guaranteed powers of the State at £1,600 million, an increase of £200 million.  That is a comparatively modest increase.  This measure is an enabling measure designed to enable the Minister to guarantee the borrowings of the board.  I do not know what increase there was last year in the £1,400 million but an increase of £200 million this year does not seem to be a very big increase.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to take complete control over capital expenditure by the board.  In referring to that I thought he was a little bit on the defensive, because section 2 (1) says that the board shall not increase any expenditure for capital purposes without the approval of the Minister. If that is implemented, as it certainly will be, it is a very far-reaching power and it will be difficult to operate.  If it does not mean Ministerial control it does not seem very sensible to have it here.  It is also provided that the board may borrow in the national currency, punts, or it may borrow in foreign currency.  If it borrows in foreign currency we shall have to repay in foreign currency.  That is inevitable.  There is also provision that the board may invest its funds in trustee <Col N="2587" /> securities and we seem to be departing from trustee securities and giving authority to the board to issue such other investments as the Minister may approve.  Is that a new departure?  I should like the Minister to comment on it when replying. If it is a new departure is it a recognition that trustee securities are no longer attractive and that it is better to look further afield?</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to tell us what the indebtedness of the board is at the moment.  How much of the indebtedness represents native borrowing and how much foreign borrowing?  How much does it cost to service this borrowing?  I think the board have a sort of Hobson's Choice here because if they can get money at home they will be faced with high and unattractive interest rates, interest rates dearer than those in other parts of the world.  As recently as Tuesday of this week the Chairman of Allied Irish Banks is reported in the <i>Evening Herald</i> as saying that there is no hope of a drop in bank interest rates because the Government are borrowing too much. He went on to say that our serious balance of payments problem, the high level of inflation and Government borrowing, are making it impossible for a fall in bank interest rates.</P>
    <P>Now we have the position wherein, if the board borrow money at home, they will be faced with sustained and increasing interest rates and those rates will have to be serviced.  That of course, will make it more difficult for the board to produce electricity at a reasonable rate.  If, on the other hand, borrowing takes place abroad the interest will have to be repaid in foreign currency and, as we know from what the Chairman of Allied Irish Banks, Mr. Neil Crowley has said, the rate of exchange is not favourable to the punt. That will inevitably put up the cost of electricity again.  These are things over which the Government have control. They are things over which the ESB do not have control.  There are certain things the Government should put right.  I have asked the Minister to deal, when replying, <Col N="2588" /> with the present indebtedness of the board and the cost of servicing that indebtedness.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this Bill imposes a charge on the board of £10 million in respect of rates this year.  When Ministers refer to their own Government's budget proposals, they present them here as if they were our proposals.  They go out of their way actually to say that certain budget proposals were those of the previous Government.  I find it necessary to put on record again that the budget of January was rejected and the budget of March is this Government's budget.  It made changes.  We were toying around with the Finance Bill until as late as yesterday and certain changes were made in that.  Let us be clear now about the situation. These are Fianna Fail proposals.</P>
    <P>The last Government proposed to make a charge on the ESB of £10 million in lieu of rates.  That was done on the basis that when rates were abolished on private dwellings other sources of income had to be found for local authorities.  At the time it was stated that the intention was that this charge would be a temporary measure until the ESB property was valued for rating purposes.  When that task was completed it was proposed that the ESB would pay rates like other rate payers.  Under this Bill it is proposed to impose this charge of £10 million in 1982 and in each other year the board will be liable for a sum to be determined in accordance with the Bill, by the Government. That figure is intended to be in keeping with the rates payable by the board if the various installations of the board were valued and rated.  I wonder if that is a wise move, because we are giving authority to the Government to impose a charge on the ESB each year which will, in the opinion of the Government, be approximate to the rates that the board would be liable for but the figure will not be increased as rates would.</P>
    <P>Section 7 states:</P>
    <P>7.&mdash;(1)  The Board shall, in the year 1982, pay to the Minister for the Environment the sum of £10,000,000.</P>
    <P>(2)  (a) The Board shall, in each year <Col N="2589" /> after the year 1982, pay to the Minister for the Environment such sum as may be determined by the Government for each such year.</P>
    <P>(b) A sum determined under this subsection for any year shall not exceed the amount of the rates made by local authorities which, in the opinion of the Government, the Board would, but for the exemption from such rates by the Electricity (Supply) Acts, 1927 to 1981, of certain property of the Board, be liable to pay for that year in respect of that property.</P>
    <P>(3) Moneys paid to the Minister for the Environment under this section shall be paid into the Exchequer or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in such manner as the Minister for Finance thinks fit.</P>
    <P>In my view it would be better if the board was rated like other owners of property rather than the Government making a stab at an approximate charge.</P>
    <P>If the board find it difficult to produce cheap electricity a lot of the blame for that is due to the way it is managed.  Since 1973 the cost of electricity has rocketed due to inflation and the huge increase in the price of imported oil, but other matters must be taken into consideration. The Minister should tell the House the amount of natural gas that will be supplied to the board and the effect the provision of such cheap fuel will have on the price of electricity.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the board on the development of their consultancy service throughout the world.  The board have made a big name for themselves by taking on contracts in many foreign countries. The work of the board in this regard should be followed by other State and semi-State bodies.  Yesterday we discussed a Bill relating to the planning and development, and in that regard I wonder if the time has come when the ESB should have regard to the planning and development laws as far as the installation of electricity is concerned.  I am referring to the erection of electricity poles and the carrying of cable over ground.  I am aware that in new housing estates the ESB put <Col N="2590" /> all their cable under ground, but I wonder if they could do more in general in regard to environmental planning.</P>
    <P>I understand that almost 100 per cent of houses are connected to the ESB, but we should go a little further and complete the job.  It must be remembered that in the past some old people refused to accept a subsidised supply when it was passing their homes.  The result is that the young people who now occupy those houses do not have an electricity supply. It is desirable that every effort be made to give them a supply.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also concerned with the fisheries activities of the board.  I was pleased to hear that the board proposed to extend their aquaculture activities particularly in regard to salmon rearing. That move is welcome because in recent years salmon catches here have fallen drastically.  In fact, since 1975 the salmon catch has halved.  That drop is due to many factors, including matters outside our control such as the Faroese catching our salmon as they passed through the waters adjacent to their islands.  The EEC should investigate that matter.  We also must contend with a lot of poaching and unfair fishing practices indulged in by some fishermen.  That should be stamped out.  I was pleased to hear that the Mulroy bay venture was a success and that the amount of salmon produced by the board is in the region of 50 tonnes per annum. I was also pleased to learn that the target is 100 tonnes per annum.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that salmon fishing is a great attraction for tourists and the breeding of salmon should be encouraged.  Many people wonder why the ESB are involved in fisheries.  The reason is obvious.  The first source of energy used by the ESB was the River Shannon and that involved the control of fisheries on that river.  The Board's concern about fisheries now extends to the River Erne.  I am in favour of giving the board every encouragement in their fisheries operations, particularly aquaculture for which there is a big future.  This is a limited debate and I do not wish to drag it out further.  I hope we will be given some brief period for a Committee discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome the Bill.  Deputies on all sides will agree that the ESB are one of our better State-sponsored bodies, being in the top five in terms of professional competence, managerial structuring and general ability to discharge their functions. It is in that setting that I will comment on a number of aspects of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us it is estimated that the amount of new borrowing required by the ESB to meet the capital programme between now and 1985 will be £735 million, the sum specified in the Bill.  Therefore, the amount of money involved up to the beginning of 1989 is very substantial for capital investment, and a number of questions must be asked. We should be told about the likely sources of money, whether the Departments of Finance, and Industry and Energy have had discussions about the phasing of the borrowing.</P>
      <P>We are now in 1982 and by 1985 £735 million will have been borrowed.  Therefore, the House is entitled to be given a breakdown of the major capital borrowing in that time.  Possibly we will not be here reviewing the overall borrowing requirements of the board for a number of years. Today, with the international money market being so expensive and domestic capital savings being so sparse, it is essential we should be given this detailed information if we are properly to assess the exercise outlined in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year I supported the decision of the previous Government to request the ESB to pay £10 million this year in respect of rates.  I have always held that all our State-sponsored bodies should bear full liability for normal commercial rates, and I am surprised that the Government now have concluded that the special circumstances of the ESB should render them liable for only a fixed payment annually in lieu of rates.  I should like the Minister to tell us what he regards as special circumstances in this case.  Special arguments have been put forward from time to time in regard to special circumstances, but I hold the view that all our semi-State bodies should be <Col N="2592" /> run with efficiency, high profitability, dynamic management and committed work forces, and with very clear terms of reference.  I say that the ESB should be obliged to pay rates.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that it has been decided to amend certain provisions of the ESB Superannuation Act of 1942.  It is good to know that the doubts that existed regarding the powers of the trustees of the superannuation committee to invest in property have been brought into line firmly and that appropriate amendments have been clearly set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are very pleased at the continued expansion of the ESB's profitable fisheries activities.  I am glad that for the first time in the history of the board's activities in this field they are being allowed to expand from salmon hatcheries, cultivation of trout and eel fishing &mdash; the ESB are our principal eel exporters &mdash; and that it has been recognised that aquaculture can make a considerable contribution.  Section 9 of the Bill gives statutory power to the board to engage in general aquaculture activities. With such tremendous investment in their hydro-stations, the board are ideally situated to diversify from salmon, eel and trout fisheries into the profitable national resource of aquaculture both in the open seas and in inland waters.  I have strong views on that and I am pleased to know that that is recognised in this legislation. It is a progressive measure and I hope there has not been any internecine warfare between the different Departments of State regarding the general diversification of the activities of the ESB.  In that context again this is a progressive Bill.</P>
    <P>There are two or three aspects I want to refer to in relation to this Bill.  The Minister indicated that in 1982 the total expected capital expenditure by the board is estimated at over £230 million of which £125 million will be spent on generating plant and about £87 million on transmission and distribution networks. We all know the general refurbishment and the capital development works being done by the ESB in relation to our national network.  But we should have from the Minister, if possible this morning, a breakdown of the £125 million <Col N="2593" /> being spent on generating plant this year. These moneys are very substantial.  The board is one of the major expenditure components of our public capital programme and it would be of interest in mid-1982, as we are about to enter into adjournment, to a breakdown of the £125 million for generating plant.</P>
    <P>The Minister also spoke about the diversification by the ESB away from oil as a primary energy source.  The Minister rightly pointed out that in this context we expect to see the new coal-burning facility at Moneypoint coming on stream.  The magnitude of the Moneypoint development is not appreciated by politicians here.  We should be told this morning the total capital cost of Moneypoint.  I have an admiration for the way the ESB can build our generating capacity here.  If the ESB say they will build a power station for £64 million, it might work out at £64.5 million or £65 million and there are no overruns.  I remember having lengthy discussions with the late James Kelly who, tragically, died rather young.  As chief executive of the ESB he had a tremendous managerial ability.  The board and the chief planners spent money without having massive overruns on general capital expenditure.  Their capacity to plan, to develop and to construct is quite extraordinary.  Indeed our other semi-State bodies could usefully follow that example.  But Moneypoint is a very major development and we should know how it will be phased in and the actual expenditure there.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicates that he is concerned, as we all are, about the effects on the balance of payments of Moneypoint. I do not know how many millions of tonnes of coal we will have brought in for Moneypoint.  I would like to know the anticipated coal imports for the first year of operation.  These would be very substantial and will have a substantial impact on our balance of payments, counterbalanced of course by the fact that we will not be importing oil.  It would be of particular interest to have that information.</P>
    <P>The Minister disclosed a rather interesting figure here: the proportion of our installed generating capacity depending on oil.  The proportion, which stood at 54 <Col N="2594" /> per cent a year ago, now stands at 51 per cent, and by the end of the decade it is anticipated that it will be down to 35 per cent.  That brings me to the question of the use of natural gas by the ESB.  I am subject to correction on this but, as I understand it, the ESB are currently getting natural gas from An Bord Gáis at about half of the conventionally oil-related, energy-related price.  The energy-related price per therm would be over 30p in terms of petrol.  It is in the national interest that it should be known that the ESB will be paying about 15p.  I have a view about that kind of development. I firmly believe that all our State bodies, whether it be Bord na Móna selling turf to the ESB or An Bord Gáis selling feedstock natural gas to the ESB, should charge the full energy-related price.  If as a result of charging that An Bord Gáis or Bord na Móna make a handsome surplus &mdash; in the case of An Bord Gáis I would think it would make an extra £20 million &mdash; then the Exchequer has this money and the Exchequer can then decide to subsidise the price of electricity.  The Exchequer then has control of the situation and the full commercial value of a very valuable, scarce natural resource accrues directly to the State.  Otherwise we will have hidden internal energy subsidies which will be unknown to the public at large and which will be assumed by the boards of State-sponsored bodies to be their natural right and this in the long run is not conducive to general efficiency.  I would ask the Minister to give us the information in that regard because I do not believe in what I would call artificial accounting in State-sponsored bodies by giving such bodies a transfer subsidy of that nature with the approval of the State.</P>
    <P>That brings us to the overall generating capacity of the ESB.  There has been a fair amount of comment on this.  I would like to know how much spare generating capacity there is in the ESB at peak winter season with Moneypoint on stream. Will it still be 25 per cent or will it be 30 per cent or will it be 40 per cent?  There is no doubt that, despite very careful planning by the ESB, they now have very substantial surplus generating capacity in <Col N="2595" /> their system.  There was a 10 per cent growth in electricity demand each year but in the late seventies and early eighties there appears to have been a decline in the growth of consumption.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the decision of the Government to proceed with a 45 megawatt station in Arigna using local low grade coal.  This was also the decision of the previous Government.  Even if there is great growth in electricity consumption, the ESB have very substantial surplus generating capacity with Moneypoint coming onstream and they are anything but enthusiastic about the new Arigna station.  They would have preferred to put it off into the late eighties and hope that politicians might forget about it.  The project has been brought forward and we should know the cost of this development and the date on which the station is likely to come onstream. We should also know whether the Minister is satisfied that the proposed technology is reasonably efficient.  I must confess that I have some doubts about the exercise as a whole and I do not regard it as an integral part of the so-called diversification programme of the board.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The Government have, in fact, decided that the position on electricity prices generally should be fully reviewed, particularly in the light of recent reports that, at least in some respects, our electricity prices compare unfavourably with general levels elsewhere.</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  It is one of those statutory sentences that civil servants feel they may be required to put at the end of a Minister's speech when he has nothing else to say but wants to convey the impression that he might do something if the thought struck him.</P>

      <P>It sounds impressive. <Col N="2596" /> It is a classic piece and I suppose Deputy Kelly would call it &ldquo;tautology&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to state:</P>
      <P>I am arranging to have this review carried out and I will be taking a personal interest in the results.</P>
      <P>The best of luck to him.  There is a need to have electricity prices &ldquo;under continuous review&rdquo;, to use the classic phrase, but I should like to know what the Minister means, and perhaps he would clarify the point.</P>
      <P>I wish to compliment the staff of the ESB on the work they are doing abroad. A large number of them have been involved in major international capital development projects in countries such as Saudi Arabia and Bahrain and in other countries involved in Ireland's development aid programme.  They have also been involved in independent consultancy projects.  I have the highest admiration for ESB engineers, technicians and general staff who have in the past decade gone abroad and won expensive international contracts for consultancy services and the commission, design and construction of works.</P>
      <P>I wish to record my admiration of their work and my direct encouragement to the board to expand in this way.  By the mid-eighties our transmission network will be virtually complete and will only require maintenance and refurbishing. When the programme is complete the staff of the ESB will seek international pastures and the kind of consultancy work they have been undertaking.  I have no doubt that they will discharge their functions with equal competence.</P>
      <P>I regret that the late Jimmy Kelly will not be there to advise the Minister in the years ahead but I accept that the board of the ESB as now constituted are competent. The chief executive is an extremely competent person and his senior executive staff are highly efficient.  As one of the arch critics of the State sector and yet one of the arch supporters of that sector, who demands the highest from it and will give the highest support in return, I am pleased to welcome this Bill on behalf of the Labour Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill should not be much more than a formality and should involve little more than tidying up aspects of legislation which have become outdated in the 28 years since the last such Bill was enacted.  It should simply make it possible for the ESB to borrow the amounts which are adequate for their programme of capital investment.  If that were the only purpose of this Bill, then the figure of £1.6 billion would be seen as adequate for the amount of capital investment needed and we could wave this Bill through, making critical or complimentary comments about the ESB and our national energy policy.  However, there are aspects of this Bill which I find deeply disturbing, particularly section 7 which imposes an arbitrary open-ended tax of £10 million on the ESB, with every certainly that this sum will be increased in succeeding years.  I object both to the principle of what is being done and the way in which it is being done.  There is no point in saying that this idea originated with the last Government because I know this to be the case, but I still think it is a bad principle.</P>
      <P>I wish to make five brief points on this aspect of the Bill.  First, there is the general question of whether the ESB should pay rates on their generating plants.  Up to now they have not done so, for a number of reasons.  In the early stages there were some difficulties of demarcation between local authorities but the principle was accepted that Ardacrusha and the other generating plant were seen as national property and great national assets.  Ever since rates have not been levied on generating plants.  The Minister knows, particularly from his own constituency, that these plants have been located in underdeveloped areas and have played a major part in providing jobs.  The contribution of the ESB, from Ardnacrusha on through the various turf programmes and rural programmes of the forties to the ambitious programmes of the sixties and the seventies, has been part of a pattern of national economic development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it wise in the national interest to introduce a new tax on this form of development? It is a tax on national properties <Col N="2598" /> which are located largely in depressed regions.  Obviously it has been decided to bring in rates by the back door, and we must now look at the way in which the money to be levied is to be assessed.  How was the sum of £10 million arrived at? Was it just taken out of the air by the last Government and regarded by this one as a fair figure?  How does it compare with rates charged on similar plant in Northern Ireland or Britain?  Can the Minister, with his hand on his heart, say that it was arrived at after a detailed examination of such properties all over the country?  I doubt it.  It was a handy figure and one which can be increased as the Exchequer desires.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (2) (b) gives the Government the right to decide what the amount should be.  The words &ldquo;in the opinion of the Government&rdquo; are objectionable because they confer on the Government power of a most arbitrary and open-ended kind.  Why involve the Government at all?  If the ESB are to pay rates, the rate should be decided by the proper rating authorities, that is, the local councils in each area.  This may be cumbersome but there will be some consistency in it.  It will put the ESB on the same footing as other bodies.  The Government, which will collect the tax, will also decide what the amount will be on principles of a very vague nature&mdash;I am sure purposely vague &mdash; which have been incorporated in the Bill.  I am sure the Minister, on reflection, would agree that this is a bad and unfair provision.  It is open to abuse and will be abused by Governments in the future as they search for new sources of revenue.  If the section is to remain and rates are to be levied a fairer, more consistent and open method of assessment should be arrived at rather than &ldquo;in the opinion of the Government&rdquo;. We should have something more honest and straight forward.</P>
    <P>What will happen to the money which ultimately will be taken from the electricity consumer?  If it was rates &mdash; the word is not used in the Bill but we are talking about rates &mdash; it would go to the relevant local authority to improve their finances. As everyone knows, particularly the Minister <Col N="2599" /> for the Environment, local authorities have never been so starved of money, but not a single penny will go to local authorities.  Will the money go to the Department of the Environment which collects it?  If it did and could be used for some purpose associated with electricity such as putting wires underground or improving the environment in areas which were scarred in the production of electricity there would be some point in it.  However, that is not the case.  The money will go straight into the endless empty coffers of the Department of Finance to be spent as the Exchequer thinks fit.  In other words, we are not talking about rates to be used for local development in areas where the plants are situated but about a new back door arbitrary tax on those who are customers of the ESB.  This money, which the Government feel is necessary, should more appropriately have been part of the Finance Bill and debated and voted on as such.</P>
    <P>A semi-State body is being involved in the collection of taxes directly for the Government.  The cost will not be borne by the ESB but by the consumer.  It is ironic that the Minister in the gobbledegook referred to by Deputy Desmond or the &ldquo;Albert speak&rdquo; which others might call it, says nothing but has many nice platitudes wishing the best for everyone without saying how it will be done. In that sentence there is almost a promise that electricity charges will be kept down or at least will not be allowed to get out of control.  The fact is that the £10 million which must be raised this year will lead to an increase of 2 per cent in the cost of electricity.  As we are so late into the year, the cost will probably be 4 per cent this year to the consumer.  How can the Minister square that with his exhortation to do good and keep prices down?  He is bringing in through the back door a provision which will raise the cost of electricity by 2 per cent and possibly by 4 per cent.  That is a fact.  Is the Minister serious when he urges industry to keep down its costs and yet imposes this savage and unnecessary new tax?</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is very busy and <Col N="2600" /> has enormous responsibilities.  He is one of the most hard pressed Ministers in the Government, with a huge range of responsibilities which in general he is carrying out very well.  I do not believe he has given this section the thought which, as a businessman, he should.  Does he realise the full implications of this section on the electricity consumer and the cost to the already hard pressed industrialist?  It is a bad tax.  It is badly introduced and badly phrased.  It is a time bomb which confers arbitrary powers on Government and will seriously affect the autonomy and development of the ESB. I am not exaggerating.  I am merely giving the implications of what is involved.  I do not wish to be obstructive.  This has been decided and we are merely involved in a rubberstamping exercise.  It would be much better if we had a committee system in the House where experts could be sent for and we could have detailed questioning. I know the Bill is necessary to allow the ESB to borrow money which is needed for capital investment.  I resent the way in which urgent legislation is used to sneak in a new backdoor tax.  I do not make this case in any party political way. I know it was under the last Government that this idea originated.  I know there was approval for it and that this Government adopted the idea.  It probably originated from the very competent gentleman on the Minister's right or his colleagues in the Department of the Environment and the Department of Finance.  The last Government might well have done what this Government are doing.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look at the points I have made, and I will raise others on Committee Stage.  I should like to congratulate the ESB on running a very efficient service.  Their consultancy service has been extremely successful, especially in Third World countries, and is an example to other semi-State bodies of what they can do to earn money and to help developing areas at the same time.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Desmond, I am concerned about the financial transactions between the various State sponsored bodies engaged in the energy sector and <Col N="2601" /> the costs paid by the ESB for gas and turf.  There is a certain amount of behind the scenes activity which should be fully aired, because we need to have the proper facts and figures which underlie our full energy policy, if there is such a thing.  This is not the proper forum for a detailed discussion on the matter.  This question should be discussed in detail in committee, and I hope that when the new committee on State sponsored bodies finally meet, they will turn their attention to some of the matters raised here this morning.  Apart from that serious reservation, I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank all the Deputies who took part in this debate.  I agree with the last speaker that there are certain points here which could be the subject of longer debate and thrashed out in detail in committee.  I have not enough time to cover all the points in detail.  I should like to take this opportunity to join with other Deputies who have spoken in complimenting the ESB and paid tribute to the late Mr. Jim Kelly who made a marvellous contribution, not just to the ESB, but to the development of the national economy.  Of course, his successors are also excellent people.  They have secured vital contracts and export earnings abroad, sold our services to the Third World and underdeveloped countries and paved the way in physical and financial planning.  Deputy Desmond paid a tribute to them for having the least overrun in the semi-State sector.  I am very conscious of overruns and what has been happening in semi-State sectors in recent years.  I have already announced that I have established a monitoring system which will enable me to get information on a monthly basis instead of waiting for two years.  We know that, in the past, information was not available to the Minister or to the House, and this falls in line with the thinking here in relation to the borrowing powers that have been set, that it will probably last for approximately one-and-a-half to two years.  Some people argue that you should give them very large scale borrowing so that they do not have to come back to <Col N="2602" /> this House for five or six years.  I do not agree with that argument.  I think they should come back very often and be subject to scrutiny so that we can monitor their whole operations.  That is why it has not been extended more than we felt was necessary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick asked about total outstanding borrowings.  The split up of £840 million is as follows &mdash; £210 million from native sources and £630 million from foreign sources.  The £200 million is sufficient for approximately two years, and that is the better way forward. Deputy Fitzpatrick also asked if there was a change in relation to the trustee security investment.  There is no change in that regard but, from time to time, the Minister for Finance declares certain investments under law to take place.  In other words in the case of new investments created by the Minister for Finance under law they can go ahead and invest in them without the approval which was necessary up till now.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> That is the trouble.  I do not agree with the Minister's interpretation of the section. Section 8 (a) invites the board to invest in trustee securities and (b) in such other manner as the trustees, with the approval of the Minister for Finance think proper.  If that meant new trustee securities, it would not be necessary to say so because they would still be trustee securities.  Obviously, this is something other than trustee securities which the Minister may permit them to invest in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the major questions raised, and which was dealt with extensively by all Deputies, was about the ESB paying rates.  A sum of £10 million was mentioned.  I believe the original thinking in relation to not levying rates on the ESB was to give them an opportunity <Col N="2603" /> of getting off to a good start.  In the sixties an interdepartmental committee was set up and recommended that rates should be applied to the ESB in line with CIE, Aer Rianta and other semi-State bodies.  Gas companies and oil refineries pay rates and they are also selling energy.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to get into a political argument, but the last Government, when they were drawing up the Estimates, wrote a figure of £10 millions into the Appropriations-in-Aid of the Department of the Environment Estimate.  I inherited those Estimates and I have to deal with them as best I can.  There is a lot in what Deputy Manning said, that this is more appropriate to the Finance Bill, where the opportunity would arise to argue on the basis as to whether it is right or wrong in the first instance.  I do not think the ESB should be exempt from paying rates.  The figure of £10 million is sufficient for this year, but there is always a danger that when you put in a certain figure like that, Deputies will ask what will happen in future years.  The figure that is intended to be collected from the ESB will never be more than they would be paying in rates.  The reason I have adopted this position is because of the last point raised by Deputy Manning, that it can add significantly to the cost of electricity. This is another area in which I must be concerned when wearing the industry hat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come back to the three or four lines that seem to mean nothing to Deputy Desmond.  From the way he read it one would not expect him to take much meaning out of it, nor would Deputy Manning. The core of the whole problem is competitiveness in ESB charges and the competitiveness of energy in Irish industry. Let us deal with the rates situation first. The case has been reasonably established, not alone in the sixties and seventies or even in 1975, that they should be rated.  Let us concentrate on where the ESB stations are, in Clare, in my constituency and elsewhere.  To rate them in the normal way would be unfair and impracticable because certain local authorities would be given a complete windfall if the ESB were subject to rates <Col N="2604" /> in the normal way and the whole central situation would be distorted.  Furthermore, ESB costs, rises in prices and expenses as an allowable cost come into the arena also.  On balance, while we can argue about it being an arbitrary tax the best result can be achieved by the amounts being collected centrally and paid in centrally.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have the opportunity of ensuring that it does not distort the electricity cost in future.  They must also bear in mind in fixing the figure the effect which Deputy Manning rightly says it will have on the allowable cost for the ESB.  It will have to be part and parcel of the examination of electricity costs every year when it comes up to see what part it will play. Otherwise we must rate them totally and give a windfall to four or five local authorities who would have an unfair advantage over everybody else.  I am satisfied that the Central Exchequer could not demand anything from them under law, because the percentage is already fixed for local authorities, who would have a windfall, and consumer electricity prices, if we did not have a mechanism for controlling it, would be affected seriously.  That is why we have gone along this road.  As Deputy Manning said, if we had an outside committee we might be able to devise a better system.  However, I have inherited the situation but I think I can achieve better control in the area of electricity prices and in a fair dispersal of the money.  The argument that the ESB should not be rated will not stand up.</P>
    <P>From time to time and in recent reports comparisons have been made of the cost of energy in Ireland in relation to industry with costs in the EEC and how we have gone out of line.  Many times very unfair comparisons are made &mdash; for instance, with France which produces a significant amount of its electricity by hydro, or with Germany which uses nuclear power.  We are not comparing like with like.  Another area of contention for a long time is the double depreciation of ESB accounts.  I have taken a particular interest in this. While the sentences might not be written in a manner which would appeal to Deputy Desmond or Deputy Manning, it <Col N="2605" /> means a review of the whole situation, taking into account the comparisons that must be made, realising that Irish industry must be competitive in every situation and that we must be seen to make our contribution in the area.  A start has been made in the recent price increases granted to the ESB.  The increases did not apply to the night users and a significant reduction was made to the people on night reduction.  This was a contribution into the area of restoring competitiveness in energy charges.  Basically involved in that is the review of energy costs to industry and how we can keep them competitive in a competitive world.</P>
    <P>I was asked for details of the £125 million.  The breakdown is as follows: Moneypoint, continuing work on the three 300MW units to be commissioned in 1985-86, 1986-87 and 1987-88 respectively, £85 million; North Wall Station, continuing work on construction of two 100MW of new peak load capacity in the form of combustion turbines due for commissioning in October 1982, £13 million; Lanesboro' Power Station, construction work on a 40MW extension to existing peat-fired station, £12 million; Shannon-bridge, construction of extension to existing peat-fired station, £7 million; Aghada, County Cork, clearing up operation on site of new gas-fired station which was commissioned in 1981, and work on installation and purchase of new combustion turbine to be commissioned in 1982, £5 million.  The total cost of the Moneypoint operation which is very significant and which, I agree with Deputy Desmond, is not appreciated generally, is estimated at £678 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not available to me here but I will make it available to the Deputy.  On the question of the make-up of energy sources, in 1980 oil was 64 per cent, in 1981 it was 55 per cent and for the year ended March 1982 it was estimated at 40 per cent; peat, 16 per cent in 1980, 16 per cent in 1981 and estimated this year to be 13 per cent; gas, 11 per <Col N="2606" /> cent in 1980, 20 per cent in 1981 and 36 per cent estimated in 1982; hydro, 8 per cent in 1980, 8 per cent in March 1981 and 9 per cent estimated for 1982; coal, 1 per cent in 1980, 1 per cent in 1981 and estimated 1 per cent in 1982.</P>
      <P>The Deputy talked about the growth in patterns of consumption.  I do not want to go back too far, but the tables showing the demand for increases and the growth in energy requirements in 1977 was + 10.7 per cent, in 1978 + 8.1 per cent; in 1979, + 8.7 per cent; in 1980 + 7.5 per cent; in 1981 - 2-3 per cent; the figure for 1982 is not ascertainable at this time. This shows a heavy growth pattern right through the seventies and this is one reason for the big expansion in the ESB capacity.  I agree in general with Deputy Desmond that we must watch the capacity that will be required in future years and look at the peak-load situation.  One advantage of gas is that it can be a quick switch-on and switch-in, while the situation with turbines, oil and so on is a 12-hour build-up.  With the introduction of more gas stations we will have a quick switch-in and a quick switch-out.  When we talk about load peak we are talking about providing for very bad weather such as we have had within the last 12 months and which we can always have again.</P>
      <P>On the question of coal imports, the requirement of Moneypoint will be approximately 500,000 tonnes building up to approximately 2 million tonnes.</P>
      <P>I have dealt to some extent with the question of prices in respect of gas to the ESB and of supply at peak times.  There is not sufficient time to permit of my going into this area in more detail except to say that the price of gas to the ESB is a subject that is being negotiated.  The price will have to be related to heavy fuel oil prices since by and large the ESB use heavy fuels.  Of necessity, there will have to be discounts to the ESB in respect of plant conversions and so on.  It must be said that if the ESB were not there as a customer the Kinsale Head development and the Cork-to-Dublin pipeline would not have been put on stream so soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked, too, about the Arigna situation.  This project is expected <Col N="2607" /> to come on stream in about 1988 or 1989. I do not have sufficient time to give an account of what my judgment might be on the crow coal development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the provisions in social welfare legislation relating to the disqualification for receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance of persons who are involved in a trade dispute.  A number of recent disputes have highlighted this area of social welfare legislation and the case was put forward, arising from those disputes, that the particular provision in question is inequitable in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>A trade disputes disqualification has been a feature of unemployment insurance from the outset.  The general principle has been that unemployment resulting directly from a trade disputes in which the claimant is involved should not give him a title to unemployment benefit.  This principle was based on the concept that the Social Insurance Fund should be neutral in relation to disputes.  This general principle is a feature of unemployment insurance systems generally.</P>
      <P>In Irish legislation the fundamental principle of disqualification for receiving benefit of persons involved in a trade dispute has been in existence since the introduction of insurance against unemployment in 1911.  Changes have been made from time to time but these have been of a relatively minor nature and have not affected the basic principle.  The latest amendment was made in 1967 and was designed to ensure that a dispute in which a person was not directly involved would not cause him to lose unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions we have in our legislation what the deciding officer or appeals officer in the case must decide is whether there is a trade dispute in existence. He is not required to make any judgment on the nature of the dispute or its merits.  If he finds that there is a trade dispute the persons involved are disqualified from receiving benefit.  There are separate provisions in the legislation which <Col N="2612" /> provide that where a person loses his employment by reason of misconduct or leaves his employment without just cause he will be disqualified from receiving benefit for a period of six weeks.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt however that all trade disputes are not the same and that the elements which give rise to a dispute can differ from one dispute to another. The general principle of disqualification for unemployment benefit of workers engaged in a strike is, I am satisfied, a sound one.  What I am not satisfied about however is that this principle should apply automatically in the case of all disputes. To do so would be unfair in certain circumstances and this is the situation I have set out to remedy by means of this Bill.</P>
    <P>This position has been highlighted in a number of recent disputes and in consequence I have reviewed the existing provisions in detail.  It is better to face up to the problems arising from a limited number of particular trade disputes rather than to allow the present unsatisfactory situation to remain.  The amendment I am putting forward in this Bill is limited in scope and is designed only to redress the situation where workers are available for work, capable of work and willing to work but are deprived of their employment in what might be regarded as an unfair manner.  This could happen for example where an employer lays off workers without proper consultations or without utilising the industrial relations machinery normally availed of by those prepared to follow good industrial relations practices.  There is also the situation where an employer by unilateral and arbitrary action seeks to impose an unwarranted worsening of terms or conditions of employment on his work force. The workers concerned may then find themselves unwillingly caught up in an industrial dispute situation where no real effort has been made to employ normal industrial relations procedures.  The automatic disqualification of the workers concerned from unemployment payments which is a feature of our existing legislation in such circumstances is unduly harsh and inequitable.</P>
    <P>The provision being made in the Bill <Col N="2613" /> does not involve any change in the existing situation whereby unemployment benefit or assistance is not payable where industrial action in the traditional sense is taken by employees.  The purpose of the provision is to set up separate machinery to deal with unemployment benefit or assistance entitlements in the situations I have outlined in the immediately preceding paragraphs.  The new machinery will be separate from the existing social welfare decisions and appeals machinery and will come into operation only where a person fails to qualify for benefit under the existing provisions.  The existing machinery provided for in sections 35 and 142 of the Consolidation Act would continue to be used and a deciding officer or an appeals officer, as the case may be, would decide, as heretofore, in cases where a worker loses his employment, regardless of whether a trade dispute existed.  Depending on the decision unemployment benefit would be allowed or disallowed.  If the decision were to disallow benefit then it would be open to the workers in relevant situations to have their cases referred to the Social Welfare Tribunal proposed in this Bill for adjudication. The tribunal would consider the various elements present in the case and would adjudicate on whether the workers lost their employment in circumstances that the tribunal considered to be within the provisions of the Bill and whether unemployment benefit should in consequence be paid.  This decision of the tribunal would be binding on all parties.</P>
    <P>In the procedures proposed there would be no intention of adjudicating on the merits or demerits of the fundamental industrial relations problem at issue. Rather would it be a question of investigating the manner in which workers had been deprived of their employment and all the circumstances surrounding this. This would be the kernel of the matter which would have to be evaluated by the tribunal and in doing so the actions of both sides to the dispute would be taken into account by the tribunal.  The tribunal would be representative of the interests of employers and employees and would have the expertise necessary to enable them to examine the various elements in <Col N="2614" /> a dispute and adjudicate on whether the workers involved had been unreasonably deprived of their employment, with particular reference to the question as to whether normal industrial relations practices had been observed.  The Bill does not tie the tribunal's hands with regard to the matters which they should consider in arriving at their adjudication.  Trade disputes have tended if anything to become more complex in recent times and it is often difficult to see where the responsibility rests in particular situations. I am satisfied however that the proposals in the Bill represent a reasonable solution to the problem and I hope I can rely on the goodwill and co-operation of all concerned in the matter.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the provisions of the Bill will be brought into effect by order. It is my intention to give effect to the provisions without delay as soon as the necessary arrangements have been made to establish the tribunal and to determine the procedures to be followed in the conduct of its business.  With this in mind I recommend the Bill to the House for speedy and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael have grave and serious reservations about the provisions of this Bill as at present drafted. I believe there is a real danger that its provisions may have the effect of encouraging and prolonging strikes, something that is not in the interest of employees, employers or indeed of the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to this Bill is relevant because it seems to me that it constitutes a political response by the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Government to a situation that arose some time ago when a commitment was given, without any consideration having been given to the consequences of its implementation.  My views in this regard are borne out by an exchange which took place in this House on 6 May last when, during Question Time, Deputy Gallagher of Waterford confirmed to the House that a commitment had been given him by the Minister for Finance in the presence of the Minister for Social Welfare.  In fact Deputy Gallagher referred to a written guarantee <Col N="2615" /> having been given by the Minister for Finance in the presence of the Minister for Social Welfare to amend this legislation. At that time he was pressing for immediate steps to be taken in that regard and he was assured by the present Minister that he need have no worries about it.</P>
    <P>I am concerned therefore that legislation can be brought into this House in this rushed manner with a background of a commitment having been given to the Workers' Party without regard to the overall consequences of its implementation. It is clear to me that this Bill must therefore be construed as the price of the support of the Workers' Party for the present Fianna Fáil Government.  In that context there is a danger that we have here a situation of the tail wagging the dog without regard to the consequences for the country as a whole.  I am concerned that legislation should be rushed through this House with that background, with a commitment having been given to the Workers' Party without its implementation having been thought through.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the desire of the present Government to ensure the continued support of the Workers' Party.  But where there is a danger that the price of that support may amount to a possibility of a worsened industrial relations environment, a danger of strikes being encouraged, then I feel the price of that support is too high.</P>
    <P>I recall as late as Thursday last asking for a draft of this Bill in this House, at which stage it was not even available. Today the Government propose putting through all Stages.  As a general principle I do not believe in rushing legislation through this House, because rushed legislation <i>ipso facto</i> is bad legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not permit time for consultation, for representations, discussion or reflection on its various aspects.  It is ludicrous to suggest that a Bill such as the one before us &mdash; which is complex in that it interferes with existing <Col N="2616" /> arrangements &mdash; can be properly dealt with in a couple of hours in this House. I believe further that we are not doing our job as legislators in putting through legislation in this manner.  I want to protest in the strongest possible manner at the approach adopted in this case.  It is clear that the draft of the Bill was not even available last Thursday.  It is further clear, from a reading of the Bill, that it has been put together in quite a slipshod manner.  I do not blame the parliamentary draftsmen in this regard.  The normal procedures imply that a Bill will have a Second Reading and that some time thereafter amendments will be put down, discussed on Committee Stage, when the parliamentary draftsmen will be afforded an opportunity of improving it as it progresses. No such opportunity exists at this stage unless we can provide amendments today.  If the Government insist on putting through this Bill today I do not believe it will be in the interests of the country that it should form part of our permanent legislation.  Therefore, I put down an amendment this morning proposing that the Bill would lapse after six months at which stage, if in the light of experience at that time the Bill is found to be in good order and workable, we can have a further full and proper debate here and we can re-enact the Bill.  I put down that amendment proposing a lapse after six months with that in mind, so as to ensure that at the end of this year or early next year we shall have an opportunity of a proper, full debate.  Indeed it might be said that at that stage we shall have the benefit of six months operation of the provisions of the Bill as at present drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question arises as to whether the provisions of the Bill may serve to encourage strikes, the general position in this country being that, where there is a trade dispute, unemployment benefit is not payable to the workers participating in such a dispute.  This goes back to the beginning of the century, the idea being that the payment of unemployment benefit might encourage the prolongation of such disputes.  Quite rightly, I believe, there is a provision that such workers' dependants will not be left in a situation <Col N="2617" /> in which they will suffer as a result and such dependants are therefore able to obtain supplementary welfare.  However the basic provision in this country is that no benefit is paid while a strike continues. Lest we might think we are unique or that it might be suggested that this has an exceptional record in this situation it is relevant to point out that in all EEC countries workers involved in industrial disputes are precluded from receiving unemployment benefit.  If I might synopsise, the general thinking in Europe in this regard is that this is so because workers' unemployment in that situation is regarded as being voluntary and is therefore considered their responsibility rather than that of the State.</P>
    <P>The general thinking in Europe is that this is not so because unemployment in that situation is regarded as involuntary and, whatever about the philosophy behind it, it is relevant to note that this is generally the position right throughout the EEC.  There is in Belgium provision whereby in exceptional cases benefit may be paid to workers involved in an industrial dispute where the employer is at fault either in failing to observe agreed dispute procedures or a lock-out takes place before such procedures have been exhausted.  That is the only provision in Europe which provides for an exception to the general rule of no benefit being payable during the course of a strike. That has been the position here since the beginning of the century, modified to ensure that the dependants of workers on strike do not suffer adverse consequences as a result of that strike and so they are able to claim supplementary welfare during the course of the dispute.</P>
    <P>We shall have to think again and examine our philosophy if we are making a major change which this Bill, as drafted, may do.  We will have to consider the effect on our industrial relations and the effect on development if the result of the Bill is, unintentionally perhaps, to encourage strikes because of the payment of unemployment benefit to those on strike.  I can accept to some degree the good faith of the Minister when he talks about hard cases.  I do not believe he wants to open up the situation to abuse. <Col N="2618" /> While I have to question the background and the circumstances in which the commitment was made, I still believe the Minister will probably try to ensure that the tribunal and its decisions will fail in only very isolated cases.</P>
    <P>There is an old adage which says that hard cases make bad law.  The Minister mentioned some recent instances in which apparently injustice was done to workers.  I do not propose to discuss the merits of the global dispute or, indeed, of the Comer dispute.  I do not know all the facts and so I do not think it would be proper for the House to argue the facts.  That is not the way in which this House operates.  There may be instances which give rise to injustice.  I do not know.  The latest instance in Comer was one in which a specific commitment was given by the Minister.  Whether he examined and adjudicated on the merits of the case I do not know.  I shall certainly not try to do so.  The facts are known to those involved and, as in many industrial relations situations, they are quite complex. My basic approach is that hard cases make bad law and any attempt to introduce provisions to meet such situations will have to be very carefully considered and given such careful deliberation as will ensure that such provisions will not be used or abused for other purposes.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to the earlier point I made about legislation being rushed through here.  We are not giving this Bill the careful deliberation it deserves.  The Bill is not &mdash; indeed it could not be &mdash; carefully drawn because of the time factor involved and I see a danger of the Bill being used and abused for purposes other than those intended.  Amendments are required to social welfare legislation generally. There are a number of areas which need to be carefully examined and amending legislation introduced.  If there are genuine cases where workers are treated unfairly we shall have to examine how injustice can be remedied but I do not believe the problem is resolved by rushing through here a Bill which can be abused.  What we need is an examination of the various problems and a Bill designed to deal with those problems. We know there are abuses.  We have a <Col N="2619" /> situation today in which employees, because of income tax, PRSI and tax rebates, are better off on social welfare benefits than they would be if they did a full week's work.  Is the Minister aware of that?  Is he concerned about it?  Does he intend to do anything about it?  If we want to get the country going again, a country of which we can be proud, surely we cannot stand by and accept a situation where people are better off on social welfare than they would be if they were working.  The same argument applies to what is known as the three-day week where in certain situations people drawing three days' pay and three days' unemployment are better off than they would be if they worked a five-day week.</P>
    <P>I ask the same questions in regard to that situation.  Is the Minister concerned about it?  Can he do anything about it?  The instances I have mentioned need to be carefully examined and the necessary steps taken to ensure that that type of situation in which people are actually encouraged not to work is ended. What we need in the social welfare area at the moment is not legislation purporting to deal with just one problem, legislation rushed through here in one day, but rather a review of all the problems. The manner in which we are expected to deal with this Bill serves to highlight the dangers of making political promises without regard to the appalling consequences that may ensue.  It serves to highlight the dangers of rushing in with an apparent solution without teasing out the consequences.  What should our aims in this area be?  I believe that in a situation where we have more than 150,000 unemployed our main aim must be to get more people at work.  Certainly one of our aims must be to have as few people as possible on strike.  For that purpose we need a proper industrial relations environment, changes in the attitude of management in many cases and changes on the other side of the fence also.  We need those changes so that in the overall interest of the country we will have a better industrial relations environment.</P>
    <P>How can we justify spending hundreds <Col N="2620" /> of millions of pounds to encourage people to set up industries here unless we can at all times be constantly aware of this problem and trying to ensure that our industrial relations environment is improved?  It is worth stating, although it is a truism, that without employers there would not be any employees and unless we can continue to encourage the establishment of industry here, unless we can continue to convince people that workers and employers can provide a proper working environment, we are doomed.  It is worth making that point in the context of this Bill.  What we are talking about when we are dealing with the payment of unemployment benefit is not just a glib situation of the State paying people.  We are talking about getting our workers to contribute through PAYE to others who are not working.  When one sees demands on the public purse for one reason or another it must always be borne in mind that whatever comes out of the public purse has to be put into it and that a major contributor to the public purse today is the PAYE sector.  Any further demands on the public purse will inevitably result in greater burdens on that PAYE sector.  I do not believe it is in the interest of those who are working and paying PAYE that we should indiscriminately pay moneys out of the public purse if that may result in an extra burden on them.</P>
    <P>We should remember when we are discussing this Bill that we are not talking about the employer paying out money, we are talking about the State paying out money in certain situations.  If I was asked for a synopsis or label of my views in regard to this type of legislation, a label that I would fairly accept is that I am pro-worker but anti-strike.  My outlook in discussing any legislation will be motivated by that approach.  In a strike situation it is important that the focus and emphasis should be on the Labour Court and its various bodies to find a settlement. I see a danger in the Bill, as it is drafted, that that focus and emphasis will swing from the Labour Court to the new social welfare tribunal.  I see a danger that the initial reaction of anyone involved in a strike or a trade dispute <Col N="2621" /> situation will be to get this tribunal to adjudicate as soon as possible on the rights and wrongs and ensure that, if possible, a finding is obtained against the employer so that social welfare benefits will be obtained.  If that happens, is there not a danger that strikes and trade disputes will be prolonged?  Is there not a danger that the attention in regard to a strike initially will be focused on this row as to who was right or wrong, as to the entitlement of the workers to unemployment benefit?  In that situation the whole emphasis will swing away from the Labour Court and its associated bodies who are there for the purpose of seeking a fair settlement to the dispute along established and well tried dispute settling procedures.</P>
    <P>Since 1946 we have had industrial legislation which set up and operated a voluntary system to provide for conciliation and settlement of a dispute through the Labour Court, Rights Commissioners and conciliation services.  The system has proved very successful in what is agreed to be a difficult industrial relations environment. As the Bill is drafted, a tribunal will decide on the reasonableness of an employer's behaviour in a trade dispute. Once it does so, is there any reason why an employee or a trade union would bother discussing their grievance any further at conciliation or at the Labour Court?  They will already have in many cases an adjudication on their situation and why then should they bother with the Labour Court?  That must be a major worry to anybody who is interested in finding a fair solution to the problem mentioned by the Minister and who, in the short time available, has been considering the effects of this Bill.  We must ensure that Pandora's Box is not opened and that tried and tested industrial relations procedures are not thrown out the door.  We must ensure in our efforts to provide a solution for hard cases that this is not the effect.</P>
    <P>On that basis I put down a series of amendments which I believe will allow a solution to be found for the hard cases but, at the same time will prevent the new procedures from being abused for the purpose of generally encouraging or <Col N="2622" /> prolonging strikes.  Every Deputy in the House wants to see our people at work, workers getting a fair deal from their employers and employers getting a fair return for a fair day's pay, and proper industrial relations.  At the same time, there is a feeling that we should try to seek a solution in which justice will be evident to all.  On that basis, let us ensure that the Bill we are putting through will deal only with injustices in industrial relations.  We must ensure that existing procedures will be used before there is recourse to the tribunal, that claims will have been examined by both deciding and appeals officers of the Department.</P>
    <P>If the tribunal are to consider the case of the employer and to adjudicate thereon, is it not incorrect that the conduct on the other side of the fence should not be opened and looked at so that the reasonableness or otherwise of the employee will be looked at?  This makes sense, and as a former practising lawyer I have always felt that one does not get the full sense of a case or the full story until one has heard both sides.  Therefore, the tribunal should be directed to examine specifically both sides and the reasonableness of the case on both sides.</P>
    <P>More important, I believe we should provide that the emphasis will not be taken away from the Labour Court and their associated bodies.  We must continue to provide every encouragement to employers and employees to have recourse to the Labour Court in their search for solutions.  I am afraid that the Bill as drafted may result in the tribunal supplanting the Labour Court at least in the early stages of disputes and that the Labour Court efforts to look for early solutions will be hampered.  Therefore, I should not like the tribunal to make decisions unless and until it can be shown that the machinery under the trade union Acts will have been availed of, that the officials of the Labour Court will have been consulted in the interests of good industrial relations, and that it has been shown and proved that either employer or employee has not done that.  If workers are prepared to resort to the Labour Court and to co-operate fully with industrial relations procedures, should not the <Col N="2623" /> employers be subjected to the same procedure if they are shown not to have been willing to have recourse to the Labour Court, and vice versa?  In my view it would be improper that this tribunal would supplant the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the reference in the Bill to the findings of the tribunal being final and conclusive.  I know of no law passed in this country which provides that the findings of such a body should be final and conclusive, and it is improper that we should ever provide that the findings of a non-judicial tribunal should be final and conclusive &mdash; there must be recourse to the courts on points of law.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the review procedure. There is a provision that an application for a review shall be by a person interested, but the Bill does not specify who is to be &ldquo;a person interested&rdquo;. I would be anxious to ensure that the Minister, who represents the public purse, would be entitled to a review if a material change of circumstances occurs. After all, it is the Minister who will be making any payments that will result from the findings of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the lack of definition of the position of chairman.  The Bill clearly lays down that two members from both employers' and employees' representatives will be selected to act on the tribunal, but the Bill is silent on the position and the qualifications of chairman. It does not set out his term of office. I have already referred to the hasty manner in which the Bill was drafted, and because the tribunal will have quasi-judicial functions I suggest that the chairman should be a judge of the Circuit Court or the High Court.  The Bill provides for the taking of evidence on oath in certain circumstances and it lays down that a person giving false evidence before the tribunal will be guilty of perjury.  In that situation it is important that the chairman would be a person who would be able to adjudicate personally, who would have judicial experience in adjudicating.  That is why I suggest the Bill should provide that the chairman be a judge of either court.</P>
    <P>Another major point relates to the time for debating the Bill in this House. <Col N="2624" /> I would have wished that the Bill would have gone through Second Stage today and the remaining Stages at some future date.  It appears now that we are not to have a Committee Stage.  I know that the Dáil is rising tomorrow and I am aware of the Government's intention of ensuring that this Bill goes through this House before the recess.  In that situation the Bill should have a time limit of six months and be amended accordingly.  It may be that the Bill, particularly if it is amended on the lines on which I think it should be amended, will be an effective Bill and will not have the effect of encouraging strikes, as I fear it will.  If that is the situation, well and good.  If we have isolated the injustices and ensured that we have the machinery to cope with them then, on the renewal of this Bill, we would have very little difficulty with it. We would also have the benefit of the six months period of operation, we would have had an opportunity of deliberating with various bodies and hearing their views and we would be able to put through a Bill in the normal way to form part of our permanent social welfare code.  But I do not believe that that can be done today.  The solution, therefore, is to put a time limit on the Bill and to take up the matter again towards the end of that time limit.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, is that I will be formally proposing amendments along those lines later and I would hope that the Minister will be prepared to accept those amendments, perhaps not in the words in which they are put because I am not a parliamentary draftsman, but perhaps he would accept the spirit of the amendments.  As the Bill stands there is a positive danger that it will achieve far more than the purpose for which it was intended, that it will encourage strikes when our whole minds should be devoted to discouraging them.  In that situation I would not feel as worried about the Bill if the amendments which I propose are accepted by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I want to be a little critical of the Minister at the outset for the undue delay in bringing this measure before the House.  This measure was <Col N="2625" /> promised earlier this year.  The problem that sparked off the controversy about this measure occurred in Clover Meats which is on the borders of my constituency in Carlow-Kilkenny and the Waterford constituency, where workers were deprived of their employment because of failure to agree to conditions of employment which would have been less favourable to them and would have been detrimental to them and were deprived of social welfare benefits.  I received an assurance from the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Eileen Desmond, that steps would be taken immediately to amend the legislation that was preventing the social welfare benefits being paid in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>I want to refute the allegations that were made at that time that the Minister had the power to make an order to enable social welfare benefits to be paid.  That was not so.  The present Minister could not do it and the last Minister could not do it.  But that was used as a criticism against me when I was a candidate in the last election.  The fact that the Minister is here today with this legislation proves that he could not have made an order declaring that social welfare benefits be paid in those circumstances and that the power rested with this House to make such a decision.  That is what we are here to do today.  I regret that it has taken so many months to bring forward this very urgent and necessary legislation.  If I were on the Government side of the House I would not tolerate such a delay in implementing a measure of such urgency.  It took some pressure over the past number of weeks from a number of Deputies here to get the Government to commit themselves to carrying out this promise.  The former Minister for Social Welfare made this commitment but when this problem came to the fore the Dáil was dissolved. But rather than prolonging the dispute at that time it helped to shorten it.  That is what this legislation does.  It will avoid disputes rather than creating them and it will encourage settlements of this kind of dispute much earlier than would have been the case in the absence of this amending legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a popular belief that workers <Col N="2626" /> have far too much protection from the law and that employers are at their mercy to a great extent.  The events of yesterday, when a number of trade unionists were jailed for carrying out union activity, prove my point that the laws are very much weighted against workers, organised and unorganised.  However, in the past two years we have had a number of laws passed which, to some extent, balance things a little bit.  We have the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Anti-Discrimination Act, the Minimum Notice Act and other Acts such as the tightening up of the Holidays (Employees) Act.  These were only passed in recent years.  Still I do not think anyone could argue that the employee is statutorily in a stronger position than his employer in the present situation.  Here again this is repeated in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act which did not change anything but just brought together all the previous Social Welfare Acts.  But section 35 in that Act gave an unfair advantage to the employer over his workers.</P>
    <P>Nobody is arguing that people who take a decision to go on strike for improved wages or better working conditions should get social welfare benefit. This is not what the Bill is about.  It is about rectifying the position where an employer wants to disimprove the working conditions of his employees and uses the Social Welfare Acts to achieve that aim.  In such a situation the workers wish to continue working under existing agreements and the employer enforces a change which is detrimental to them.  At present he is aided by section 35 of the Social Welfare Act.  If it is fair to say that the social welfare laws should not prolong strikes or assist strikers, then it is equally fair comment that the law should not be used to help an employer to impose detrimental working conditions on his employees.</P>
    <P>It is most important that this matter be rectified, because workers involved in such a dispute will be slow to settle if they are also being deprived of other entitlements such as social welfare benefits.  The previous speaker mentioned various other areas of the social welfare code where he would like to see changes.  As <Col N="2627" /> public representatives we hear many cases of workers who make a claim at the employment exchange and then find that their employer has not complied with his end of the bargain by having his insurance records and his PRSI contributions up to date.  This problem is growing, judging from the number of replies from the Department to the effect that they have no records covering the governing year while a person was in full-time employment.  The need for other changes in the social welfare code should not delay the passage of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I can list many shortcomings in the social welfare payments scheme, such as the bleak period faced by redundant workers over 40 years of age until they qualify at 65 for an old age pension.  Such people have little chance of finding employment in current economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should like an assurance from the Minister that the provisions of this Bill will cover the workers in Castlecomer who have been out of work since 15 March last, although they have been most willing to work.  If for any reason they are not covered by this Bill I would ask the Minister for an assurance that he will bring in a further amendment.  These are precisely the kind of people who should not be deprived of social welfare benefits. It was possible by another means to make payments to the workers in Clover Meats and the Government may have experienced a certain kind of complacency, feeling that the problem would not arise again.  I regret that it has arisen and will do so again unless this legislation is passed.</P>
    <P>The problem tackled by this Bill is essentially concerned with social welfare and it is not directly involved in industrial relations.  The problem cannot be resolved by the Labour Court.  I do not agree that the courts should be brought into this matter.  I have yet to see an industrial relations problem being solved by a court decision.  Such decisions give rise to more industrial relations problems than anything else.  These problems must be solved by common sense on the part of representatives of both employers and <Col N="2628" /> employees rather than by technicalities and points of law.  Sometimes they are compatible but at other times they are not.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the chairman of this tribunal should be a person of common sense, not tied up by legal definitions and technicalities and not having his work adjudicated upon by a court of law.  The Minister might tell us how the chairman will be appointed and the qualifications he considers desirable.</P>
    <P>This amendment will prevent further disputes of this kind.  Provision has been there since about 1952 but it was only discovered on a large scale in recent times.  Corrective action is now being taken to ensure that there will not be abuse of section 35 by employers.  This will contribute enormously to good industrial relations and prevent rather than create problems in that field.</P>
    <P>In common with other Deputies I received a submission from the FUE yesterday evening.  I cannot accept some of their points, because we have seen the necessity for this legislation.  In the two instances we can refer to, section 35 as it stands did nothing but prolong the disputes in question.  That runs contrary to the view expressed by the FUE that the establishment of a tribunal would lead to prolongation of industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>The FUE also submit that it would worsen the industrial relations situation because not only would the employer be contesting that his action in the matter was not unreasonable but he would also be contesting the right of workers to social welfare payment.  That already exists under section 35.  Are the FUE aware that what they are talking about exists in practice through the appeals procedure? An appeals officer invites the employee, employer and representatives, if necessary, to an appeals hearing and they thrash out the pros and cons of the claim for unemployment benefit.  The FUE's reference to that aspect is incorrect.</P>
    <P>I should have preferred to see a simpler Bill and one that would short-circuit the system.  Problems of this kind are urgent and do not lend themselves to prolonged references to appeals officers, deciding <Col N="2629" /> officers and tribunals.  The procedure should be speeded up.  Nothing hinders the settlement of a dispute as much as delays in the machinery which is available for its settlement.  Sometimes that machinery becomes overloaded and cannot deal with the problem as quickly as it might.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  If it does not meet the requirements I will be back looking for whatever amendments are necessary. I hope the Minister will assure us that he will amend it further if, for some reason, it does not meet the requirements.  This Bill has been described as one to pay people who are on strike or give them social welfare benefits.  That is not what it is about.  It is a Bill to provide social welfare benefits for people who are out of work because of a decision by their employer to prevent them working and achieving conditions of employment which are more favourable than those in operation.  Unfortunately the Bill is necessary. Its introduction will assist industrial relations.  It is not the function of the Labour Court to decide entitlement to social welfare benefits.  It was never intended that section 35 of the Social Welfare Act should have been interpreted in the way it was by deciding officers, appeals officers and the courts.  I do not criticise them for that.  Their job is to interpret it as they see fit, but they are answerable for their interpretations. Once the courts interpreted it in a similar way there was no option but to change the legislation.  I hope the Bill will pass quickly through this House and the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to confirm that provisions of the Bill will enable employees in Castlecomer to receive their unemployment benefit from the date of their claim Monday, 15 March 1982.  The real purpose of the Bill is to correct injustices of that kind.  It is not to give any group an unfair advantage.  It is a measure to take away any unfair advantage which might unconsciously have been inserted.  Now that it has been discovered, it is the duty of the House to remove that unfair advantage.  We should not give the employer the advantage of being able to enforce changes on workers <Col N="2630" /> with the help of the social welfare code by reason of the fact that they would be starved into submission.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it will deal with the problems it is intended to deal with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Waterford) Mr. Gallagher (Waterford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> We should be clear in our minds as to what we are discussing.  This Bill is a measure to rectify a serious loophole in the 1981 Social Welfare Consolidation Act where workers were in the case of Clover Meats and are in the case of Castlecomer, County Kilkenny, being denied their just entitlements because of the interpretation of Department officials of what constitutes &ldquo;a trade dispute&rdquo;.  Contrary to the opinions expressed by Fine Gael today, this Bill does not and will not give a <i>carte blanche</i> to workers to be paid social welfare while on strike.  It was never the intention of my party in seeking this amendment, or indeed of the other parties, to bring about such a situation. There have been mischievous, misleading and damaging statements from the media over the last few months and in the document which I received this morning from the Federated Union of Employers.  They give the impression that what is being sought is <i>carte blanche</i> to pay workers while they are on strike. I categorically refute that statement.  Section 35 (1) of the Social Welfare Act is rigid, unbending and unyielding in its definition of what constitutes a trade dispute. Employers have discovered this definition and are forcing through changes in working conditions and practices on foot of this Bill because they know if workers are denied their social welfare benefits &mdash; only getting the bare minimum in supplementary social welfare &mdash; they will only be able to survive for a relatively short period of time and will have to go back to work.  They would then have to accept conditions which will be written and drafted from the point of view of the employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amazed at the contribution by Deputy O'Keeffe.  He stated that he was not in a position to discuss the circumstances of the Clover Meats or Castlecomer situation because he did not know <Col N="2631" /> the background.  Yet he came into the House and pontificated on the merits and demerits of this Bill.  I listened carefully to him and he is simply regurgitating the document circularised by the FUE.  I got a copy of that document from another source yesterday but I only received a copy from the FUE this morning.  Deputy O'Keeffe has seen fit to quote me in regard to a question which I tabled to the Minister, but he deliberately omitted to state that Deputy Deasy and Deputy Collins, both front bench spokesmen for Fine Gael and conspicuous by their absence here today, in conjunction with me, tabled questions to the Minister for Social Welfare asking for exactly the same type of amending legislation which we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>The questions concerned are Nos. 22, 23 and 24 which were answered on Thursday, 6 May 1982.  Deputy Deasy asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he would amend section 35 (1) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act to allow for the payment of unemployment and pay related benefits to workers such as those in Clover Meats, Waterford, where there was a failure to agree on terms and conditions of employment but where no industrial action was involved.  Deputy Eddie Collins asked the Minister for Social Welfare when amending legislation would be introduced to remove the anomaly in the law which originally prevented the workers in Clover Meats, County Waterford, from receiving unemployment benefit.  Of course it is one thing to make promises at local level but it is another thing to come in here and back up what they are seeking.</P>
    <P>It would be a worthwhile exercise if I illustrated the background to the Clover Meats dispute.  It might enlighten Deputy O'Keeffe as to the circumstances which led to this amending legislation.  In Clover Meats, because of the live export of cattle from the port of Waterford, the raw material was not forthcoming to the Clover Meats factory.  Consequently, the management tried to bring about a change in working practices and conditions which were unacceptable to the workers.  Because agreement could not <Col N="2632" /> be reached, the management handed the workers their cards.  As a result, the workers went to the local labour exchange, made a claim for unemployment benefit and the manageress referred the matter to a deciding officer in Dublin, who decided that a dispute existed.  This was upheld on appeal.  Is Deputy O'Keeffe aware that the management of Clover Meats and the workers testified to the deciding officer and to the appeals officer that no dispute existed?  I wonder was he aware of those circumstances when he spoke about giving a <i>carte blanche</i> to workers to get unemployment benefit and that that would lead to a prolongation of strikes?  That is absolute nonsense, and he should have been properly briefed before he spoke in such a manner.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made in relation to the previous Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Eileen Desmond, and her interest in this matter.  I was not elected to Dáil Éireann when the issue of Clover Meats came up and there was no hint of a general election at the time.  In my capacity as an elected representative to Waterford Corporation, in conjunction with other members of the city council, various representations were made to the Minister to bring about a resolution of a very serious problem whereby 350 people and their families were denied the barest necessities and entitlements.  Some of these people had up to 35 years ongoing contributions in PRSI and PAYE payments and all had enjoyed good industrial relations with the management of Clover Meats.  On behalf of my party, I made various attempts to contact the Minister of the day through letter, telegrams and a score of telephone calls.  It would be easier to get an audience with the Pope than to get a communication from the Minister in question.  She seemed to be totally unmoved by the sufferings of these families in Waterford.  We then had the general election, and when I was elected I received permission from my party to raise the matter with the leaders of the three main parties.  I want to make this quite clear so that there will be no charge of making deals or pacts with anyone.  I wrote to Deputy FitzGerald, Deputy <Col N="2633" /> Michael O'Leary and Deputy MacSharry, the former Minister for Agriculture. I asked them for their observations and what their party commitment would be towards amending the legislation, if they would accept the principle that the legislation in itself was defective and that when it was amended compensation and retrospective payment would have to be made.</P>
    <P>Our party had discussions with Deputy O'Leary, Leader of the Labour Party, in which he stated that amending legislation was &ldquo;currently being formulated&rdquo;. That is an exact quotation of what he said then.  I accepted that in good faith, but on the following day we had discussions with the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy FitzGerald, who refuted that completely and said that Deputy O'Leary had it wrong and that, far from amending legislation being formulated and retrospective payments being made, nothing could be done in this instance and that his advice from his officials was that it would be a dangerous precedent to set.  Then I met Deputy MacSharry and he did not see any problem.  Now the Clover Meats factory is open and giving gainful employment to workers who are back at work where they should be and compensation has been paid.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation being introduced and I welcome the Bill.  On behalf of The Workers' Party I am pleased that the Minister has seen fit to honour the commitment he has given.  Despite the reservations expressed by the Fine Gael Party, I do not see that this legislation would be subject to abuse.  I ask the Minister in his summing up to make clear the intention of the Government to set up this tribunal immediately and to tell the House when the regulations to be set in train with the Bill will be ready.  I ask him, finally, to come to an agreement with other speakers in relation to the functions, powers and capabilities of the chairman.  It is important that the chairman of this tribunal be versed in industrial relations procedure and have the necessary expertise.  I do not agree that a judge of the High Court would be a proper or fitting person to engage himself <Col N="2634" /> in the complex area of industrial relations, and to appoint such a person would be a detrimental step.</P>
    <P>Do the Castlecomer workers of south Kilkenny come under the terms of the amending legislation now before us?  The Castlecomer situation is different from the Clover Meats situation in that the workers there accept that initially a dispute existed but after two weeks and after the intervention of the union concerned a compromise was reached and the workers decided to go back to work.  On reporting for work they were faced with a completely different set of working conditions and practices and the manager, with full knowledge of the Clover Meats history, told them that they could please themselves, they could either accept the new conditions or the factory would remain closed.  He was sure that if the factory remained closed the workers would not qualify for social welfare benefits, and that is what happened.  Over a hundred workers in Castlecomer, County Kilkenny, were denied for approximately 19 weeks every penny of social welfare benefit to which they were entitled.  They were subjected instead to depending on supplementary social welfare which would barely keep body and soul together.  A fair percentage of the workers in the Castlecomer firm did not qualify for any benefit whatsoever.  I ask the Minister in his summing up to give a categorical assurance that the Castlecomer case will be placed before this tribunal as a matter of urgency and that if the tribunal see fit to adjudicate on behalf of the workers and come to the conclusion that the situation of the workers has been exacerbated by the attitude of the employer, then full and total payment of the social welfare benefits for the 19 weeks which they were denied will be paid.  I ask the Minister to be clear and unambiguous on that point.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is a positive step. It is not retrograde, contrary to the line that the Fine Gael Party are taking, which to me is a cause of wonderment.</P>
    <P>For the record of this House, this debate commenced at 12.30 p.m.  Two Deputies in the Fine Gael front bench represent the Waterford constituency <Col N="2635" /> and they were very vocal in their condemnation of the treatment of the workers of the Clover Meats factory and in calling for this amending legislation, but they are not present in this House now at 2.05 p.m. to make a contribution on this legislation which is of fundamental importance to working people.</P>

      <P>I would not give this legislation the praise that Deputy Gallagher has heaped on it.  I see the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 1982, and the Bill we dealt with last week, the Trades Disputes (Amendment) Bill, 1982, as just more <i>ad hoc</i> legislation in which we are trying to deal with important areas of labour law, and on this Bill social welfare law and labour law as they intertwine, in an <i>ad hoc</i> way, not thinking fully of the implications and consequences of the legislation we are enacting.  Fundamental reforms are required within our social welfare code and labour relations laws. This is an unfortunate Bill.  I understand why it is being introduced and the difficulties experienced by the workers in Clover Meats, but the function of this House is not to deal with one isolated problem.  The function of this House is to provide legislative mechanisms which apply here and now and which will apply to all trades disputes as they arise in future.  There is a need for a complete overhaul and review of our industrial relations legislation.  There is need to blow away many of the cobwebs attached to it and to bring it in touch with the realities of industrial problems as we find them at present.  I deplore the fact that the Trades Disputes (Amendment) Bill, 1982 last week and this Bill before this House today are being dealt with in a manner in which all Stages are passed through the House in one afternoon, in which there is no real time to consider amendments to the Bill, in which this House is effectively asked to rubber-stamp a Bill, prepared by the <Col N="2636" /> Minister's office, to which no real consideration can be given.</P>
      <P>We are undermining the legislative function of this House by the manner in which legislation is being dealt with.  A whole series of important measures which have had relevance in the social, economic and labour area over the past six months have been rushed through for all sorts of semi-plausible reasons when, if we had reformed the procedures of this House, they could probably have been passed through this House just as quickly but would have been given more detailed consideration.  I am not going to list all the legislation that I would regard as coming within the ambit of that comment in the context of this debate, because so little time is being given to this debate and it would be unfair to colleagues in this House to do so, but this House should never be asked to complete all stages of a Bill in one day.  No matter what the importance of legislation is, once Second Stage has been completed, Committee Stage should not take place until all Members of the House have been given the opportunity of considering what was said during Second Stage and in particular what was said by the Minister in introducing the measure and giving his reasons for the need for the legislation. I intend illustrating my reasons for saying this in the course of my contributions on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that the Minister means well in so far as this Bill is concerned, but some of the comments he has made about it are not accurate.  In addition, I expect that some of its consequences are not fully foreseen by the Minister.  It should never have been agreed that a Bill of this nature should be put through all Stages in one day.  The fact that we have come to the end of term should not mean that every last vestige of business that the Government wish to have passed should be passed.  Neither should it mean that the House should cease functioning until the end of October.  If the Government wished to have this Bill through before the adjournment there was no reason for not having the House sit for another couple of weeks.  That would have allowed time for proper consideration to <Col N="2637" /> have been given to the Bill.  Proper consideration should have been given, too, to the Trades Disputes (Amendment) Bill which we passed last week.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us is an ill-conceived and poorly-drafted measure.  It will have the effect of undermining the conciliation and arbitration procedures established under the Industrial Relations Acts.  The Minister has suggested that that will not be the case and says he is not providing anything new in the Bill, that he is merely trying to remedy an injustice.  There is an old saying that hard cases make bad law. That applies particularly in this instance.</P>
    <P>Starting with the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, we have established down through the years a whole series of mechanisms for conciliation and arbitration through rights commissioners and the Labour Court.  When a trade dispute arises it is usually the wish of all parties concerned that the dispute be resolved as rapidly as possible with the minimum amount of damage being done to the industry concerned and that as little confrontation as possible takes place.  This Bill will bring into effect a social welfare tribunal, a new body whose help will be sought in sorting out the rights and wrongs of trade disputes, without the tribunal having the capacity to do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech that the provision being made in the Bill does not involve any change in the existing situation whereby employment benefit or assistance is not payable in cases in which industrial action in the traditional sense is taken by employees.  The Bill will involve a fundamental change in the existing situation because it will mean that whenever a trade dispute arises, instead of the procedures available under the Industrial Relation Acts being used, there will be an enormous temptation on the part of unions and of workers to seek to prove, before going to the Labour Court, that an employer has been unreasonable in his behaviour.  This Bill could result in an automatic rush to the social welfare tribunal, the other procedures having been gone through, to seek to get that sort of adjudication.  Rather than involving the Labour Court and the rights commissioners in a form of arbitration <Col N="2638" /> and conciliation, this will result in automatic confrontation between employer and worker where the worker will try to establish that he is totally in the right and the employer will try to establish that the worker is totally in the wrong.</P>
    <P>Lest what I am saying should be misrepresented as merely spouting the FUE line, we all know that industrial disputes are very often like marital breakdown in that there are wrongs on both sides, that steps that both sides could have taken to avoid a dispute reaching the stage at which industrial action is taken, are not taken.  I would defend workers in this sort of situation because very often they are put in a position by an employer whereby they have no choice but to resort to industrial action.  On the other hand, we often have the situation in which industrial action and strikes are resorted to much too quickly, but when they are resorted to we should seek to ensure that the proper mechanisms within our labour legislation are used instead of having some social welfare tribunal being used as a form of review or justification mechanism.</P>
    <P>The effect of this mechanism, though I do not believe this is the intention of the Minister, will be to exacerbate the confrontation aspect of industrial disputes. In this regard I would refer to the reviewing powers that the tribunal will have.  If at some stage the tribunal, having been asked to intervene, decide that the social welfare payments were made rightly, or alternatively, that the employer was not being unreasonable, which means in effect that the employees were unreasonable, there is power for the tribunal to review their decision as the industrial dispute continues.  Therefore, there could be a situation where not only were the procedures provided by way of the Labour Court avoided but whereby once the tribunal had given a decision that would not appeal to the employees involved in the industrial action, they can continue to go back to the tribunal asking for a review of the original decision on foot of some change in circumstances having taken place.</P>
    <P>This piece of legislation could have a disastrous effect on labour conciliation <Col N="2639" /> and arbitration services.  The Minister, referring to the procedures proposed, said that there is no intention of adjudicating on the merits or otherwise of a fundamental industrial relations problem. That cannot be the case.  If the tribunal decide that an employer has been unreasonable that in effect will be a judgment on the merits of the industrial relations problem at issue.  To describe it as anything else is to engage in woolly thinking.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very poorly drafted.  From the point of view of an employee who is on strike and who is seeking unemployment assistance, the Bill may not even provide the protection it is designed to provide.  I say this because it has the same sort of a fault that is inherent in much of the legislation that has been passed in this House in the time I have been here, that is, that it is an extremely woolly measure which is not fully and properly drafted. There are no substantive provisions telling the tribunal when they should or should not adjudicate in favour of an employee within the terms of the Bill. The Minister says that the Bill will not tie the tribunal's hands in respect of matters they should consider in reaching their decisions.  The Minister says this as if it is something meritorious, as if we should create tribunals and tell them that they have enormous discretion, that they may look into their hearts or their inside jacket pockets and decide in their wisdom whether it was appropriate to make a decision in favour of a particular applicant.</P>
    <P>Legislation establishing a tribunal should contain strict and definitive provisions that determine the manner in which the tribunal should make decisions. We should state strictly the law governing those decisions.  That is not the case so far as this Bill is concerned.  It is Kafkaesque in the extreme.  An employer might find himself trying to justify his actions before the tribunal without knowing what criteria at the end of the day the tribunal would apply in determining his case one way or the other.  I do not believe that constitutes a merit.  Indeed, I believe this is yet another example of <Col N="2640" /> hastily produced and rushed legislation. I have no doubt that within 12 months an amending measure will be before the House designed to try and resolve the difficulties and problems this Bill will create. I believe we shall have before us a measure spelling out in far greater detail the exact circumstance in which the tribunal can make a decision one way or the other.</P>
    <P>The tribunal will have extensive powers. It will have power effectively to <i>sub-poena</i> people to attend court.  It will have power to give notice in writing requiring an individual to attend.  An employer faced with an industrial dispute who wishes to use the existing conciliation service and does not wish to get in confrontation with his workforce or engage in argument before the tribunal as to whether he or his workers were unreasonable, may find himself <i>sub poenaed</i> to appear before the tribunal to justify his actions.  The possibility is he may be questioned in detail about fundamental matters appertaining to his firm, to its operations or employment.  He may be required to give details about his business of no relevance whatsoever in the context of the dispute, details which could possibly be used subsequently in other circumstances. That is yet another example of the confrontation technique this Bill will introduce into the industrial relations sphere.  If an employer is <i>subpoenaed</i> to attend before the tribunal and does not do so he will be liable to conviction for a criminal offence.  I believe, and I am sure Members of this House will agree, that criminal law should not be involved in industrial disputes.  It is wrong that it should be involved in the manner in which this legislation envisages.</P>
    <P>Why is there a need at this stage to establish a new social welfare tribunal of this nature?  The Social Welfare Acts provide for a deciding officer and an appeals officer.  It may be argued it was desirable to ensure employees receive social welfare payments in the sort of situations this Bill is designed to meet.  Why could that not be dealt with in the context of the existing deciding procedures?  The establishment of this tribunal is an indication that it is accepted by the Government <Col N="2641" /> that the tribunals which presently sit to deal with and determine applications are inadequate in that there are no proper provisions at present for people to be formally represented in the context of decisions made in secret by the deciding or appeals officer, decisions remote from those most nearly involved in them.  Why is there a need to establish a special tribunal to deal solely with this particular area?  Should there not be a more comprehensive approach?</P>
    <P>In the context of the tribunal the Minister envisages two persons appointed to represent trade unions and two to represent employers.  I hope the Minister will tell the House what the attitude of employers is to this legislation.  Has the FUE agreed to nominate persons?  Is there a possibility this tribunal may be boycotted by employers who regard this as supernumerary to the industrial relations procedures that exist?  Could it be that this will be a white elephant?  We are in process of passing a Bill in two or three hours which may never be implemented at all because of the possibility of employers not being willing to co-operate in the establishment of the suggested tribunal.</P>
    <P>I believe there should have been more consultation.  I believe there should have been greater consideration given to the effects of this Bill on overall industrial relations.  There is yet another aspect that can be regarded as part and parcel of the confrontation aspect in labour relations. I refer to the awarding of costs.  The tribunal will have power to award costs and expenses in a totally undefined way. How will this operate?  Extensive and comprehensive aspects requiring to be implemented should be dealt with by substantive legislation.  They should not be dealt with by way of statutory instrument or regulations introduced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I deplore the manner in which important areas of legislation have been dealt with in some few hours on a single day over the last two weeks.  A Bill to deal with the injustices this measure purportedly seeks to remedy could have been passed by the end of this week if proper procedures were available.  The time has come for the establishment of a whole <Col N="2642" /> series of select committees to process legislation in an expert and detailed manner, dealing with amendments on the basis of representations from those affected and dealing with those amendments in a manner divorced from the party political battles that go on here.  The aim should be to avoid the very real difficulties that have arisen in legislation passed by this House in the last 12 months.  By this time next year I believe we will have yet another measure before the House seeking to remedy the difficulties in the industrial relations sphere created by the enactment of a badly thought out, badly drafted and ill-conceived Bill.</P>

      <P>There is no question of a commitment.  There is a question of a very active review that is proceeding at present, which is not particular news because we have already had a discussion at the Council of Ministers in regard to it.  As I said in my reply, it is proposed to have an accelerated scheme, stepping up the whole programme of disease eradication. This will have two aspects, first a revision of the grants, and, second, a revision of the whole operation of the programme.  I have had recommendations from the Animal Health Council and these are being considered as well in the course of this review.  This matter was dealt with fully by me in a statement which I issued yesterday from which I have just quoted some of the salient factors before the Deputy came in.  If the Deputy likes, I will read the statement out.  It is a short statement and I quote:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Brian Lenihan, T. D., today commented on press reports about increasing the grants for reactors slaughtered under the disease eradication schemes. The Minister said that the existing rates of reactor grants had been fixed in 1978 and he was fully aware of the difficulties being experienced by farmers in certain areas.  The rates of grants were currently being reviewed in the context of the extension of our disease acceleration programme for a further two years.  He had also received recommendations from the Animal Health Council about the revision of the grants which are very helpful and would be taken into account.</P>
      <P>&mdash; and they will be taken into account. Then, a final sentence:</P>
      <P>He expected that this review of the grants and of the disease eradication programme would be completed very shortly.</P>

      <P>As far as the recommendations of the Animal Health Council are concerned, they are round about those figures.  The Animal Health Council have made these recommendations.  There is the accelerated disease eradication programme, of which the Deputy is well aware.  All of these matters are being considered in a very active way at present; this is current business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must be well aware, because he was present, that when I spoke on this matter on Monday night I made it quite plain that any increase in this area would have to be in the overall budgetary context and that I would certainly keep under review recommendations from bodies like the Animal Health Council, decisions taken within the Council of Ministers as to what help we could get from the EEC in regard to stepping up the programme.  All of these aspects are under very active review at present.  That is all I am saying, no more and no less that that.</P>

      <P>In regard to the latter part of the Deputy's question I should like to state that when replying to the last <Col N="2651" /> question I was referring to the updated acceleration programme with the help of the EEC.  We have made a start this year from our own resources by initiating blitz programmes in certain areas of high incidence with a view to tackling the high incidence rates that have survived over the years.  I will take on board the Deputy's suggestion about the urgent redeployment of staff from one disease eradication programme which is reaching finality to one where there are difficulties. I will have it investigated.</P>

It was spent in appallingly bad efforts to eliminate these two serious diseases.</P>

At present we are experimenting with this blitz idea &mdash; I will take Deputy Bruton's suggestion aboard with regard to the redeployment of staff &mdash; and we want other matters, such as EEC aid to step up the scheme considered.

Will the Minister agree that we have spent £125 million net over the period of eradication of tuberculosis? The way these moneys were <Col N="2652" /> expended, even the way those moneys are being expended today &mdash; leaving aside elements of compensation &mdash; in any other country would result in a public judicial inquiry as to the way politicians directed the money and the way the money was handled.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am grateful to the Minister for the reply, but I should like to know if he appreciates that in the mid-seventies we were self-sufficient in regard to eggs?  Is the Minister aware that we are now importing about 35 per cent of the eggs consumed here?  That represents the eggs of about one million hens.  The caring for those hens generate a lot of employment.  Is the Minister aware that it would take 44,000 tons of feed for that number of birds and, in terms of employment, that represents a great loss?  We are losing a lot of employment by the failure of the Minister to curtail the importation of eggs.  If the Minister finds that eggs are being sold in large quantities here below the cost of production, will he deal with the matter? Does the Minister regard that as dumping, and does he intend to exclude this unfair competition?</P>

      <P>The total value of agricultural imports in 1981 under the categories live animals, meat and meat preparations, dairy products, cereal and cereal preparations, vegetables and fruit, sugar and sugar preparations was approximately £520 million.</P>
      <P>According to statistics supplied by the Central Statistics Office £226 million or 44 per cent of these imports could be described as processed while the remaining £292 million is unprocessed items.  It is not possible to state with any accuracy the volume which reasonably could be produced here.  It is clear, however, that there is scope for replacing a certain amount of the imports by modifying our production arrangements and intensifying the degree of domestic processing, although much of the imports is accounted for by products such as citrus fruit which cannot be produced here.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 to 17, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention was that this estate would have been allocated by now.  However, due to the refusal of one of the allotments involving a substantial area, the scheme of division has to be recast and it is now hoped to divide the lands later this year.  In the meantime, it is not possible to say what form the allocation will take.  An application for portion of the lands has been received on behalf of the Maree Community Development <Col N="2661" /> Association and will be fully considered by the Land Commission in connection with the division of the lands.  There is no application from any other organisation.</P>

      <P>I should like to reply to them as quickly as possible.  Just to give the Deputy some official information, the new revised scheme is expected to be lodged inside the next few months and division of the estate is expected later in the year.  I will certainly be in touch with the community development association and will mention the Deputy's interest.</P>

      <P>To avoid duplication of inspections, a common closing date of 10 July 1981 was fixed for the EEC suckler cow premium scheme and for the cattle headage and beef cow schemes in the disadvantaged areas.  Subsequently, with the agreement of the EEC, the closing date for the Suckler Cow Scheme was extended first to 11 August and then to 15 October.  Similar extensions were granted in the case of the Disadvantaged areas Schemes.  Even though the original closing date and the two extensions were widely advertised, 297 applications under the suckler cow scheme and 35 applications under the Disadvantaged Areas Schemes were received after the final closing date.

This review will cover a large number of different areas of the country including the localities mentioned in the questions.  For the purposes of this review it has been decided that consideration should be given to townlands or to groups of townlands rather than entire district electoral divisions, as had been the practice heretofore. The Minister and the Minister of State in my Department have in recent months met deputations from many parts of the country as part of the review process. The review will be completed as quickly as possible but, in view of the substantial amount of detailed field work involved, it is not expected that the results will be ready before early 1983.

In that event, would he not now agree to push this proposal energetically, because my information is that it has been treated in a very lukewarm fashion?  Would he agree to push this proposal so that in areas where the review has been carried out, action can be taken now without having to wait for the review to be carried out in the rest of the country?  Is the Minister suggesting that there must be a hierarchy of areas throughout the country and that the last must wait until the first has been considered?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that this Bill is being presented to the House.  It is not what is required to deal with the problems which led to its introduction. The weakness in existing legislation has caused serious industrial problems over a long period, with the result that the companies in question were in danger of permanent closure.  The companies' subsequent trading was affected due to this extended closure.  Management or workers did not wish to see this situation arising.  They were landed in a Catch 22 situation due to existing legislation.  This Bill will deal with the immediate problems but I think it will create further problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned that he would like this Bill to be reviewed after six months.  I would like to endorse that because this Bill is rushed and, while it is <Col N="2884" /> adequate to deal with the problems for which it was introduced, it could create difficulties which will have detrimental effects on industrialists, employers and workers.  If there is a problem in an industry, employers and workers suffer.  It is very important that adequate legislation should be introduced which will not just deal with a situation which requires remedial action but will bring about a permanent solution.  This Bill will not bring about a permanent solution but will create many problems in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept the suggestion from our party spokesman that this should be reviewed.  This Bill was promised last February and I do not understand why it is being introduced on the day before the Dáil goes into recess.  I do not think it should be rushed through in one day.  This type of legislation needs careful scrutiny and must be approached responsibly by all sides of the House. Most people here are very concerned that an objective view should be taken.  We want to see legislation which will prevent the type of disturbance which we had in Kilkenny and Waterford recently.  It is ironic that the two situations in question, due to section 35 of the Social Welfare Act, 1980, should affect workers in Kilkenny because the majority of workers in Clover Meats live in south Kilkenny and commute to their jobs in Waterford.  In Castlecomer, over 100 workers employed in the Comer International Mills have been out of work since 15 March.  They have at this stage taken up an entrenched position.</P>
    <P>This situation should not have arisen to begin with, and secondly it should have been dealt with long before now.  This Bill should not be necessary and we should be concentrating on better industrial relations, or our industrial relations should be strengthened and these disputes should not occur.  That is where we should set our sights.  It is not always possible to have perfect industrial relations but in smaller firms, particularly where management is very close to the workers, you do not have a great incidence of strikes and the differences that arise can be dealt with on a reasonable, <Col N="2885" /> man-to-man basis.  This is what we should aim at and we should not clutter ourselves with Bill after Bill trying to plug holes. We should aim at bringing in good legislation, and I put it to the Minister that this is not good legislation, and while it is essential that this matter be dealt with immediately so that the people in Castlecomer will be enabled to resume work and this very valuable factory at Castlecomer which we appreciate very much can reopen its doors and resume normal working after six months, legislation generally in relation to social welfare should be renewed and updated.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned here earlier in debate that many anomalies exist under the social welfare code.  We all recognise this, and one thing referred to continually which every sane and rational person will agree with is that the incentive to work is being removed.  Some people are receiving more on social welfare, whether it be unemployment benefit or disability benefit, than they were earning in their employment.  There are also people, as already mentioned, who get more remuneration on a three-day week than in a full five-day week working situation.  It is not employers who are complaining about this type of situation; it is the workers, because the workers must pay for the benefits being provided for the people who are so unfortunate as to be on disability or unemployment benefit. People who are working are not prepared to accept that those people on benefit should be better off than they are who are doing a full day's work every day, who are happy to be working, who do not resent people getting good benefit but who resent the fact that such people are better off out of work, and they are demanding that the Minister take action which is long overdue to correct this.</P>
    <P>In relation to social welfare generally, the trouble is not all on one side.  Many workers find themselves disadvantaged in that for one reason or another, they cannot get their benefit when it is due to them.  Delays in decision sections in relation to unemployment benefit claims, delays in processing disability benefit claims, the fact that it is very difficult for a person from the provinces to contact <Col N="2886" /> the Department of Social Welfare due to the very bad telephone system in the Department, are all matters which need attention which is long overdue.  The disability section of the Department of Social Welfare should be regionalised. This was promised and it should be attended to.  Many problems exist for people who are on benefit, and we would all like to see these difficulties dealt with by legislation and by ministerial action.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that the Bill go through today so that people whom I represent can get their just rights, but at the same time I have reservations about its implications that any rational person who reads it must have also.  The Bill makes provision to set up a tribunal to deal with problems which arise.  Difficulties as to whether a dispute is a dispute and whether it was caused by the employer will be referred to the tribunal.  I can see difficulties here in that large number of disputes will be referred to this tribunal. I am sure the Minister envisages the tribunal dealing with one or two cases a year, but they will be very busy and I do not think that this is what the Minister set out to achieve.  The tribunal will consist of five members&mdash;two from the employers, two from the unions and a chairman. I do not think that a tribunal should be set up in this fashion or that we should have a black and white situation of two from the employers and two from the unions taking opposite views in any case put to them.  This is what automatically is bound to happen if you state specifically that a certain number of people must represent a certain opinion.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister set up this tribunal with independent people.  He might ask who is independent and who is not, an employer or an employee.  I suggest that, generally speaking, many people can be objective and that such people should be put on this tribunal to give an objective, full decision on any claim that might come before them. Under the present proposal to set up the tribunal it will be virtually the decision of the chairman that will be carried because it will be a two each vote situation in 95 per cent of the cases.  It is not fair to this one person who is chairman to ask him <Col N="2887" /> to make the decision.  Secondly, it is not fair to the employees and the firms who are required to go to this tribunal that their cases should rest on the decision of one person, and this is what we are arriving at in this type of tribunal.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in that it will deal immediately with the problems which must be dealt with, but it needs very serious consideration.  Again, on the question of local issues I trust that the Minister will be able to assure us that his amendment will enable retrospective payment to be made to the Castlecomer Mills people, because otherwise it will not be possible for them to get back to work or for that good industry to start production again.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister left the introduction of this Bill to this very late stage with the result that we are now rushing it through.  It is ironic that when the Bill was requested on Friday last we were told that it was not available&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be waiting anxiously to hear what the Minister has to say on the subject and if his reply is not satisfactory I shall raise the matter with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, of which I am a member.  As the House is aware, publication of the contents of legislation in advance of its being circulated to all Members of the House is a very serious breach of the privilege of the House.  However, I shall suspend judgment on the matter until I have heard the Minister's reply.</P>
      <P>There are a few points I should like to raise concerning the wording of the Bill. In section 1 there is reference to a situation in which a person who has been adjudicated by a deciding officer not to be qualified for unemployment assistance under section 35 (1) of the Consolidating Act may apply to the tribunal.  It would seem to me that that section should also allow access to the tribunal of an employer of a person who has been adjudged to be qualified for benefit under the provisions of section 35 (1) of the Consolidating Act.  There should not be one-sided access to the tribunal whereby only employees who are affected by an industrial dispute are allowed to appeal. Given that the tribunal will be considering both sides of a dispute, it should be only right that both sides have the right to appeal to the tribunal in the event of a deciding officer making a decision which prejudices the case of either. Clearly, if a deciding officer makes a decision which allows benefit to be paid to people who in the view of the employer are effectively on strike, that prejudices the employer's negotiating position.  We should have an equal approach to this matter and, consequently, I am asking the Minister in the interest of natural justice to amend the Bill accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of what constitutes a cause on which the tribunal could decide that a person, though he was involved in an industrial dispute, was also capable of <Col N="2889" /> receiving unemployment benefit, the Bill states that although a person may be in industrial dispute, he is capable of being paid unemployment benefit if he is in dispute as a result of some act or omission on the part of the employer concerned which amounted to unfair or unjust treatment of the applicant.  What is unfair and unjust is very subjective.  What one person might regard as being unfair and unjust might be regarded by another as being fair and just.  Therefore, it is worth saying that the Minister is incorrect in saying that in the procedures proposed there would be no intention of adjudicating on the merits or otherwise of the fundamental industrial relations problem at issue.  I do not see how it would be possible for the tribunal to decide whether the act or omission of the employer was unfair or unjust without adjudicating on the merits or the demerits of the fundamental industrial relations problem at issue because that is what goes to the very heart of deciding what is fair or unfair, what is just or unjust, on the part of an employer in any set of circumstances.  The Minister should declare clearly that what he said in his opening statement in this context is not correct in the light of the wording of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I believe that, if it is going to be possible for this tribunal to decide that a person is entitled to unemployment benefit on the basis of the criteria laid down here regardless of whether the person has a financial interest in the issue in dispute&mdash;and it is notable that the draft here says that he may be given unemployment benefit notwithstanding any other provision of this Act&mdash;that sets aside the provision in the Consolidating Act which says that he shall not get unemployment benefit if he is &ldquo;participating in or financing or directly interested in the trade dispute which caused the stoppage of work&rdquo;.  It seems to me therefore, that this tribunal can set aside, on the basis of what I have shown to be subjective and broadly drawn criteria, the entire code of social welfare which says that you do not pay unemployment benefit to people who are on <Col N="2890" /> strike or engaged directly or indirectly in a dispute the outcome of which may be of financial benefit to them.</P>
    <P>If that is what is happening it would seem to me that this is not just a Bill designed to meet a problem in Deputy Gallagher's or Deputy Crotty's constituency. We would all like to see problems resolved in their or anybody else's constituency. That is the nature of representation and our work as public representatives. However, it would appear that the whole existing code and practice in regard to social welfare is being set aside by this appeals procedure.  It is going far beyond fixing a problem in Deputy Gallagher's constituency.  I have no objection if the Minister wants to sort out a problem for Deputy Gallagher&mdash;I hope he will sort them out for me too, that is fine&mdash;so long as it does not involve a fundamental change in our national legislation which could cause unforseen problems all over the country.  I believe that that is what is at stake in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would submit to the Minister also that instead of having reference in subsection 2 (a) (i) to &ldquo;unfair or unjust treatment of the applicant&rdquo; it should read &ldquo;unfair and unjust treatment of the applicant&rdquo;.  I cannot see how both words are necessary. Perhaps it should be just &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; full stop.  I do not see why it is necessary to have two words there apparently saying the same thing.  But, presumably because they are there, they are there for a purpose because the parliamentary draftsman is, I believe, trained to economise in words as in everything else.  What is the significance of saying &ldquo;unfair or unjust&rdquo;? In my view it should be one word or both but not alternatives.  I should be glad if the Minister would explain the significance of the use of the alternative form here.</P>
    <P>Coming to the further reference in the Bill to a person being &ldquo;temporarily laid off by the employer, without, in either such case, any reasonable or adequate consultation by the employer with the applicant or with a trade union action on his behalf,&rdquo; if there is not &ldquo;any reasonable or adequate consultation by the employer with the applicant or with a trade union acting on his behalf,&rdquo; would <Col N="2891" /> that appear to be a ground for allowing him unemployment benefit?  Again I should like to ask the Minister: what is the significance of saying &ldquo;reasonable or adequate&rdquo;?  Surely the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; would be sufficient?  Is there any legal significance in the fact that the word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; has been put in as well as the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;?  This may seem to you, Sir, or to other Members of the House to be a semantic point but I can assure the House that the precise wording of this section will be poured over by the Tribunal.  They will be asking themselves the meaning of putting in &ldquo;reasonable or adequate&rdquo; rather than just &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;. The Minister should explain why he has chosen to put in both words in this instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would indicate further what he regards as &ldquo;adequate consultation by the employer&rdquo; with the person concerned or with his trade union.  It is accepted that trade disputes can arise very quickly.  For instance, if a picket is put on a plant by one category of workers whose work is so essential to its operation that the plant could not continue for another 24 hours, and the employer tells the people concerned he can no longer continue to employ them beyond 24 hours and consults with them on the matter during those 24 hours, would that be considered to be &ldquo;adequate consultation&rdquo; or would he have to go on and perhaps consult with them over three or four weeks in order to meet the requirement of &ldquo;adequate consultation&rdquo;?  The Minister needs to clarify what he has in mind in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also needs to make it clear what he means by &ldquo;a worsening of the terms or conditions of employment of the applicant and taken without any or any adequate consultation with, or any or any adequate notice to, the applicant,...&rdquo;. <Col N="2892" /> It is clear here that even if the employer has given adequate notice, he also has to have adequate consultation in regard to any worsening of the terms or conditions of employment.  We all know that a worsening of the terms or conditions of employment could mean for instance, an increase in wages, less than an increase in wages in a comparable employment, or an increase in wages less than the increase in the consumer price index over the period.  It may well be that, in the interests of competitiveness in certain industries and if the industry is to survive, increases in wages are less than those in comparable employment or less than the increase in the CPI, may have to be offered and, indeed, perhaps no more could be given in certain industries in the interests of improving their competitive position.  I have in mind here in particular the protected sector of our economy which is imposing heavy costs on the rest of our economy.</P>
    <P>If that happened, notwithstanding that it was economically necessary would it constitute a worsening of the terms or conditions of employment within the meaning of this Bill?  In the case of anybody who went on strike against such an increase being offered, which was all the company could afford but was less than the CPI or less than that being offered in some other more profitable industry, would that be sufficient reason to allow that person or those persons who were on strike to get unemployment benefit for the duration of the strike?  If that is possible &mdash; and it seems to me to be possible within the wording of the Bill before us &mdash; then clearly the State will end up subsidising all strikes, indeed perhaps subsidising strikes in pursuit of claims for increases in wages which are in excess of the Government's guidelines on what the country can afford.  If that is the case this Bill would be acting contrary to the interest of the improvement of competitiveness, indeed would be against the Government's own policy as far as increases in incomes and wages in our economy are concerned.  The Minister needs to clarify the meaning of the term &ldquo;a worsening of the terms or conditions <Col N="2893" /> of the employment of the applicant&rdquo; in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>I agree strongly with the point made by Deputy Crotty that this tribunal, because of its composition, is not a tribunal at all. It is simply a tripartite group constituted of two employers, two trade unionists and a man in the middle.  No court of law is composed of counsel for the prosecution, counsel for the defence and a judge sitting in judgment.  That is not the way in which the judicial process operates. The judicial bench is composed of judges independent of either prosecution or defence and they decide the issue independently of the case made by either side.  What the Minister fondly calls a &ldquo;tribunal&rdquo; is simply a mish-mash of both sides to a dispute sitting around a table. To my mind it is an abuse of the term &ldquo;tribunal&rdquo;.  In this context it is meaningless. I agree with Deputy Crotty that this should be an independent tribunal, with representation of neither side, guided by precisely drafted legislation.  This Bill, like so much other legislation emanating from the Department of the Minister, is very imprecisely drafted.  It leaves many areas of doubt as to what it really means. I have identified three such areas already.</P>
    <P>In regard to the staff of the tribunal, will the Minister state in regard to the appointment of staff, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, if he envisages &mdash; he must have a view on the matter &mdash; it being necessary to have staff permanently seconded to the tribunal or will temporary staff for the duration of inquiries be sufficient, such staff returning to other Departments when inquiries are not in progress?  I hope the latter will be the case.  The Minister is taking power to appoint staff, presumably permanent full-time staff, and he should indicate whether he believes such permanent full-time staff are necessary.</P>
    <P>There is provision for a fine of £100 where people are adjudged guilty of neglect to attend or a refusal to give evidence or other essential information to the tribunal.  A fine of £100 is not adequate where an employer, an employee, a trade union or a union of employers attempt to withhold essential <Col N="2894" /> information for the purpose of the tribunal coming to a determination.  The large sums potentially involved by the State under the particular section render a fine of £100 utterly inadequate.</P>
    <P>On a general basis, will the Minister indicate how this Bill will relate to the general provisions for unemployment benefits?  One of the grounds upon which an applicant is refused benefit is if he refuses an offer of suitable employment. If people are paid unemployment benefit while on strike from a particular employment surely it would not be possible to offer such people employment elsewhere. In that case they would cease to be on strike.  By paying unemployment benefit, if that is what the Minister intends here, to people on strike then the Minister is invalidating a basic principle of social welfare legislation to the effect that one may only draw benefit if one is available for work in suitable alternative employment.  A striker cannot avail of an offer of alternative employment and, on my interpretation, here it would appear that the cornerstone of unemployment legislation has been removed and the possibility is it will not be long before it is removed in other instances also.  I agree with the points made by other speakers to the effect that <i>ipso facto,</i> as Deputy O'Keeffe said, legislation such as this is in itself bad because there is not an adequate opportunity to explore all the implications.  This debate is insufficient on legislation of such a far-reaching character. If adequate time were given some of the fears I have expresed could probably be allayed.  I doubt if in the time at his disposal the Minister will be able to allay them this afternoon.  It is most undesirable that legislation like this should be enacted in such haste.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions. I shall try in the time available to answer as many of the points made as I can.  First of all, this whole process of looking at this legislation again was initiated by my predecessor on 24 February when the then Minister wrote to ICTU and the FUE seeking their views on amendments to section 35.  When I <Col N="2895" /> resumed office on 11 March I repeated that request.  I pursued the matter further. Members have adverted to the delay and the haste with which the measure is now being enacted.  I would have been very happy to have the considered views of all involved presented much earlier to enable us to bring the Bill before the House earlier than this.  The considerations which had to be given to various aspects involved a considerable amount of time and discussion.  It was certainly not my desire to have a situation in which we find ourselves up against the closing stages of the session with very little time at our disposal in regard to this Bill. However, the fact that there is so little time has tended to concentrate minds wonderfully on the problem.  There has been some difficulty in getting speakers to apply themselves assiduously to finding solutions, solutions everyone said were necessary but which no one could see.</P>
      <P>The ICTU were consulted and gave serious and lengthy consideration to the proposals.  They expressed their support of the proposals and their appreciation of the speed with which the Bill had been finalised.  As far as industrial relations are concerned, these people deal with them in a practical day-to-day way and they have to face the difficulties, the balances and the counterbalances.  They have given very detailed consideration to the Bill.  They are satisfied that these are good measures which will represent an improvement in the situation and that they do not open doors widely in every direction as some Deputies suggested.</P>
      <P>Most Members said they welcomed the provision of the Bill but at the same time expressed some reservations.  That is fair enough because when one proposes changes one must be concerned about any loopholes that may develop or other problems that may arise.  Considerable thought has been given to this matter and I believe we have covered the problems in so far as we can.  The Bill is adequate, particularly when one takes account of the amendments before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Members suggested that adequate consultations did not take place <Col N="2896" /> with the FUE beforehand.  We have been in contact with the FUE from the beginning and they expressed their views on the legislation.  On 13 July the FUE issued a response to the Bill which, broadly speaking, coincides with the views expressed to us in the course of our discussions.  The FUE made it clear that they do not hold any brief for workers, trade unions or employers who do not utilise the machinery of the Labour Court and the normal industrial relations procedures. They also stated that the number of cases this measure will cover were few and exceptional.  It will cover a few and exceptional cases and we are anxious to do that.  It is important to recognise that we are not talking of paying unemployment benefit to people who are on strike but we are dealing with exceptional cases.</P>
    <P>The FUE stated that they considered that the objective of the proposed legislation would be secured if a social welfare deciding officer, or appeals officer, was enabled to take full account of the decisions or views of the Labour Court in arriving at a decision in any case that may come to it.  That is where the problem arises.  The deciding officer, and the appeals officer, are not entitled now to take the special circumstances into account.  If they could do what the FUE suggest we would not have a problem because a deciding officer normally exercises considerable discretion.  The practical situation is much more complex than Deputy Shatter suggested exists outside. I should like to pay tribute to the Labour Court and those involved in industrial relations who have carried out a difficult task in an admirable way down the years. They have achieved great success in their efforts to find balances in areas where one cannot have strict legal definitions. The problem is that deciding officers and appeals officers at present cannot deal with the situation.  That is why we are setting up a reference for these cases only.  Those cases will be considered and the Department of Social Welfare will be in a position to work on the decision.</P>
    <P>The FUE went on to echo the sentiments that have been expressed here, particularly by Fine Gael Members, that <Col N="2897" /> other changes in our social welfare arrangements rated as a higher priority. They defined clearly how this measure will deal with specific cases and, at the same time, expressed the view that the other changes needed rated a higher priority.  They were referring to changes that should be made in regard to abuses, the three-day week and other matters. We also heard such sentiments expressed today.  In regard to those matters the Government have established a working party to consider the measures necessary to deal with abuses and try to make the operation of the system as efficient as possible.  A report from the working party will be available by the early autumn and we will be able to include them in the economic programme to be presented then.</P>
    <P>I hope the Opposition Deputies, who are so anxious to see action taken in this area, the FUE, and employers generally, will support the measures which will be proposed following the deliberations of that working party.  One of the problems in the Department of Social Welfare is to get employers to support the work of locating and identifying abuses.  One of our great difficulties relates to prosecutions where it is necessary to get the support of employers.  One may be able to show that there has been a loss of revenue, or even get the revenue back, but one cannot proceed with a prosecution unless one gets the wholehearted co-operation of an employer.  That is why I would welcome the support that will be necessary to implement the measures we expect to introduce in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation workers can be unfairly treated.  It is possible that at a time of depression such problems only come to the forefront because there is a temptation by companies to save by keeping workers locked out.  We must take action to deal with that problem although I do not believe it will occur often.  I was sorry Opposition speakers were not in the Seanad this morning to hear their colleagues put a different case to me.  In the Seanad the Opposition made the case that the unemployed are the real poor here and that while there may be some abuses the bulk of the <Col N="2898" /> unemployed and those on long-term social welfare benefits were needy people who must be protected.  I did not hear that view being expressed by the Opposition here today.  I heard a great deal of talk about the abuses outside that context. We must learn to look at those abuses in the proper context.  The officials in the Department of Social Welfare who have to deal with such matters recognise the reality of the situation.</P>

    <P>I would be prepared to arrange that some time after the enactment of the Bill we might have an Oireachtas Committee to review how it has been operating and to decide whether it needs amendment. Because of the limited time for Second Stage I have not been able to deal with all the points raised by Deputies but I am sure we can discuss them on Committee Stage.  Some of the statements made during the Second Stage were inaccurate. The general principle of what we are planning to do in the Bill has been discussed <Col N="2899" /> with the FUE and the CII, but the only person who looked for copies of the report was Deputy Flaherty, the Opposition spokesman on Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>In page 2, line 11, after &ldquo;Where&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, in relation to a stoppage of work, or a trade dispute, which was or is in existence on or after the 1st day of June, 1982,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On May 6 we had a discussion on these measures in the House and the problems arising therefrom, and I gave an undertaking that the commencement of the Act would be brought forward.  I think it is reasonable that the commencement date should be 1 June.  A number of Deputies asked about the Comer International Ltd. dispute and whether it would be covered.  Because that dispute was current at the time it could be referred to the tribunal.</P>

      <P>I think we should have further enlightenment on this.  After the Clover Meats dispute a payment was allowed of £144,000 by the Minister for Agriculture to the workers as part of the ultimate settlement.  That would be equivalent to the amount of lost social welfare benefits during the stoppage. Have payments been made to those workers directly, or indirectly through Clover Meats?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 11, to delete &ldquo;or&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The question raised is whether when a dispute arises the decision of the deciding officer and/or the appeals officer would be adequate or whether the dispute should first be heard by the tribunal.  We wondered whether it would be better if the matter, having been examined by the deciding officer, should then go on to the appeals officer.  I am happy to accept the proposal made by Deputy O'Keeffe that &ldquo;and&rdquo; should be inserted, so that the reference to the tribunal would be after consideration by the deciding and the appeals officers.  Of course, the dispute would be laid before the deciding officer in the first instance.  My purpose in putting down the amendment was to ensure that the existing machinery would be used as the first resort.  It is important that the existing means would be fully utilised before recourse to the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the need for this amendment, but I do not oppose it. I understand that under section 35 of the <Col N="2901" /> Consolidation Act it would be a matter of form for the deciding officer to investigate and this does not change anything in that section.  Section 1 provides only for cases knocked down by section 35 and the amendment provides only a further procedure.  There does not seem to be any necessity to provide substitution of &ldquo;and&rdquo; for &ldquo;or&rdquo; because in the normal course the dispute would go to the appeals officer via the deciding officer.</P>
      <P>While section 35 stands it would be a waste of time in some cases if there is a statutory obligation to go through the appeals officer.  It will waste the time of the appeals officer and the Department officials and we all know how much of a waiting list appeals officers have to deal with at times.  I would like to see a compromise between the original wording of the Bill as introduced and the amendment, giving the option to go through the appeals officer or not to go through the appeals officer, because in some cases it will be clear that it would be a complete waste of time.  Am I correct in saying section 35 stands in its entirety?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  But, as I said, the basis of the case will be laid at the deciding officer stage within the context of section 35 and therefore a reference to the appeals officer would be quick and would not cause hardship at that stage.  It is the full machinery which is there and, on balance, I accept the point made by Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>

      <P>In page 3, lines 13 and 14, to delete &ldquo;of officers of the Labour Court&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this amendment is to broaden the provision to refer to all the services of the industrial relations procedures generally.  This would include the Labour Court, the rights commissioners and the conciliation officers.  It is really just to make sure that the full range of industrial relations services would be <Col N="2902" /> considered in that context and to broaden the range.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that we should tease this out further.  Does this provision then mean that if an employer is willing to go to the Labour Court but for some reason or other is not anxious to avail of the services of the rights commissioner that would be considered a black mark against him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is the other way round.  If we specified only the Labour Court then if he was going to a rights commissioner or a conciliation officer these would not be adequate.  In fact it is to make it quite clear that, where the employer is taking any reasonable step through any part of the industrial relations machinery and not just the Labour Court itself, this is adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Time does not permit a detailed analysis of this.  Is it the case that there would not be an obligation on the employer to avail of all the services but that if he is availing of any of them which would be normal in an industrial relations situation he would be clear?  Is the Minister satisfied that that will be the interpretation of the clause as amended?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is an abbreviation of amendment No. 3 in Deputy O'Keeffe's name.  Deputy O'Keeffe's more extensive amendment would, it is felt, force workers to go to the Labour Court whereas the conciliation machinery of the Labour Court is based on voluntary participation. But the amendment which I have proposed refers to reasonable conduct <Col N="2904" /> and is adequate for the purpose intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say first that the person who is making out these amendments was not very good at reading my writing.  The word in my amendment was &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; and not &ldquo;desirable&rdquo; as is typed here.  What I had in mind was that as well as considering the conduct of the employer it would be relevant that there should be a specific question for consideration by the tribunal as to the conduct of the applicant.  The Minister has accepted this point in principle in that his amendment takes the point that the conduct of the applicant and as to whether it is reasonable is to be specifically taken into account.  However the second part of my amendment was to some extent related to the obligation on the part of the employer to avail of the services of the Labour Court and quite clearly it would be a black mark against the employer if he had not done so, and rightly so because the Labour Court and the various services associated with it should be availed of in times of an industrial dispute.  My worry is that, even though the Minister has accepted the spirit of my amendment as to inquiry into the reasonableness or otherwise of the conduct of the employee, he has not accepted the question as to whether such employee has been willing to avail of the services of the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>How does the Minister suggest that it is reasonable that an employer must avail of the services of the Labour Court while there is no similar obligation on the employee?  I would suggest that an employer who comes before the tribunal without being willing to avail of the services of the Labour Court does not come with the clean hands and that the same would apply to an employee.  There seems to be a lack of balance in not totally accepting my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill without this amendment is an attempt to correct an imbalance.  We must remind ourselves that practically all the references to this legislation will arise from some initiative on the part of the employer who seeks to <Col N="2905" /> make changes in conditions of employment which in the opinion of the trade union and the workers, would make them less favourable than previously.  The emphasis in the Bill must be on dealing with such problems.  There is a loophole in existing legislation which enables actions by employers to create difficult work situations.  The Bill is not designed to deal with a strike which results solely from a decision by employees since that matter is already adequately covered.</P>
      <P>I should prefer to see consistent phraseology in the Bill and in the amendments. What is the difference between &ldquo;any action or decision by the employer&rdquo; and &ldquo;conduct of the applicant&rdquo;?  Could not the same words be used in both cases?</P>

        <i>(Waterford):</i> I fail to see the reason for amendment No. 2b.  The earlier amendment, by deleting the words &ldquo;of officers of the Labour Court&rdquo;, has clearly set down guidelines whereby the participants would come before the tribunal.  Who can define &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; conduct?  What would be reasonable to one man might be unreasonable to another.  The tribunal will decide whether or not the conduct of an employer has been reasonable.</P>

It seems sensible that both parties should be encouraged to go to the Labour Court to get the problem resolved.  If there is pressure on the employer to go to the Labour Court or one of the associated services I fail to see why there should not be similar pressure on the employee.</P>

      <P>If the employee does not take reasonable steps he will be seen to <Col N="2906" /> be unreasonable.  The nature of the machinery involves voluntary participation by employees.  The employer is obliged to refer to the services normally availed of by employers in the interest of good industrial relations and he is not tied specifically to the Labour Court.  The employee must behave in a reasonable way in relation to the various procedures open to him.  It is not necessary to force the employee to go specifically to the Labour Court and this is not normal procedure.</P>

We have removed the pressure on the employer to go to the Labour Court but he must avail of the services normally availed of by employers in the interest of good industrial relations.  Is it not the natural corrollary that the employee should similarly avail of services normally availed of by employees in the interest of good industrial relations?

It is sufficient for the employees to behave in a reasonable way.  That covers the point. The tribunal will decide what is reasonable for an employee in those circumstances. What is reasonable will mean the normal use of procedures which are available to employees.  It is covered by &ldquo;reasonable behaviour&rdquo; and the tribunal will take that into consideration.</P>

      <P>The tribunal is entitled to take all the circumstances into account.  One of my worries is that there would be a rush on the tribunal to the detriment of the Labour Court.  People should be encouraged as far as possible to go to the Labour Court from the point of view of trying to get a dispute settled. My real worry is that no matter what the circumstances, an employee in dispute with an employer will be looking at any angle he can to ensure he will get unemployment benefit, possibly to the detriment of the Labour Court procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the background to my suggestion that there should be pressure on the employer, through the Bill, to avail either of the Labour Court or normal industrial relations procedures and similarly there should be pressure on the employee to avail of normal industrial relations procedures. I should not like to see a situation where employees would concentrate their attention on the tribunal and try to get an adjudication against the employer while the strike continues and normal industrial relations procedures through the Labour Court are neglected.  The employer should have to have recourse to the Labour Court and similarly with the employee.  That is why I included it as the second part of my amendment.  I am glad the Minister accepted my amendment in that regard.  It would be ridiculous to think that the employer could succeed unless he was acting reasonably. Since it is spelled out for the employer that acting reasonably includes availing of industrial relations procedures, why <Col N="2908" /> do we not have the same thing in regard to employees?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">

      <P>It is already covered in the existing Act.  If an employee is out of work through his own fault he is disqualified. The Bill is to cover the other situation which was wide open until now. The Bill states that the employee concerned must satisfy all the other conditions. He must be available for work and free to go to work if his employer lets him.  This Bill deals with a social welfare problem and not an industrial relations one as such.  Deputy O'Keeffe's point is widening the Bill to take in industrial relations.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister has taken the spirit of my amendment. An applicant should not be entitled to succeed in getting unemployment benefit while on strike in circumstances where he was not willing to engage in normal industrial relations procedures and the employer was.  Problems would arise where normal industrial relations procedures were not being followed.  That being so, I took the view in framing my amendment that, if they were being followed by the employer and not by the employee, the tribunal would be precluded from making an award.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though the Minister has largely accepted the wording of my amendment the effect of the change is that, instead of the tribunal being precluded in those circumstances, <Col N="2910" /> it merely considers those two points.  I gathered from the Minister's speech that he took the view that an award would not be made by the tribunal to an applicant in either of these two circumstances: where the employer was engaged in normal industrial relations procedures or where the employer was not willing to engage in these procedures. While the wording is largely the same, there is a subtle difference in the effect of the two draft amendments.</P>

The employer would not be a party and the Minister is merely saying that any of the parties could apply to the High Court.  That is not answering the question as to whether the employer could apply.  On a practical basis the employer would not have any great interest in the matter since it is the Minister, representing PAYE workers, who is paying out and the employee who would be getting paid.  The employer is not really <Col N="2912" /> interested one way or the other.  It seems the employer is not a party to the proceedings but I do not know whether he would have some type of third party right of audience in the High Court.</P>

    <P>The supplementary list of amendments <Col N="2914" /> put out by the Minister made it obvious that we were to be all sweetness and light up to this.  It was largely an acceptance of my amendments, but he has stopped at No. 6.  I am concerned at the lack of definition of the post of chairman.  This position will be highly important in that effectively two members will be nominated by the ICTU and two nominated by the employer organisations &mdash; I will have a point to make on that afterwards as to why we mention the ICTU and not the FUE&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will be interested to know what is in the Minister's mind on that.  The chairman, or chairperson, will be in the middle and this person will have a very important function.  In that situation the Bill should contain some definition as to what kind of qualifications we should seek from the chairman and other aspects related to his role.  Late last night when I was drafting these amendments I came to the conclusion that there should be some such definition.  It seemed to me that a judge would at least guarantee total impartiality, but if the Minister has some alternative suggestion I would be quite prepared to look at it.  Basically you are looking for somebody who is above and beyond the employer vested interest situation and similarly above and beyond the trade union vested interest situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether it is possible to find such a body in this country I do not know, but, as Deputy Crotty pointed out on Second Stage, everything will concentrate on this person.  Naturally, two employers will approach the one tribunal, I will not say unfairly, but from an angle relating to their industrial background and environment. Similarly two trade unions will approach from a different angle.  We want to find some way out of this impasse. I put down this amendment seeking that the chairman should be a judge, somebody who will be, and will be seen to be, totally impartial.  If the Minister has other suggestions in that area I will not go totally bail on this, but I would be interested in his views on it.  I trust he will understand and appreciate my reasons <Col N="2915" /> for attempting to define the position of chairman more so than is in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the unfair dismissals and redundancy tribunals and these have been reasonably successful.  It has not happened that, irrespective of the merits of the case, in unfair dismissal cases the employer representative has consistently sided with the employer and the worker representative consistently sided with the worker, leaving the decision to the chairperson.  It has worked reasonably well with both tribunals.  I hope that we will get a chairperson with commonsense because, let me repeat what I said on Second Stage, I do not believe that a person from the High Court or Supreme Court with his legal experience &mdash; which is extremely limited, in fact it is non-existent as far as industrial relations are concerned &mdash; will be suitable. Anyone will tell you that a chairperson dealing with an industrial relations problem must have a completely trained outlook different from that of someone who is chairing, say, the Special Criminal Court or has a casting vote in the Supreme Court or something like that.</P>
      <P>I oppose amendment No. 7 put down in the name of Deputy O'Keeffe.  The provisions of this Bill will make it possible for the tribunal to have clear-cut evidence in all cases referred to them with very few grey areas in it.  Decisions of the tribunal would not necessarily be two for the applicant and two against, lined up on the basis that the two employer representatives would vote against and the two worker representatives would vote for, irrespective of the merits of the case, and a decision taken by the chairperson.  If we are to have that kind of tribunal we should forget about it now.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to spell out in greater detail what he has in mind about the chairman, because that is not mentioned in the Bill.  The Bill makes provision for the nomination and appointment of the other four members, but where the chairperson is to come from remains a mystery as far as the Bill is concerned.</P>

        <i>(Waterford):</i> I would appreciate it if the Minister would spell out what he would regard as the terms of reference or parameters by which he is to appoint this chairman.  It would be an unmitigated disaster if he was to decide to appoint a chairman who would be a representative of the High Court, Circuit Court, District Court or any court.  The whole history of the trade union movement has been to steer away from courts of law.  The industrial relations scene is very complex.  The type of person I would visualise as chairman of the tribunal would be one well versed in industrial relations procedures.  If we move into the area of adopting legal personnel for this position, I could visualise many disasters ahead.  One need only have regard to yesterday's papers to find an account of workers being jailed by High Court judges.  Workers cannot have much confidence either in High Court judges <i>vis-à-vis</i> the manner in which injunctions are granted.  There is a need for the Minister to spell out clearly the type of personnel he has in mind and the sort of qualifications they would need for these duties. Having said that I agree with Deputy Pattison that the Unfair Dismissals Tribunal and other tribunals also work quite well.  I have appeared before the Unfair Dismissals Tribunal from time to time to represent employees and I have found that decisions were not weighted one way or the other.  The tribunal seems to work quite fairly.</P>

      <P>The reason I am not accepting the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Keeffe is that I do not wish to tie the legislation to the extent that a High Court or a Circuit Court judge would have to be involved.  It could happen that such person might be available and might have the suitable background in the area of industrial relations but it would be inadvisable to restrict ourselves at this stage to having to find either a High Court or a Circuit Court judge who was available and suitable and who was generally acceptable.  As Deputy Pattison has said, a barrister may be the kind of person with the right sort of experience for the position.  I can think of other kinds <Col N="2917" /> of people, too, people who are experienced in industrial relations, university people, barristers or judges as the case may be.  In any case, it will be our desire to have someone who will be seen clearly as being objective, independent and impartial and having sound judgement as well as being reasonably well versed in industrial relations procedures.  When all of those qualities are put together we may be confined to one or two people in the country but I think Deputies will recognise that there are people available who have these qualities.  It will be our intention and very much our interest to find someone who will act as a competent, impartial and independent chairman. That is the approach we would take in any event.</P>

      <P>I accept that the rarefied atmosphere of the Four Courts may not be the best place in which to get an indepth knowledge of industrial relations. At the same time, there are certain functions under this Bill which will require somebody who will be good at evaluating evidence since the tribunal will be involved in the whole area of whether an employer or an employee was fair and reasonable in his behaviour.  I accept also that the person evaluating the evidence should have a knowledge of industrial relations.  I would assume that both the employer and the employee representatives on the tribunal would be in a position to supply a lot of that expertise but there is the question of the man in the middle and he would need to be good at evaluating a situation and reaching a decision in the event of a tie.</P>
      <P>I am impressed by the comments of Deputy Pattison and endorsed by Deputy Gallagher in relation to the operation of existing tribunals.  The Deputies have told us that from their experience of these tribunals they do not come down either on the side of the employer or of the employee.  That gives us some hope that we will have a tribunal in this instance who will be able to judge situations fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of this legislation that must be considered is that the tribunal will have power to take evidence on oath and there is the proviso that false evidence <Col N="2918" /> given on oath will be effectively perjury.  The question of the evaluation of evidence in that sort of situation might require someone with some legal training. I put down the amendment merely to highlight the difficulty in finding a chairman with all the characteristics necessary and to get the Minister's view as to the kind of person he has in mind. Perhaps the problem could be resolved if under subsection (5) the Minister were to indicate that the term of office of members of the tribunal would not be over long so that in the event of the appointment of an unmitigated disaster, whether of a legal or other nature, the person concerned could be got rid of after a short time.  If the Minister were prepared to give us an assurance on those lines, my apprehensions might be allayed in this area.</P>

      <P>We do not envisage many cases coming before the tribunal and consequently I would not envisage an appointment, particularly in the early stages, for a very long duration.  That is a matter that could be considered also when we are reviewing the operation of the Bill after a period of a year.  However, I accept the point the Deputy makes and I agree that it will not be appropriate at this stage to appoint someone for a long duration.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 1, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now looking at section 1, as amended, which is virtually the entire Bill.  It is clear that any person will be entitled to go to the tribunal.  I have this fear &mdash; somewhat reduced as a result of the amendments we have <Col N="2921" /> inserted &mdash; that we may find that persons involved in industrial disputes are more inclined to go to the the tribunal rather than endeavour to use the normal industrial relations procedures.  Hopefully my apprehensions in that regard will prove to be unfounded but, if they are not, it will be absolutely essential that we have some form of review procedure.  I have been impressed by the view presented from all sides of the House that none of us wants a situation to arise in which this tribunal will have the effect of interfering with or damaging the normal industrial relations procedures.  I still have some concern, reduced somewhat as a result of the amendments the Minister graciously was prepared to accept.  But it will be very important indeed that we do not sit back, forget about this Bill and accept it as being permanent legislation without there being some review procedure.  I shall be coming to the last amendment I put down, again specifically with the purpose of advocating that this would be a temporary Bill which would lapse after six months, not from the point of view of thinking that the type of problem which the Minister says he is trying to get at and which we all feel should be got at will not exist after six months but so that we would have a proper review after a limited period of time.  We must be clear that, under this Bill, everybody is entitled to go to the tribunal, everybody who is involved in an industrial dispute, where under section 35, there has been a decision that a trade dispute is involved.  I hope that the Minister's assurances that the tribunal would not be able to make an order in favour of an applicant where that applicant was found not to have been willing to avail of the industrial relations procedures, will in fact turn out to be the views of the tribunal.  It would be absolutely disastrous if this tribunal were to have the effect of interfering with the work of the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the employer representatives on the tribunal I note that in subsection (4) the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is mentioned as providing two names for nomination on the trade union side whereas no name is mentioned on the employer's side.  Is it the intention <Col N="2922" /> that these will be nominated from the FUE, or possibly one from the FUE and the other from the CII?  Why is that taken differently?  Why is it not specified in the Bill?  Were there apprehensions on the part of the Minister as to the concern of any employer organisation or otherwise and their willingness to work the tribunal? I am interested to know why the Minister adopted this course.  I have already had the point from the Minister on the term of office of the members which initially will not be more than a year and which will allow time to review thereafter.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that generally, as a result of the amendments, we had tightened the Bill.  I believe that, with these amendments, there is a fair chance that the provisions of the Bill will not be abused in the future.  At the same time, because of the very serious nature of the situation, I am very anxious that we have a clear and unequivocal commitment, either, as I am proposing in section 2, to the lapsing of the Bill or, alternatively, to a review within a very short time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be clarified that it is people who are disqualified under subsection (1) of section 35 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, who have the right to go to the tribunal.  To my mind there is nothing really new in section 1 of this Bill.  It re-echoes some of the provisions contained in the Unfair Dismissals Act, even in the Redundancy Acts, or even in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, itself.  For example, there is provision in the Unfair Dismissals Act for a situation in which dismissals are contrived, in the sense, in some cases, of employees being forced to resign from jobs through conditions being made rather difficult for them. There is a provision in the Unfair Dismissals Act that an employer does not have to formally dismiss somebody in order to be taken before the Unfair Dismissals Tribunal in a claim against him for unfair dismissal.  If an employee can show that conditions were changed to his or her detriment then he or she could succeed and, in many cases, has succeeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2923" /> Similarly the Redundancy Act provides for a period of four weeks in the event of alternative employment being offered.  If the employee feels that the alternative employment being offered is not up to the standard of employment that he or she had had, then that employee can refuse such an offer of work and still be eligible to receive redundancy payments and social welfare benefit. Section 35(4)(b) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, provides:</P>
    <P>employment in the district where he was last ordinarily employed at a rate of remuneration lower, or on conditions less favourable, than those which he had habitually obtained in his usual employment in that district, or would have obtained had he continued to be so employed,</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the employee who is told by his employer that his conditions will be worsened or made less favourable and his wages will be lowered.  If he tells his employer he will leave rather than accept such changes in his employment he will get no employment benefit.  If, on the other hand, he tells his employer he will fight this worsening of his conditions and his employer tells him he will stay outside until he accepts then he will not get any social welfare.  There is an inconsistency here.  I hope such an employee will have recourse to protection and will have recourse to the tribunal.  Up to this an employee could be told by the deciding officer or the appeals officer that he was in dispute with his employer and that was the reason he was not working and he could not, therefore, get social welfare benefit.  If now the appeals officer can advise such an employee that his employer was acting unreasonably that employee will be entitled to social welfare benefit.  I am glad that inconsistency is removed.  Have all the subsections to be satisfied in order to qualify or will it be sufficient to satisfy one or two in order to qualify?  Will the Minister clarify that for me?</P>

      <P>Any one will do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to Deputy O'Keeffe's <Col N="2924" /> point in regard to people who are disqualified under section 35 being free to go to the tribunal.  Once established the tribunal will set its own terms and regulations and those who do not have a case will very quickly find after a little experience that there is no point in their going to the tribunal.  Trivial or vexatious claims will get fairly short shrift.  Initially people might have to garner experience of the position but I am sure they would be informed very quickly that they did not come within the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe made the point that ICTU are specifically mentioned whereas employers organisations, and specifically the FUE, are not mentioned.  Following discussions with them ICTU specifically requested representation.  There are many employer organisations but to date we have had no request from any of them. We shall be quite happy to consider any representations they may make subsequent to the passing of this Bill and, in the meantime, we have covered employers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Essentially, if an individual is refused unemployment benefit because of involvement in an industrial dispute, he may go to the tribunal which will take into account all the circumstances of the stoppage of work and then decide whether the applicant was unreasonably deprived of his employment.  I wish I could share the Minister's confidence that the tribunal will only be making decisions in relation to hard cases. Since I do not share the Minister's confidence I trust he will accept my amendment for a review of the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 24, after &ldquo;order&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and shall lapse 6 months thereafter&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2925" /> I make this suggestion for a number of reasons.  First, this is rushed legislation and rushed legislation must inevitably turn out to be bad legislation.  We have not had a full opportunity of considering the Bill.  We have not had an opportunity of receiving representations and reflecting on them.  I would have preferred the Committee Stage to take at least a week. Apparently this is not possible because the Minister is anxious to get the Bill today.</P>
    <P>The second reason I suggest a lapse after six months is because that would give us an opportunity to have a proper debate on a new Bill.  It would give us time to consider all the aspects in the light of the experience gained of the operation of the Bill over the previous six months.  We could draw on that experience.  I am making the suggestion for the lapsing of the legislation after six months because I believe we will have to review it.</P>
    <P>There is still a danger, although I am happy with the Bill now that the Minister has accepted some amendments, that the Bill may result in a strike encouragement situation.  We would all wish to ensure that that would not happen, but if it occurs and we find that the effect of the tribunal is that we have an encouragement towards the commencement or prolongation of strikes or, on the other hand, an encouragement of employers and employees away from the normal well-tried and established procedures of the Labour Court, then it is important that the House should have a further opportunity of debating the matter.  If the House agreed to my suggestion that the Bill should lapse in six months we could have a further debate on the terms of it. I want to emphasise strongly the need for a review of the terms of the legislation within a short space of time.  Mention has been made by a number of Members of other aspects of social welfare legislation which should be attended to.  Various abuses have been mentioned on the part of employees and employers and they could be dealt with in the context of a new Bill in six months' time.  We should not pass the Bill without making a positive <Col N="2926" /> arrangement to view the effects of the legislation within a short space of time in case it turns out to have a bad effect on our industrial relations environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the amendment tabled by Deputy O'Keeffe because it provides that the Bill lapse within six months.  This piece of legislation has been urgently sought after for six months, it has taken it six months to get this far and if we agree that it should lapse after another six months I am sure it will take between six and 12 months to get a replacement for it.  I agree with some of the reservations expressed by Deputy O'Keeffe about the success or otherwise of the legislation and I have reservations for other reasons.  I would like to see a review of the legislation taking place within six months time because I am anxious to ensure it provides the machinery which is needed.  In six months I might have identified some shortcomings in the legislation and, indeed, the trade union movement might have identified some shortcomings; but the solution to that is not to propose that the Bill should lapse.  If it is found that it is not satisfactory I do not think we would be solving the problem by lapsing it.  I would prefer if the legislation remained on the Statute Book pending substitution by an improved measure.  I would not accept a situation where the Bill would automatically lapse leaving us with a period of time, 12 months or maybe longer, before a substitute is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we accept the amendment we are saying that the Bill is only being introduced for one or two specific cases.  There is a necessity for such legislation.  It will contribute enormously to improving industrial relations and it will shorten rather than lengthen industrial disputes. In my view the closures at Clover Meats and Comer International would have been shorter if this legislation was in existence.  The evidence that exists satisfies me that the provisions of such a Bill would have shortened if not eliminated those two disputes.  I can see this preventing further disputes and contributing in a big way towards improving industrial <Col N="2927" /> relations.  It makes bad industrial relations worse when employees who are deprived of their wages because they cannot go to work are also deprived of social welfare benefits on top of that.  That gives them a double reason for being on bad terms with their employer.  In such situations workers tend to blame the employer if they do not get their social welfare payments, although it is due to the way the original legislation was framed.  If that legislation was not changed industrial relations problems would get worse.  I would welcome a review of the legislation before the House in six months or 12 months to see if there are other ways we might improve it, but I would be totally opposed to the legislation lapsing automatically within about six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Waterford):</i> There is a need for a review of the legislation and the section as it is worded is very limited. It states that the Act shall come into operation on such day as the Minister appoints by order.  I recognise that a certain amount of time will be required to draw up regulations, to specify times and places of hearings by the tribunal and so on but I should like to get an assurance from the Minister that it will not take six months to set up the tribunal.  In Comer International there is a definite obstacle to a resumption of work because of the provisions in the original legislation.  I would welcome an assurance from the Minister that within a short time after the passing of the legislation that case will be heard by the tribunal.  It will be up to the tribunal to adjudicate on the merits or demerits of the case of the employees of Comer International and if the tribunal find that they are not entitled to benefit the workers will accept it.  However, under existing legislation they are debarred from obtaining such benefit. My reservation concerns the looseness of the section and I should like the Minister to indicate when he hopes to see the tribunal functioning so that problems such as the one which exists at Comer International can be adjudicated on.</P>

Deputy Gallagher will be aware of the amendment which will bring the Act into operation from 1 June, which means that the Comer International matter can be considered.  I appreciate the urgency in this respect.  I cannot accept Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment for the reasons outlined by Deputy Pattison.  I do not accept that it would be reasonable to have a review in six months but, as I said on Second Stage, I am prepared to arrange for a review after 12 months, by agreement between the Whips, and we can arrange to have a committee of the Oireachtas to review the operations of the Act and possibly to amend it in the light of experience.  I appreciate that Deputies have certain apprehensions and fears but I assure them that we have taken all possible precautions, including discussions with the appropriate Departments and representatives of employees and employer.  I have taken this matter very seriously in order to ensure that the measure will meet the problems.</P>

The Minister said the review would take place after 12 months' operation of the Act.  I want an assurance that the review will be immediately after 12 months' operation of the Act, because it could take place in five years and that would be after 12 months' operation of the Act.  I want the review after the first 12 months.  Second, I should like the review body to be an all-party group from the Dáil or from both Houses, and I should like an assurance that they will meet shortly after the year has expired. Perhaps the Minister cannot give me such a commitment because there is no guarantee that he will not be on this side then, but I hope he will give this serious consideration.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, at its rising on Friday the 16th July, 1982, do adjourn for the Summer Recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The four months since the Government took office have been eventful in the field of foreign policy and Ireland's involvement has been an active one, both because of the nature of the issues involved and our current membership of the United Nations Security Council.  At least two major international crises have arisen over the last few months, one in the South Atlantic following the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands, the second more recently in the Middle East as a result of the Israeli invasion of the Lebanon.  At the same time, the world faces a period of continuing international tension because of matters such as the <Col N="2932" /> situation in Poland and consequent strains in the East-West relationship, the war between Iran and Iraq and tensions in other parts of the world.  Also there are important arms control and disarmanent talks between East and West in train and the UN has just completed its second Special Session on Disarmanent.</P>
    <P>All of these issues have an impact on our foreign policy, either in our bilateral relations or within the European Community or in wider for a such as the United Nations.  Moreover, each of these crises, particularly the Falklands and the Middle East, has confronted the Government with important choices and even dilemmas.</P>
    <P>I want to speak first about the Falklands. As Deputies are aware, the invasion of the Falkland Islands faced the Government with the problem of making decisions in a complex and rapidly evolving crisis.  There was no doubt that the dispute over sovereignty of the Falkland Islands is a long-standing issue which was the subject of continuing negotiations between Britain and Argentina.  But what was equally clear was that Argentina acted in breach of the United Nations Charter and international law by resorting to the use of force in an effort to resolve the dispute over sovereignty unilaterally in its favour.  Ireland responded to the illicit use of force by Argentina by voting for Security Council Resolution 502 adopted on 3 April.  We also joined with our partners in the European Community in applying political and economic pressure on Argentina to comply with the Resolution and to resolve the conflict by peaceful means.  In my statement of 10 April, following the adoption of measures against Argentina I made our position plain when I said:</P>
    <P>Following the armed intervention by Argentina, the Security Council adopted on April 3 a Resolution No. 502 which made three clear demands. It called for an end to hostilities, an immediate withdrawal of all Argentine forces and a diplomatic solution. Ireland voted for that resolution because the Government believes that the full implementation of its terms is <Col N="2933" /> the best means by which further fighting can be avoided and the principles of the rule of law rather than the rule of force in international relations upheld.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason and in defence of that principle also that we together with our Nine partners in the European Community in a spirit of mutual solidarity have decided to unite our political and economic efforts to press for and to promote full implementation of the terms of Security Council Resolution 502.</P>
    <P>This is the sole aim of the measures decided on by the Ten in Brussels earlier today.</P>
    <P>It follows that it was no part of our purpose in adopting these measures to see them used in support of a military as distinct from a negotiated solution to the conflict.  And when it became clear that this was the likely course which events were going to take, the Government decided that it would no longer be appropriate to maintain the measures in force. As Deputies are aware, we were not alone in this regard.</P>
    <P>While the Government believed that it would not be appropriate to continue to apply measures to Argentina in a manner which implied political support for a military solution, at the same time, we took steps to ensure that the measures being maintained in force by our Community partners would not be circumvented.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the Falklands crisis also impinged directly on our current membership of the UN Security Council.  In calling for a meeting of the council, we did so conscious of the fact that sooner or later, when and if the mediation efforts by individual states were not successful the council would be obliged to face their responsibilities. Indeed as early as 10 April I had said and I quote:</P>
    <P>For its part, Ireland will continue its own efforts and is ready to join with others in the search for diplomatic solutions.</P>
    <P>The moment is fast approaching <Col N="2934" /> when the peace-making and peace-keeping machinery of the United Nations if they are resorted to may be able to provide as in the case of other conflicts a practical means by which to avert a major clash, greater bloodshed and further suffering.</P>
    <P>I have instructed the permanent representative of Ireland to the United Nations, Ambassador Noel Dorr, to explore every possibility in this regard.</P>
    <P>In giving practical effect to our request for the meeting of the Security Council, the Government was concerned to ensure that this was fully in accord with and complementary to the efforts of the UN Secretary General to establish a framework for negotiation of a peaceful and honourable settlement.  For any country to act in these circumstances carries certain risks.  For Ireland, faced with a situation in which its nearest neighbour and a partner in the Community was involved, the risks of being misunderstood are obvious.  Nonetheless, the Government believed that it had a duty to speak and to act in defence of principle and proportion in this tragic conflict.  As we now know, the issue was not resolved through peaceful negotiation.  History will judge whether and to what extent the outcome might have been otherwise.  Suffice it to say, now that the guns are silent in the South Atlantic, the difficult task of reconciliation and of creating conditions for an enduring settlement remains.</P>
    <P>More recently, and even as I speak, the international community faces the unfolding of yet another tragic episode in the long cycle of violence, bloodshed and injustice in the Middle East.  Successive Irish Governments have maintained a clear position on the issues at stake in the Arab-Israeli conflict.  Like many political conflicts, that of the Middle East is a conflict of rights &mdash; the right of Israel to live in peace within secure and recognised boundaries; the right of the Palestinian people to justice, to self-determination and the consequent possibility to realise this right in the establishment of their own State and to assume responsibility for their own destiny as a people as Israel has done.  We wish to see this conflict <Col N="2935" /> resolved equitably, by compromise, through the negotiation of a comprehensive just and durable settlement.</P>
    <P>I have little doubt from the sentiments expressed by the vast majority of those who participated in the debate on the situation in Lebanon which we had here on 16 June that Deputies endorse and indeed the public-at-large fully support, in a word have confidence in, the Government's approach to the crisis in Lebanon and the wider conflict in the Middle East. The Government have been active in efforts to bring about a ceasefire in the Lebanon.  Resolution 509, which called for an immediate and unconditional withdrawal by Israel, was sponsored by Ireland.</P>
    <P>More recently, Ireland has joined with its partners in the Community in speaking out clearly and firmly in regard to Israel's conduct in Lebanon.  Deputies will recall that on 9 June in Bonn, the Foreign Ministers of the Ten vigorously condemned the new Israeli invasion of Lebanon, which was described as a flagrant violation of international law.</P>
    <P>At the European Council at the end of June, the Taoiseach and I participated in an extensive and thorough discussion of the situation in Lebanon.  As a result of that discussion, the Ten issued a statement setting out the main lines of our approach and emphasising the need for specific measures to preserve the existing ceasefire, and to provide for the immediate disengagement of the forces in conflict as well as pointing to the necessary practical arrangements required for a definitive peace in Lebanon.  In this connection, the Government are glad that the policy of the Ten in regard to Lebanon gives particular weight and emphasis to the role of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>We believe that the UN have an immediate role to play in consolidating a ceasefire and disengagement of forces in the Beirut area.  In the longer term the UN should also be placed in the position to provide an adequate peace-keeping force with a clear and unambiguous mandate. In our view such a force is the best means of ensuring that Southern Lebanon can be restored to Lebanese sovereignty and <Col N="2936" /> can be kept free form enclaves, private armies and heavy weapons so as to make it possible for the population there and in the neighbouring areas of Israel to live their lives free from the cycle of violence and reprisal.  Ireland, for its part, is contributing in practical terms to the existing UN force in the Lebanon, the mandate of which has been extended temporarily until 19 August.  I am confident that the House will agree that Ireland will continue to contribute to the efforts of the United Nations to bring peace to this country whose innocent population have suffered so tragically.</P>
    <P>In this connection it is important to stress the achievements of UNIFIL to date in very adverse conditions over the last four years in the course of which some 34 soldiers, including four of our own, have been killed.  The success of a peace-keeping force is fundamentally dependent on the goodwill and co-operation of the parties to any conflict as well as that of the community to which it is endeavouring to restore a measure of peace and stability.  When UNIFIL were established there were barely 1,000 civilians still remaining in its area of operation. Today more than a quarter of a million people are living and working throughout the UNIFIL area.  Peace in practical terms, the conduct of people's daily lives free from fear and danger, had crystallised round the various UNIFIL positions in South Lebanon.  It is important therefore to emphasise that a lasting and positive peace in Lebanon, not just the absence of war and strife, will require patient and painstaking work and the co-operation of all sides.</P>
    <P>In our view the UN and the forces operating under its auspices are best placed to help create the conditions under which peace can be consolidated. For this reason it is dismaying and disquieting to see the extent to which in recent days insinuations, wholly unfounded, have been made about the integrity and impartiality of the UN forces.  No one in this House, or indeed outside it, should give currency to attempts, ill-advised or mischievous, which serve to undermine the prestige <Col N="2937" /> of the UN and of the forces, including our own, serving under its flag.</P>
    <P>I know I speak for all of us when I say that we take pride in the magnificent work being done by General Callaghan, the Irish commander of the UN force in South Lebanon, and the Irish contingent in that force.  I can assure the House from recent contacts which I have had with many prominent leaders abroad, including in particular the Secretary General of the United Nations, that they share our great admiration and respect for the Irishmen who are currently in the service of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the UN Second Special Session on Disarmament which ended recently.  This special session did not arrive at the substantial results we would have desired.  Given the state of international relations at the moment, this is perhaps not surprising.  Nevertheless, the inability of the special session to agree on concrete measures of disarmament, which are now more necessary than ever, must be counted as a setback. Nevertheless, a number of valuable proposals were put forward and these will be considered next autumn by the UN General Assembly.</P>
    <P>In the statement which the Taoiseach made on behalf of Ireland in the general debate which opened the special session he set out the Government's policy on the urgent and increasingly serious problems of arms control and disarmament. He also put forward a number of specific proposals &mdash; practical measures &mdash; which, if implemented, would help to reverse the dangerous spiral of the arms race. Moreover, now that it is proposed to expand the UN Committee on Disarmament, Ireland has offered to become a member of this important multilateral negotiating body.  The Government's policy, as enunciated by the Taoiseach, and the practical measures he advocated, are also fully in line with the policy of all previous Governments since we joined the United Nations.  From the response which the Taoiseach's address has evoked from members of the public throughout the country, I am confident that this approach is entitled to the support of this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2938" /> One of the central tasks facing the international community at the present time is the achievement of a stable, functioning and just global economic order. Economic forces left entirely to themselves tend to produce growing inequality. What is at issue now is the capacity of the international community, through discussion and negotiation, to reverse the present unfavourable trends in the world economy which affect rich and poor alike.  Of course, the North-South dialogue will not by itself solve all the current world problems, many of which are political rather than economic, but the world community can have no real stability until it faces up to the basic challenge which the widening gap separating rich and poor countries represents.</P>
    <P>Our involvement in international development co-operation is an essential element of our foreign policy.  Ireland has participated actively, and continues to do so since I took office as Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the discussions aimed at achieving a new international economic order.  Regrettably, the prospects for the launching of the long awaited round of global negotiations do not appear to be particularly promising at the present time.  However, we continue to hope, following the consensus apparently achieved at the recent Versailles summit of the seven major industrialised States, that progress can be made.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the wider debate on global economic problems, Deputies will know of the growing attention which we and our Community partners have given in recent years to building up and extending our relations with the developing countries.  The Community's principal instrument of co-operation with developing countries is the Lomé Convention, governing relations with 62 African, Carribbean and Pacific countries.  For our part we are also anxious to see better Community links with other developing regions, in particular South East Asia and Latin Ámerica, and I was very happy to avail of the opportunity provided by Commissioner Pisani's recent visit to Dublin to discuss our ideas on this and other matters with the member of the Commission responsible for mapping out <Col N="2939" /> the Community's development co-operation policies in the years to come.</P>
    <P>In this important area of the Community's external relationships, there is, as the Brandt Report so forcefully reminded us, no time to lose.  The urgency and critical nature of the problems of underdevelopment is nowhere better illustrated than in the fight against world hunger, which I am glad to see is now the top priority as far as the European Community and, indeed the whole international community, are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Commission have recently put forward a programme of food strategies designed to assist the developing countries become as self-sufficient in food production as they possibly can.  I need hardly say how strongly I support the idea behind the Commission proposals and at the Development Council two weeks ago in Luxembourg I was able to join my colleagues in agreeing to implement right away food strategy programmes in a number of developing countries, including, I was happy to note, one of our own bilateral priority countries, Zambia.</P>
    <P>Indeed, this year it is possible to increase the size and content of our programmes in Tanzania and Zambia to bring about a better balance of distribution among our priority countries.  Also for the first time we are enabled to extend programme assistance to Zimbabwe, in response to the needs of that country following the struggle for self-determination.</P>
    <P>In a word, this Government, despite the present very difficult budgetary situation, have maintained their commitment to the developing world.  In this context I am particularly anxious that Deputies should have a better insight into the increasingly complex nature of our involvement with the Third World.  The recent decision to establish a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas on Co-operation with Developing Countries is an essential step in the process of establishing and clarifying Ireland's role in international development and an essential complement to the work of the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation, as I had <Col N="2940" /> occasion to remark when I addressed the Council in May.</P>
    <P>This Government are fully committed to Anglo-Irish co-operation directed towards a resolution of the problem of Northern Ireland.  When last in office we succeeded in making a major step forward in our relationship with our nearest neighbour.  It is widely acknowledged that following the Taoiseach's meeting with Prime Minister Thatcher in 1980 the Anglo-Irish relationship entered a new and hopeful phase, with a clear acceptance by the British of the need for both Governments to bring forward policies to achieve peace, reconciliation and stability in this country and to further develop the links between our two countries. This historic initiative by the Taoiseach was decried at the time by some of those who would normally purport to seek an improvement of relations between Britain and Ireland.  Many of these very same people now speak of a deterioration in the Anglo-Irish relationship. Their motives were suspect then and they are suspect now.</P>
    <P>The Government's initiative during our previous term of office resulted in a new Anglo-Irish structure which we are still completely confident can be developed and used to make progress towards resolving the underlying political problem in Northern Ireland.  That we had succeeded in putting a new and positive shape on our relationship with Britain was clearly recognised by the Fine Gael and Labour Parties during their brief period in office.  No attempt was made to alter the course we had set, and Deputy FitzGerald's meeting with the British Prime Minister was an opportunity to further promote our objectives within the newly established structure.  It is with regret that I must remind the House of the previous Government's failure to give their full dimension to the Anglo-Irish institution, which was already taking shape while we were in office.  It was most unfortunate and a great disappointment for this country that Deputy FitzGerald should have failed to pursue vigorously the establishment of the parliamentary dimension of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernment Council when he met <Col N="2941" /> Prime Minister Thatcher.  This was the more unfortunate in view of the fact that all parties here agree on the desirability and potential of such a body, which would in particular open the possibility of Northern Ireland representation in Anglo-Irish discussions.</P>

      <P>The weak approach of the Coalition parties ran directly counter to the consensus which had emerged in recent years among responsible leaders in Ireland and Britain that the problem of Northern Ireland demanded a joint approach by our two Governments.</P>
      <P>I regret that in recent months the British Government have been less than wholehearted in their commitment to the approach which they had agreed with us. Earlier this year they embarked on a misguided and unilateral initiative which in effect ignores the wider Anglo-Irish dimension within which the Taoiseach and Prime Minister had agreed to tackle the problem of the North &mdash; a problem which affects both our countries so much. Mr. Prior's failure to properly consult with the Government here in the elaboration of his proposals has already been put on record by me &mdash; and indeed admitted by him in a recent parliamentary reply in Westminster &mdash; and I wish to state my view that the British Government's approach on this matter has been contrary not only to the spirit but also to the letter of our new arrangements.  The degree of reasoned opposition to the British proposals &mdash; and, as Deputies are fully aware, the Government have been unable to approve of them &mdash; ought to have made Mr. Prior think again.  Instead they have now completed their painful passage through the House of Commons and Mr. Prior seems determined to force his scheme on Northern Ireland by what can only be described as desperate means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have already made <Col N="2942" /> clear our fear at the consequences which may follow from yet another failed British Government initiative.  With the announcement in the last few days of voting in the Autumn for the proposed Northern Ireland Assembly, our apprehension grows greater.  This institution is to be in and for Northern Ireland alone and its intended role is to restore a devolved executive in and for Northern Ireland alone.  Few Deputies will not see such a concept as retrograde and insufficient and few in this House will likewise fail to deplore the retreat by the present British Government from the commitment to prescribed powersharing in Northern Ireland.  This commitment has been a constant in the policy of various British Governments since 1973.  Instead, the evolution of affairs within the new Assembly is to be left to the free play of the political parties.  Everybody knows which political tradition will dominate in such a situation and we hear already that dominant unionist interest declare its attitude &mdash; an attitude which has not varied over 60 years and which, not surprisingly, is marked by contemptuous rejection of the present British plan.  Irish nationalist opinion is alert to the dangers ahead.  They are the same dangers nationalists thought they had left behind them quite a little time ago.</P>
    <P>I regret the present line of policy of British Ministers but despite this we are determined to use and to pursue the development of the institutional framework established by the two Governments. It is still there and in fact has been functioning normally in recent months with five ministerial level meetings since this Government came to office.  It offers the hope of avoiding disaster and a clear way forward.  It remains our conviction that a joint approach offers the only hope of ultimately resolving the situation in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It saddens me that at this time some Members of the Opposition parties have joined in painting a gloomy picture of the state of Anglo-Irish relations.  Such a picture can only be in the interests of those who seek to thwart the processes of Anglo-Irish co-operation for their own purposes.  It is significant in my view that <Col N="2943" /> this kind of talk is most prevalent in certain sections of the British media often reflecting the opinions of those in Britain who have never been well-disposed towards this country.</P>
    <P>The reality is different.  Where interests are so healthily interlinked, relations do not come to a halt.  As I have already said, useful co-operation has pressed ahead in recent months.  Much of it has directly beneficial effects throughout this country &mdash; my colleague's discussions about the use of our natural gas with his British counterpart is an example of this. We anticipate future meetings of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council in this spirit of constructive co-operation as appropriate and necessary and at every level.  But let me make it absolutely clear that co-operation is by definition a two-way process.  In the fields of political, economic and security co-operation this Government are determined to play their full part in bringing peace, stability and reconciliation to our people.  We expect the British Government to do the same.  Whatever our temporary differences, we in these two islands have so much in common that Anglo-Irish co-operation is vital in our joint interest.  But it must be full and wholehearted in its inspiration and in its working.  We cannot accept a selective or inconsistent approach to mutual co-operation.  I, therefore, ask all the Members of the House to support the Government's efforts to further develop the agreed Anglo-Irish institutions as we press for a joint initiative which will directly tackle the problem of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In our determination to promote such an initiative and in line with the Taoiseach's declaration that the Northern Ireland problem is the first political priority of this Government, we have made efforts to obtain the understanding of all other concerned Governments for our objectives.  Indeed this problem affects not just the people of Ireland and Britain but it has had repercussions across the Atlantic and is deplored by many as a continuing threat to the stability of the Western community of nations.</P>
    <P>In office we have sought to maximise <Col N="2944" /> the potential of the American dimension in moving towards a solution of the difficulties in Northern Ireland.  On his first visit there this year the Taoiseach sought to enlist the support of the current US Administration and in particular to encourage a commitment on its part to Irish unity.  All the indications are that the Taoiseach's visit made a major impact and there are encouraging signs that our position is gaining understanding and support at the highest levels in the United States.  I can assure the House that the momentum created by the Taoiseach's talks with President Reagan is being exploited to the full by my Department and its personnel in our Embassy and other offices in the United States.  The recent visit of an influential group of our friends from both Houses of the US Congress marked a further step in the process by which we hope to give Irish-Americans and our other friends in America a positive policy to support.  As the Taoiseach said in his New York address during his most recent visit there, this Government will work with all those in America who share our ultimate objective of the unity of the people of Ireland and our abhorrence of violence.  To this end we are determined to promote closer and more fruitful contacts with all our friends there.</P>
    <P>In our contacts with other Governments too, particularly among our European partners, there is increasing understanding of our policies on Northern Ireland and, in particular, a ready support for a joint Anglo-Irish approach to the problem.  This growing conviction in other countries that an Anglo-Irish context is the appropriate one for resolving the problem is a rational and encouraging development.</P>
    <P>Let the House be assured then that this Government are committed to the most vigorous pursuit of our political objectives regarding Northern Ireland.  We have every reason to be encouraged by the degree of international acceptance which they have already gained and, with the support of the House, we are confident that these objectives will be achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal later in my contribution with the negative and unconstructive remarks made by the Minister in regard to what he titled Anglo-Irish relations.  What he was talking about were relations between Irish people in this part of the country and Irish people in the other part of the country. Yet he chose to see this in the context of Anglo-Irish relations rather than relations between Irish people.  It is this fixation with Britain on the part of Fianna Fáil which has thrown a blight over relations between the people within the two parts of this country and is mainly responsible for the fact that we have made no progress whatever towards the achievement of our declared objective in this area.  However, I shall deal with this matter in greater depth later in my contribution.</P>
      <P>The best way to judge this or any other Government is on the basis of their own statements, what they say they are going to do, and compare that with what they actually achieve.  By comparing their quoted aspirations since they took office late in 1979 with actual achievement since then the Taoiseach and the Government can be shown to have failed miserably in the four areas which they themselves identified as being of major importance. These are: jobs, reduction in borrowing on the current budget deficit, energy conservation and the promotion of North-South co-operation.  They have failed in each of these four areas that they set for themselves as the areas in which they sought to make major achievements.  I will demonstrate this by quotations from the Taoiseach and by comparison with results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Adjournment Debate on 18 December 1980 the Taoiseach said that the economic policies urged by him gave priority to the maintenance and provision of employment.  He spoke of how his statements in this matter had won approval from people in Europe and elsewhere. Compare his aspirations with the reality.  At the time he spoke unemployment stood at 118,000 people; it now stands at 154,000 people.  Compare the Taoiseach's statement of his priorities and his clear inability to achieve them. <Col N="2946" /> Compare the fact that we now have unemployment at 154,000 people with the fact that at the time the Taoiseach took office in December 1979 unemployment was at a level of no more than 85,000.</P>
    <P>I would also draw attention to the fact that the Taoiseach has consistently made statements in the House to suggest that he was giving a major priority to the elimination of the current budget deficit. This goes right back to 1979.  I quote from column 2042 of the Official Report of 13 December 1979.  He said:</P>
    <P>Government borrowing, which helps to fuel both this deficit and inflation, is simply too high.</P>
    <P>In 1980 he said we must restrain current expenditure so as to achieve a reduction in the current budget deficit in order to free as much as possible of our resources for investment and as a contribution to reducing the rate of inflation.  He has been talking about this, but the evidence of his failure to achieve any of what he set out to do in regard to the current budget deficit is to be found in his own statement in the confidence debate a few weeks ago.  In that debate he said that now that trade in the European Community had begun to revive, we could begin to phase out the budget deficit.  He said in 1979 he was going to do something about it; he said in 1980 he was going to do something about it; and now in 1982 he is telling us he is going to begin to do something about it.  Clearly, there rarely has been such a mismatch between performance and aspirations as there has been on the part of this Government in regard to this area.</P>
    <P>I would like to bring Members' minds back to the day when Deputy Haughey was appointed as Taoiseach.  His first press conference was primarily concerned with the priority he was going to give to the energy problem.  He said at column 2042 of the Official Report of 13 December 1979:</P>
    <P>In 1972, this country spent £53 million in buying oil from abroad, or 2.4 per cent of national output.  This year we may well spend close to £500 million <Col N="2947" /> or about 6½ per cent of output ....</P>
    <P>These facts will, I hope, give some of the background to my decision to put so much emphasis on energy policy ....  If we solve our energy problem, we will have gone some way towards solving our balance of payments and our inflation problems ....</P>
    <P>What has the Taoiseach to show for all this emphasis he was putting on energy policy?  At the time he took office he said we were spending 6½ per cent of our output on imported oil.  In 1981, after all this emphasis, we were spending 8.4 per cent, two percentage points more of our output on imported energy.  That is a clear indication of failure by the Government in the areas that they had selected as those in which they intended to have the greatest achievement.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told us in 1979 that he hoped to take a keen interest in encouraging and promoting the development of social, cultural and economic links between North and South.  What social or cultural links have been achieved between North and South as a result of the Taoiseach's efforts?  Has the Taoiseach visited the North to talk to people in Northern Ireland?  Has he even gone so far as to allow his presence to have the beneficent effect that one would hope it would have on the people of Northern Ireland?  No, he has not even crossed the Border to visit the people for whom he expresses so much concern about achieving unity with.</P>
    <P>There have been no improvements in social or cultural contacts as a result of any initiative by the Taoiseach.  There have, of course, been contacts with the British Government; but we are talking about contact with Irish people in Ireland.  Nothing has been done to achieve a better relationship with the one and a half million Irish people in Northern Ireland about whom we speak so much in regard to having a political unity with them.  His own cherished Anglo-Irish relationship has been damaged by the fact that he has, without any particular necessity and without achieving <Col N="2948" /> any result as far as the bringing about of cessation of hostilities is concerned, gratuitously adopted a radically different position and to some degree an apparently offensive position in regard to the conflict in the Falkland Islands.  I am not saying that, if one were to look at the matter dispassionately and if Ireland were a country somewhere in the Pacific, we might not, having looked at the conflict between Britain and Argentina over the Falklands, have come to a view not totally different from that of the Government. But Ireland is not the Pacific.</P>
    <P>We share a land boundary with Britain. We are seeking to get something from them and, in particular, to get them to encourage development in Northern Ireland along lines that would be conducive towards bringing the people of both parts of this island together.  We cannot ignore these realities and take stances solely for domestic political consumption that are so potentially damaging to our ability to achieve anything.</P>
    <P>This has been very eloquently borne out by the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He very curiously criticised the previous Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, for failure to pursue adequately the parliamentary dimension of the Anglo-Irish Government Council when he met Prime Minister Thatcher. He and the Taoiseach have been in office for the past four months.  What have they done about getting a parliamentary dimension to the Anglo-Irish Council? What results have they to show for their four months as against our seven months? None at all.  But he does not mention that because there has not been any substantive meeting between himself and Mrs. Thatcher at which this could be discussed. Why has there been no substantive meeting between himself and Mrs. Thatcher at which this might be discussed? The reason lies in the unnecessary stance taken by the Government in regard to the Falklands Islands crisis. That is why they have made no progress. They should not criticise the previous Government for lack of progress on something in regard to which they have failed to make any progress.  The whole contribution of the Minister in regard to <Col N="2949" /> the Northern Ireland/Southern Ireland relationship seems to be concerned exclusively with its British dimension, its American dimension and its European dimension.  He did not mention the Asian dimension of the Northern Ireland problem but I am sure the next time he makes a speech he will be telling us he has gone to see the Prime Minister of Singapore about solving the Northern Ireland problem. He has not told us anything about going to see the political parties in Northern Ireland or about talking to the people in Northern Ireland about this problem.  It is all about trotting off to Washington or bringing people from Washington over here or trotting off to London to solve an Irish problem involving Irish people.</P>
    <P>The whole approach of the Government seems to be one of speaking above the heads of the people in Northern Ireland to other people about the problems of Northern Ireland.  If you want to achieve co-operation and a constructive approach from people whose interests you are expressing it is common good manners to talk to them before you start talking about them over their heads to someone else.</P>
    <P>That is reasonable and good manners in regard to our own personal relationships with anybody.  Yet in regard to achieving unity of hearts and minds among the people in this island, this Government do not act in accordance with that tenet of good manners of talking to the people concerned directly as well as talking about them to someone else.  The Government seem to see the problem in Northern Ireland as a diplomatic problem. It is not a diplomatic problem that can be solved in the chancelleries of the world at cocktail parties.  It is a human problem involving people who disagree with one another and with us.  These disagreements must be eliminated by patient conversation, discussion and co-operation over a long period.  These disagreements will only be exacerbated by talking above the heads of those people. Those are my remarks about what I regard as an unfortunate passage in the <Col N="2950" /> Minister's speech which we could have well done without.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject, however, I will make some reference to something he said.  He said, &ldquo;I would, therefore, ask all the Members of the House to support the Government's effort to further develop the agreed Anglo-Irish institutions as we press for a joint initiative which will directly tackle the problems of Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  I hope that we will be able to support the Government in their initiatives, but the Minister commenced his contribution on this subject with a gratuitous attack on Deputy FitzGerald in regard to his activities as Taoiseach in this field.  This certainly is not creating a climate in which the type of co-operation which he pretends to seek is most likely to be willingly forthcoming.  However, I know that my party will not pay undue attention to these gratuitous remarks on the part of the Minister.  So long as the views I have expressed in regard to the need to pay primary attention to the concerns and interests of the people directly affected in Northern Ireland are taken into account, that constructive dialogue can be opened between the Government and the main Opposition party in regard to this area.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn back to the economic area and refer again to something said by the Taoiseach in this field.  He said in the confidence debate that export-led growth is now within our grasp.  However, this optimism does not seem to be matched in other more informed fora in regard to economic development.  The Algemene Bank Nederland in their report published in June this year say that the anticipated up-turn in the world economy has not yet materialised and that the OECD, who in December forecast a 1.25 per cent growth in world production in 1982, have now revised this growth figure downwards to 0.3 per cent.  This world economic recovery on the basis of which we can postpone all hard decisions here on our own economy is always around the corner, but either it never comes around the corner or we never go around the corner, because for the last few years we have never seemed to meet this wonderful <Col N="2951" /> economic recovery.  I advise the Government not to put too much hope in a world recovery in demand and that they had better put first priority on putting our own house in order so that we can survive here whether or not there is a recovery in world demand.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that there is widespread reluctance on the part of the community to accept further increases in taxation, but he went on to say that if it were put to the Irish people &mdash; I can imagine him commissioning the opinion poll himself &mdash; as to whether they want more Government services and thus more taxation, their answer would pretty universally be against higher levels of taxation. Again, I agree with the Taoiseach, but unfortunately he seemed to be mis-stating or misunderstanding the problem.  If we are to reduce our current budget deficit the problem is not whether we want more services, because if we are to reduce our current budget deficit without increasing taxation we must reduce Government services.  It is not a nice, kindly choice, would you like more of this or less of that?  If we are to reduce our current budget deficit we must have either more taxation or fewer services. You cannot close the gap any other way. Yet the Taoiseach seems to have the idea that there is some soft option, if we are to go by the statement he made as reported in the Official Report of 1 July 1982, column 564, volume 337.  That is not so.  There is no soft option, and I hope the Taoiseach will not attempt to delude the people any longer that there is.</P>
    <P>I would like to say something about a matter which looms so large in many government speeches, that is the great economic and social plan which we are to see some time after athe Dáil has gone into recess and can no longer discuss it and after the electors of Galway East have voted and cannot take it into account.  This plan is an excuse for not answering any questions at the moment. If a Government Minister is asked what they are going to do about this employment, that public sector pay, taxation, the answer always is, &ldquo;I cannot tell you <Col N="2952" /> now but wait until we produce our economic and social plan&rdquo;.  An economic and social plan which is an excuse for not answering legitimate questions about the Government's economic policy now is worse than useless.  Of course, it is very hard to be against planning.  Who could be against planning?  However, the record of the present Government party in this matter has not been particularly hopeful.  The Government have changed their view about even who should be doing the planning.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said in 1979 that he believed that the planning function in our economy should be concentrated in one Department so that there would be no unnecessary mixing of priorities.  As a result he abolished the Department of Economic Planning and Development and put the planning function into the Department of Finance, a very good move.  Having said that, he has now proceeded in this economic plan to take the function of planning away from the Department of Finance and have the plan drawn up in his own Department by a civil servant who is now responsible to the Taoiseach personally.  In other words, the Taoiseach is acting contrary to his own prescribed advice that planning should rest clearly in one Department. He has a bit of it in the Department of Finance and a bit of it in the Department of the Taoiseach.  That will not lead to rational planning or the type of constructive co-operation which is necessary from all arms of Government if it is to be effective.</P>
    <P>This plan must first clearly state the unemployment problem.  It must not attempt to pretend that it is any less than it is.  Secondly, it must clearly and honestly state the problem that we have with our public finances and not pretend that it is simply a question of postponing something if we want to reduce the budget deficit.  It is far more serious than that.  We face the prospect of either reducing services or increasing taxation. I hope that the plan will be honest about those matters.  Thirdly, I hope that the plan will set specific, quantified targets for Government expenditure, for taxation in terms of percentage of GNP and <Col N="2953" /> £s raised, for inflation, for agricultural production and for industrial production, broken down by sector and into figures, so that if we fail we will see where we fail or we can ask why we have failed.  Also, it is vitally important that the plan be linked in to Government expenditure. Every Department are spending every year in substantial quantity but nobody ever asks whether any of this money is achieving any of the alleged objectives of the Departments spending it.  We need a plan which says that £X million is being devoted to the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism and that is expected to achieve Y jobs and Z new industries here.  We must link in the plan objectives to Government expenditure. Up to now we have had the experience of having plans introduced which involved the Government's planning everybody else's activities except their own.  As a result we had aspirations about Government expenditure which were far exceeded in the actual outcome as against what the plan set out to do.</P>
    <P>There is a need to reform the public service.  Today 26 per cent of our work force are in the public sector as against 16 per cent in 1960.  The Devlin Report of 1969 recommended far-reaching reforms of the public service but practically nothing has happened in this regard. I have asked questions about this under the headings of mobility within the public service from one Department to another and the bringing in of people from outside and I have ascertained that since Devlin reported 23 officials in the entire country have moved in or out of any Department as a result of the mobility scheme recommended by Devlin.  In respect of 11 of the 19 Departments of State no civil servant has moved anywhere as a result of that scheme.  Of the 23 who moved, 11 were in one Department, the Department of Labour.  Devlin recommended the establishment of an Aireacht which would do the policy making and also an executive unit that would execute the policy so as to avoid the situation of Ministers being bogged down in administration and consequently being unable to make the real decisions that are necessary in regard to policy.  Seven of <Col N="2954" /> the Departments of Governments have not done anything concrete yet about establishing an Aireacht in their own areas and three of them, including the Minister's Department, say that the recommendation does not even apply to them.  It can be said that only three Departments have unambiguously introduced the Devlin recommendations in regard to that vital matter.</P>
    <P>Devlin suggested also that there be open competition throughout the whole public service in respect of all important senior promotions such as secretaries, deputy secretaries and assistant secretaries so that the best man would be got for the job, regardless of where he came from.  Nothing has been done in that area in all those years since 1969.  I appreciate that successive Governments have been responsible for this failure.  Indeed, my party held office for a significant portion of the period in question, but the fact is that we must not start preaching about efficiency in the market sector of the economy while the public sector have failed so clearly to do anything about improving efficiency in accordance with the recommendations that we commissioned and accepted.  If we are to become a more efficient State the key watchword on economic policy should be an old fashioned one &mdash; more efficiency and more value for money everywhere.  In that way sufficient jobs will be created.</P>
    <P>Another area where we must act is that of creating the incentive to work. Between 1978 and 1981 long-term social welfare benefits increased by 90 per cent while the corresponding short-term benefits increased by 70 per cent although wages for people working increased by only 60 per cent.  Clearly, the gap between what one can get while not working and what one can get while working has narrowed.  Since then social welfare benefits have increased by 25 per cent while wages have increased by about 13 per cent.  This means that the incentive to work is being diminished further.  If we are to put this country back on its feet we must provide the incentive to work, and that is why our policy of introducing taxation in respect of short-term social welfare benefits was right and why the <Col N="2955" /> Government were wrong to have acted to reject that policy.  However, I understand that most of the Fianna Fáil back benchers believe now that we were right on that issue.  Perhaps they agree also that most of the other proposals in the budget we introduced were correct also.</P>
    <P>We must look, too, to the services and the professions for more efficiency.  We had the incident recently of the barristers' profession restricting entry to that important profession.  That will have the result of increasing legal fees and costs.  Anyone who wishes to settle anything in the courts will have to pay more, because the availability of fewer barristers will mean that they will be able to charge more. That sort of restrictive practice whether in the barristers' profession, the medical profession or any other, must be eliminated. I trust that the Government will take a strong line on enforcing the restrictive practices legislation so that we may be rid of all those restrictive practices in respect of entry to professions or to trades, practices whereby only people with certain artificial qualifications are allowed to perform certain functions while other people who are equally able to perform those functions are prevented from doing so.</P>
    <P>We must take action also on transport policy.  The lack of a coherent transport policy and the lack of liberalisation in regard to the State monopoly on transport in many sectors of the economy has been one of the main reasons in stifling efficiency and preventing firms from expanding as well as causing extra costs to apply in Ireland compared with the other countries with which we must compete. The paranoiac reaction of CIE to the criticism published recently by Dr. Sean Barrett shows how far the company are prepared to go to prevent a view being published with which they do not agree.  It would not seem to indicate that they have a very tenable case.  Clearly there is a need for the Government to look forcibly at this area of transport policy so as to achieve the maximum efficiency in the interest of the community.</P>
    <P>We need to have much greater efficiency <Col N="2956" /> also in the area of educational expenditure.  There are wide divergences between the cost per student in various types of higher education as well as in various types of secondary education.  It is obvious that in some instances we are not getting good value for money in this area and at the same time we are not spending enough money on other areas of education because of waste in the areas I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>It is in all of these areas to which I have referred that we can really do something about bringing about more efficiency in our economy.  If we talk about boosting aggregate demand, of pumping money into the economy, unfortunately the efforts in that area mostly benefit people outside the country.  This is because demand pumped into the Irish economy translates itself quickly into imports and consequently into extra jobs in Japan, America or elsewhere.  But if we concentrate on making our own economy more efficient in the areas of education, transport, of public sector reform and in the area I have mentioned so often, of this House itself, any benefits we derive will be kept entirely within our own economy. That is the sort of emphasis that I should like to see the Government give force to in their economic plan.  I wish them success in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Leader of this party has offered to the Government constructive discussion in regard to the content of the economic plan.  I have suggested that there should be an inter-departmental committee on the economy where we could discuss the content of the Government plan. Obviously, we will not agree about all the measures that the Government will propose but at least we can agree on the facts.  Because the parties do not agree on the facts at the moment, both Government and Opposition can afford to make promises that the country cannot afford. I invite the Government to respond to our suggestion and I look forward to the Taoiseach indicating such response when he intervenes in this debate tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall commence my contribution to this debate by posing the question to the Government side: is there <Col N="2957" /> anything that divides the Government from any party on the Opposition benches in the matter of recognition of the seriousness of the crisis in which we find ourselves in the country?  The answer to this question is that it appears to me now at any rate &mdash; if one is to judge by the tenor of recent Government pronouncements and speeches &mdash; that there is very little difference of perception now between Government and Opposition speakers on this point.  In perception there appears now to be recognition on the part of Government Ministers that the economy is in deep crisis.  Of course there may still be entertained on this side of the House a lack of trust in the matter of their willingness to take action.  But, in matters of perception, Government Ministers are now competing, one with the other, in saying how serious is the situation and how drastically needed is remedial action.  To the extent that this agreement on perception has arrived we must accept that it represents progress. When one considers that Members of this Government were speaking otherwise quite recently it represents progress for part of this Government, by the more clear-sighted elements within this Cabinet, from the totally confusing position adopted by them last March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Casting our minds back to March last, then it was the firm of bloom and boom was in the ascendancy.  That was the type of speech one heard from the Government benches.  One had the Minister for Finance making the point of bloom and boom in headlines in this optimistic assessment of our position, as contrasted with the gloomy speeches of their predecessors in government.  We were in the spend, spend phase.  Public expenditure commitments were entered into as if money, borrowed or otherwise, had gone out of fashion.  The so-called savage budget of the Coalition Government was totally out of fashion.  We were told that Ministers of the previous Government had talked down the economy, that we had frightened off foreign investment with wild statements.  Our statements then in that Government, our perception then, led us to take action throughout that government period about the seriousness <Col N="2958" /> of the crisis in the public finances but those statements and actions of ours were derided.  We were, one and all, taken to book by the present Taoiseach and many of his Ministers.</P>
    <P>Now, of course, things have changed. In fact one might say that some of these born-again Ministers are beginning to embarrass us with the force of their late conversion.  They speak with all the zeal of the newly-converted.  Of course others in the Cabinet are a little confused, perhaps those who are not working in the economic area and, in times of great temptation, such as by-elections, are given to relapses into old habits.  We could forgive them these relapses.  When we remember their belief that a couple of millions here or there would hardly be missed in the hundreds of millions of foreign borrowing which must be arranged every week and month, we need not be too hard on them.  It was their belief that a few millions would not be missed in such large amounts of borrowing as are still proceeding.</P>
    <P>The problem for the Government and for us as a country is that all the expensive horses were let out of the stable before the door was bolted.  It is a pity that this new-found realism, which has found so many recent converts in the Cabinet, was not recognised or accepted by them at the time when the budget was being formulated, when the PRSI concessions were being debated, or not debated, by the Government, or even when the Finance Bill was being formulated.  It is a tragedy for the country that this new-found realism was not then in evidence. Lest I be misunderstood or, worse, misrepresented, when I speak of realism in this matter of borrowing I want the House to understand what I mean.  Without a planned phasing-out of the current budget deficit our capacity to borrow abroad for valid, capital purposes is put at risk.  I am not one of those who harbours some puritanical dislike of borrowing for its own sake.  I accept that foreign borrowing must remain a feature of our economic development.  My only reservation is that the money borrowed is deployed in productive employment-creating investment.  That is why I make the <Col N="2959" /> point that a planned phasing out of the current budget deficit is vital if we are to maintain our capacity to effect the necessary borrowing for productive investment. It is a pity that the new-found realism of the Cabinet was not evident earlier when it mattered, when it counted.  But we must be thankful for small mercies that it may lead to belated action.  There is now this perception on the part of Government Ministers of the scale of the crisis in the economy and country.  One does not know whether this new-found firmness, this new realism on the part of the Government, this rush of blood to the head, was generated by the Exchequer returns for the first half of this year which showed that the budget deficit for the entire year of £679 million, so proudly announced on 25 March last, was exceeded in this part of the year already by £13 million.  It may be that this change of perception on the part of the Government was due to those undisputed figures. Of course it is also just possible that it has finally dawned on at least some of the Members of this Government that the foreign interest payments on government debt this year will be £500 million, or 4.4 per cent approximately of GNP. And it does not matter what speeches one makes at the United Nations, the European Economic Community, what press releases there are in foreign capitals or what Ministers or statesmen one meets, if our economy continues on this course nobody will be around to meet us and we know in whose company we will belong internationally.  We will be chief in the banana league if that trend were to continue, and no international posturings would save us from being designated to that kind of company.  I repeat £500 million, or 4.4 per cent approximately of GNP, and that estimate is a low one.  At least one economist, Dr. Brendan Walsh, puts the figure even higher than that. Therefore these Ministers in this Cabinet, including the Taoiseach, now realise that even on a neutral budget &mdash; that is one with no extra taxation, one incorporating no extra expenditure measures and containing favourable exchange rate projections, all of these now highly unlikely <Col N="2960" />&mdash; interest payments on foreign debt will more than wipe out the benefits of any possible economic growth in the next five years unless foreign borrowings for current Government expenditure are wound down within a definite, planned time scale.</P>
    <P>Recently we have had the warnings from the European Commission.  We have had warnings from a highly placed member of the Commission staff who took the trouble of coming to our country and telling us directly what the scale of our problems is.  The Commission has warned that unless there is tangible evidence of improvement in both the deficits on public finances and the balance of payments in 1982 and 1983, and I quote, &ldquo;lenders might grant shorter periods for loan repayments&rdquo;.  If that were to happen we would have the following scenario in that debt repayment, a telescoping of the debt repayments, larger payments to be made in a shorter period and central debt payments, would all jump, forcing any Irish Government on the disastrous course of embarking on further taxation.</P>
    <P>In a paper presented to a conference of the IFA on 10 June a member of the Commission's Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs pointed out that if the massive balance of payments deficits recorded since 1980 are allowed to persist unchecked a devaluation within the EMS may be forced on the country.  Despite the improvement projected in this year's balance of payments deficit, I believe that the collapse of the Government's budgetary strategy in the latter half of this year will necessitate further borrowing which, in turn, will drive up interest payments and the outflow of funds from the economy in 1983.  That sequence of events points towards devaluation.</P>
    <P>I say &ldquo;collapse of the Government's budgetary strategy in the latter half of this year&rdquo; because I do not believe that the accelerated VAT payments will be received this year.  We must not forget that the state of Government budgetary strategy, the budgetary target towards which the Government are working, relying on over £176 million in accelerated corporation tax and VAT payments and <Col N="2961" /> £45 million in revenue buoyancy I believe, will definitely, not become a reality this year.  It is common knowledge at the moment that the Revenue Commissioners are having difficulty in collecting normal VAT, PAYE and PRSI payments from many companies.  Importers and many companies are in arrear on their existing back payments.  The Minister for Finance must know of the large number of businesses presently negotiating with the Revenue Commissioners deferment of their tax dues.  I do not believe for a moment that the £140 million essential to achieving Government budgetary targets will be collected this year.</P>
    <P>We are still waiting for details of the promised scheme to utilise the Industrial Credit Corporation in on-lending funds to companies which experience difficulties in paying additional VAT in the autumn.  It is common knowledge that the Revenue Commissioners will be unable to make rebates to exporters on their raw material purchases until fully six weeks after VAT has been paid on these goods.  The effects can be imagined, the adverse effects this will have on firms' capacity at this time of great strain.  These facts suggest to me, especially the £36 million accelerated corporation tax, that the Government's budgetary strategy in the latter half of this year must inevitably collapse.  Of course the £36 million is part of their budgetary strategy.  The other part is the £45 million revenue buoyancy.  Again, I contest that it is possible to expect that money to be received this year.  No one who has looked at any figures of recent retail sales returns expects these figures to be realised.  These twin facts and analysis of what is occurring at the moment incline me to the belief that this difficult budgetary situation will get much worse in the latter half of this year.</P>
    <P>There are some who argue that a way out might be found through devaluation. When one talks about that as a way out it is, of course, forgotten that we are vulnerable.  Any devaluation of the punt is highlighted by the growing percentage of the public sector debt now held abroad.  That exceeds 60 per cent of total <Col N="2962" /> debt and interest payments and almost 10 per cent of export earnings.  The fact that so high a percentage of our public sector debt is now held abroad should cause those who favour devaluation as a way out to pause.  I said there was some agreement now between certain Members of the Government and of the Opposition of a common perception of the scale of economic crisis.  But action is another matter.  I say, with regret, the Government's conversion has come much too late, their conversion in perception, and one is therefore doubtful of their capacity to confront the economic crisis.</P>
    <P>Next month the Department of Finance will be asking spending Departments to submit their Estimates for 1983. Ministers will soon be put to the test in their various Departments.  Those of us who have been in Government know exactly the kind of exercise now confronting Ministers in spending Departments. We know the kind of meetings that will be shortly in the offing.  Because of the shortfalls I have mentioned &mdash; the £176 million plus the £45 million in revenue buoyancy, Government strategy must lead &mdash; indeed, will lead &mdash; to a current budget deficit now of over £900 million at a conservative estimate and an opening deficit for 1983 of what now can be seen to be at a minimum no less than £1,200 million.  If there is this change in perception on the part of the Government one might argue that they have had ample opportunity to demonstrate their conversion on the road to Damascus.  That still holds good as they go into these inevitable discussions.  The Ministers in the spending Departments will be confronted with the reality of the budget next year with that kind of deficit facing them. Doubts, of course, persist over the Government's strategy.  The monetary stance pursued by the Central Bank is bound to continue to be restricted.  The high interest rates are bound to continue so long as uncertainty continues about the intentions of the Government &mdash; that is, apart from their expressions of recognition of problems in the economy. The existing high interest rates, even though short-term rates are dropping on <Col N="2963" /> the Dublin inter-bank market, are unlikely to decline for most borrowers this year for the following reason: Government borrowing for the first six months of this year stood at £1,136 million or 67 per cent of the projected Exchequer borrowing requirement for the entire year.  It is almost certain that the EBR will be near to £2 billion for the year as a whole.  Last year's borrowing requirement at 16.9 per cent was the It was the highest ever recorded in any EEC country despite the July 1981 budget.  Even though our borrowing requirements at 16.9 per cent was the highest ever recorded, and despite our efforts in that July budget to mend the situation, efforts which were greeted with a lack of support on the Opposition benches at that time, even with that effort on our part to take the right direction and deal with the crisis our borrowing requirement of 16.9 per cent was the highest ever recorded in any EEC country.</P>
    <P>The crowding out of other borrowers by the Government's own borrowing requirement will be repeated this year and will keep interest rates high in order to control private credit expansion.  The current level of interest rates is clearly not conducive to investment, and, therefore, to employment, and is also bad news for mortgage holders who are now facing an unprecedented mortgage rate of almost 18 per cent.</P>
    <P>Mention of mortgage holders brings home the reality of high interest rates for ordinary people.  The Government who assert their interest in the high price of house mortgages have brought about the high interest rate because nobody, including the Central Bank, attaches any credibility to their budget strategy.</P>
    <P>Our exchange rate and interest rates are combining to undermine the one beacon of hope in the present gloom, the performance of industrial exports, which will be up 7 per cent.  Our exchange rate and interest rates are serving to undermine that possibility of recovery in the economy.  I have already briefly referred to devaluation as a way out.  Voices have been raised suggesting that devaluation <Col N="2964" /> was a remedy that would maintain our competitiveness in the export market, or, indeed, on the home market.  My belief is that any devaluation would offer only temporary respite.  That route offers no automatic solution to our economic difficulties however attractive the short term possibilities might be.  The option of devaluation would not absolve the Government from the task of winding down our foreign borrowing.  Rather, it would make it absolutely essential to retain the beneficial effects on exporting companies' costs.  Without firm and resolute Government, the danger must be that spiralling inflation would result from a devaluation at this point.  Furthermore, interest rates would rise even further in such a situation.  The onus is now squarely on the Government to indicate the taxation and expenditure measures it will take to avoid a forced devaluation of the currency. I hope we have now got past the nonsense of contrasting gloom and doom with bloom and boom and we are now at the reality of what we will do about what is accepted by all as a crisis in our economy.</P>
    <P>I should now like to examine the areas where there is little consensus between us, the Labour Party and the Government. I am referring, of course, to the means chosen to confront not only the financial crisis but also the human crisis which accompanies it, an inevitable accompaniment.  One may ask what do such things as exchange rates and interest rates matter to ordinary people, but they are of concern to them because we have a high unemployment rate accompanying those high interest rates which militate against extra employment and the borrowings of the Government eat up productive investment.  We differ from the Government in that they appear to be standing idly by, as a former leader of Fianna Fáil said in another crisis, when it comes to dealing with the human crisis of unemployment as reflected in the record 151,000 unemployment we are now experiencing.  By a series of hints and leaks we can begin to picture what appears to be the evolving Government strategy for dealing with the mess they are now in.  Public services are to be cut, <Col N="2965" /> in a way as yet unspecified.  Public service numbers are to be reduced, in a way yet unspecified.  It is ironic that that will be done by a Government who between 1977 and 1981 caused the greatest expansion in the public service.  Public service pay rates are to be moderated but not frozen.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see how a basic agreement governing incomes either in the public or private sectors can be secured given the effects of the Government's mismanagement of the economy.  The Government's action will make agreement in this area difficult to obtain.</P>
    <P>On taxation the Commission on Taxation proposals will doubtless get a thorough airing.  The Government have already signalled that the level of taxation has reached the maximum that will be tolerated by the public.  If the Government are referring to the tax taken from PAYE, I fully agree.  However, total silence is the response so far on the need to increase capital taxation.  What appears to be emerging is a fairly crude approach to public expenditure cuts. Housing, health and social welfare are areas where cuts are to take place.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the no confidence motion in the Government I questioned the seriousness of the Government's commitment to planning in terms of their unwillingness to accept that their own actions must give some indication that they are consistent with a planned approach to the economy.  The Government's plan, which we are all awaiting anxiously, will be given serious consideration by my party, even though we are sceptical at present of their capacity to deliver on their own contribution to the effective operation of such a plan. The Minister for Education in the debate on 1 July chided the previous Government for not bringing in a plan in the eight months we were in office.</P>
    <P>He forgets that we correctly attempted &mdash; it is recognised we largely succeeded &mdash; in bringing a planned approach to Government expenditure which was in a state of chaos prior to our taking office. Before a Government starts planning an economy, they have to place their own expenditure and revenue on a planned <Col N="2966" /> course.  That was our approach.  Any plan sets out objectives or aims, the means of achieving them and the constraints or parameters on their achievement.  It is the task of a Government to try to create the necessary consensus required to implement such a plan.  The evidence to date is that the Government have not earned the respect of the people so that they can seek the necessary sacrifices that must be made by all if the economic and financial crisis is to be seriously tackled.</P>
    <P>In the crucial area of taxation policy, the Government have persisted in reacting to protests over PAYE and PRSI with piecemeal reforms.  However, now that the Report of the Commission on Taxation is available to the Government the time has come for a comprehensive approach to tax reform.  The Coalition Government did not wait for the Commission's report because we believed in getting on with the job.  With the benefit of hindsight the Government may well regret their abandoning a tax credit system. It would have enabled them to make their PRSI concessions at approximately half the £45 million it will now cost.  But, most important, it would have provided a much fairer administrative mechanism for adjusting the burden of taxation at various income levels.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation are reported in the newspapers to have recommended an expenditure tax or sur-tax above a certain level, with a standard rate of income tax for all taxpayers.  Whatever taxation system is decided on some of the glaring inequities and anomalies in the present system should not be carried over into the new system.  The Government's own amendments to the March budget indicated precious little movement towards genuine reform.  Interest relief for new mortgage holders on the higher tax rates was restored.  Such a move has wider implications for the allocation of resources in housebuilding, or rather it restored an incentive to perpetuate the present system which misallocates resources in favour of the more expensive dwelling.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, there are a few simple realities that need to be encompassed in any taxation reform: the <Col N="2967" /> burden of tax on the PAYE sector must not be increased; the lower paid must have an incentive to work; the tax base must be widened and the combined yield from all forms of capital taxation should be progressively raised to at least 1 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>In the time at my disposal I have concentrated on the economic side.  Most of my experience in Government has been on the economic side.  What concerns most people is their ability to live in this economy and their future security.  It is on economic strategy and wisdom that the Government will be judged by the people.  Whether this Government have the will to govern throughout the next three or four years remains to be seen. So far all the evidence, judging the Government in an unbiased way, is that they have not.  If the Government want to hang on to office simply for the purpose of governing, they will have this side of the House to reckon with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate takes place today under the darkening shadow of mass unemployment.  With more than 150,000 officially unemployed and the real total probably nearer 200,000, none can seriously deny that this is the most serious political and social problem facing Irish democracy today.  Yet what have this Government, or their predecessors, done to solve it?  Sweet damn all.</P>
      <P>Radical new proposals are needed to tackle this problem, but even within the existing system there is a lamentable failure to exploit resources to the full when it comes to job creation.</P>
      <P>New jobs could be created very quickly if a liaison system could be established between the Departments of Social Welfare, the Environment, Labour, and AnCO.  A task force based on these bodies could develop public work schemes which could at least take the sharp edge off the experience of starting life on the dole &mdash; the grim spectre now facing so many of our young people.  There is plenty of work for young people to do in our cities and in our towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely it would be better to have them carrying out badly needed work on community <Col N="2968" /> services and infrastructural development than simply drawing dole.  These young people want to work, and there is no more soul-destroying experience than to be unemployed and facing the prospect, in a few years, of becoming unemployable through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>This is no exaggeration.  Of more than 50,000 young people currently unemployed the new Youth Employment Agency estimate that 20,000 could go through life without ever having a job.</P>
    <P>With such a daunting prospect before us I do not intend to launch into a party point-scoring exercise on what might have been if politicians on both sides of the House had grappled more seriously with this problem in the past.  I want to emphasise, with all the force at my command, the need to tackle this problem in a new way.  We must inject hope into our young people.  We must convince them that they have a future in this country, and that can only be done if we show them we are prepared to tackle the unemployment problem on a bigger and better scale than ever before.</P>
    <P>The Government have an opportunity to meet this challenge in their new economic development plan.  The Workers' Party urgently hope that they will have the courage to seize that opportunity. Such a plan must, of course and will win widespread acceptance if it is to succeed. And it must also commit the Government to invest in wealth generating economic activities.</P>
    <P>Too often in the past money has been invested haphazardly, or in providing a carrot for private industry which has singularly failed to bite.  Alternatively, Governments have sought to create jobs in the public sector which have simply swelled the ranks of the civil service. What we need is Government investment that will create productive jobs in both the public and private sectors.  They will generate the wealth not alone to repay debts incurred in financing new job creation but the extra funds needed to create yet more jobs.</P>
    <P>Such a strategy must be firmly based on our natural resources.  We have a rich country, but we are singularly failing to utilise its wealth in the interests of the <Col N="2969" /> people.  Every year, for instance, we export 350,000 tonnes of lead and zinc ore from the Navan Mines.  This ore is going to create jobs in smelters all over Europe, but none in Ireland itself.  We are still waiting for the zinc smelter promised in the 1977 election campaign, and the countless downstream industry jobs this would generate.  At present the only employment generated by the export of this valuable mineral resource is fewer than two dozen jobs in Dublin port.</P>
    <P>If we do not act soon in this area we shall end up with nothing to show except a huge hole in the ground, as happened at Gortdrum.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, most of our natural resources are renewable ones.  It is estimated that at least 23,000 extra jobs could be created in food processing alone if we were utilising our agricultural wealth efficiently.  At present the vast bulk of our cattle are exported live and, even when animals are slaughtered at home, many of the valuable by-products are also exported to provide jobs abroad. How many jobs in the leather industry could have been saved if Irish firms had been able to buy Irish hides at competitive prices at home instead of having to re-import them, ready treated, from Britain?</P>
    <P>A similar situation exists with the sheep industry.  Raw wool from Ireland is exported untreated and has to be reimported by textile firms.  In our party publication, the Irish industrial revolution, it is estimated that more than 4,000 jobs could be created from these sources by 1986.  An even more glaring failure in national economic planning was exposed by my colleague, Deputy De Rossa, last week when he spoke on the fishery Estimate. On that occasion Deputy De Rossa pointed out the tremendous job opportunities that existed in the fish farming area &mdash; if the recommendations of the National Board of Science and Technology in this area in a recent report are accepted.  Figures cited by the NBST show that 20,000 tonnes of fish farmed-salmon will be produced by the Norwegians each year by the end of the eighties while in Ireland we are not producing 20 tonnes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2970" /> It is this type of imaginative approach and the initiative which are needed if we are to face the jobs crisis, the biggest social crisis Ireland has faced since the Famine.  As a party committed to the attainment of full employment, the Workers' Party believes that employment could be increased by over 300,000 before the end of the decade if an integrated national economic plan was developed along the lines I have indicated.  Of course such a plan requires money and, some will argue, we have borrowed enough already.  A fact which must be confronted by this Government &mdash; and every Deputy in the House &mdash; is that there is no shortage of money in this country; it is the political will to use it in the public interest which is in short supply.</P>
    <P>No economic plan that is worthy of the name can ignore the need to control the lending policies and interest rates of the commercial banks.  Earlier in this session we saw a host of semi-State companies, many of them with fine records of contributing to the Irish economy, such as the Irish Sugar Company, Irish Shipping, Irish Steel and B &amp; I, being given expanded share capital allocations by the Government.</P>
    <P>This, in itself, was a policy welcomed by my own party.  But, having recognised the fact that these semi-State bodies were undercapitalised, the Government then performed a double-think and told them to borrow for their immediate needs. What we are doing is driving these enterprises into the arms of the bankers and surely one thing we can all agree on in this House is that the bankers already have far too strong a grip on all sectors of the economy &mdash; and that applies as much to farmers, to urban mortgage holders, to private industry as to semi-State enterprises.</P>
    <P>The time has come when the Government must assert its authority over the banks rather than allow the banks to dictate economic policy to the Government. Indeed my party would go further, and argue that the Government, in its new economic plan, should enter the banking arena itself by allowing the Post Office, <Col N="2971" /> or its successor, An Bord Post, to set up a national giro service.  Such a service would open up new investment funds for the Government and also help the small investor.  What better way is there to finance economic growth and, at the same time, cut out the banking middleman with his exorbitant interest rip-offs?</P>
    <P>But the creation of this new wealth is not simply an end in itself.  For too long the privileged few in Ireland have exploited scarce resources for their own benefit.  Any new economic plan must show that the efforts and sacrifices of Irish workers will be rewarded with better living standards and better social welfare and health facilities for the sick, and those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>This very evening saw hundreds of workers from a very long established firm here who had a monopoly in a particular business &mdash; I refer to Roadstone workers &mdash; marching to the gates of Leinster House criticising the company for its redundancy policy and its foreign investment plan; because the wealth being created by the sweat of these workers was being invested by the company in foreign investment.  Workers are very keen to see that management structures are correct and that management will do its business in a manner which will give the incentive to workers on the factory floor.  Such is not the case here.  The record of management is very bad.  People who are critical of workers have failed to examine the problems that exist in various areas.  I will be blunt and say that the expenditure of finance by such companies to provide staff cars for managers of all descriptions while workers are being asked to take a cut in their living standards has to stop. This is the kind of situation that has to be rectified, and the Government should take note of it and give the message loud and clear to those people who have got Government subventions to utilise it in the best interests of industry and its workers, because very often it is not being so used.</P>
    <P>Earlier this session, my party put down a detailed motion calling for a radical overhaul of the PRSI system.  While seeking to introduce a lower basic rate of <Col N="2972" /> PRSI with built-in tax reliefs for the lower paid, we also sought to remove the ceiling on contributions from the higher paid as an unfair anomaly in any social insurance scheme.  Under our proposals we believe that, for the first time in the history of this State, it could become possible to provide comprehensive medical care services for all, regardless of income.</P>
    <P>There is a deplorable situation here where people who are paying high amounts in taxation and PRSI contributions have absolutely nothing to gain from them.  The number of people who cannot qualify for full eligibility for health services is alarming.  If we had comprehensive medical care services for all it would remove forever the nagging problem of eligibility levels for families needing medical attention.  At the moment we have the ludicrous situation where it is sometimes better for a person to go to hospital for treatment rather than try and meet the cost of medical bills in the home.</P>
    <P>People in need of drugs or medical treatment should never be confronted with those sorts of choices.  The spectre of a family losing its medical card because one of the breadwinners has received a rise which may push them into a higher income bracket should be removed.  It is a petty means test procedure which costs as much to administer as it seeks to save in health expenditure.</P>
    <P>Our party are also seeking to bring other changes in Irish life.  The long-festering sore of ground rents needs to be lanced from the body politic once and for all.  In our Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Bill which we hope to introduce after the recess, we are seeking to abolish ground rents on tens of thousands of urban homes.</P>

      <P>In order to overcome objections based on property rights enshrined in the Constitution, we have allowed for the commutation of ground rents to ordinary contracts debts.  This is <Col N="2976" /> not an ideal solution from our point of view but it is a step in the right direction which has been welcomed by the Association of Combined Residents Associations who have spearheaded the campaign to abolish ground rents.</P>
      <P>The ground rents issue has also helped to highlight one of the major defects in the Constitution, the excessive rights accorded to private property.</P>
      <P>Another major defect in the Constitution is the bar on divorce.  Therefore The Workers' Party have also tabled a motion seeking to amend Article 41 of the the Constitution in this regard.</P>
      <P>For far too long Irish politicians have failed to grasp this nettle and, in consequence, some 60,000 families are suffering from marital breakdowns for which no adequate legal remedy can be found.</P>
      <P>The time has passed for politicians to ignore the problem and hope it will go away.  Two years ago Deputy Noel Browne proposed a Divorce Bill which other Deputies failed to support on a wide variety of grounds.  Some said they wanted an interparty committee of the Oireachtas to examine the problem.  Others said they would prefer to examine the issue within their own party, while another group said they would be bringing in their own, more comprehensive measure subsequently.</P>
      <P>The Bill then before the Dáil was consequently defeated and nothing has happened since.</P>
      <P>The issue is a simple one.  Either we need a referendum on this issue to determine the people's will or we do not.  I believe, and my party believe, that this is a matter of private conscience.  Surely the time has come for Deputies to face up to the issue and say where they stand.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to appeal to Deputies on all sides of the House to join with us in supporting this motion.</P>
      <P>As Workers' Party Deputies we were elected to this Dáil to represent our working class constituents, to improve the quality of their lives, defend their democratic rights and help them win their long-denied fair share of the national cake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hope that the Government, and other Dáil parties, take heed of our warning. <Col N="2977" /> As I have pointed out already, the huge unemployment problem currently confronting us is the most serious social crisis we have faced as a nation since the Famine.  If we do not meet the challenge then Irish democracy itself is threatened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-Central):</i> An Adjournment Debate provides the opportunity to reflect on the closing session.  During this session pressures on all Members were extremely intense but the session also provided the opportunity for the Government to show their mettle and expertise, both politically and otherwise, in dealing with the various problems with which they had to contend.  We all accept that there were many problems.</P>
      <P>Only last week we concluded the debate on the Finance Bill.  That Bill, more than anything else, indicated to all the inconsistency and double standards of the main Opposition party.  Many of the financial measures included in the Bill were identical to those in the ill-fated budget of January.  The same measures were proposed to bring about the necessary improvements in the economy but unfortunately, for obvious political reasons, Fine Gael opposed those same measures when it suited them to do so, probably in an effort to plunge the country into a third general election within 13 months.</P>
      <P>That irresponsible attitude was evident in many other aspects of Dáil business during the session.  For example, we had the display of political opportunism in the seeking of very large sums of money to aid ailing factories and industries.  It was on such an occasion, following a Private Members' motion, that the Opposition partners got carried away in their enthusiasm and put down a motion of no confidence in the Government.  We all know the outcome, which strengthened the hand of the Government and clearly exposed the weaknesses and hypocrisy which have been evident in every action of the Opposition since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2978" /> It has been stated recently that the electorate have become dangerously cynical in their attitude to politicians and political parties and that this cynicism could lead to a revolt by the public against politicians generally.  I do not accept that any considerable percentage of our people are thinking in such dramatic terms.  Much cynical comment has been made by the public on the blatant dishonesty of some politicians and the double standards maintained by Opposition parties in their about-turn on the needs of the economy, in the interests of their own selfish ambitions of regaining power at any price.  At the same time public images of honesty and sincerity have been badly tarnished by some of these happenings. It is agreed that we are at the crossroads regarding the recovery of the economy. It is vital that we are guided by a stable Government along that road.</P>
    <P>Parliamentary criticism is fully justified. It is necessary if our democratic system is to continue in good health. However, that criticism should be constructive. If it is made in an effort to improve whatever measures are proposed by the Government that is as it should be.  At a time when the economy is struggling, with our balance of payments situation, with rising unemployment and when we have the highest inflation rate in the EEC, it is necessary that we should not have the irresponsible, destructive type of politics the House has experienced in the recent past.  It does not matter where the dishonesty comes from.  The country and the democratic system will suffer greviously and at the end of the debate the Dáil will go into summer recess.  I sincerely hope we will not have any more personal vilifications against our Government and leader which we have had to listen to for quite some time.  Perhaps that is too much to hope for.  Such appeals were made in the past and went unheeded since that infamous speech by the Leader of Fine Gael in 1979.</P>
    <P>All Members will agree that it is high time consideration was given to the country's problems.  The choice of the people, which was confirmed last February, should be accepted in a proper parliamentary <Col N="2979" /> fashion.  It seems to be conveniently forgotten that this Government are in office for only four months.  The previous Government were in office for seven months and during that time nothing was done in a practical sense to relieve our balance of payments situation and ignite our economy despite the pious platitudes of the then Taoiseach and Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-Central):</i> It is very true and the Deputy knows it.  The opposite took place, and as a result of the gloom and doom which has already been mentioned and which will continue to be mentioned when one reflects on the activities of the former Government, we lost the confidence of many industrialists and financial institutions.  That is a fact, and I know it from personal experience.  We will never know how many jobs were lost because of that.  Many foreigners were frightened off, and that was understandable in view of the fact that the Government were so pessimistic about the future.  Many foreign companies decided not to extend credit and goods to existing companies and representatives.  There was a general feeling that our whole money system was about to collapse. That type of policy was disastrous and did nothing to assist our economy.  Many jobs were lost.  Employment was affected.  Unemployment rose and has continued to do so ever since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember hearing the former Tánaiste being interviewed on radio.  He was asked about the rise in unemployment figures.  He said &mdash; and the former Taoiseach repeated the same thing a few days later &mdash; that he could not see any improvement for the next four or five years.  He said the world was going through a serious recession and he forecast that unemployment could eventually reach a figure of 250,000.  That type of statement coming from a Taoiseach and Tánaiste indicated that that Government did not have the plans or political will to get people back to work.  They are the people who are criticising this Government <Col N="2980" /> and who recently put down a motion of no confidence at a time when the unemployment figure reached 150,000.  That is the kind of dishonest politics and cheap political opportunism which is depressing and upsetting to all.</P>
    <P>We are as concerned as anyone else about the rise in unemployment.  We are concerned at the number of jobs lost and the fact that there are little prospects for young people leaving school who are seeking employment for the first time. We have a number of companies which are suffering badly because of the depression and we must accept that there are many more jobs at risk.  It is difficult to understand the large number of people who are still prepared to go on strike.  Recently I was horrified to hear that a well known bakery in Dublin was forced to close with a loss of 250 jobs.  The union involved could not come to an agreement with the management on proposals to introduce night working.  Negotiations had gone on for a considerable time and, according to newspaper reports, the offers made by management were substantial.  Unfortunately agreement could not be reached and 250 jobs were lost in a bakery which was well established in the city for many years.  That type of situation is mad, especially at a time when unemployment is so high and jobs so difficult to obtain.</P>
    <P>The recession is still biting deeply.  It is more important than ever that in situations of industrial unrest commonsense should prevail.  I know industrial relations have improved during the past year, but until we reach a stage where firmness is exercised on both sides we will always have this problem.  There was a time when workers were blatantly and disgracefully discriminated against, but in many cases the wheel has turned to an extent where many employers and companies are in the position the worker was in during the time of Larkin.  We must be realistic and accept that if workers do not give a good day's work in return for their pay there is little possibility of industrial peace which is badly needed.</P>
    <P>We also have a situation where future industry will be affected.  Industrialists will shy away, and that is an area which can cause great difficulty as far as the <Col N="2981" /> promotion of new jobs and industries are concerned.  An area which causes anger to many workers is one where the unemployed have greater take home pay than they have.  Deputy Sherlock referred to this aspect.  It is understandable that any worker should feel very sore to meet his neighbour or unemployed friend&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider this issue to be very serious and which, as a public representative.  I consider in all conscience I must bring before the House.  I have never questioned the motivation of any politician.  I regard our profession as an honourable one.  I regard the Members of this House with great respect and I never intend to question their honour.  I admire Members of all <Col N="2985" /> parties who have made sacrifices to represent the people to the best of their ability.  I had to go to the Minister, as a last resort, to seek clarification of the allegations that were made in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Tuesday last.  I have given every opportunity to the Members on the other side of the House to reply through a press conference, in public, or in the House and they did not take that opportunity. This issue affects the entire command structure of the gardaí, the discipline of the gardaí, the authority of the courts and demeans the office of the Minister for Justice.  It makes a mockery of the self-righteous posturing of the Leader of the Opposition who has remained silent throughout.  The publicity machine which is operated on his behalf claiming he is leading the whiter than white brigade has suddenly collapsed because of this scandalous performance by him.  He has taken no action or made no statement to restore confidence.  He has not denied that these actions have taken place.</P>
      <P>The Official Report of Tuesday, 1 June 1982, column 631, Volume 335, states as follows:</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach:... I also know that when Deputy Mitchell was Minister for Justice he made no effort in this area. In fact, his personal activities in many cases were detrimental to law and order and to the activities of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>
        <i>(Interruptions.)</i>
      </P>
      <P>Dr. FitzGerald: First, that is an unworthy remark for which there is no basis, and, secondly, there is wide concern at the Minister for Justice's remarks which are widely interpreted as meaning that the Government do not propose to proceed in the near future with the necessary legislation...</P>
      <P>Further on at column 632:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. J. Mitchell:... The Taoiseach has sought to impugn my reputation. I ask him to withdraw any suggestion that anything which I did as Minister <Col N="2986" /> for Justice was anything less than good in the public interest ...</P>
    <P>There were further interruptions.</P>
    <P>Mr. J. Mitchell: The Taoiseach told an untruth ...</P>
    <P>Subsequently the Taoiseach, in order to behave in an honourable and decent fashion and to be fair to Deputy Mitchell, withdrew that remark.  Unfortunately, the generous spirit in which that withdrawal was made was not reciprocated by Deputy Mitchell.  I believe that Deputy Mitchell has led a propaganda smear campaign against many members of the Fianna Fáil Party with the ultimate goal of destroying Fianna Fáil in the public mind and in the media.  I do not suggest for one minute that we on this side of the House have not erred in the past or that we will not err in the future.  I do not pretend that we are angels of mercy.  We have a difficult job which we carry out to the best of our ability.  A man is entitled to one error.  If this case which I have referred to is the one and only time that Deputy Mitchell has interfered with the Garda, on his own admission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Andrews, earlier I reminded you that you had been given advice that you should confine your contribution to the subject matter of your Private Notice Question in which you sought details of the inquiry being carried out, and I ask you to avoid as far as possible any emotive terms that might not do any credit to the case you are making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the report in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 20 December 1981 dealing with the McCartin affair where we know interference has taken place, but I will come to that in a moment.  Can the Minister indicate the exact number of times his predecessor met gardaí to intervene to subvert the due process of the law on behalf of his constituents while he held the office of Minister for Justice?  That must be clarified to the satisfaction of all the Members of this House.  The honour of the Members of this House is at stake.  I have listened over the past year to rumours and counter-rumours about Members on this side of the House and Members on that side of the House.  I might have taken the line that I do not believe any of them. I have listened to falsehoods, untruths and scandalous rumours about Members on this side and I know where they are coming from and I have denied them, but there comes a threshold where that is very difficult when we find a Minister admitting freely that he has interfered with gardaí to prevent justice taking its course on behalf of a man who is a well-known criminal who, I understand from my inquiries, is lodged for three years in a jail.  I am not sure which jail, but I think it is Portlaoise or Mountjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the gardaí approached this man he escaped and in a conversation as <Col N="2988" /> reported in the newspapers between one of the Garda officers and Deputy Mitchell, Minister for Justice, Deputy Mitchell referred to the Garda as a posse.  It is important at this stage that I quote from the newspaper report.  &ldquo;I have a man here&rdquo; said Deputy Mitchell, &ldquo;who complains of trouble caused in his house this morning&rdquo;.  &ldquo;I was there, Minister&rdquo;, replied the man, &ldquo;but I did not cause trouble&rdquo;.  &ldquo;You were in charge of the posse&rdquo; said the Minister.  &ldquo;The man's wife was very distressed and the baby was pushed around&rdquo;.  &ldquo;I did not see any baby&rdquo;.  &ldquo;It is a pity &mdash;&rdquo; this is the Minister speaking &ldquo;&mdash; that there is not more co-operation with people who wish to cooperate with the police.  We would well end up with another Liverpool on our hands&rdquo;.  With such a Minister I have no doubt that we would.</P>
    <P>As I said, three bench warrants were issued for this man, and his brother, who attacked one of the arresting officers with a sword, was subsequently brought to court and convicted on a charge of assaulting the Garda with a sword.  Yet the Minister who was supposed to be upholding the laws passed by the Oireachtas goes to a sergeant, a relatively junior figure in the Garda Síochána, orders him to by-pass his superior, his inspector, superintendent, assistant commissioner, commissioner, officers in charge of the whole operation, and undermines the forces of law and order. At the same time, despite repeated requests from me during this week, the former Taoiseach remains silent.  Did the former Taoiseach know about this incident when he was Taoiseach and when Deputy Mitchell was Minister for Justice? Did he know before he appointed him spokesman or afterwards?  What action does Deputy FitzGerald intend to take?  Does he intend to allow Deputy Mitchell to continue in his very responsible position as front bench spokesman on Justice?  If he does, the people will bring the rap upon him.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister if this was the only incident to his knowledge in which Deputy Mitchell was involved with the Garda, or were there other incidents?  I believe there were.  The <i>Sunday Tribune</i><Col N="2989" /> and the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, December 1981, referred to Deputy Mitchell calling in senior gardaí and telling them to ease off on the McCartin brothers in Leitrim.</P>

I should like the Minister to let us know if that is true and also if the admission in the Official Report of 1 June 1982 but which has been denied is only the tip of the iceberg.  I am asking the Minister to give an undertaking that a sworn public inquiry will be held into the performance of the previous Minister for Justice, into the question of his subversion of the Garda, his subversion of the laws of this land, into his behaviour to the courts and his lack of respect for the decisions of the courts and for warrants issued by them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make it clear also that I believe genuinely the concern expressed properly by Deputy Andrews this evening.  I have had considerable communications personally in endeavouring to establish what my position should be in the handling of this affair. Having read the article in question in one of our national newspapers on Monday last I established by way of request that the member of the Garda involved did receive a phone call from the then Minister for Justice who required from the garda in question that a report be sent directly to the then Minister.  I have endeavoured to find any trace of that report in the Department but without success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I have established also that the persons involved in the Garda inquiry on the morning in question were the persons described in the newspaper report.  At the time of the Garda visit to the house in question there was a warrant for the committal of one of the residents. Subsequently that warrant was enforced, and later still the crimes that the Garda were investigating resulted in a court hearing at which the accused was sentenced to three years.  He is now serving that sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other situation related to a brother of the person the gardaí went to arrest on that morning.  Deputy Andrews has quoted from the newspaper in this regard.  I am satisfied now that that other person assaulted one of the gardaí, in the course of his duty, with an antique sword, that he resisted arrest, fled up a staircase, jumped out a rear window and escaped <Col N="2993" /> through the back garden of the home. Subsequently, he was arrested at the Garda station and charged with assault. Recently he pleaded guilty in the District Court in Dublin and was given the benefit of the Probation Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews asks whether there are any other instances of which I am aware in which the Minister became involved.  I can only reply to that by saying that I consider it incumbent on me &mdash; in the public interest and in order to assure the public that I consider the freedom of the Garda a very essential part of the <Col N="2994" /> protection of the public at a time when I have made every effort, as have my Government, in the past two months to bring about a situation where ordinary people of this city and of the country as a whole can walk safely and freely both during the day and at night &mdash; to investigate any other instance of the type in question that may be brought to my attention or that I for one reason or another may suspect has occurred.</P>

      <P>I recently made regulations to give effect to EEC Directive 79/112, commonly referred to as the Food Labelling Directive.  When implemented, the regulation will improve greatly the amount of information available to consumers about the food they buy.  The regulations apply mainly to prepackaged foodstuffs, and the information required includes the product name, place of origin (if its omission would mislead), the list of ingredients, name and address of manufacturer, packer or seller, quantity, date of minimum durability and, where necessary, instructions for use or storage.</P>
      <P>I will also make regulations soon in the field of price-marking of foodstuffs.

      <P>I think the sentence <Col N="2689" /> quoted by the Deputy, read in perspective, is self-explanatory and I would refer the Deputy to the rest of my statement on this matter.</P>
      <P>My overall view, essentially, is that we in Ireland have progressed fairly rapidly in recent years as far as consumer protection measures are concerned.  However, the actions we take must reflect the times we live in.  In considering new measures for adoption, I do not believe it is sufficient to look solely at the purpose of the measures in narrow consumer protection terms.  We must also look at their broad impact and how they contribute overall to the benefit of society, bearing in mind any possible wider effects, &mdash; for example, on employment, industry or trade. In other words we must strike a balance of where the people's greater interest lies.  As the recent statement to which the Deputy refers said, the search for an improved consumer regime must be carefully balanced, in a period of widespread and growing unemployment throughout Ireland and the rest of Europe, so as to responsibly reflect the problems faced by industry at the present time.  However, this is not to say that there should not be progress in consumer protection.  A number of current measures, covering such diverse subjects as food labelling, unit pricing, doorstep sales, product liability and consumer credit will, when implemented, represent a major advance for the consumer.</P>

Trade figures for the first five months of 1982 suggest a return to a favourable balance in our trade with Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the joint studies identified a large number of areas where Anglo-Irish co-operation might be fruitfully pursued.  The possibility of an Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council which was raised in the Joint Study on Institutional Structures has now become a reality and the council are functioning routinely.  Their first ministerial level meeting was on 29 January this year and since then a further five ministerial level meetings have been held.  At the inaugural ministerial meeting it was agreed that the joint studies should furnish the basis for a programme of co-operation between the two Governments. The Deputy will appreciate that the studies' recommendations cover a very wide range of subjects.  However, I might summarise the main progress to date as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the new Anglo-Irish institutions the main development has, of course, been the establishment of the council to which I have already referred. In addition the two Governments are discussing <Col N="2698" /> the establishment of the Anglo-Irish Encounter Organisation.  The Government will continue to pursue further development of the agreed Anglo-Irish institutions and attach particular importance to the early establishment of a parliamentary tier.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the whole area of voting rights in Ireland and Great Britain was one of the subjects examined in the Anglo-Irish Joint Studies. At their meeting in May 1980, the Taoiseach told Prime Minister Thatcher that, following examination of the constitutional, legal and other aspects of the matter, he was prepared to present proposals to effect an extension of the franchise here to permit British citizens to vote at elections to the Dáil.  The present position is that draft legislation to give effect to an extension of voting rights here is being examined as a matter of urgency.  It is the Government's intention to proceed with legislation in this field as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The joint study on economic co-operation identified areas where co-operation could be developed or intensified.  Several Government Departments are involved with their British or Northern Ireland counterparts in follow-up action, or in ongoing co-operation in the economic area.  As the Deputy will be aware, major progress has been made in relation to the proposed sale of Kinsale gas to Northern Ireland.  Further consultations have taken place at ministerial and official level, in relation to transport and communications issues, the disposal of toxic waste and the control of marine pollution.  Implementation of the various cross-Border studies continues in consultation with the Northern Ireland authorities.</P>
    <P>As regards the area of measures to encourage mutual understanding, many of the items outlined in the joint studies fall within the portfolio of the Minister for Education.  I understand that progress has been made in a number of areas including the following:</P>
    <P>&mdash;A course of training for Adult Education Organisers is being held in Magee College, Derry, 28 June-3 July, 1982.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2699" />&mdash;Two pilot courses in distance learning have been arranged by NIHE Dublin and RTE.  The first of these, on computers, was put together in co-operation with the National Extension College, Cambridge, and is scheduled to commence in September, 1982. The second, on Agriculture, will come on stream next year.  There are on-going discussions in progress with the Open University.</P>
    <P>&mdash;A scheme to encourage holders of higher education grants and scholarships to attend third-level institutions in the North has been formulated and will, it is hoped, be promulgated shortly.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The scheme to grant-aid exchanges in the youth and sport areas has been extended.  A sum of £30,000 is available in the present year for this purpose.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Contacts at inspectorial level have been stepped up and there have been fruitful exchanges in this area.</P>
    <P>&mdash;All third-level educational institutions and teachers' centres in the Republic have been written to and asked to encourage contacts and exchanges with their counterparts in the North.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The schools' contacts initiated in recent years under the auspices of UNESCO will be continued as resources permit.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am providing funds to two organisations engaged in the promotion of mutual understanding and reconciliation between North and South. The organisations concerned are Co-operation North and the Glencree Reconcialiation Centre.  It is intended that the grants provided will enable Glencree and Co-operation North to continue and intensify their valuable work in the field of reconciliation.</P>

      <P>At a meeting in Dublin on 8 December 1980, the Taoiseach and the British Minister commissioned joint studies in five areas.  These studies were prepared and completed by senior officials of the two Governments and were published on 11 November 1981.</P>
      <P>As regards institutions, at a meeting in London on 6 November 1981 the then Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister established an Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council.  Meetings within the framework of the AIIC continue to take place as and when necessary.</P>

The Committee will be concerned with economic, social and cultural co-operation and will be associated with the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council; (d) Paragraph 10 of the Joint Study on possible new Institutional structures dealt with further consideration of various aspects of the Council and stated <i>inter alia</i> that provision could be made for emergency meetings of the council to consider current problems of an urgent nature of concern to both Governments. It is clear from the details given above that the council are now functioning routinely. No emergency meetings have been held to date; (e) At my meeting with Mr. Prior on 31 March 1982 the establishment of a parliamentary their in the Anglo-Irish intergovernmental council was discussed.  The Deputy will be aware of the importance attached to the tier by the Government.  The matter has also been discussed since January in the course of normal official contacts.

      <P>On the question of trading links with South Africa, it is the policy of the Government, in keeping with their strong opposition to the apartheid system, not to promote trade or other commercial relations with that country.  I can confirm that State-sponsored bodies are aware of and adhere to this policy.</P>
      <P>As regards possible exports of butter to South Africa, I understand that no licences for the export of butter to that country have been issued since 1980 by the Department of Agriculture under the Milk and Milk Products (Restriction of Exports) Order 1964.  However, I also understand that some butter exported by at least one private Irish undertaking to member states of the European Communities has been re-exported to South Africa.  There is of course no legal barrier to such trade, nor would it be covered by the Government's policy on State-sponsored bodies which I have outlined.</P>

      <P>Among other matters arising from the admission of responsibility by the British authorities for the sinking of the &ldquo;Sharelga&rdquo; I have raised with them the question of what steps are now being taken to ensure that there is no repetition of this type of incident.  They have replied that in their view the circumstances surrounding the sinking were so unusual that they considered the incident to be unique and could see no reason for recurrence. The full background to the sinking had, however, been explained to all their submarine captains.  The Government's concern that there should be no repetition of an incident of this kind has been made clear to the British authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of a quota is prohibited by the Staff Regulations of the Community Institutions which lay down that no posts may be reserved for the nationals of any member state.  However, regard is had to the need to make appointments on the broadest possible geographical basis.  There are no regulations in existence limiting the appointment of Irish nationals.  I am satisfied that qualified applicants from all member states have an opportunity of competing for vacancies which arise.</P>
      <P>At administrative level, the number of Irish staff in the Community Institutions is satisfactory.  In the executive, secretarial and manual grades, our representation has been low in the past, partly due to the language requirements for appointments.  While in recent years the position has been improving, the situation remains unsatisfactory.  However, I am confident that the numbers will continue to increase.  Recruitment is of course primarily a matter for the institutions concerned.  Nevertheless the Government has an active policy of publicising vacancies and providing suitable Irish candidates with appropriate assistance. A recent example was the organisation by the Department of the Public Service and my Department of a preparatory seminar, attended by 220 Irish applicants, for a Commission competition.</P>
      <P>The Government are fully conscious of the need for a substantial Irish presence among the staff of the Institutions at all levels and will continue to work to this end.</P>

      <P>When an apprenticeship contract terminates on the completion of the statutory period of apprenticeship, there is no subsequent obligation on the part of the employer to retain the apprentice in employment or on the part of the apprentice to remain in the employment of the employer.  Neither is required to notify AnCO or the National Manpower Service of the situation.  Accordingly, there is no comprehensive information available as to the employment situation of people on completion of their apprenticeships. The National Manpower Service estimate that approximately 350 of the skilled persons on their register registered with them following completion of apprenticeships last year.  As there is no requirement on qualified craftsmen to register with the NMS, this figure cannot be taken to accurately reflect the number of craftsmen who became unemployed in 1981 on completion of their apprenticeships.  The NMS figure is also considered to include some who have subsequently secured employment but have not informed the NMS accordingly. The NMS are doing everything possible to help these craftsmen secure employment.</P>

      <P>The Manpower Consultative Committee have, since its establishment in 1978, been monitoring manpower shortages in highly qualified and skilled occupations.</P>
      <P>Specific initiatives have been introduced from time to time to alleviate the shortages identified such as in the NMS Survey of Industry. Conversion courses with provision for the payment of maintenance allowances to participants were initiated in 1979.  These courses are designed as a short-term measure aimed at graduates and national diploma holders to facilitate their conversion to skills, especially in the engineering field, in short supply in Irish industry.  Parallel with this scheme it was arranged with the universities and other third level institutions to expand existing courses and introduce new courses with a view to meeting the shortages in the medium and long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>AnCO, who have primary responsibility for designated apprenticeships, completed a major study in 1978 to ensure that sufficient skilled workers in the areas <Col N="2714" /> covered by statutory apprenticeships are recruited and trained to meet existing and projected needs of the economy. This study included the trades of fitter, motor mechanic, bricklayer, carpenter and other skilled woodworkers and is being continually updated in the light of the demands of the labour market.</P>
    <P>AnCO intervene in the apprentice labour market as necessary by directly sponsoring apprentices to counteract shortfalls in normal employer recruitment and to make provision for skilled workers for new industries attracted here by the IDA. AnCO has used its own training centres, training centres in industry and special apprentice schemes to train these additional apprentices.  In addition the AnCO/FUE apprentice to craftsman scheme was set up in 1980 to counteract shortages of skilled personnel in the engineering industry.  Eighty four apprentices were catered for in the first year. A further 99 were started in October 1981.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117, 118, 119 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>The Report of the Transport Consultactive Commission on Road Freight haulage was presented to my predecessor by the Commission on 22 July 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main general recommendation of the report is for completing the liberalisation of the licensing system on a phased basis so as to make general haulage <Col N="2718" /> licences freely available to all qualified applicants.  This recommendation is linked to improved enforcement of road transport and road traffic legislation and higher standards of quality controls.</P>
    <P>After presentation of the report to the Government and both Houses of the Oireachtas, the report was published on 30 July 1981 with an announcement that decisions on the specific recommendations in the report would be taken as soon as possible after all the interests concerned had an opportunity of studying and commenting on the report.  This announcement was followed by advertisements in the daily press and trade magazines inviting all interested bodies and organisations to submit their views on the report by 31 October 1981.</P>
    <P>Submissions on the report were received from: The Chartered Institute of Transport in Ireland; The Commercial Vehicle Rental Association Ltd; The Confederation of Irish Industry; Córas Iompair Éireann; The Independent Hauliers' Association; The Irish Finance Houses Association; The Irish Overseas Transport Association Ltd; The Irish Road Haulage Association; The National Transport Operators Association; Transport Brokerage Services Ltd; and some individual hauliers.</P>
    <P>It is assumed that all who intended to respond to the invitation to submit views on the report have done so.</P>
    <P>In response to specific requests from two of the associations of hauliers I received deputations from them on the subject of the report during the month of June.</P>
    <P>I am now in the process of finalising my conclusions on the recommendations in the report and the detailed views of the interests concerned.  I hope to have this completed very soon and to make my recommendations to Government.</P>
    <P>As regards the latter parts of Deputy Collin's question the position is as follows. The holder of a merchandise licence is entitled, subject to plating requirements, to operate in the course of his business vehicles which are not owned by him.  The owners of plated vehicles who are not the holders of merchandise licences are not, however, entitled under <Col N="2719" /> the legislation to engage on their own account in the business of transport of goods for reward.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in spite of precautionary measures which have to be observed at the Garda plating stations, there have been abuses of the system on the basis of what is known as the hiring or renting of licences and/or plates to vehicle owners who are not licensees.  Transport operations based on such arrangements constitute offences under the Transport Acts on the part of both the holder of the licence and the owners of plated vehicles. I am informed that the Garda, who are the enforcing authority, investigate all cases of alleged contraventions of the legislation coming to their attention and institute legal proceedings as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Transport Consultative Commission on the road freight haulage industry recommended improved enforcement of road transport and road traffic legislation and the abuses of the licensing system are also under consideration in that context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Concessions under the Irish-EEC Treaty of Accession to the EEC provided for Council Regulation (EEC) No. 543/69 on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport and Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1463/70 entering fully into force for national transport by 1 January 1976 and 1 January 1978 respectively.  In view, however, of the difficulties associated with implementation of the legislation for the road transport industry it was necessary for a number of approaches to be made to the EEC authorities for relief from the Regulations.  As a result a number of separate further concessions were granted which were aimed at assisting the industry through phasing-in of the EEC requirements and Regulation No. 543/69 and Regulation No. 1463/70 did not enter fully into force in Ireland until 1 January, 1981 and 1 December, 1981 respectively. This exhausted the possibilities for concessions under EEC rules and the Regulation fell to be implemented in full from those dates.</P>
      <P>Recently the EEC Commission have been reviewing the working of the Regulations in consultation with national administrations and the social partners. There is a possibility that this may lead to some changes which will introduce some measure of greater flexibility in their applications throughout the Community. The work of reviewing is at an early stage and it is not possible to say when it will be completed or what the outcome will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy's concern is about faults on telephones in the Merrion Square area.  Subscribers in the area had difficulty in making calls to Dún Laoghaire in the period 28 January to 27 February because of an underground cable fault but there have been no other major interruptions in service in the area this year.  Tests have shown that in general the quality of service in the area is reasonably good and that there are no serious problems with over-loading of lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been delay in repairing underground cable faults in the Dublin area particularly over the last few months because of the extensive flooding and snow damage and because faults in underground cables are time-consuming to repair.  Priority attention is given as far as possible to faults on doctors' lines but, where a major cable break affecting a large number of subscribers occurs, the extent to which doctors and other priority categories can be given preference in the restoration of service is limited.  A special programme of preventive maintenance is in hands for the entire 01 area and this <Col N="2725" /> will improve the service gradually for all subscribers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 to 142, inclusive, together.  I assume the Deputy means Finglas East post office when he refers to the raid on 3 June, as Finglas post office was not raided on that day.  The six cases mentioned by the Deputy are the subject of continuing Garda investigations and two are already the subject of prosecutions in the courts.  In the circumstances it would not be in the public interest to make any statements about them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether, in reply to written representations to his Department in recent weeks, he now proposes to continue to issue the standard general reply which has been issuing in very recent times and which bears no reference whatever to the specific inquiry being made by a Member of this House; and whether he will consider reverting to the former practice of giving as much information as possible about each individual query in order to provide the maximum information.</P>

      <P>The number of inquiries and representations being received about the provision of telephone service is such that it would not be possible at present within the Estimate provision for the current year to allocate all the staff needed to get the detailed information necessary to enable each representation to be answered individually in the short term except by diverting more staff to that work from making telephone connections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The telephone applications that will be met over the rest of this year are being programmed as closely as possible at present and when this has been done, it is expected that it will be possible to give more precise information in replying to representations received.  Similar <Col N="2727" /> arrangements will be made for next year when the current year's programme has been completed.</P>

      <P>The areas referred to by the Deputy are served by the Mount Leinster transmitter.  RTE completed the modification and rebuilding of transmit aerials at the Mount Leinster transmitter in 1981.  Considerable improvement in reception has been recorded over much of the Cahir, Cashel, Newcastle and Nire Valley areas.  Despite the improvements achieved, some areas will remain inadequately served.  It will only be after further surveys have been completed and analysed later this year that those remaining areas will be properly identified and appropriate reception improvement possibilities considered.  This work will be limited by the availability of resources and capital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy's question has been prompted by press reports suggesting that it has been decided to close a number of automanual exchanges.  No such plan has been <Col N="2739" /> adopted by my Department nor is any such proposal under consideration.  Planning and development of the telephone network continues, as heretofore, to be based on having 16 automanual centres.</P>
      <P>It has long been recognised however that with increased automation and improvement of the telephone network, there would be a substantial reduction in exchange operator staff.  Agreement has been reached with the staff organisations concerned on the arrangements which should govern the closure of exchanges staffed by the Department other than the 16 automanual centres.  Broadly speaking, day staff will have the option of transferring to another exchange or resigning on agreed terms.  Night staff at the exchanges to be closed are employed part-time, and were recruited specifically for service locally.  They will become redundant on agreed terms.</P>
      <P>There will be a phased run-down of staff in the automanual exchanges later. Recruitment has been ceased and consideration is now being given to the other measures which will be required in due course so that staffing levels are kept in line with traffic needs.</P>

      <P>It had been planned to convert the exchanges at Ballintra, Donegal, Inver, Laghey and Mountcharles this year.  The conversions were, however, dependent on the bringing into service by mid-1982 of the Sligo/Donegal/ Letter-Kenny Radio Link to provide the necessary trunk outlets to carry traffic to other parts of the country.  Unfortunately this did not prove possible and the conversion of the five exchanges has had to be deferred until 1983.</P>
      <P>In addition to the five exchanges already mentioned, Bunbeg, Dungloe, Glenties and Gweedore will also be converted to automatic working in 1983.</P>

      <P>A number of factors have contributed to the delay in bringing the new digital exchange in Naas into service.  There were problems in the development of some ancillary equipment and these took longer to resolve than had been envisaged. There was also delay on the part of the contractor concerned in providing and installing trunk route equipment without which an acceptable standard of service could not be granted; this was compounded by industrial action taken by the contractor's staff.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 279 and 280 together.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the increasing incidence of alcohol and drug abuse among young people and I am taking immediate steps to alert and educate parents and young people to the dangers inherent for them in the whole area of substance abuse.  I recently allocated an additional £¼ million to the Health Education Bureau to undertake an urgent national programme on substance abuse.</P>
      <P>The bureau's programme will involve the training of teachers, doctors, pharmacists, career guidance counsellors, health board personnel, gardaí and clergy as drug educators.  These will be available to act extensively throughout the community and particularly in schools.  This aspect of the programme is aimed primarily at parents to inform them as to the nature and extent of the problem, equip them to guide their children away from becoming involved with drugs and train them to react appropriately, organising treatment and support if their child has a drug problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young people themselves must also be alerted, advised and educated outside the home as to the dangers of drug abuse. The school is the obvious place through which to impart information.  To this end, the Health Education Bureau, with the full support and co-operation of the Department of Education, is arranging for the preparation of educational materials on all forms of substance abuse for second level school children.  This is being piloted in selected schools at present and <Col N="2770" /> will be extended to all schools from September 1982.</P>
    <P>Education in relation to abuse of alcohol will of course be a component of this comprehensive programme for schools. In addition, however, there is also a special alcohol education programme for second level schools in the process of being designed at present by the bureau. The aim of the programme is to develop a responsible attitude in young people to the use of alcohol.  It is expected to be in operation early next year.</P>

The remainder of the posts referred to by the Deputy are among a number of consultant posts approved by Comhairle na nOspidéal, the filling of which has to be considered in the light of the funds available.  The question of allocating funds to enable these posts to be filled will depend on the availability of financial resources for the creation of new posts in the health services.</P>

      <P>The previous Government allocated £4 million &mdash; not £5 million as the Deputy says &mdash; to provide for opening a selected number of new health facilities in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, however, the funds which were originally provided to finance on-going services were seriously deficient &mdash; to the extent of £48 million and, if I had not succeeded in obtaining <Col N="2773" /> extra funds in the March budget, severe curtailment of health services and large-scale disemployment would have been unavoidable.</P>
    <P>Despite the increases in their allocations resulting from the extra funds provided by the Government it is necessary for health agencies to achieve significant savings to avoid exceeding budgetary limits.</P>
    <P>I am at present reviewing the overall position as regards the financial needs of the health services and the restricted funds available and it is in that context that I have not as yet made any decision as to the allocation of the sum of £4 million to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>Children, including mentally handicapped children, are covered by medical cards when their parents or guardians have established their entitlement to such cover.  The criterion of eligibility is inability without undue hardship to arrange <Col N="2781" /> general practitioner medical and surgical services for the applicants and their dependants.  A person who does not meet this criterion may still be eligible to receive a particular service without charge if he is unable to provide that service, without undue hardship, for himself or his dependants.  There are no specific guidelines relating to mentally handicapped children but any expense arising from the care of such children may be taken into account in assessing applications for medical cards.</P>
      <P>Whether or not they are covered by medical cards, all mentally handicapped children are entitled, without charge, to hospital in-patient and out-patient services in respect of their handicap.  This includes the services provided in special residential centres, day care centres, workshops, training centres and hostels.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 316 to 318, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The problem of curbing glue-sniffing is not an easy one.  Our experience has been that it is essentially a reflection of the deeply-rooted forms of social deprivation to which some of our children, notably the children of travellers, are subjected. Various measures are necessary and various steps are being taken.  The following are the main initiatives which are under way.</P>
      <P>The Health Education Bureau were recently allocated an additional £250,000 for an urgent national education programme on substance abuse, including glue-sniffing.  The key elements of the programme include the counselling of parents, children and community groups, and of those who are in a position to influence parents and young people. Also, I propose to include a provision in the new Children's Bill to prohibit the sale of glue and other such substances which are subject to abuse to persons under 18 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as itinerant children are concerned <Col N="2783" /> glue-sniffing is, unfortunately, only one of the many serious problems which affect them.</P>
    <P>The Travelling People Review Body which was set up in January 1981 by the Ministers for Health and the Environment to examine all aspects of the traveller situation, including accommodation, education, training, employment, health and welfare will report within a few weeks.  I shall in the context of that report be examining what effective action I can take in regard to the various problems of travellers and their children in so far as they concern me as Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>Residential care is provided for up to 24 travelling boys in Trudder House, which was established by the Dublin Committee for Travelling People, with the support of the Eastern Health Board. I have at the moment proposals before me from the Eastern Health Board to set up a similar unit for travelling girls.  Other residential homes take in travelling children when requested to.</P>
    <P>I may add, for the Deputies' information, that officials of my Department have recently held discussions with representatives <Col N="2784" /> of the Eastern Health Board, Dublin Corporation and workers in the field dealing with the children involved to establish what additional measures are required to combat this social problem.  These discussions are continuing.</P>

None of these civil servants and/or ex-civil servants is paid fees.  They are entitled to travelling and subsistence expenses at approved rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal issued a report on the future organisation of cardiothoracic surgery in this country in December 1981.</P>
      <P>I have now completed my consideration of the recommendations of the report and I am in agreement with them. The report incidentally did not envisage cardiac surgery being developed in the Royal City of Dublin Hospital.  The precise terms of the report in this respect were as follows:</P>
      <P>The development of resources for cardiac surgery on adults should be confined for the foreseeable future to 2 centres in this country, namely the unit at the Mater Hospital and a unit to be developed at Cork Regional Hospital. Cardiac surgery on children should be confined to one centre, namely Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I intend that the recommendations should be implemented as quickly <Col N="2787" /> as possible, because of the very considerable financial implications involved in the provision of this service it has been necessary to determine priorities for development.  I am now investigating how the necessary additional revenue and capital funds can be provided for this purpose in the present difficult economic situation.</P>

      <P>The proposal to improve and extend the facilities at Portiuncula Hospital is a costly one for which no provision was made in the capital programme for the current year by the previous Government.

    <P>My difficulty in regard to this problem <Col N="2788" /> has essentially arisen from the failure of the previous Government to make any provision for this facility in the capital programme for the current year.

      <P>In 1981 the average number of prescription items dispensed per person in the general medical service was 11.0.  Private medical practice is not subject to control by the public authorities.  There is not, therefore, an administrative basis on which to determine prescription rates.  Such information would be of interest, but direct comparisions between prescription rates in the private and public sectors are not necessarily valid.  For payment purposes prescriptions are written at present for products for medical card holders which, in the private sector, do not require a doctor's prescription.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 29 March 1981, but she was not entitled to payment as she had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited in the 1979-80 contribution year governing payment in the benefit year 1981.  Likewise she is not qualified for payment in 1982 as she had less than the minimum of 26 contributions in the 1980-81 contribution year.

The qualifying age for pension generally is a matter which arises for consideration in the formulation of proposals, now being undertaken in my Department, for a national income-related pension scheme.

      <P>A new computer system recently introduced in the Department makes it possible to install visual display terminals for inquiry purposes in offices outside the Department's headquarters and in fact such terminals are already in the Department's Dublin public offices in Pearse Street and at Gandon House and in the employment exchange at Cork.

      <P>It is planned, as resources allow, to gradually expand these facilities to enable a comprehensive disability benefit service, including payment of benefit, to be developed at local offices.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position generally in relation to disability benefit is that payments are being issued promptly where the claim is made correctly and the claimant is qualified on his or her insurance record.</P>
      <P>It is relevant to point out that at present about 70,000 persons receive disability benefit from my Department each week. The majority of these are established claimants and payment issues promptly on receipt of medical evidence of incapacity.</P>
      <P>In the case of an initial claim, of which some 5,500 are received each week, no payment is due on the first certificate which is merely a notification of the date of commencement of illness.  Payment only becomes due on receipt of the second and subsequent certificates.  The principal cause of delay in payment in these cases is where a claimant is not qualified for payment of benefit on his or her insurance record and it is necessary to make inquiries about the record in order to establish entitlement.  The duration of the delay in such cases will depend on the amount of time taken to complete the inquiries.  Delays in payment also frequently occur where medical certificates are not submitted promptly or where incorrect RSI numbers are quoted or where wrong addresses are given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concious of the need for the speedy processing of claims, not alone for disability benefit, but for all social welfare benefits.  In this respect I am particularly interested in the possibility of achieving greater efficiency by regionalising to a greater extent the services of the Department.  To enable this to be done, computer and telecommunications facilities are being developed and expanded in the Department so that visual display unit terminals can be located in offices outside the Department's headquarters in Dublin.  Some have already been installed at local offices on an experimental basis.  The extension of this programme will, in the first instance, enable inquiries on matters such as entitlement to benefit to be dealt with on the spot.  Furthermore, in the case of delay in payment information can be given to the claimant as to the cause of the delay <Col N="2797" /> so that any necessary remedial action can be initiated immediately.  The Department are pursuing the development of these facilities with all possible speed.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of their agreement with my Department medical certifiers are obliged to examine all insured persons who apply to them for a medical certificate of incapacity for work for the purpose of claiming disability benefit. Where a certifier is found guilty of a breach of the agreement, including any irregularity in the issue of medical certificates, there is provision for the imposition of a monetary penalty which may be recovered by witholding such sum as is considered fit from any remuneration due by my Department to the certifier or as a simple contract debt.  There is also provision to terminate the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the medical profession generally live up to their responsibilities in this matter and that certifiers do not negligently or fraudulently issue certificates of incapacity for disability benefit purposes in respect of insured persons whom they know are not sick.  If the Deputy is aware of any case in which he considers that a medical certifier appears to be issuing medical certificates irregularily I will arrange to have the matter investigated as a matter of urgency if he will supply me with details on a confidential basis.  In the years 1980 and 1981 following investigation a total of 12 certifiers were regarded as guilty of irregularities in the issue of medical certificates. In eight of these cases monetary penalties were imposed and warning letters <Col N="2798" /> were issued in the remaining four cases.</P>
    <P>The irregular issue of medical certificates normally comes to light in the course of general administration and control of claims.</P>

The claim form submitted by her was only partially completed and a fresh form was issued to her with a request that it be fully completed with particular reference to that part of the form which related to her possible entitlement to benefit under the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act which provides for payment at a higher rate than under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the form was returned, it transpired that she was not qualified for payment under the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act as she intimated that she had finished work with her employer prior to her confinement and did not intend to resume the same employment afterwards.  Her insurance record for the 1979-1980 and 1980-1981 contribution years was then examined to ascertain whether she was qualified under the Social Welfare Acts.  As the information which she supplied upon request indicated that she had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions in either of these years, it was necessary to approach her again for her old insurance number. She could not quote this number but a search in the Department's alphabatical index located it.  In this way, it was eventually established that she was entitled to maternity benefit on the basis of the contributions <Col N="2801" /> to her credit in the 1978-1979 contribution year.</P>
    <P>A cheque for £303.60 paying all maternity benefit due on her claim issued on 29 June 1982.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the percentage of the insured labour force claiming disability benefit at the latest date for which figures are available; the equivalent percentage ten years ago; and the extent to which any increase in the percentage is due to <Col N="2802" /> (a) an increased rate of claims or (b) a change in the rules for eligibility for benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The percentage of the insured labour force receiving disability benefit at 18 May 1982 was approximately 8.3 per cent.  The equivalent figure for 1972 was approximately 7.4 per cent.</P>
      <P>Factors giving rise to the increase in the rate of benefit claims, but which are not quantifiable, are the removal from October 1973 of the requalifying condition which required women on marriage to obtain at least 26 paid contributions after marriage in order to qualify for benefit, the removal from April 1974 of the salary limit for non-manual workers and the introduction of pay-related benefit from April 1974 which greatly enhanced the value of benefits payable in respect of short-term illnesses.</P>
      <P>It is relevant to point out that at present many employers pay full wages or salary to their employees during periods of illness on condition that the employees claim disability benefit in respect of such periods and hand over the benefit received from my Department.  It is considered that the enhanced value of the benefit payments in recent years as compared with the rates of benefit payable ten years ago has resulted in an increase in the incidence of claims in such cases.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 358 and 359 together.  The duties of medical referees employed by my Department consist mainly of providing independent medical opinions on persons claiming disability benefit.  They also assess the degree of disablement in occupational injury benefit claims.</P>
      <P>The disability benefit cases referred for examination by medical referees are selected on a systematic basis having regard to the nature and duration of incapacity, age of claimant, recent history of claiming and other relevant factors. This method of selection was devised as a result of consultation with the Medical Adviser of my Department and is kept constantly under review.  A relatively small number of claimants are referred for examination on the basis of confidential information furnished by medical certifiers or by employers.  Sickness visitors who visit claimants in their homes also recommend for examination cases in which it appears to them that the claimants are fit and active or are not complying with the rules of behaviour for persons claiming or in receipt of disability benefit.  In view of the nature and scope of the existing method of the selection of suitable cases for medical referee examination it is doubtful if any useful purpose would be served by a system of spot checks on medical certificates submitted in support of claims for disability benefit.  The number of medical referees at present serving is one Medical Adviser, one Deputy Medical Adviser and 15 Medical Referees.</P>
      <P>I consider that the present medical referee strength is not adequate and I have recently made arrangements to increase the number of medical referees by four in an effort to ensure that a second medical opinion will be obtained as early as possible on all cases considered suitable for medical referee examination.</P>
      <P>The average number of claims for disability benefit received each week in my Department so far during 1982 was 5,550.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that allegations of this nature are made from time to time. Under the terms of their agreement with my Department medical certifiers are obliged to examine insured persons who are ill and who apply for a medical certificate. A full medical examination may not be necessary on each occasion on which an insured person visits his doctor. It is a matter for the medical certifier, having regard to his knowledge of the history of the case to decide when a further examination is necessary before the issue of a certificate.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, very concerned at the possibility of irregular practices developing and if the Deputy is aware of any case in which he considers that a medical certifier appears to be acting irregularly in relation to the issue of medical certificates, I will arrange to have the matter investigated as a matter of urgency if he will supply me with details on a confidential basis.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to a report (details supplied) to the effect that a person can organise himself to get a medical certificate when a strike is imminent in order to be in a position to draw disability benefit for the duration of the strike; if there is any foundation to this report; and, if so, the action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the nature of the scheme the control of disability benefit expenditure is essentially a medical matter. A person claiming disability benefit is required to furnish medical evidence of incapacity for work from a medical practitioner <Col N="2805" /> before payment is allowed.  If such evidence is submitted the only way to challenge the certification is to have a second medical opinion on the claimant. It is for this purpose that my Department have a team of Medical Referees to carry out such examinations.</P>
      <P>As part of the overall control of disability benefit claims the number of medical referees employed by my Department will shortly be increased by four, bringing the total number to 19.  This will have the effect of ensuring that a second medical opinion will be obtained as early as possible in all cases where this is considered desirable.</P>
      <P>In relation to strike situations, it is the practice of my Department to monitor claims from persons employed in firms where such a situation exists and to refer all such claims for early medical referee examination.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to a report (details supplied) to the effect that it is possible for an employee to obtain a certificate of illness while at work and draw wages and social welfare benefits at the same time because of the inadequacies of the P.60 recording system in regard to the number of weeks actually worked; if this report is correct; and the action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The P.60 is the certificate of pay, tax, PRSI contributions, number of weeks of insurable employment, etc. which an employer is required to give to each employee at the end of the tax year. Similar data is furnished by the employer to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in respect of each employee and the relevant portion of such data is subsequently transmitted to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the PRSI system a contribution is payable, subject to the earnings limit, on all wages paid, including wages paid in respect of periods of incapacity for work even though the person may have been in receipt of disability benefit.  In recording weeks of insurable employment <Col N="2806" /> on the P.60 all periods, including periods of incapacity for which wages are paid under an occupational sick pay scheme or otherwise, are regarded as weeks of insurable employment.  In this way a person can be in receipt of wages and disability benefit at the same time but this does not involve any irregularity or abuse of the disability benefit system. The establishing of an entitlement to disability benefit rests primarily on the medical certification provided by doctors.  I have no reason to doubt that medical certifiers as a whole act in the best traditions of their profession.</P>
    <P>In those cases where the system is abused fraudulent claiming comes to light in a number of ways.  Procedures are in operation for test visits to claimants by sickness visitors and local inspectors and agents.  Where there are doubts as to whether an illness is genuine the claimant is referred to a medical referee for a second opinion.  Also information is obtained as a result of inquiries made locally by social welfare and other officers of the Department. All cases of irregularity are investigated and legal proceedings are taken where the evidence is sufficient to justify a prosecution.  Control procedures are regularly reviewed and every effort is made to improve them.</P>

However, it can be said that the equipment is of the normal operating standard and the effectiveness of the arrangements &mdash; excluding an actual broadcast of warnings over the air and the dissimination of warnings to the public other than in selected areas &mdash; has been tested annually in recent years as part of the Civil Defence national fallout exercises.

      <P>A fire occurred in the engine room of LE <i>Aisling</i> on 19 November 1981 while the ship was in a position 37 miles south of Tuskar Rock.  The fire was caused by a leak of lubricating oil onto a hot exhaust manifold and was promptly extinguished by the ship's carbon dioxide fire fighting system.  No structural damage occurred but there was damage to electrical fittings, wiring and paint surfaces in the immediate area of the fire.  Repair of the damage was carried out by Naval Service personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ship returned to service on 17 January 1982.  Arising from this incident detailed examinations have been carried out on LE <i>Aisling</i> and the other Naval Service patrol vessels to eliminate as far <Col N="2812" /> as possible the risk of a similar situation arising again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the ESB that the board disagree with the conclusions referred to in the National Utility Service survey.</P>
      <P>According to the board a simple comparison of price statistics does not show the full picture.  Factors which must be taken into consideration in making any comparison are&mdash; 1 The cheaper primary energy sources available in most of the countries reviewed.  2  The benefits of scale accruing to heavily industrialised countries through use of shift rota.  3 Benefits from interconnection with other electricity utilities.  4  Government subsidies.</P>
      <P>A comparison undertaken on 1 September 1981 by the British Electricity Council showed that ESB prices were among the lowest in Europe to domestic consumers, were reasonably priced for light industrial users and were high for 20 to 30 energy intensive users.  The National Utility Service refers only to this latter type of user.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, while the survey comments specifically that the price of electricity in Ireland is higher than the average inflation rate, it does not highlight the fact that eight other countries also have prices for electricity at rates higher than inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, the Government decided to reduce the night rate for electricity by 0.5p per unit.  This measure should be of considerable benefit to industry.  Also the recent relatively low increase of 5 per cent in the ESB rates of charge will help to improve further the overall comparison between ESB rates and those in other <Col N="2813" /> countries.  In the longer term one of my major policy objectives is to see that any necessary increases in ESB charges will be kept to single percentage figures.  I believe that I have the full support of the ESB board and senior executives in this. The commissioning of the major coal fired station now under construction at Moneypoint, County Clare, will also help to contain prices below the rate of inflation as will the continued use of natural gas by the board.</P>
    <P>I have decided that an inquiry should be undertaken into the reasons for the present level of electricity prices.  Proposals for this inquiry are being drafted in my Department at present.</P>

      <P>As far as the public sector are concerned decision makers' attention is regularly drawn by me to the need to give full consideration to Irish materials, products and services in the planning of structures and the placing of contracts. In the private sector the exhortations and services of the Irish Goods Council are directed towards the same end.  In addition, An Foras Forbartha prepared and published last year the Irish Building Product Register and an updated version of this most informative volume will be available this September.</P>
      <P>Producers of Irish building materials and products stand to benefit from the work of the IDA in identifying new outlets and matching existing domestic production facilities to the requirements of major users.  Furthermore, they should benefit from the results of my request to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to establish Irish Standards for materials used in the building industry. In addition, I have written to the Minister for the Environment suggesting that only materials conforming to Irish Standards should be used in public sector building operations, and that Irish Standard specifications be incorporated in that Department's building regulations.</P>
      <P>I think it advisable to point out in this connection that as a member state of EEC we do not discriminate against the products and services of other member states or restrict entry of their products in any way.  Our aim is to ensure that our manufacturing and service industries, which frequently are not as firmly established as many of their competitors, are not ignored or overlooked when decisions are being taken.</P>

I have had discussions with the company with a view to assisting in their exploration of a number of options and I have made a number of inquiries, on an international level, with a view to discerning whether there is any interest among those contacted in becoming involved in operations at the terminal.

      <P>I am aware of the seriousness of the latest unemployment figures.  The Government are considering a wide range of measures to maintain existing employment and to create new employment opportunities in the context of their work on establishing the national economic plan.</P>
      <P>In regard to the manufacturing industry and the international services sectors for which I have responsibility, the intensity of the international recession is reflected in reduced capacity on the part of established industry to maintain and increase employment and in the increased difficulty of attracting new internationally-mobile industrial and service projects.  The Industrial Development Authority have intensified their efforts to deal with this situation.</P>
      <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Industrial Development Authority, are currently preparing a strategic plan for the development of industry.  In addition, I intend to publish a White Paper on industrial development by the end of the year.  The White Paper will take account of the NESC review of industrial policy and will put forward detailed plans for industrial development up to 1990.</P>

      <P>Street trading in cut flowers in Dublin operates at present under the provisions of the Street Trading Act, 1926.  My chief function in relation to that act was to approve or otherwise by-laws made by the local authority under the Act.  However, the Casual Trading Act, 1980, for which the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism is the responsible Minister, provides for the repeal of the Street Trading Act, 1926, by 26 March 1983.  Under the Casual Trading Act it is entirely a matter for Dublin Corporation to decide, by resolution, the manner and location of street trading in the city.</P>

      <P>It is primarily a matter for each local authority concerned to ensure that their services are adequately equipped and trained to perform their roles under the plan drawn up by an Inter-Departmental Committee for dealing with incidents arising from the transport by rail of acrylonitrile from Dublin Port to Asahi, County Mayo.  My Department has approved of borrowing proposals for purchase of equipment required for such emergencies by a number of local authorities on this rail route.  Fire service personnel have attended relevant training courses organised by my Department. My Department has also issued guidance to local authorities, including guidance on the fire service response to such incidents, pollution control aspects, the characteristics of the chemicals being transported and the general precautions to be taken in dealing with an incident.</P>

Such agreements may be entered into only by the EEC Commission acting on behalf of and at the direction of the Community as a whole.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that for some <Col N="2837" /> time past the Community fish markets have been depressed and I consider that this problem can only be resolved in the EEC context.</P>
      <P>The EEC Council of Fisheries Ministers has agreed on a total overhaul of the Community's market organisation for fishery products and the regulation giving effect to this revision came into effect on 1 June 1982.  The regulation strengthens the role of producers organisations and affords them additional flexibility in their operations, improves the prices structure with higher compensation payments from Brussels for fish withdrawals and provides for tighter controls on low cost imports from third countries which have disrupted the Community markets in recent years.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that the new EEC markets regime together with recent indications of improved buoyancy in fish prices and increased landings will mark the start of an economic upturn in the industry.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 a licence permitting gaming at an amusement hall or funfair (a gaming licence) is granted by the Revenue Commissioners on foot of a certificate granted by the courts.  In addition under the provisions of the Finance Act, 1975, the holder of a gaming licence must have a gaming machine licence in respect of all gaming machines to be operated on the premises, which licence is also granted by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <P>The Deputy is, no doubt, aware that the Government decided, in 1979, on a number of measures aimed at improving the living conditions of the inhabitants of non-Gaeltacht islands off the west coast. The rationale behind these special measures was, in part at least, a recognition of the problems posed for the islanders by the cost of transport to the islands.  In particular the decision resulted in the provision of higher new house grants and <Col N="2848" /> loans and of higher house improvement grants.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the statement which I issued on 8 July.  The main problem at inspection centres arose from delays caused by the presentation by farmers of large numbers of over-age calves.  The magnitude of this problem may be gauged from the fact that in the three weeks ended 9 July the Department's field staff dealt with almost 165,000 calves at some 260 centres throughout the country and that over 41,000 or 25 per cent of these had to be rejected as over-age.  Following my statement <Col N="2855" /> of 8 July it is hoped that any impression that calves born before 20 May are eligible for the premium has been removed and that as a result pressure at the inspection centres will be eased.</P>

      <P>The person concerned originally claimed deserted wife's allowance on 28 July 1976 but her claim was refused on the grounds that she was under 40 years of age and had no qualified child.  She re-applied on 10 April 1978 and, as she then had a qualified child, the allowance was awarded at the maximum appropriate rate from 13 April 1978, the Thursday following the date of application.  Payment of the allowance continued up to 7 September 1978 when she resumed employment.  As her means derived from earnings from this employment exceeded the statutory limit the allowance was terminated from that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 4 June 1982 the claimant notified the Department that she wished to claim deserted wife's benefit.  The question of <Col N="2874" /> her entitlement to the benefit had, however, already been investigated in 1978 and it was decided that she was not entitled to payment on either her own or her husband's insurance prior to the date of desertion.  She was notified to this effect at the time.  An inspector will call on her at an early date to investigate her means with a view to restoring payment of deserted wife's allowance if her circumstances so warrant.</P>
