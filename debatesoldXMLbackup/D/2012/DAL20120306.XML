        <Quest>    his views on the findings of the Creative Capital report on industrial relations in the audiovisual industry here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.    </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the development of the audiovisual industry, including industrial relations issues, was examined during the preparation of the Creative Capital report, Building Ireland&rsquo;s Audiovisual Creative Economy, which was published in July 2011.  An implementation committee is examining the advancement of its recommendations.  It is chaired by my Department and includes representatives from the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Education and Skills, Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The Irish Film Board, Screen Producers Ireland and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland are also represented on it.  I am expecting an internal report from it after Easter.</P><Col N="2"/>
        <P>The Creative Capital report focuses on issues such as talent development, convergence, sectoral growth, education and the digital opportunities for Ireland, as well as reporting on industry leadership, State agency roles and innovation.  It will provide a road map for the next few years and assist in enabling the domestic audiovisual content production sector to develop into an internationally traded sector for product and services over the five year period 2011 to 2015.</P>
        <P>In the area of industrial relations I understand negotiations are ongoing between the relevant parties under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this juncture.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  As he will be aware, I tabled a written parliamentary question on this a number of weeks ago and I was a little disappointed with his reply.</P>
        <P>The Creative Capital report from the Department identifies the potential of the Irish film industry to grow at a rate of in excess of 30% in the next five years.  It is a very important sector which both of us agree has considerable potential for job creation, but the ongoing limbo the talks between the craft unions and the producers are in is sending out a negative image internationally.  Disney has stated publicly it is not prepared to return to Ireland until these practices have been resolved.</P>
        <P>The talks between the craft unions and the producers have been ongoing for more than a year, with the unions not making a single concession.  The industry is in limbo because there has been an absence of an agreement for five to six years.</P>
        <P>One of the most damaging aspects to the Irish film industry abroad is the 50:50 nomination system operated by the craft unions.  It gives unions the right to choose 50% of a production crew.  To the best of my knowledge, no other industry operates to such criteria.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister press Screen Producers Ireland to omit the inclusion of the practice of 50:50 nomination from any new agreement?  Given the paralysis in the industry, will he ensure that a new agreement will be finalised by both sides as soon as possible to provide clarity to the international market that Ireland is competitive?  In light of the fact that it is ongoing for so long, the Minister might consider intervening personally by seeking to meet the producers and craft unions separately and then trying to mediate between them to bring about a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
        <P>It is an important industry where there is potential to grow jobs, but at present there is stalemate which is sending out a negative message to the international community.  Disney, a renowned film production company, has vowed not to return to Ireland as long as this practice is in place.  The Minister might clarify some of those points for me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Troy that we must be competitive in the film industry to attract film and television drama productions to Ireland.  If one compares our costs with those of the UK, for example, we certainly are not competitive.  We must look at it from a view of all inputs into the film industry.  We must be competitive or else producers will not come to this country.  We have had recent experience where, as Deputy Troy stated, they have decided to go elsewhere.</P>
        <P>I understand discussions currently are at a sensitive stage with the Labour Relations Commission, the unions representing the various elements of the film industry and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  While I do not want to get into those negotiations or comment on them, I would say that if we are to achieve the target of 10,000 working in the industry following the completion of the Creative Capital report, certainly we must be very <Col N="3"/>competitive.  That is why these negotiations are very important and it is very important that they would be concluded as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>It would not be appropriate that I or any other Minister would become involved with the Labour Relations Commission.  It is not something that would be welcome at this stage.  The unions and Screen Producers Ireland are very much involved in talks currently and seem to be making progress.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
	<P>This is about jobs, and jobs are being put at risk.  The Minister&rsquo;s hands-off approach is not appropriate in this instance.  I appeal to him to mediate because it is important in that it involves jobs.  The Minister&rsquo;s Creative Capital report has clearly outlined the need for action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure Deputy Troy understands the principles of negotiation.  The Labour Relations Commission will certainly be carrying that out.  I am sure it would not respond favourably to interference from the Minister at this stage.</P>

        <asker>   Deputy Catherine Murphy</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</askee>
        <Quest>    if he will outline, in relation to the Gathering event planned for 2013, if he is considering any genealogical element to the proposal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.    </Quest>
        <QRef>[12636/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Gathering event is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I am conscious of the tourism potential of genealogy for attracting the diaspora to our shores.  Therefore, I welcome my fellow Minister&rsquo;s initiative.  He has stated he expects the Gathering to be one of the biggest tourism initiatives ever to be undertaken in Ireland.  It will be a year-long event in 2013 when people at home and abroad can play a part in the country&rsquo;s recovery, potentially bringing in 325,000 extra tourists and providing a major economic stimulus. </P>
        <P>The Gathering is a hugely important and timely initiative for the tourism sector, one which my Department and the national cultural institutions which operate under its aegis are very pleased to support and participate in.  In that context, officials from my Department are working closely with their colleagues in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and agencies within its ambit &mdash; F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland &mdash; on cultural, genealogical and heritage tourism matters.  I see the Gathering as an excellent opportunity to enhance genealogical tourism.</P>
        <P>Genealogical records made available through my Department have been extremely popular with the public at home and abroad.  The success of the digitisation project of the 1901-1911 census is the best proof of this.  The website, hosted and managed by the National Archives of Ireland, has proved to be phenomenally popular, with over 648 million hits and more than 13 million individual visits to date.  The certificate of Irish heritage has now been linked with the site.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister that the online availability of the 1901 and 1911 census information provides people with an opportunity to undertake research in advance of their arrival here.  In the absence of many of the 19th century census records, the General Register Office which provides information on births, marriages and deaths is important.  We must put our best foot forward in this regard.  Digitisation of records enables people to carry out research in advance and thus increases the likelihood of their coming here.  While there is an online facility for researching births, marriages and deaths, it is part of the Church of Latter Day Saints&rsquo; website rather than the website of the General Register Office, which I do not understand.  Searching online is much simpler than having to physically search through large indexes in the General Register Office located in the Irish Life Mall.  Much more <Col N="6"/>needs to be done in this regard, from which we could get a decent return.  I ask the Minister to address this issue in conjunction with other relevant Departments, if necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">While I agree with the Deputy, I do not have direct responsibility for the General Register Office.  The Deputy will be aware that in the autumn I brought together all of those involved in the country in genealogy.  We had a successful forum, under the chairmanship of Judge McMahon, in the National Library, at which this issue was raised.  I am awaiting a report from the group.  The General Register Office is an important source of information.  I agree with the Deputy that the more information we can make available to the diaspora the better and the more sources there are through which people can make connections and trace their roots, the more interest there will be .  We must ensure all of the information is digitised and made available to a global audience.  I previously informed the Deputy that I intended to introduce legislation to enable digitisation of the 1926 census returns.  The legislation has been approved by the Cabinet.  Following its enactment, I will have to come up with the resources to implement it.  I cannot start the process until the enabling legislation has been passed.  It is hoped it will be ready in June or July.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the importance of this issue to the Deputy.  I agree that it is important we make every source of information available to allow people, irrespective of where they are in the world, to make a connection with this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>When does the Minister expect to receive the report from Judge McMahon?  Also, has the cost of implementing the enabling legislation been quantified?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are various ways of approaching this matter.  Obviously, special provision will have to be made.  We could, for example, consider putting in place an agreement with a person or body on the provision of this information and the person or body could recoup the costs over time by way of charging for the information provided.  I am not suggesting that will be the ultimate solution, but it is a possibility.  It is important that the enabling legislation to allow this happen is put in place first.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</askee>
        <Quest>    his plans to institute a strategy to tackle the escalating numbers of mink throughout the country in view of the impact this particular animal has upon the landscape, habitat and other wildlife in the areas affected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.    </Quest>
        <QRef>[12891/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Mink found in the wild in Ireland are descended from animals that escaped from fur farms.  They have been breeding in the countryside since the 1950s and are now found throughout much of the country.  A report published by my Department in 2009 estimated the population of wild mink in the State could reach a total of between 20,500 <Col N="8"/>and 33,500 individuals.  It identified ground-nesting birds as the species most vulnerable to mink predation.</P>
        <P>For some time I have been concerned about the prevalence of feral mink around the country and especially their effects on ground-nesting birds.  However, the cost of a national cull would be prohibitive at this time.  Accordingly, my Department is concentrating its resources on protecting the nesting sites of rare and threatened bird species such as the red-throated diver, the corncrake, the grey partridge, waders and terns from a range of predators, including mink.  Experience has shown that targeted control of predators at specific times can have a significant benefit to the breeding success of these species.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the work of the National Association of Regional Game Councils which has been actively promoting mink control to its members by providing funding for its regional councils for the purchase of traps for individual clubs.  I decided to provide &euro;20,000 for the organisation towards the payment of a bounty to hunters this year based on the number of mink killed.  I consider this to be a useful addition to the control measures already being taken by my Department on land it owns.  While feral mink are found in most parts of the country, I requested that, as far as possible, special attention be given to the counties of Donegal, Galway, Mayo and Kerry where my Department has already concentrated its efforts.  The bounty scheme will be operated by the National Association of Regional Game Councils and a verification process will be in operation between it and my Department.  As wild mink are not protected under the Wildlife Acts, they can be controlled by landowners and their agents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is evident that there has been a massive increase in the number of wild mink in Ireland.  When in opposition in 2010 the Taoiseach raised this matter in the House with the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. John Gormley, and what was said received coverage in the <i>Mayo Advertiser</i>.  At the time it was believed, perhaps on the basis of a census carried out or a rough estimate made in 2009, that up to 33,500 mink were living in the wild.  I am sure that now there are between 40,000 and 50,000 wild mink throughout the country.  All of the evidence, particularly that relating to a number of incidents which occurred in recent years, seems to point to the fact that the population of wild mink is increasing at a rapid rate.  Wild mink are causing havoc among and damage to other species of wildlife and rare species of birds.  There have also been attacks on domestic farmyard fowl.  When I was at home in west Kerry recently, I listened to a radio report in which was outlined the major damage done in farmyards throughout the Corcha Dhuibhne area.  It must also be borne in mind that these days many ordinary people keep poultry in order to ensure they have a stock of eggs.  There is evidence to suggest mink are present on the Great Blasket Island and Puffin Island.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to take immediate action to prevent the numbers of mink on the islands in question from increasing even further.  These mink will wipe out rare birds and other species of wildlife if they are allowed to roam the islands in the way they have been permitted to wander the mainland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  Not only are mink a threat to other species of wildlife, they are also a threat to domestic fowl.  The Deputy has referred to a few incidents which occurred in west Kerry.  I can inform him that similar incidents took place in the northern part of the county where a huge flock of turkeys was completely wiped out just prior to Christmas.  What is happening is also affecting people economically.  This is a matter which we must address.  To that end, I have made &euro;20,000 available this year.  The total cost to the Department for the control of mink is approximately &euro;100,000, but we will have to provide more resources in the future.</P><Col N="9"/>
        <P>In the Hebrides in Scotland it was proved that with a proper eradication programme, mink could be exterminated in an environment.  However, that was on a smaller island.  To exterminate mink entirely in this country it would cost approximately &euro;100 million, a significant amount of money.  This is a very important issue, especially if we consider ground-nesting birds, to which mink are doing more damage than any other species.  Such birds include the corncrake, a rare species.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>We need a national campaign.  Perhaps the partnership and Leader groups might get involved in providing grant aid for farmers.  We must put in place a trap system as the bounty system has failed to work.  There is evidence of this in Iceland particularly, as during the years the population has grown, despite the existence of several bounty schemes.  I will speak to the Minister later, but perhaps something might be done with the rural development groups in providing Leader programme funding and grant aid for local farmers.  Mink which are trapped could be used as part of a commercial activity to offset the cost of trapping the animals.  I do not know, however, if that suggestion would be feasible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for his very practical proposal; he usually comes here with good and practical proposals.  We can discuss the matter again.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63, 64, 68, 80, 83, 86 and 307 together. </P>
        <P>In 2011 the Government announced a compensation scheme for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation, SACs.  The cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme comprises a payment of &euro;1,000 per year, index linked, for 15 years or, where feasible, relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs where they can continue to cut turf.  Those wishing to relocate can avail of the financial payment or the delivery of cut turf while relocation sites are identified and prepared.  The cost of acquiring and preparing relocation sites will be met by the State.  The Government has recently considered whether the financial package announced in 2011 should be enhanced.  I will make an announcement to the House in this regard during Private Members&rsquo; business later today.</P>
        <P>In April 2011 my Department wrote to known owners of land and rights in the SACs nominated for designation between 1997 and 1999 to inform them of the cessation of turf cutting on these sites and to invite applications for compensation.  Advertisements were also placed in local and national newspapers.  It is estimated that 750 individual turf plots are active on these SACs.  To date, almost 650 applications for compensation or relocation have been received relating to these sites.</P>
        <P>Assessment and verification of applications is a complex process, particularly in respect of proof of ownership.  My officials have been working closely with turf cutters, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as successor of the Land Commission, Bord na M&oacute;na and the Property Registration Authority to assist people to provide the necessary proof of legal interest with their applications.  While a number of payments have been made under the scheme, the complexity of ensuring adherence to the qualification criteria has caused delays in <Col N="14"/>making payments.  However, my Department has recently put in place arrangements to speed up and simplify the checking process and expects to make by the end of this month a significant number of initial payments to additional applicants for sites nominated for designation between 1997 and 1999.</P>
        <P>In December my Department wrote to known owners of land and rights in the SACs nominated for designation in 2002.  Advertisements were also placed in local and national newspapers.  It is estimated that there are approximately 790 actively cut plots on these sites.  The deadline for the receipt of applications relating to these sites was the end of February 2012.  Owing to the high number of applications received in recent days, the details of the numbers received are not readily available.  To allow potential applicants time to gather the necessary legal documents, I have decided to extend the deadline for the receipt of applications for sites nominated for designation in 2002 until 30 April 2012.</P>
        <P>The Government has been conscious of the need to build a shared understanding of the requirements of the habitats directive regarding the protection of raised bog SACs.  To this end, it established the peatlands council under an independent chairman, Mr. Conor Skehan, to bring all parties together.  Last week, on his initiative, a peatlands forum was convened in Athlone under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice John Quirke.  It provided an opportunity for all parties to identify and discuss what was needed to resolve issues arising from Ireland&rsquo;s requirements to implement the habitats directive on 53 raised bog special areas of conservation.  The forum considered proposals in regard to relocation and other solutions to address the requirements of the directive.  Its report, prepared by Mr. Justice Quirke, was presented to me and considered by the Government this morning.  My Department will publish the report on its website this afternoon and, once people have had an opportunity to consider it, I propose to respond more fully to it during Private Members&rsquo; business.</P>
        <P>My Department has been in discussion regarding relocation with several groups of turf cutters from different bogs with a view to reaching satisfactory resolutions at local level.  Agreement has been concluded with groups from Clara bog in County Offaly and Mountbellew in County Galway.  These solutions involve turf cutters moving to nearby Bord na M&oacute;na bogs where they will be able to continue turf cutting.</P>
        <P>The position on continued cutting on natural heritage areas, NHAs, will be reviewed in accordance with the programme for Government.  This will be done in the context of drawing up a national peatlands strategy which is being undertaken by my Department in conjunction with the peatlands council.  I have undertaken that such a review will be completed in advance of the 2014 cutting season.  The review will provide clarity on the future of turf cutting on these sites.  The issues regarding turf cutting on Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog special areas of conservation will be discussed in greater detail later and tomorrow during Private Members&rsquo; business and I look forward to contributing to that debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
	<P>Turf cutting is an emotive issue.  It is part of our heritage and culture and the tradition has been passed on through the generations.  The issue is topical because it will be the subject of a Private Members&rsquo; motion later and the original deadline for the receipt of applications for compensation passed last week.  However, I welcome the extension of the deadline because many potential applicants did not have time to get the necessary information together.  For example, turf cutters on a bog in County Longford were not aware that the previous deadline had been set for 29 February.</P>
        <P>It appears the Government parties have changed their position somewhat on this issue since their time in opposition.  I acknowledge the previous Government introduced SACs and the ten year derogation.  The Minister stated there were 750 active turf plots on the SACs desig<Col N="15"/>nated between 1997 and 1999 and that 650 applications had been made for compensation.  What percentage of the applicants have been accommodated through relocation to an alternative bog?  What percentage have been adequately compensated?  I understand all those approved for compensation have been not paid.  I am involved in a few cases.  The peatlands forum initiative undertaken last week by the peatlands council was most welcome.  Are the Minister and the Department still liaising with the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that the Deputy has always been positive and supportive of what we are all trying to do to resolve this matter, which would be in all our interests, as the last thing we want to do is to pay fines of between &euro;20,000 and &euro;25,000 per day to the European Commission.  I do not have to remind Members that formal notice was sent to the Department in January 2011 followed by a reasoned opinion in June 2011.  Therefore, the Commission is interested in what is happening here.  However, there have been positive developments.  For the first time, the TCCA, the Department and the Commission are working together to try to find a solution.</P>
        <P>I would like to acknowledge &mdash; I will do this again this evening &mdash; the efforts made by so many people to obtain a resolution to this sensitive and difficult subject.  As a rural dweller who lives in the heart of a number of bogs as well as near one of the designated bogs, I am very much aware of how sensitive this issue is and how important it is for so many people to have it resolved in such a way that the environment is protected but people can continue to cut turf legally.  That is important.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I have been trying my best to facilitate payments as much as possible, but we have developed a new system of payment.  To date, just 63 applicants have been paid the amount that applied last year, but 200 people will be paid next week.  I hope payments will go out in the next few weeks.  We had to establish a system of verification to ensure the documentation was proper and so on, but that system is now in place and I hope payments will go out faster.  As the Deputies know, the verification systems that have been established this year will last for the next 15 years.  Once people have their documentation verified, that will be sufficient for the years ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments and the motion that has been tabled today.  I have not seen Mr. Justice Quirke&rsquo;s report, but I acknowledge, and I think the Minister acknowledges, that for the first time ever the Government of the day has publicly admitted that there was a lack of proper consultation, communication and trust between the State and turf cutters throughout the country.  That in itself is a significant step forward.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister clarify that we are talking about here is approximately 5% of designated bogs and that for the other 95%, there is absolutely no dispute relating to them?  We are talking about a very small percentage of bogs.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister aware that for the majority of turf cutters, this is not an issue of compensation but of a sensible resolution being provided to turf cutters to facilitate them to continue to cut turf on their existing bogs or adjoining non-designated bogs?  In light of that, could the Minister clarify whether the Government is considering allowing the co-existence of domestic turf cutting on designated bogs as a mitigating measure in a limited number of cases?  Has the Government considered the issue of compensatory habitat?  At the end of this process, more than 100% of designated bog will be closed off to turf cutting for good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Naughten for his contribution.  Roscommon is particularly affected by this issue, and I know from my experience of visiting that county that it is a very emotive subject there.  Along with Deputies Naughten and Flanagan and the chairman of the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, Mick Fitzmaurice, I travelled over that <Col N="16"/>area in a helicopter last year and was given a bird&rsquo;s eye view of what was happening on the ground as well as an idea of the extent of raised bogs in Galway and Roscommon.</P>
        <P>The de-designation of small areas around the country will be a matter for the Commission.  The Government cannot de-designate.  This is mentioned in Deputy Flanagan&rsquo;s motion which will be moved this evening, and is also mentioned in the amendment.  I will go into more detail later.  Obviously, we could go back to the Commission with any proposal, but we want to exhaust every other alternative first.</P>
        <P>The Deputy mentioned that for the first time ever there has been real engagement.  The Government, and the country, are fortunate that Conor Skehan has taken over as chairman of the Peatlands Council.  I acknowledge here that he has given ten months of his life to this issue, free to the State, which is a considerable contribution.  I hope for his sake that because of these deliberations and the amount of work he has put in, we can obtain a resolution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SandraMcLellan"><NameTxt>Deputy Sandra McLellan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his answer.  With regard to the proposals from the TCCA, which include a detailed case-by-case analysis of the possible options, will the Minister commit to providing individual turf cutters with a hearing on this matter?  If so, in what timeframe does he envisage this occurring?  We are all conscious that time is of the essence and other alternatives may suit some people better then relocation or compensation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy knows, an elaborate process was carried out last week in which representatives for each bog put their case to the judge and a technical group tried to obtain a resolution.  I do not think this process has ever been carried out before.  I recognise that people entered this process with total intent to obtain a resolution, and they were very honest, open and frank about the whole thing.  There was a real sense that people engaged because they wanted to achieve a solution.</P>
        <P>With regard to individual turf cutters, in the small number of bogs where it may be difficult to resolve this issue, all considerations will have to be taken into account, including those of individuals.  Our policy from the beginning was to listen to everybody and I know that is what Mr. Skehan did.  Officials from my Department and the National Parks and Wildlife Service have spent the winter out there speaking and listening to people and trying to obtain solutions.  I hope this effort will now pay off and we will get the desired results, for all our sakes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>As has been said, the issue is not about financial compensation but about the right to continue cutting turf.  However, for those who do wish to take compensation, could the Minister confirm there is funding for this purpose?  I agree with him that there have been some resolutions, including in Mountbellew, but I could mention other bogs in Galway &mdash; Camderry, Kilkerrin, and Barroughter in south-east Galway &mdash; where, according to the people who live there, there is nowhere else to go to cut turf.  That brings us back to the idea of de-designation of bogs.  Is that possible where people want to cut turf but have no alternative?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a sizeable sum of money &mdash; &euro;5 million &mdash; available.  The Government considers it important that we resolve this, and people will have to be compensated.  I have been making this point quite clearly.  That is why I will be announcing an enhanced package this evening.  Expecting people to move from areas in which they have cut for generations to alternative bogs is a lot to ask, and they must be properly compensated.</P>
        <P>In the Deputy&rsquo;s own constituency, because of the leadership of a former Deputy of this House, Paul Connaughton, a positive resolution was obtained, and work has already started, with machinery on the bog and drainage being carried out.  The examples of Clara and Mountbellew show that this can work when people work together.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="17"/>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Can something be done to facilitate people who do not own a bog but have had informal rights to turf-cutting in terms of obtaining access to adjoining bogs?  Second, is it not the case that without Conor Skehan and Mr. Justice Quirke, this issue would not have been resolved to the extent it has, and that if this had been done ten years ago, we would not be in the mess we are in today?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Department advertise the extension to the scheme in order that people would be aware of it?  Although it is not all about compensation, for those who wish to be compensated financially as opposed to being relocated, speed is of the essence and more people might have taken it if there had been greater speed.  What progress has been made with the natural heritage areas, NHAs, to ensure they will be exempt in the future because we support the Minister&rsquo;s endeavours in that regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to Deputy Naughten, the judge in his conclusion mentioned that ownership of bogs is a complex area so we will take a sympathetic view of those who have established rights in bogs.  Many bogs were never registered and people have been cutting on them for generations and that could be the fault of a solicitor who never bothered to do it.  I agree with the Deputy that if this process had happened ten years ago we would not have incurred the wrath of the Commission and would be in a much better position where we would not be discussing this.  In reply to Deputy Troy, we will publicise the extension.</P>

    <Title>Leaders&rsquo; Questions</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has announced the legal requirement to hold a referendum on the fiscal treaty.  The legal advice, however, has not been published and I would like the Taoiseach to tell the House if he intends to publish that advice.  It is my belief he should and that it would be helpful.</P>
        <P>The public fundamentally need the most comprehensive form of information possible on this treaty, a request I am hearing a lot on the street from people, who want it explained to them in simple terms in a comprehensive manner.  Will the Taoiseach outline to the House the timing he envisages for the holding of the referendum?  Will it happen in May or in the autumn, as conflicting reports are suggesting?  Will the Taoiseach tell the House whether the wording of the referendum Bill has been completed and, if not, when it will be finalised?  Following on from that, could the Taoiseach give Members a timeline for the establishment of the referendum commission?</P>
        <P>Some the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Ministers are saying the negotiations on the promissory note issue should be linked to the referendum.  In a major interview in the <i>Financial Times</i>, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, said a deal would be helpful, while the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, has stated it would not be helpful to connect the two.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have said the two issues are not linked, nor should they be.  Commentators like Mr. Quinn of Dow Jones came on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning and said emphatically that a deal has been done.  Will the Taoiseach outline to the House what <Col N="19"/>is going on?  Is this the case?  Has a deal been done on the promissory note?  By any objective criterion and with any sense of natural justice independent of the signing of a treaty, a deal should and must be done, given that Ireland took the hit to protect the eurozone at a time when there was no European mechanism in place.  Given what has been said this morning and that some Ministers are strongly hinting a deal has been done, will the Taoiseach confirm whether a deal has been done?  Will it be done before the end of March?  Will the Taoiseach clarify this issue in the House today?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not intend to publish the formal legal advice of the Attorney General except to say she advised the Government formally that, on balance, in consideration of the wording of the fiscal stability treaty, she considers that for it to be ratified, the people must be asked and a referendum must be held.  I have been very clear all along that if the advice of the Attorney General was that a referendum should be held, then it should be.  The decision not to publish the legal advice is in keeping with the long tradition of not publishing legal advice given by the Attorney General to the Government of the day.  I agree fully with the Deputy that it is important that Irish citizens have the fullest possible information on what the treaty actually means.  The questions of the future of the country and its people and our place in Europe are important for job creation, growth and continued investment.</P>
        <P>No date has been fixed for the holding of the referendum.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin is aware that it will be necessary to put together a referendum Bill which will have to take account of the question that will appear on the ballot paper.  A referendum commission will have to be established and a competent person found to chair it.  The publication of a fiscal responsibility Bill which will deal with the elements of the treaty that need to be enshrined in Irish law will also be required.  The Government will reflect on these matters.  The treaty has to be ratified by 1 January 2013, on which date the train for the future of Europe will leave the station.  I consider it important that Ireland be clearly seen to be on that train.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputy for expressing his view of the country and support for the treaty.  From his own experience he is aware of the timelines in this regard.  There is a need to have a set period between publication of a referendum Bill and the establishment of a referendum commission.  The Government will reflect on this matter again next week.  The T&aacute;naiste has written to the Attorney General on behalf of the Government and will bring a memo to the Government.  The referendum has to be held before 1 January 2013 and the Government will consider the most appropriate date for it.  People need to have sufficient time to obtain the fullest information possible on it.  The Government has not yet made a decision on whether it will take place before or after the summer.</P>
        <P>I have noted the comments made in the <i>Financial Times</i> about the promissory note.  The Minister involved was responding to a specific question asked by the interviewer.  I wish to make it clear that these matters are entirely separate.  A great deal of intensive work and activity are taking place on the issue of greater flexibility for Ireland with regard to the payments it has to make.  Clearly, if that work is brought to a successful outcome, it will enable Ireland to deal more adequately with its deficit and make it easier for it to repay its debts.  There is no timeline in this regard and I have not put a timeline on it.  I cannot speak for the governors of the eurozone central banks or the other elements of the troika.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also asked about the comments made on national radio this morning by Mr. Quinn of Dow Jones.  I can confirm that no deal has been done in this regard and that no deal of the order suggested by Mr. Quinn is on the table for decision.  I will not heighten anybody&rsquo;s expectations.  The Government is doing a great deal of work on this complex, difficult and sensitive issue in the interests of the nation.  I will not stand up and commit to a heightened expectation that this can be delivered in a fortnight or three weeks.  This is a serious matter for <Col N="20"/>the country, the economy and the people.  We will continue to work diligently, following the initiative taken by the troika when it undertook to produce a paper on the basis of the flexibility of what we have to repay with regard to the promissory note.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for bringing clarity to some elements of this issue, particularly to the comments made this morning.  I suggest some Ministers, whether they mean it, are adding to the sense of heightened expectation in relation to the promissory note.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>That seems to be what is happening.  The more important part of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply was his suggestion &ldquo;no timeline&rdquo; applies to the negotiations on the promissory note.  Is the Government not working to a timeline, in the light of the imminence of the first repayment that has to be made?  European mechanisms in terms of banking issues which were not in place at the time are now in place.  Surely there is a timeline leading up to the end of this month.  I assume those who are working on this matter, including the troika, are very conscious of it.  Does the Taoiseach envisage that it will be sorted before the end of this month?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To be honest, I cannot put a conclusion time on it because I do not control the attitude that might be taken by the governors of the other eurozone central banks.  The Deputy is well aware that some countries take the view that others should be encouraged and helped.  That is part of what the foundation of the European Union was about.  People in other countries who are coming from a certain political perspective take the view that we got ourselves into this mess and that we need to get ourselves out of it.  We take a very different view of how the European Union should progress in order to ensure every country can adhere to proper conditions, can have proper budgeting and housekeeping of its own affairs and can work to stimulate its economy in order that jobs and opportunities can be created.</P>
        <P>I wish we did not have to deal with the promissory note issue, but it is the reality.  The Deputy is aware that it came into being some time before Ireland entered into the bailout programme.  Essentially, the principle surrounding our approach is that we are not looking for something that any other country could look for afterwards.  It is important that there be an emphasis on the opportunity to apply the flexibilities under the EFSF and the ESM to the promissory note recapitalisation moneys of over &euro;60 billion which were added to the sovereign debt and led to difficulty for us.  I would love to be able to tell the House that I know a conclusion will be reached by a certain date.  However, I am not standing here to heighten expectations that a conclusion will be brought to this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I can confirm that discussions are continuing between officials at European level.  However, I am not in a position to say a deal is on the table or that it will be defined by a certain date.  Nobody should run away with the view that we have heightened the expectation that a &ldquo;big bang solution&rdquo;, as some call it, will be reached.  Ireland&rsquo;s economic problems are much more complex and much more sensitive than this.  I can confirm that the Government&rsquo;s activity and energy, through its officials, are being channelled into this issue in a realistic way. <Col N="21"/> Ireland has measured up during five detailed assessments by the troika.  It has adhered to all the conditions laid down.  We will look for an opportunity to gain further support here.  If we secure a longer extension and a lower interest rate, it will make it easier for us to deal with the deficit and meet our repayments.  Obviously, I will report progress to the House when it is made.  However, I am not in the business of heightening expectations by suggesting we will have a solution to this complex matter by a certain date or time.</P>

	<P Just="Left">When the Dignity 4 Patients group presented the results of a survey this morning, it showed that 18% of respondents believed they had been subjected to inappropriate action or comment while in the care of a health care professional.  It is 17 years since complaints were first made of the sexual abuse of patients at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  Three years have passed since the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, tabled a motion calling for an immediate inquiry into the sexual abuse of patients at the hospital.  The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the President who were in opposition at the time voted in favour of the motion.  N&iacute;l m&eacute; ag ard&uacute; an &aacute;bhair seo d&iacute;reach os rud &eacute; go bhfuil ceisteanna &aacute; chur ar an Taoiseach inniu.

	<P Just="Left">T&aacute; an-&eacute;igeart ag baint leis seo agus t&aacute; a fhios sin ag an Taoiseach mar is fear maith &eacute; i dtaobh ruda&iacute; mar seo.  T&aacute;imid ag fanacht ach n&iacute;l muidne t&aacute;bhachtach ar chor ar bith.  T&aacute; saor&aacute;naigh eile ag fanacht f&oacute;s.</P>
        <P>Seventeen years is too long, given the all-party support for a commission of inquiry.  There is no reason whatsoever this cannot proceed immediately.  There are sexual abusers in all sectors of our society.  There are sexual abusers in families.  My father was a sexual abuser, and I have some sense of the anguish and the pain of these citizens.  I meet them regularly and I know every time they meet, it is a revisiting of all that happened to them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was good enough for Fine Gael and the Labour Party to support a commission of inquiry when in opposition.  There is no reason it cannot be established on terms acceptable to the victims and the survivors.  I ask the Taoiseach to give a clear commitment on such a commission <Col N="22"/>of inquiry.  When in opposition the current Minister of Health put down a motion on this and it was defeated by only two votes.  There is no reason, in my opinion, it cannot proceed.  Until then, there is no reason Dignity 4 Patients cannot receive appropriate funding.  Dignity 4 Patients has been advocating for this group for the past 17 years.  This would never have come to light only for a brave woman who blew the whistle and highlighted what had occurred.  Dignity 4 Patients, which is advocating for these citizens, is not even being properly funded by the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s view that this is a horrendous situation.  I commend the whistleblower who brought forward this information in the first instance.  I really empathise and sympathise with those who are the victims in this case.  However, I do not want to stand up here and announce inquiries like that.  I ask the Deputy to bear with me while the Office of the Attorney General provides me with the best advice on the best way possible to proceed.  I am happy to sit down with the Deputy and other Deputies from the north-east region and have a rational discussion about ensuring justice is done for the victims.</P>
        <P>I know that sometimes words can be twisted, and this is a sensitive matter, as the Deputy is aware.  While funding was made available before, I had assumed &mdash; wrongly &mdash; that the referendum on Oireachtas inquiries to carry out investigations of public importance would be approved.  It was not approved by the people, and we cannot, therefore, proceed down that route.  I have asked the Attorney General on the best option available, as has the Minister for Health, and if the Deputy bears with me until I receive that advice, I will be happy to report to the House, answer questions about it and meet with Deputies from the north east.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>That is almost exactly the same answer given to me on the last occasion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but I have not got the advice, as the Deputy knows.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand, from his replies to Deputy Martin, that there are many reasons the Taoiseach feels he cannot give us a date for the referendum. However, it seems to me to be more than coincidental that we are not getting a date either for the referendum or for the solution the Government is going to find on the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes.  It would be fair to draw a conclusion that one is dependent on the other.  When we get one date, we will almost certainly get another date.  For that reason, perhaps the Taoiseach will give the House an indication on when we can get a deal on the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources gave an interview to <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> last month stating that this would be done and dusted by 31 March.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could confirm that.  The Minister for Social Protection gave an interview to the <i>Financial Times</i> stating specifically that she was looking for a 50 year deal on the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes.  Can the Taoiseach state this is also Government policy?  The Minister for Social Protection linked the two issues.</P>
        <P>It seems there is a great deal of confusion on this issue, particularly as the Minister for Finance, whose area this is, appears to be the only person who is silent on it.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could give us a specific indication of when we will get a deal or even a progress report on the promissory notes.  We then might be more enlightened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not just a matter for the Minister for Finance.  This is a matter for every person in the country.  This is not an issue that is confined to any one party or to any one Minister.  This is an issue for the Irish people.  It is a separate matter from a European Union treaty in that Ireland does not have the power of veto.  It is not a case of saying I am <Col N="23"/>going to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; because it will stop this process in its tracks.  Once 12 countries have ratified the treaty, it can come into effect.  From that perspective, it is very important that Ireland has its own insurance policy against the future by being able to ratify the treaty very strongly.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources said he hoped it would be concluded by 31 March.  The question of the promissory note and the discussions on it are entirely separate from the stability treaty.  We could name 1,000 things that are all separate and were they to be dealt with tomorrow morning, the environment and the atmosphere would be very good.  However, the position is that Irish people are very pragmatic about the choice they have to make here.  The choice that they have to make is in respect of our country&rsquo;s future and the steps we have to take on the road to economic recovery.</P>
        <P>It is not coincidental that a date has not yet been named.  I came in this morning and ten different dates were thrown at me.  Some of them were in the middle of the Eucharistic Congress.  Others were in the middle of the European championships.  There has to be a practical nature to what we are at as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>That depends on how well we do in the European championships.</P>

	<P>What of the Connacht final?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that we must consider what it is the referendum Bill will contain.  As the Deputy will be aware, in the past it always has been a strong feature of referenda in Ireland that one does not insert too much detail into the Constitution and legislates for the details that are contained in treaties.</P>
        <P>The Government will reflect on that next week.  We will be in a much clearer position, once the timeline is set out, on the process of setting up the Bill, the referendum commission and the person to chair that, and how one proceeds afterwards to have a campaign that funds the case, both for and against, as applies and the difficulties that all of that has brought with it.</P>
        <P>The fact that work has been ongoing on the promissory note for quite some time is not linked with the fact that the Attorney General gave her formal legal advice to which the Government is responding quickly.  Deputy Ross should not get carried away that there is a longing and an expectation that this will be concluded, in so far as the promissory note is concerned, on 17 March or whenever.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

	<P>As soon as Government decides the date, we will announce that to the country and put in train the process.  I am quite sure Deputy Ross, in his economic vista, will see the road out ahead for our country and will come around to the point of view where he would promote a strong &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in this referendum.</P>

	<P>It states, &ldquo;Minister Pat Rabbitte said that some sort of restructure will be agreed with the country&rsquo;s bailout lenders before the next annual repayment of the IOUs falls due next month.&rdquo;  There is nothing wrong with him saying that, it if is true.</P>

	<P>If it is being diluted, that is fine.  There is nothing wrong, by the way, with linking the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes and a deal.  My guess is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Without guessing, could I have Deputy Ross&rsquo;s supplementary question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, of course.  My guess is that the Taoiseach will surprise himself how quickly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>It was an act of contrition.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;he will be able to come to the conclusion that it is time for a referendum when he announces, before 31 March, that the Anglo Irish Bank promissory deal is done.  I would suspect the Taoiseach will surprise everybody in this House with the speed with which the Cabinet suddenly will be able to come to that conclusion.</P>
        <P>Finally, can I ask the Taoiseach a question?  The Taoiseach stated yesterday that there would not be a second referendum.  What happens if M. Hollande is elected in France and he negotiates a new fiscal treaty, as he has promised?</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>A friend of the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, this morning hoped he would be elected.</P>

        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Ross will be aware, there was no referendum being contemplated when the question raised by the troika was undertaken, which was, to do a paper in respect of the possibilities of flexibility on this promissory note.  There was no referendum in train or being considered at that stage.  That work was under way when the Attorney General, quite properly, gave her formal legal advice to the Government and the Government proceeded to act on the consequences of that.  The process being set in train for the referendum, that is, the preparation of the referendum Bill, the appointment of a referendum commission and a person to chair that, the publication of the issues to be legislated for in a fiscal responsibility Bill, must be all put in place.</P>
        <P>I genuinely want to see a rational discussion about the importance of the referendum on this treaty in order that every person in the country understands its importance for our future in as complete a way as can be explained.</P>
        <P>I do not speak for M. Hollande.  I know he has stated that if he were elected he would renegotiate the treaty.  He is as much aware as anybody else that this treaty has been already agreed by 25 of the 27 countries, it must be ratified and the ratification process is under way.  I cannot speak for the French electorate as to what it will do in the presidential election and I cannot say what efforts he, if he were to be elected, could make in respect of renegotiating the treaty.  I pointed out that this was agreed by the French Government, as one of 25 countries of the 27.  We move on, having signed it, to the process of ratification, which is different from one country to the next and which will involve a referendum here.  That election takes place on 6 May and, obviously, the French people will make their own decision.</P>
        <P>We need to make clear decisions about the process here.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, who wrote to the Attorney General on behalf of the Government because it is a matter of intergovernmental treaties, will bring a memo to Cabinet, probably next week.  Deputy Ross will have further opportunity to see the precise timelines.  As I say, it must be either before the summer or after the summer.  We do not want it to be too short, where people would not have the opportunity to have this explained to them and have their say, and to fully understand it.</P>
        <P>For my part, I see the importance of this being given a very strong &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; support for the future of our country and for the future of our people.  In due course, when we decide on the time, we will explain how important it is for everybody.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 10, inclusive, together.</P><Col N="27"/>
        <P>Following the restructuring completed in 2011, my Department is now engaged on core activities which focus on supporting the Taoiseach and supporting the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department has undergone significant change in the past 12 months.  A new Economic Management Council, a new programme for Government office and a new office of the T&aacute;naiste, within the Department of the Taoiseach, have been established.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Cabinet committee structure has been changed.  Other significant changes include a new integrated European affairs division, involving the transfer of 18 staff and functions from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Department of the Taoiseach; the transfer of 27 staff and functions relating to public service reform from the Department of the Taoiseach to the new Department of Public Expenditure and Reform; the adoption of a different approach to social dialogue by the new Government, which replaces the previous social partnership process and places a greater emphasis on the role of line Departments rather than a centralised process managed by the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
     <P Just="Left">Following the restructuring completed in 2011, my Department is now engaged in the following core activities: the executive functions of the Taoiseach and the Government; the Government secretariat, my private office and the offices of the Government Chief Whip and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs; the Office of the T&aacute;naiste; the Government press office; support for the Taoiseach in carrying out my duties as Head of Government, including in relation to the Oireachtas, constitutional issues, protocol, the European Council, the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council; engaging with the formulation and implementation of Government policy, mainly through the system of Cabinet committees, including the Economic Management Council, senior officials groups and the new programme for Government office; providing briefing and advice for me on the full range of domestic policy issues and on international affairs; supporting the Government and myself in the formulation and implementation of EU policy, including the co-ordination of EU policy interests across the whole of Government; and delivering support services through corporate affairs division, that is, HR, finance, IT and other services.</P>
        <P>All of these functions are carried out within a staff ceiling of 185, which will rise temporarily to over 200 arising from Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU in 2013.  Overall, there has been a reduction in staff numbers of 20% since January 2008.  It should also be borne in mind that my Department is the smallest Department, with an annual budget of under &euro;20 million.</P>
        <P>The details requested in regard to staff numbers in my Department in March 2011 and to date are set out in the table, which I propose to circulate with the Official Report.  I am also proposing to circulate with the Official Report the details requested regarding the number of staff employed in the Government Information Service and <i>www.merrionstreet.ie</i>.  Two staff from Forf&aacute;s are on loan to my Department to work on the implementation of the action plan for jobs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My advisers work closely with the civil servants in my Department on the preparation of speech material.  One of my personal assistants is involved in this process and works on an e-working basis.  Three members of staff in my Department retired in February 2012, comprising one principal officer, one executive officer who work-shared and one head service officer.  The staffing needs of my Department are kept under ongoing review in order to ensure that it meets its objectives, and sanction has been received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to fill a small number of vacancies through internal competitions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked six of the questions in this block of ten questions.  Rather than spending too much time on this aspect, it is worth noting from the information the <Col N="29"/>Taoiseach has supplied that his promise to slim down the Department of the Taoiseach radically has clearly been abandoned and the same goes for his nine-year promise to get rid of what he used to call the propaganda units in the Government Information Service.  This is very similar to the &ldquo;not another red cent&rdquo;-type promises he made, which were only designed to last as long as the election itself.  As the Taoiseach knows, he had very strong stuff to say about <i>www.merrionstreet.ie</i> and the GIS but he very quickly and warmly embraced them and continues to endorse their output and work.</P>
        <P>The other key issue the Taoiseach alluded to, and it is the biggest change that has occurred, is the transfer of the European division from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to his own Department, with over 80 staff.  I questioned this at the time in terms of coherence and integration with the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade itself.  The logic of that decision has never been clear because, even up to that period, the co-ordination of European policy was very effective and was acknowledged as such.</P>
        <P>The core network we rely upon in our relations with our European partners remains within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I am sure the Taoiseach is aware the T&aacute;naiste has reinstated a European affairs section in Iveagh House, led by an assistant secretary.  Will the Taoiseach explain how he considers it an improvement to have two sections in two different Departments responsible for co-ordinating European affairs?  In many ways this was an inevitable consequence of his decision to take the entire entity of European affairs to the Department of the Taoiseach.  In addition, if questions are asked of the Taoiseach on the North or on European affairs, why are some of them automatically referred to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know why some of them are automatically referred.  Obviously, it depends on the nature of the question.  I am quite happy to answer questions in respect of Northern Ireland and my responsibilities in that regard.</P>
        <P>On the individual programmes of the two parties before the Government was formed, the Deputy is aware that each one had its own view.  Obviously, the programme for Government is what we operate from.</P>
        <P>As I said, 18 staff of the EU division and their functions were transferred from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Department of the Taoiseach.  I discussed this at the very beginning.  The point made was that if one wants real co-ordination on an issue that now crosses all Departments, given we have a changed situation in so far as Europe is concerned as well as the impending Presidency, one is better to have it co-ordinated and overseen by the Department of the Taoiseach.  While senior civil servants are needed from other Departments &mdash; I say this with the greatest of respect to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade &mdash; it is much easier and has greater strength to have it coming from the Department of the Taoiseach, where it is guaranteed that senior personnel will be appointed to the issues of the day, as it were.</P>
        <P>In that sense, that suggestion was made to me from personnel within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade itself.  From my experience, the appointment of the second Secretary General dealing with the European issues has brought a cohesion and a co-ordination that is very real and responsive.  Where issues arise of European significance and where civil and public servants from other Departments are required to be in attendance, there is always a full response to that because it is coming from the Office of the Taoiseach itself, not just from myself as the person who occupies that office.  The impact of it has been very real, in my view, and very responsive in the interests of getting the job done more efficiently and more quickly.  I certainly cannot fault the way it is now operating.</P><Col N="30"/>
        <P>I do not know about the Deputy&rsquo;s comment on setting up another section in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Presumably, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has a number of people there in so far as the foreign affairs end of matters is concerned in order to be able to co-ordinate with the Second Secretary General dealing with European affairs in my Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I would argue that, across the foreign affairs brief, it is vital there would be a coherence and an integration.  It is not just about Europe on its own.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is about how Europe interacts with the emerging countries, including in Asia and South America, and European policy is critical to that relationship with other parts of the world.  The idea that a section on European affairs stands alone is misplaced in terms of the conduct of foreign policy.  On the evolution of European policy and how it relates to other blocs across the world, it is arguable that an integrated and coherent approach is needed.  If the section and the leadership is taken out of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, that connectivity and strong linkage between what is happening in Brussels and Europe is lost in terms of informing the rest of the diplomatic service on the issues.</P>
        <P>With regard to the action plan for jobs, the Taoiseach said two staff were seconded from Forf&aacute;s.  I argue that the plan is not radical.  It was over-claimed and over-spun, and was very much based on news management of existing proposals given many of the measures were already agreed or were part of strategies that had already been published.  The Taoiseach indicated, when he launched the plan with the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, that there would be a radical departure in the co-ordination of policies.  How can this be credible if so few people are actually given specific responsibility for it, even in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of the jobs action programme, there are 270 action points.  It is fair to say some of these have been around for a very long time and were never followed through or implemented.  There is a range of new initiatives to improve the atmosphere and the environment in which business can happen and jobs can be created, and to free up the road blocks that business people, entrepreneurs and innovators say are stopping them from doing their business.  I get examples of this on a regular basis.</P>
        <P>As to what we have decided to do, a senior public servant in my Department has responsibility for jobs, and he has a number of staff working with him.  The two I mentioned are additional staff from Forf&aacute;s who have come into my Department to assist in the work of monitoring implementation of the 270 action points.  It is not just these two people on their own.  It is a coterie within the Department of the Taoiseach who have responsibility for jobs and the jobs action programme.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>As they are further assisted by the addition of two good people from Forf&aacute;s I, as Taoiseach, working with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, can see to it that on this occasion, the action plan is implemented.  That means one puts the pressure on the Ministers to deliver, so far as their responsibility is concerned, and on the agencies, for whom they have responsibility, to ensure this happens.  I hope that as we publish a quarterly report on the action points implemented this will improve the environment and atmosphere generally for business and that what small businesses say to the Minister responsible for SMEs, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, me and everybody else will result in improving the position in terms of companies setting up and being able to do their work.  Clearly credit access and microfinance are two important matters in this regard.</P><Col N="31"/>
        <P>It is slightly misleading for me to say that there are just two people monitoring this matter.  There is a section in the Department of the Taoiseach which has responsibility for the jobs area and they are being supplemented by two internal people from Forf&aacute;s, redeployed to the Department of the Taoiseach.  I hope it bears results and I expect it will.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">T&aacute; dh&aacute; cheist agam &mdash; Ceisteanna Uimh. 7 agus 8 &mdash; so leanfaidh m&eacute; ar aghaidh le Ceist Uimh. 7 agus tiocfaidh m&eacute; ar ais ar&iacute;s le Ceist Uimh. 8. We learned last week that 9,000 staff are leaving the public service.  To the surprise of some of his Cabinet colleagues, the Taoiseach spoke about transition teams that were put in place.  Are those transition teams in place?  An bhfuil siad ag bualadh le ch&eacute;ile go f&oacute;ill agus c&eacute; chomh minic a bhuail siad le ch&eacute;ile?  M&aacute; t&aacute; said ag bualadh  le ch&eacute;ile, c&eacute;n dul chun cinn at&aacute; d&eacute;anta acu?  Has progress been made and how is the transition being managed?  From my soundings around health professionals, health workers and so on I have a sense there is no real plan in place to deal with the ongoing crisis in the health service where 4,300 workers are leaving and there are &euro;700 million worth of cuts.  It would be useful to get a sense of how the exodus and the cuts are being managed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The latest figures from across the public service indicate that more than 7,500 people applied to retire in January and February 2012.  Those figures are based on data reported by all of the public service employers on the number of retirement applications that have been received.  It will take some time for the final figures of actual retirements to be determined, taking into account those who may have changed their mind before 29 February.  The sectoral breakdown is as follows: education section, 3,058; the Civil Service, 1,236; the health sector, 2,640; local authorities, 931; Defence Forces, 362; and the Garda 310, amounting to a total of 7,537.  Retirement numbers do not always equate with full-time equivalents.  While these were taking place over a telescoped period in January and February, rather than a longer time span, local management had to assess and address the level of staff departures and ensure continuity of business and service maintenance.  Between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the representatives of sectors and other Departments they have not highlighted any areas of major concern resulting from retirements to mid-February that could not in the main be addressed through redeployment and redistribution of work.  In limited cases where critical posts have been identified in front-line services and in key policy areas they may need to be filled to meet business needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There was a great deal of public comment about what would happen in respect of the health sector where clearly people on the front line were opting to retire from the service, causing concern and anxiety that services could not be maintained.  The Cabinet sub-committee on health had a meeting with all the regional directors of service who have signed off on plans for each individual hospital.  In regard to the issues that arise from week to week, at weekends and issues that had not even been contemplated they have all signed off on their plans.  I am pleased to say that full co-operation and flexibility has been shown under the Croke Park agreement by medical teams, clinical teams and nursing staff for which we should be very grateful.</P>
        <P>In the education area arrangements are in place for managing the impact of the retirement of teachers, some of whom have been replaced.  Retiring teachers of State examination classes can be re-employed until the end of the school year.  That is because teachers obviously form a bond with their pupils in the junior and leaving certificate classes and it is important that not be disrupted in the study structure of students as they prepare for the junior and leaving certificate examinations.  The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, has been reconfigured into eight rather than ten regions, resulting in the suppression of two regional director posts.  In third level, universities and the higher education institutions manage the <Col N="32"/>retirements at the end of February in these institutions in the overall context of managing within the ceilings that have been allocated to them.  The same applies in the case of the Garda, prisons, other State Departments, the courts and the Judiciary.  Each Minister has an important responsibility in working with the groups on the ground to ensure pressure points are dealt with and relieved in the best way possible.  Those are the up-to-date figures I have got.  Given that a small number of people change their minds at the last minute that may impact on some of those figures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply which is very informative.  However, my questions were specifically about the transition teams he announced.  To the best of my recollection he did not mention them in the course of that very detailed response to my question.  In terms of the crisis in the health service I dealt with the case of a 96 year old lady who was on a trolley for three days in Beaumont Hospital.  She was still on the trolley until I asked my office to intervene and, God knows, she could still be there.</P>
        <P>The reason we are asking these questions is to try to get the Government working better and to keep it accountable.  I raised earlier the issue of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and so on.  I have here the question and answer that we dealt with on 23 November.  There is something wrong with a Government which gives a specific commitment both in meeting the leaders of the Opposition and coming forward with a request for a commission of inquiry, with which the Taoiseach agreed in opposition and clearly has done nothing about.  To say he is still waiting for a response from the Attorney General from November until March on the back of 17 years of campaigning by the people involved shows the Government is not functioning properly.</P>
        <P>Question No. 8, which the Taoiseach dealt with in response to the questions from Teachta Martin, asks about the notion of the implementation of the programme for Government and how he is trying to change his Department in order that it becomes a Cabinet office.  Are there plans to bring forward reports assessing the progress made on implementation and how is the House informed about these matters?  Without wishing to be hankering on this issue, I have raised it four or five times and have been given more or less the same answers.  That shows a failure of government.  I know it is not deliberate or malicious and that the Taoiseach is genuine and regards this as a serious issue that needs to be dealt with but what dsyfunctionality in government prevents this from proceeding?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no dysfunctionality within the Government.  I expect to launch tomorrow the report on implementation of the programme for Government to date.  A number of the major measures committed to in the programme by both parties have been put in place or are in train.  The Deputy will be aware the programme is for a five year period.  Ministers are also dealing with a range of serious issues not contained in the programme, some of which are legislative matters, while others arose and had to be dealt with.  Completion of work not committed to in the programme will be reflected in the next report.  The report I intend to launch tomorrow will detail the actionable measures relevant to each Minister which have been delivered, cannot be delivered or remain to be dealt with into the future.</P>
        <P>The Deputy has said the Government has not responded to requests for the establishment of a commission of inquiry.  He will be aware that a referendum was held on the issue of Oireachtas committees being given the power to investigate matters of public importance, which clearly this matter is.  However, the people did not agree, as is their right.  It may well be that they were not given adequate time or sufficient information to absorb what was involved.  As stated, this would have been an appropriate matter for an Oireachtas committee to investigate in the public interest.  The Minister for Health has sought the advice of the Attorney <Col N="33"/>General on how to proceed.  When that advice is to hand, I will make it known to the Deputy and everyone else, including Deputies from the area concerned.  In view of the sensitivity attached to and importance of this matter to so many, we must consider how best to proceed in the circumstances.  I await the advice of the Attorney General and ask the Deputy to be patient for a little while longer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>It is not an issue on the agenda.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>It is related to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It has nothing to do with the questions tabled by the Deputy.  I have been very lenient.  If Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin gives way, I will allow the Deputy to ask one more question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin for giving way and will be brief.  The questions I asked on this issue were asked following the referendum and I can quote them if the Taoiseach wishes.  He gave a commitment that the Minister for Health would meet the people involved, but that has not happened.  He also gave a commitment that he would meet me, as well as other Opposition leaders.  He told us previously that there was funding in place when there was not.  However, he has rectified that today and told us he was working on that assumption.  These are genuine issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to have meetings for the sake of it.  I would like there to be a purpose and a conclusion to a meeting, following which we could move on.  It might be in everyone&rsquo;s interest to await the advice of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office on this matter.  As I said, I had expected that we would be able, following the reversal of the Abbeylara case decision, to have an Oireachtas investigation into this matter of public importance.  However, that is not now possible.  We must consider what is the best thing to do in the interests of those to whom the Deputy referred who feel hurt, rightly so, at what happened in these horrific cases.  From that point of view, I will inform the House and Deputies from the north east as soon as the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice is to hand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s response on this issue is disingenuous, given the commission of inquiry legislation which is on the Statute Book which was used effectively in the Cloyne and Dublin inquiries.  I would never have thought an Oireachtas inquiry would be suitable in this case.  There is ample scope under the existing commission of inquiry legislation to investigate issues such as this professionally and effectively.  </P>
        <P>On the issue of early retirements, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, spent much of last year praising himself for revolutionising the public sector and strategically planning everything.  In reality, there has been a complete failure to prepare strategically in terms of having contingency plans in place to cover vital services.  I would appreciate an explanation of why transition teams were an after-thought.</P>
        <P>It is clear the commitment to slim down the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department to a British-style Cabinet Office has been abandoned.  If anything, the Department is growing.  The Taoiseach has stated the number of staff in his Department will grow to over 200 during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Union.  In this regard, he has used the baseline figure for 2008, which is becoming a habit.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s staff are good at news managment and spinning, which is admirable from a particular vantage point.</P>

	<P>I said at the time of the appointment of the new Secretary General that the Department would be reformed into a coherent, cohesive, responsive and efficient Department, which it is.  The Deputy will appreciate, having served as a Minister in an important Ministry when Ireland last held the Presidency, that it is necessary to recruit temporary staff to deal with Presidency matters during the first half of next year.  A great deal of work in that regard is under way.</P>
        <P>When in Brussels last week I attended the first tripartite social interaction meeting between the Danish Presidency, the Cypriot Presidency and the Irish Presidency.  The meeting was also attended by representatives of the trade unions of Europe and employer and business interests.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 to 14, inclusive, together.  </P>
        <P>On Thursday, 9 February I attended the Invest in Ireland Roundtable in New York organised and hosted by President Bill Clinton.  I am deeply grateful to him for his commitment and efforts to support Ireland as the Government intensifies its national recovery efforts.  He promised his assistance to Ireland at the Global Irish Economic Forum held in Dublin Castle last October and delivered on this commitment in New York through top level engagement with a range of US investors and companies.  This presented a significant opportunity for the Government to highlight improved investment opportunities in Ireland for existing US investors and leading US executives who do not yet have a substantial business interest here.</P>
        <P>One clear message from the Invest in Ireland event hosted by President Clinton was that existing investors had faith in Ireland and the Irish people and our capacity to bring about economic recovery.  More generally, there was an acknowledgement that Ireland represents a highly attractive investment opportunity and I expect that over the coming period, IDA Ireland will follow up closely on all the contacts made.</P>
        <P>The investment round table was followed by a broader Invest in Ireland forum that was hosted by me, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton.  President Clinton also attended and addressed this audience.  I briefed members of the Global Irish Network and other friends of Ireland on the round table&rsquo;s outcomes and we discussed further opportunities for deepening economic links between Ireland and the United States.  The response again was excellent and I commend all those involved in the Global Irish Network on their ongoing support.</P>
        <P>The following week I returned to the United States for a series of further engagements that represented further opportunities to promote Ireland as a place of excellence in which to invest and do business.  I also attended a function in aid of the Children&rsquo;s Medical and Research Foundation.  Between 15 and 17 February, I visited New York and Boston, where I met more business and political leaders, senior executives of IDA client companies and senior tourism representatives.  My key messages were that Ireland is indeed open for business, that the economic strengths which attracted foreign direct investment in the past, in particular from the United States, are even more attractive at present and there never has been a better time for US companies to invest in Ireland and its people, whether they are IDA client companies that already have a presence here and are considering expansion or companies that may be considering investing here for the first time.  During my visit, I had meetings in both New York and Boston with senior executives of a number of companies that already have significant investments in Ireland and which employ nearly 10,000 people between them.</P><Col N="36"/>
        <P>In New York, I had a meeting with Mayor Bloomberg in City Hall.  I also attended the launch of Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s new marketing campaign and met many senior tourism trade representatives who will be marketing Ireland to their client base across the United States.  I visited Governor Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, and during our meeting I took the opportunity of inviting him to lead a trade mission to Ireland.  I attended a dinner hosted by the American Ireland Fund at which I met a number of senior executives of companies that are leaders in the financial services industry and other sectors.  I also attended a business breakfast hosted by the Irish American Partnership and addressed an audience at an event hosted by Enterprise Ireland for business contacts and clients in Boston and the wider Massachusetts area, including companies in the life sciences, ICT, software and financial services industries.  My visits to New York and Boston continued the theme of the Invest in Ireland round table and forum, namely, now is the time to invest in Ireland.  Similar to the round table event, I was greatly encouraged by the positive responses I received about Ireland and the potential for future investment.  In addition to the economic and business focus of my visits, I took the opportunity of my first visit to Boston as Taoiseach to meet the Irish-American community there and to address students at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government on the theme of reasserting Ireland&rsquo;s place in the world.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to ensure that clear and positive messages are conveyed directly to key business and political interests in the United States.  It also will use the unique global opportunity of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day to bring these messages to a wider audience both within the United States and in all our key global markets, namely, now is the time to invest in Ireland&rsquo;s recovery and that we are open for business.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To which venue does the Deputy refer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the Working Abroad Expo.  Quite a few people commented to me about it and I made a special effort to watch a news clip on it.  It was graphic testimony to what is happening in this country in that 5,000 or more, mainly young, people were queueing up to find out whether they could get work elsewhere.  It is a sign of where we are and of the great haemorrhage of our youth.  That said, it shows up both the challenge facing us and the failure of austerity.  However, I wish to especially commend the work the Taoiseach has done in the United States.  It is a good initiative that I support fully and warmly commend.  I also commend and thank President Clinton for his efforts.</P>
        <P>However, because the diaspora thinks and cares about home, there are other ways to get them to connect to us.  Perhaps the Taoiseach has had the opportunity to raise the possibilities offered by the proposed constitutional convention.  I have made this point previously and have written to the Taoiseach in this regard.  The diaspora wants to see the country back on track and wishes to be involved in its recovery.  There is a perfect opportunity to involve the diaspora in this regard in order that we are not always simply asking them to do things.  Instead, there is an opportunity to give them their rights as citizens to vote in presidential elections and so <Col N="37"/>on.  I note these are rights enjoyed by citizens of other states.  I acknowledge the Taoiseach will have the opportunity to so do around St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day but did he raise the issue of Pat Finucane with anyone as he had promised?  He had stated he would raise this issue in the United States.  Did the Taoiseach have the opportunity and did he raise these two matters?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for his comments regarding the interaction with American business and politics.  I also saw the pictures on television showing people who attended the aforementioned expo at the RDS.  It is disheartening to see people there, particularly those who are in their 30s and mid-40s, who may be married with families but where unemployment has hit either one or both partners and for whom it is very difficult to make ends meet.  This is part of the critical issue faced by the Government and when we get our own public finances in order, clearly we will have more money to invest in important social services such as schools, health or whatever.  However, I make the point that I recently visited Cork, where I met representatives of a number of important firms there who informed me there are 800 vacancies in that region for information technology people.  Moreover, there are 4,000 vacancies nationwide in the information technology sector.  Similarly, I spoke to someone last week who seeks 100 fluent German speakers but such people are not available with the requisite fluency level.  This problem was highlighted to me by the French representative at the recent Tripartite Social Summit for Growth and Employment, who told me that although they have 50,000 vacancies in southern France, they do not have the skill mix to meet them.  We need an opportunity to discuss these issues rationally in Ireland because the manner in which F&Aacute;S used to be structured meant that while it did some good work in a number of areas, it is clear that where people sought particular competencies, they were not always available.  In this sense, the change from F&Aacute;S to the Department of Education and Skills and the Pathways to Work programme published by the Government hold enormous potential.</P>
        <P>I met someone yesterday who has &euro;2 million on the order books and who is seeking money from the bank but the latter has stated it needs that person&rsquo;s house as collateral.  This example demonstrates we must have a functioning banking system, which is the reason it is important to bring on stream the legislation for partial loan credit guarantees and the micro-finance agency as effectively as possible.  There is nothing wrong in stating we have the wrong skill mix in places.  Moreover, there are sectors &mdash; not enough, obviously &mdash; in which jobs should be filled but those who would fill them are not available from our own resources.  This is the reason I commend the Minister for Education and Skills on the range of conversion courses he has put in place.  In this context, when we launched the Pathways to Work strategy in the Liberties, it was interesting to talk to people who had been graphic designers, architectural technicians, construction workers or administrative back-up staff but who are changing their career pattern completely with digital training and everything to which that world leads.  I have a sense of optimism and hope in this regard.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste and I this week will launch the opportunity for the diaspora to be involved in a global sense in the potential for job creation here in Ireland.  I believe the Deputy will find this to be a highly exciting and imaginative proposal, which will be made into a reality, and which came from an entrepreneur here in Ireland.  The Deputy will find it to be significant as it will give an opportunity to those who are emigrants abroad or have businesses abroad.  One should remember there are 80,000 people employed in Irish-run companies in the United States who may have ideas about job creation here.  We will give them this facility, in a digital global sense, to participate in this regard.  We discussed the constitutional convention last week and we will have a further meeting on it soon.</P>
        <P>I did not raise the issue of the late Pat Finucane when I was in the United States.  Most of the meetings in which I was involved related to either business alone or business and politics. <Col N="38"/> I will return to the United States for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and I will take the opportunity to raise the matter at that stage in the political forum in which it should be raised.  I did not raise it on my recent visit because I was more concerned with dealing with issues such as the economy, our reputational status and the opportunities that exist in respect of investing in Ireland.</P>
        <P>President Clinton pointed out that in view of the current demographic in this country &mdash; namely, the fact that so many of the population are young &mdash; and the potential that exists here, people should give serious consideration to investing in Ireland.  Our tax system, talent pool, technological capacity and track record offer an unbeatable package to investors.  This package is another reason there is a continuing and strong line of investment from the US &mdash; which I welcome &mdash; on the part of companies such as PayPal, Ely Lilly, Allergan, etc.  It is also responsible for interest being expressed by the Vice President of China.  The latter will probably lead the Chinese people, of whom there are approximately 1.4 billion, at some point in the foreseeable future.  The Vice President&rsquo;s visit to Ireland was of exceptional significance internationally, particularly as ours was the only country in Europe he visited on his journey home to China.  We hope to follow up on what happened last month with a series of visits to China by, for example, Ministers with responsibility for education, the agri sector, jobs and innovation.  I hope to take up the Vice President&rsquo;s invitation to visit China at the end of this month.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the comments the Taoiseach repeatedly made in the United States to the effect that the 2011 budget has been central to restoring international confidence in Ireland.  I accept that it would be too much to expect the Taoiseach to acknowledge the fact that he voted and then ran an election campaign against that budget.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the deep connections which have been built up over the years with major US investors remain strong and were central to many of the key investment decisions that have been taken?  In essence, the foreign direct investment strategy that has been pursued for many years continues to ensure a solid pipeline of inward investment, once the fundamentals relating to corporation taxation, structure, skills and the overall environment for facilitating the conduct of business and industry are right.  PayPal, for example, has been operating here for some time and I was delighted with Eli Lilly&rsquo;s recent announcement.  The latter also made an announcement of this nature in 2006.  I ask the Taoiseach to clarify the position but it seems these and other major US investors involved in producing pharmaceuticals, medical devices and technology remain committed to Ireland.  Notwithstanding issues which may arise from time to time, the companies to which I refer tend to comment very favourably on their experience in this country.  In particular, they tend to comment strongly on the quality of the skillsets among those who work in the industries to which I refer.  In the area of the pharmaceuticals industry and in the context of the relationship with the US Food and Drug Administration, FDA, a strong record of compliance has proven to be a key factor in our continuing to attract major investment.  Such investments have been made notwithstanding the challenges which the industry faces.</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach outline what happened at his meeting with the Global Irish Network, a body I established some years ago?  There are key individuals on this network who can help us, particularly in respect of the financial services and other sectors of the economy.</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate if he engaged in discussions with personnel, either political or business, in the United States in respect of the proposals of President Obama and his Administration to alter their country&rsquo;s treatment of the foreign earnings of corporations?  Was that matter raised during his visit and did he comment on it?  What are the indications emanating from the White House in respect of this proposal?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="39"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that the connections which have been in place for so many years, be they in the areas of art, literature, music, politics, business, economics or trade, remain very strong.  I recognise that the process relating to foreign direct investment from the United States has evolved from one where we attracted companies which produced computer hardware to a model where a great deal of computer software is now developed and produced here.  Ireland provides both an English-speaking launch pad into Europe and a strong legal base.  The Deputy is well aware of this and I recognise his association with helping to develop the process to which I refer.  As an agency, IDA Ireland has been superb &mdash; in the face of intense worldwide competition for investment &mdash; in continuing to promote the structures, environment and skills which exist in this country.  In that context, I refer again to the package of the four T&rsquo;s &mdash; technology, tax, talent and track record &mdash; and the importance thereof.</P>
        <P>The chief executive of a major company based in California informed me that it sited its European operations in Dublin not just because of the common language, the corporation tax rate or the fact that this is a young and vibrant city but rather as a result of the passion of young people for their work.  He further stated that it is their desire to be able to create the future and to be challenged in doing so, which makes them stand out from any of their peers across the globe.  I am sure the Deputy will agree this is something of which we, as Irish citizens, can be very proud.</P>
        <P>This morning the Government dealt with the issue of a number of US companies here which traditionally have been able to operate their accounting systems without having extra charges imposed on them by means of double accounting systems.  The facility that exists in this regard has been extended.</P>
        <P>Deputy Martin established the Global Irish Network, which is an important entity.  We hope the network will evolve and change to reflect the new circumstances that exist in the US.  President Obama&rsquo;s proposals in respect of tax did not emerge until after my visit to America.  During the meetings we had, we asked the business people we met to prove how serious they are with regard to what they are doing in Ireland.  A number of questions arose with regard to stability in the context of our 12.5% rate of corporation tax.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government has been very clear in respect of this matter.  There will be no movement in respect of the rate, which is transparent across the board and which gives rise to an actual effective rate of 11.9%.  It is clear that American companies in particular welcome certainty, decisiveness and horizons against which they can plan their business.  What we had to say on this matter was very much acceptable to and very much accepted by them.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, this is an election year in the United States.  The representatives from a number of companies which are big players in America and which have operations in Ireland also understand that fact.  They are aware that if the US Administration were to follow through on its proposals in respect of tax, the process that would have to be undergone would be both long and tortuous.  When he visited this country last year, President Obama informed me that while the recommendation was being made, he wanted to make it clear that even if the Administration were to follow through on it, the process relating to it would be very long.</P>
        <P>During my visit to the US there was some discussion on the corporation tax rate but the main focus was on the fact that Ireland is very much seen as a country about which people are positive and in which they find it beneficial to invest.  We hope to keep the link to which Deputy Martin refers very much alive and to be vibrant and energetic about our work in this regard.  We inform those in business in the United States and beyond of the decisions being taken by the Government to assist the business sector here.  I found the interaction with those involved in business and politics in the US extremely stimulating in the context of their interest in Ireland as a destination for continued investment in the future.  The latter is extremely <Col N="40"/>important, not only with regard to the jobs directly created as a result of such investment but also in the context of the knock-on effect for small and medium enterprises here which can provide supplies and facilities for the companies involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>On skills availability and the 800 placements in the institutes of technology &mdash; a matter to which reference has been made for the past five or six months &mdash; there are a number of ready-made solutions.  It is time for a more hands-on approach from the institutes of technology and the Department of Social Protection to match people with skills.  There are people with qualifications who cannot get jobs and there is a mismatch somewhere between the industry on one hand, where there are indications of vacancies that cannot be filled, and people coming to us saying they cannot get a job.</P>
        <P>We had this issue before and more than a decade ago we set up a task force for technicians, for example, which involved companies, institutes of technology and the long-term unemployed.  We prepared an 18 month programme which got these people off the dole queues and into secure jobs.  With a hands-on approach, this could be rectified fairly quickly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with this.  The Deputy would be aware that there were occasions in the past when a company would seek a forklift driver but would be sent a painter or somebody in an entirely different trade.  It is a case for the personnel working in the new sectors, both in the Department of Education and Skills in so far as training is concerned, and in the Department of Social Protection where the categories, competencies and experiences of people are known.  They must match these elements.</P>
        <P>It is most unfortunate when people say they have looked for a job for two or five years and there is nothing for that person.  As the Deputy has correctly noted, if they are asked about experience, competencies and what they would like to do, they can be directed to upskilling or a change of direction.  It is a case of being imaginative and responsive to the human resources that exist.  Rather than referring to this as a live register issue or the number of people unemployed &mdash; that figure is way too high &mdash; we should consider the resource of people available for employment.  I hope that under the new Pathways to Work scheme and training facility in the Department of Education and Skills, the matches can be attained far more quickly.  As the Deputy knows, a job can transform a life and bring a whole new change of attitude and confidence.  That is where we must focus our energy and activity for the period ahead.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I once again warmly endorse the work being done in the US and it is a matter of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s judgment what issues he wants to raise.  Having said that, it is disappointing that he did not get the opportunity to raise the Pat Finucane case.  I find that sometimes these matters do not have to be raised publicly, especially if dealing with people who might not necessarily be involved in politics.  It can also be done quietly on the side, which sometimes works as well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach, uniquely, will have the opportunity on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day to meet President Obama, the US Secretary of State and the leaders in the Senate and the House of Representatives.  He will meet leaders in the labour movement, the arts and business across a spectrum of opinion in the US.  Geraldine Finucane, who is Pat Finucane&rsquo;s widow, will also be in the US at that time to campaign, as she has done for over 20 years.  I suggest this as an opportunity for the Taoiseach to raise this matter very publicly.</P>
        <P>There is also the issue of the so-called illegals, the Irish people who, through no fault of their own, have ended up in the US with no status.  We have just referred to at least 100,000 people <Col N="41"/>who have left this country during the Taoiseach&rsquo;s time in the Government.  I was in the North on Sunday and there are many other issues of concern there which could usefully be raised.  I can drop a note to the Taoiseach on those matters, if that would be helpful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>One must judge when to raise matters like this.  It was not appropriate in the circumstances in which I found myself to raise a matter like the Pat Finucane case in a mixture of business and politics, as it would have been of considerable interest to the political side but not to the business side.  These parties would have told the story of investment in Ireland or heard of the opportunities that exist here.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, when I met Geraldine Finucane and her family in Belfast, I undertook to raise this matter when I got the opportunity.  I will do so because, as I have said to the Deputy and others in the House on many occasions, at Weston Park the agreement was that irrespective of what Judge Cory would decide, the two Governments would act.  In this jurisdiction, the Smithwick tribunal was set up following the judgment.  Judge Cory made a clear recommendation that there should be a public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.  I have a difference of opinion with the British Prime Minister on this and, as the Deputy knows, he has appointed a Queen&rsquo;s Counsel to consider the matter.  When I met Geraldine Finucane and her family, I undertook to raise this with political representatives in the United States, and I will do so.</P>
        <P>With regard to the undocumented, I had a good meeting with representatives of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform in New York.  I also spoke to Senators McConnell and Brown from Boston and I met Senator John Kerry.  I spoke to Governor Deval Patrick, who is a close acquaintance of President Obama, about the matter.  The Deputy is aware of the efforts being made by Senator Schumer and others.  There are two Bills going through the legislative process currently, one from the Democratic side and one from the Republican side.  The Democratic end has been sort of cleared but neither side can put this through because they need assistance from each other.  Clearly, there are political considerations between New York and Boston and, from a Democratic perspective, the holder of the Senate position in Boston.</P>
        <P>There is much conversation and activity between both sides and there is an agreement that it could get through but it would need support from both sides.  As I have pointed out, it is not for Ireland to interfere in the wrong place but we would greatly encourage the Senators in putting through this proposition.  That would only deal with E3 visas, that is, people who may go to the US in future.  Neither Bill going through Congress deals with the limbo in which the undocumented find themselves now.  We have discussed that on a number of occasions.  As it is a year for presidential elections, I cannot see anything happening of any great significance in respect of the undocumented as it feeds to a much bigger problem for undocumented and illegals from other countries.  That brings with it its own political sensitivities, particularly in the southern states in America.</P>
        <P>We are very happy to engage with the Irish groups and American politicians in encouraging this work.  While I hope that a conclusion can be brought in respect of future E3 visas &mdash; that is a good proposition &mdash; we will have to revisit after the presidential elections the question of the undocumented, not only for Ireland but other countries as well.</P>

There has been a consistent and sustained campaign by Labour Party Members of Government to misrepresent the origins of this strategy.  The Taoiseach knows well it has been his party&rsquo;s policy for many years to sell State assets to fund the NewERA plan.  Will the Taoiseach confirm whether he will be available in the Chamber on Thursday to explain this to his Labour Party colleagues?  Will he consider making more time available to discuss this issue?

I hope it will come before the House in four or five weeks but I cannot give the Deputy an accurate date.  I wish to point out to the Irish Hotels Federation that the Government is well aware of the infrastructure that exists for quality tourism in the country.  This is why the PRSI rate was reduced and VAT was reduced in the hospitality sector.  We hope events such as the tall ships, the Volvo race and the Titanic centenary celebrations in Cork will add immeasurably to this.  Next year we will have The Gathering which has enormous potential to bring back people to the homeland.

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>Deputy Seamus Kirk</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter.  The end of the month, 31 March, is looming for many hard working, progressive dairy farmers throughout the country.  Unfortunately, a hefty milk quota super-levy bill is also looking for them because of the inflexible position within the industry.  As Deputies representing rural constituencies will be aware, the milk quota regime is due to be phased out between now and 2015 and while a minor transitional arrangement is in place to cater for it, it is clearly inadequate.  The previous Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, introduced the Food Harvest 2020 strategy, which set ambitious targets for the dairy industry.  Dairy farmers who are in the process of expanding their operations now find that they have to tailor production to meet the strict milk quota limits.  At a time when the industry is reasonably buoyant, with the potential to help our export statistics, dairy farmers find themselves seriously constrained by the prospect of a penal super-levy bill.  I would have thought progress could be made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on a bilateral arrangement with the United Kingdom.  This issue has been raised in the House from time to time, certainly in the past 12 months or so.  It is quite ironic that there is probably unused super-levy quota on this island &mdash; in Northern Ireland <Col N="50"/>&mdash; which should be available to dairy farmers south of the Border, but it is not.  I ask the Minister to initiate a concerted effort, now that we are well into the month of March and coming to the end of the market season, to prevail on the Commission to agree, even just for this year, to a bilateral arrangement under which unused quota in the North of Ireland would be made available to help our hard-pressed farmers who are on the edge as far as production is concerned.  There is no logical reason we cannot have a bilateral arrangement with the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>At a time when the economy could benefit from a lift in primary production such as in the dairy sector, this seems an obvious area in which to introduce an initiative.  It could help the economy, dairy farmers and the industry in general.  I am glad the Minister is in the House to deal with this issue because I am sure he appreciates, on a personal level, the serious difficulties being faced by farmers.  I await his answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue which is indeed topical.  During the past 12 months my Department and I have been active in raising the question of an adjustment to the milk quota regime at political, official and Commission level and have made determined efforts to secure a soft landing for all member states in the lead-up to milk quota abolition in 2015.  I have discussed the matter extensively with other EU agriculture Ministers, including in bilateral meetings with my Danish, French, German, Estonian and UK counterparts.  Furthermore, officials from my Department have raised the issue at every available opportunity at appropriate EU meetings in the past eight months or so and at bilateral meetings with other member states.  </P>
        <P>Among the options discussed with regard to a soft landing were the front-loading of the remaining quota increases between now and 2015, a reduction in super-levy fines, a further reduction in butterfat correction levels and a EU flexi-milk arrangement which would operate provided EU production overall was within quota.  Most attention was focused on butterfat correction.  In December a coalition of member states involving Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium and Cyprus formally put a specific proposal to the Special Committee on Agriculture for an adjustment to the butterfat correction mechanism.  That would have given us flexibility of about 1.5% in our quota.  Unfortunately, the Commission has consistently resisted attempts to reconsider this issue, as it has resisted attempts to revisit the outcome of the 2008 CAP health check agreement in an overall sense.  This is something to which the previous Government signed up, but, unfortunately, it has not worked out.</P>
        <P>The extent of the difficulties in terms of the potential for super-levy fines this year was confirmed today on the front of the Farming section of the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  It was reported that Copa-Cogeca had secured agreement on a common position calling for a reduction in butterfat adjustment levels.  It seems, however, that this is not the case; unfortunately, the report is not accurate, according to my information.</P>
        <P>It is important to address the particular question the Deputy asked.  This is not the first time I have addressed it, as he has spoken on this issue before.  If we had been able to establish a bilateral arrangement with the United Kingdom under which we could use unused quota from Northern Ireland, we would have done it months ago.  Unfortunately, however, such an arrangement cannot be made between member states.  We have an agreed health check policy that was supposed to provide a soft landing for countries in advance of 2015, but it is certainly not achieving this for at least five countries within the European Union.  We will have a review of that soft landing policy towards the end of the year which the Commission will be facilitating and I will have an opportunity to raise all these issues again.  In the meantime, we are trying to achieve agreement on a butterfat correction which would at least allow some flexibility and <Col N="51"/>help to keep us within quota, but it has not been possible to get agreement on it either, mainly because France and Germany are opposed to it.</P>
        <P>In terms of lobbying, there is a need to put together a strong coalition in order that the concerns of countries such as Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium and Cyprus, with a number of others, are taken seriously.  If it were as easy as simply saying, &ldquo;Farmers in the UK are not using their full quota, and we need more quota, so we can just take some of theirs,&rdquo; we would have done this long ago.  Unfortunately, it is not legally possible to do it.  As much as many of us in this House would like Northern Ireland to be part of the Republic of Ireland, it is not.  It is considered to be a separate jurisdiction and countries cannot transfer national quota across borders.  I would like us to be able to do this, but it is not possible.  I will continue to raise this issue &mdash; in fact, at my next Council meeting I intend to raise it under the heading of any other business &mdash; and we will continue to push for more flexibility.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will finish on this point.  Farmers must take responsibility for themselves in the meantime.  At the end of 2011 they were just under quota, but there is a significant danger that if they produce as much milk in the first three months of this year as they did last year, they will be significantly over quota and super-levy fines will be applied at 28 cent a litre.  This is a significant fine for any dairy farmer who is over quota.  I caution farmers to continue to do what they have been doing, that is, to act responsibly to try to remain within quota.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>Deputy Seamus Kirk</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is right in saying Deputies have raised this issue a number of times in the House.  That it has been raised is a reflection of the fact that constituents are asking what is being done about the matter and whether progress cannot be made on it.  They find it hard to comprehend unused quota down the road cannot be transferred.  In the case of my constituency of Louth it may well be that there are dairy farms in the next county with unused quota.  Farmers cannot comprehend the position that quota cannot be transferred, given that Ireland and the United Kingdom are within the same economic zone in the European Union.</P>
        <P>I am looking at this issue from the point of view of the transitional arrangements between now and 2015.  There is no question but that the economy could benefit from the significant exports represented by even a 5% or 10% increase in milk production in Ireland.  I am sure the Minister for Finance would very much appreciate the increased revenue and also the improved balance of trade statistics.  There is a demand on the world market for this product and we do need a transitional arrangement.  There is no point in saying that today, in March 2012, we can have a production level of such and such, as in two years time the production level is expected to be increased.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is exactly what the last Government signed up to.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>Deputy Seamus Kirk</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the nature of the dairy industry, it is not going to work.  We need a realistic transitional arrangement.  I am not expecting the European Union to just open the floodgates and allow us to produce milk <i>ad infinitum</i>, but we need a transitional arrangement to allow the industry to expand on an orderly, planned basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to take a political view, but the milk health check was signed up to by the previous Government to achieve what the Deputy would like to see, a soft landing in the transition from a quota to a non-quota system.  With the benefit of hind<Col N="52"/>sight, it has not worked.  It does not matter at this stage whose fault that is, we must change it and I will try to do that.  The Deputy has been in politics a long time; he knows we cannot just order the European Commission to do something.  There must be agreement among a qualified majority of member states for a change to a health check that was voted through and agreed by everyone.</P>
        <P>In the Commission&rsquo;s eyes, the Republic of Ireland availing of excess quota in Northern Ireland is no different from Luxembourg using excess Belgian quota.  Unfortunately, it sees it as two different jurisdictions.  I must impress on my colleagues at the Council of Ministers that the soft landing is not working and a number of countries support that position.  Unfortunately there are not yet enough to have a blocking minority to force a change of policy.  The Commission says if we want to raise this issue, it is up to member states to do it and we are doing that at every possible opportunity.</P>
        <P>I would like Ireland to have the capacity to slowly increase milk production between now and 2015 in order that we do not have a situation where we are operating within the reins of a quota system that just gets released after April 2015, resulting in a 15% to 18% increase over a 12 month period in the volumes of milk produced in Ireland.  Supply problems would result from that in terms of dealing with that increased quantity and there is potential for price problems as a result of that significant increase, which is not in anyone&rsquo;s interest across the EU.  We need a transition where there is a gradual increase in the volume of milk produced across the European Union in countries that want to produce more and we should be able to facilitate that at a time when the EU quota for milk is about 5% to 7% under quota.</P>
        <P>Five countries were fined last year for being over their quota; Ireland was just under.  I hope this year we will be just under again but farmers must behave responsibly for the remaining weeks for that to happen.  In the meantime, we will continue to work politically to find ways to be more flexible and change the soft landing approach between now and 2015, using the review mechanism at the end of the year to do that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelHarrington"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Harrington</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will be aware of the issues involved and I support him in his efforts to have this situation in the north-east Atlantic mackerel fishery resolved as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The Faroe Islands and Iceland have a share of north-eastern Atlantic quota for mackerel that was agreed between the nations and the EU at 6% of the total allowable catch in the north-east Atlantic.  Unfortunately, they are now harvesting a further 300,000 tonnes per annum over and above the agreement, 45% of the TAC in this fishery, or six times the agreed allowance.  Putting that in context, the Irish mackerel quota is about 68,000 tones.</P>
        <P>The mackerel fishery is worth &euro;125 million in a &euro;1 billion fishing industry.  It is a cause of huge concern for the present industry and, if it continues, the danger exists that the sustainable mackerel stock will be wiped out in the north-east Atlantic because of overfishing by these two nations.  The breach of the fisheries agreements may cost the Irish fishing industry between &euro;10 million and &euro;15 million in potential TAC adjustments.  Abusing the quotas in this way by breaking all international agreements on mackerel quotas can be regarded only as modern day piracy.</P>
        <P>This abuse illustrates an irresponsible and barefaced disregard for the rules set down by the European Union, Faroe Islands and Iceland.  This cannot be allowed to go unchecked.  If states feel there is no fall-out from breaches of this nature, what incentive is there for them to stay within the guidelines?  The situation is detrimental for Irish fishermen.</P><Col N="53"/>
        <P>Last year I called for the resolution of this matter and, in the absence of progress, the adopting of sanctions against the Faroe Islands and Iceland, beginning with trade sanctions at the least.  I am now asking the Minister to consider further measures, including the possible suspension of accession talks with Iceland.  Five rounds of talks have taken place in the past two years in Clonakilty, London, Brussels, Norway and Iceland but so far very little progress has been made.  A sixth round of talks is scheduled for the next ten days and there should be no further trade-off on this issue.  It is a smash and grab on limited fish stocks by two countries that have overfished their traditional fishing grounds by ignoring traditional conservation methods.  They are taking 1,000 tonnes per day more than they should from sensitive and finely balanced and managed fish stocks.  I have called for sanctions to be imposed on these countries since December and I understand the Minister will also press for immediate and hard sanctions against these countries.</P>
        <P>An EU-sponsored fish factory is being built on the Faroe Islands capable of processing 1,000 tonnes per day.  It is regrettable that negotiations conducted by the Commission are treated with scepticism by Irish fishermen because they are worried about the resolve of the Commission.  We need a strong approach to this.</P>
        <P>We are entering a new troika on 1 July in advance of Ireland&rsquo;s assumption of the EU Presidency on 1 January 2013.  In the next 12 months we will have some power to bring these negotiations to a speedy conclusion, hopefully before we assume the Presidency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  It will not come as news to him that this has caused me a great deal of concern.  Mackerel is the most valuable fish stock for the Irish fishing fleet and prices for it are at an all time high, between &euro;1,400 and &euro;2,000 per tonne.  After Scotland, Ireland has the second highest quota of mackerel to catch in the European Union in the waters referred to here. Mackerel, therefore, is the most important fish stock for our industry.  The stock we rely upon is being damaged significantly by irresponsible and arguably illegal fishing by two countries, Iceland and the Faroe Islands.</P>
        <P>I do not say that lightly.  This has been going on for some time.  The European Union has tried, with Norway, because there is an arrangement between the EU, Norway, the Faroe Islands and Iceland, to manage this mackerel stock in a sustainable way.  This has been one of the great success stories of European fisheries because we have seen the fish stock grow and many people in Ireland have made a living out of catching it, but we are now seeing an ignoring of a sustainable management system for this stock.</P>
        <P>It is true to say mackerel stocks in western waters have moved north into Faroese and Icelandic waters.  We must negotiate a fair quota settlement with those countries.  Unfortunately, however, what has happened is that there has been no sign of a willingness, particularly from the Faroe Islands but also, more recently, from Iceland, to do any sort of a reasonable deal with the European Union and Norway and, as a result, nearly half of the entire mackerel stock is being caught in Icelandic and Faroese waters, despite the fact that combined, they had less than 6% of the agreed quota until recently.  Now, both of these countries catch more fish than Ireland, the second largest of the European countries in terms of this stock.</P>
        <P>The European Union must show some teeth.  Iceland is in the process of looking for EU accession.  I hope it is successful in that regard.  However, I believe the mackerel issue needs to be resolved to the satisfaction of all the countries concerned, including Iceland, before the fisheries chapter of that accession process opens.  We have to come to a conclusion in terms of quota allocation with the Faroe Islands.  It seems the view that is being taken politically is that in the absence of an agreement, fishermen should physically catch as much fish as they possibly can until such an agreement is forced on them.  Both Iceland and the Faroe Islands are catching <Col N="54"/>more than 150,000 tonnes of this stock, which is way above sustainable levels.  Some time ago, I requested at Council of Ministers level that we introduce a mechanism whereby trade sanctions could be imposed against Iceland and the Faroe Islands in relation to fish and fish products.  The European Commission and other member states agreed with me.  The Commission has come up with a mechanism whereby that can be done.  I will push it to use that mechanism to force a much more serious negotiation between the member states and the associated states that are doing so much damage to a valuable stock that we have all worked hard to protect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelHarrington"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Harrington</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response.  We are aware the Minister and the officials in his Department are taking this issue seriously.  He has brought the matter to the European Commission with great force.  The EU fisheries industry is not entirely clean in this regard, regrettably, as these breaches are being supported by vessels that departed the EU fisheries register to help the Icelandic and Faroese industries to process large amounts of fish.  They do not have the capacity to process such amounts of fish without the help of individual companies within the EU.  It is regrettable that they are being facilitated by EU companies.  It will complicate issues when the negotiations mentioned by the Minister take place.  I am very hopeful that the Commission will show its teeth when it uses this process and this instrument to propose sanctions against Iceland and the Faroe Islands.  I hope the Commission will force those countries to honour the fisheries agreements into which they have entered.</P>
        <P>It has to be noted that Iceland has form in this regard.  I imagine that Irish people looked on with great glee when Iceland took on the UK in the cod wars of the 1950s and 1970s.  Now that we are the victims of what is happening in Iceland, it is not as funny anymore.  People in this country looked on nonchalantly and thought it was okay when Iceland took on our neighbours across the water in the UK and virtually wiped out fishing towns like Grimsby and Hull.  We are now being directly affected by Iceland&rsquo;s efforts to uphold what it sees as its rights.  As the Minister quite rightly said, Iceland agreed to total allowable catches to support and enhance sustainable fisheries for future generations.  That agreement was reached not just in the interests of Iceland and the Faroe Islands, but also in the interests of Ireland, Scotland and the rest of the EU.  If the agreement is not defended, our coastal communities will suffer as a direct result, unfortunately.  I commend the Minister on his approach to this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">For the purposes of clarity, I would like to inform the House of what the proposed sanctions entail.  The European Commission has proposed a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council which would allow for the introduction of trade sanctions against third countries that engage in irresponsible or illegal fishing activities which may lead to the depletion of EU fish stocks.  The sanctions proposed would include restrictions on the importation into the EU of fish and fishery products from offending states, restrictions on the use of EU ports by vessels from offending states, prohibition on the sale and purchase of fishing vessels between EU member states and offending states and prohibition of trade agreements between nationals of an EU member state and nationals of offending states.  It could be argued that we should go even further.</P>
        <P>I am not the kind of politician who calls for trade sanctions against countries that have a lot in common with Ireland.  These countries, like Ireland, are islands in the north Atlantic.  I hope Iceland successfully joins the EU at some stage in the future.  I hope we will be able to work with Iceland on a series of issues of mutual interest and concern.  Iceland and the Faroe Islands are acting irresponsibly on this issue.  They are damaging a hugely valuable stock.  In my view, they are threatening the viability of our fishing industry, which has worked hard to protect and rebuild this stock.  We should respond in a way that is consistent with the responsible management of a valuable stock.  The EU needs to show a bit of muscle, in terms of its scale, on this <Col N="55"/>issue.  Unfortunately, we are currently facilitating the causing of significant damage to a valuable fish stock, which is the heartbeat of the Irish fishing industry, particularly in the north west and south west.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EricJByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Eric Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a bit rich to be required to say in two minutes what politicians have been speaking about for 16 years.  I want to recall a debate in which I was intimately involved as a member of the board of Crumlin Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  I recall vividly a debate about the national tertiary paediatric hospital.  I am acutely aware that the board threw its weight behind the concept of moving to a single site.  The refusal by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to grant permission for the proposed new hospital will have horrendous ramifications.  My heart goes out to the parents and children who have been desperately waiting for a national paediatric hospital for many years.  I appeal to the Minister not to panic in the face of what has happened.  If we rush into a new decision to build a hospital on a lesser scale, we could end up with an incorrect development.</P>
        <P>I remember the debate in Crumlin when we bought into the McKinsey report.  The nine key criteria points were of crucial importance.  I am acutely aware that the consultants and specialists in Crumlin &mdash; given that Crumlin is essentially this country&rsquo;s national tertiary paediatric hospital, they are the foremost specialists in the country &mdash; threw their bodies and souls behind the complex negotiations and took part in the internal planning processes that resulted in the scale of the hospital that eventually emerged.  I ask the Minister to cautiously recognise that in the past, the input of the Crumlin authorities has been instrumental in facilitating this development.  If my senses are right, I believe they would have severe reservations about any downscaling of the project to which they contributed in recent years.</P>
        <P>I am calling on the Minister to carefully consider co-locating an acute general hospital, as set out in the initial criteria, with a paediatric hospital and the Coombe hospital.  A potential site for such a hospital exists as a result of the failure to develop the Bailey Gibson site, the Player Wills site and the St. Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens area.  It is exciting that we could have the tri-location of an acute adult hospital, a paediatric hospital and a maternity hospital at this site.  I appeal to the Minister to consider that.  Perhaps he will engage with the boards of management of St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and Crumlin Children&rsquo;s Hospital, as well as the Dublin City Council planners, on the possibility of redeveloping the Coombe site.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcConalogue"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a two-pronged issue.  We need to discuss the delays in the development of a national children&rsquo;s hospital and the reduction in bed capacity at the children&rsquo;s hospitals that are currently operating as a result of the cutbacks introduced by the Government.</P>
        <P>A total of 25 beds in Crumlin and ten beds in Temple Street are closed due to budget cuts, forcing children to wait longer to be admitted to a ward and forcing them to stay longer than they should in emergency departments.  Overall, 60% of children on inpatient waiting lists are there for more than three months, 50% of children on day case waiting lists are there for more than three months, while 2,500 children are on the waiting list for elective or day treatments.  That is the situation at our children&rsquo;s hospitals.  They are not operating to capacity because the Minister is restricting their budgets.</P>
        <P>One year into the Minister&rsquo;s tenure, we are further behind than ever in respect of the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  Today he moves on to his second review of that hospital.  Only last week, <Col N="56"/>in response to An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s decision, I heard him talk about more grandiose elements of the children&rsquo;s hospital.  He has been in his job for a year.  If he felt that some elements of the children&rsquo;s hospital were grandiose, why did he not address them after he came to office?  If it is the case, following the first review, that the Minister said that the Mater Hospital is the right site for the hospital, why has he said in the newspapers this week that he is not sure where he wants to place it?  If it was the right site this time last year when he entered office, why is he not looking to amend the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act in order that he can proceed with it and ensure we do not wait any longer than we have done for a hospital that befits the health needs of our children?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  The provision of a national paediatric hospital is the most sensitive issue facing us.  We have been talking about this since 1998.  We have had the McKinsey report and last year the international expert group reported to the Minister, recommending co-location on the Mater site.  We now find that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has rejected that on aesthetic grounds and on the grounds of overdevelopment on the Mater site itself.</P>
        <P>I would like to ask one or two questions in the context of the terms of reference for the group that has been established which state that it is to inform itself about planning considerations and processes affecting this project.  Can the group enter discussions with An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  Can the group possibly look at amending legislation to allow for the Houses for the Oireachtas to look at this particular project in the context of the Mater Hospital site?  This is due in part to the McKinsey report, but more importantly due to the international expert group which stated last year that the Mater was the most suitable site.</P>
        <P>There is much concern.  Other hospitals and other interest groups will come on board again to say that one site is more suitable than the other, and we will have this debate over and over again.  The Minister states that it will 56 days before the group, under the chairmanship of Mr. Frank Dolphin, reports back to him.  How quickly thereafter does the Minister expect to be in a position to make a decision on this critical infrastructure in order that we can have it completed for 2016?  Everyone would like to adhere to that target in order that we can pass a national children&rsquo;s hospital onto the next generation 100 years after the Easter Rising.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>In the last 24 hours, I have spoken to Professor Michael O&rsquo;Keeffe in Temple Street and Dr. Orla Franklin in Crumlin.  Both are pretty horrified at the situation they are facing.  Professor O&rsquo;Keeffe was at pains to point out that he feels the hospital is being penalised for being too efficient and too effective, and that it had too many operations last year.  He states that it will be forced to have 1,500 fewer operations this year, yet if a child is waiting 20 weeks for an operation, the hospital is liable to be fined &euro;25,000.  He is really frustrated with the bureaucracy.  He states that there are too many officers and not enough soldiers, and that we need more people to roll their sleeves up and see patients.</P>
        <P>Dr. Orla Franklin is presiding over a hospital in Crumlin that she claims is falling down.  It got a brilliant intensive care unit a couple of years ago, but cardiac and cancer care are causing great problems and the hospital does not have the necessary facilities.  There is no doubt that a new children&rsquo;s hospital will be great, but Dr. Franklin makes the point that it is for children who are not even born yet.  It will be great when it is built, but what about children who are alive today?  There are huge problems in Crumlin with infection.  The hospital does not have an infection-free environment due to the amount of room sharing that must occur with children, along with parents sleeping on the floors.  She stated that bad things are happening to Irish children due to sub-standard facilities.  Surely we can do better than this.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="57"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies opposite for their intentions in raising this.  There is no doubt that this is a key facility for the well-being of our children and that it is absolutely necessary.  I thank Deputy Eric Byrne for his comments and would like to reassure him that there is absolutely no panic, nor is there a need for panic, but there is a need for expediency and a sense of urgency.  That certainly is the case.</P>
        <P>I am committed to providing the best possible health service for our children and their families.  I want this to be delivered through a new national children&rsquo;s hospital, where tertiary and acute services can be provided from one site.  Immediately following the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to refuse planning permission for the national children&rsquo;s hospital, I announced my intention to establish a group to review the implications of the decision.</P>
        <P>The Government today agreed the terms of reference for the review group.  These are to inform itself about the planning considerations and processes affecting this project; to consider the different options which now exist for progressing the construction of a national children&rsquo;s hospital having regard to Government policy on the delivery of health services, including accessibility and paediatric services in particular and best clinical practice considerations, the cost and value for money considerations of the different options, the likely timelines associated with the different options, and the implementation risks associated with the different options; to advise me, in the light of these considerations, on the appropriate next steps to take with a view to ensuring a national paediatric hospital can be constructed with minimal delay; and to report to me within 56 days of the first meeting of the group.</P>
        <P>Currently the three Dublin children&rsquo;s hospitals work together as a unified network under the clinical leadership of Dr. Colm Costigan to ensure optimisation of resources and facilities.  The hospitals are fully aware of the challenges facing their young patients and of the need to support families.  Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin has been experiencing a surge in attendances to its emergency department and a corresponding increase in admissions through that department.  The clinical director, Dr. Colm Costigan, is a joint appointment across all three hospitals.  When individual hospitals are under pressure, he clinically reviews patients and, where necessary, redeploys patients across the hospitals to minimise impacts on elective surgery.</P>
        <P>The regional director of operations in the HSE has met the clinical director and Ronan O&rsquo;Sullivan, professor of paediatric emergency medicine.  They have organised hospital site visits and are formulating an agreed approach to deal with the seasonal peak in paediatric emergency medicine.  The HSE has taken steps to provide as high a level of protection as possible for the funding of the children&rsquo;s hospitals.  The budget adjustment to both Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin and the Children&rsquo;s University Hospital, Temple Street was significantly less than the average in the HSE Dublin mid-Leinster service plan for 2012.  The HSE management are in discussions with the Children&rsquo;s University Hospital, Temple Street towards agreeing a cost containment plan and will meet representatives of that hospital next week to discuss the plan further.</P>
        <P>The HSE service plan for 2012 has set a target for children&rsquo;s hospitals requiring that no child should be waiting for treatment for more than 20 weeks by the end 2012.  The Children&rsquo;s University Hospital, Temple Street is actively engaged with the HSE, the special delivery unit and the National Treatment Purchase Fund to ensure that this target is met.  Discussions with the hospital have been positive and are ongoing.</P>
        <P>I have emphasised the need to ensure that the impact of any changes to patients is minimised, and that all changes are fully communicated.  All measures will be reviewed regularly by the hospital management team to ensure the least impact on patients and service users.  Patient safety remains our first priority.</P><Col N="58"/>
        <P>I reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to the construction of a new children&rsquo;s hospital.  I am committed to the principle of co-location with an adult hospital, but I know that others may have a different view.  I will await the completion of the work of the review group.  One thing is clear: I am determined to deliver a national children&rsquo;s hospital for the children of this country.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response, but I would like to ask him some personal and pertinent questions.  Would he wish to express a view on the concept of a tri-located hospital?</P>
        <P>We were always mystified in Crumlin because we had a great relationship with the Coombe Women&rsquo;s Hospital in keeping premature babies alive who required very intricate surgery very early on in their lives that a maternity hospital was not the preferred option in terms of co-location.  Will the assessment criteria proposed in the McKinsey report, Children&rsquo;s Health First, in 2006 be used in reviewing An Bord Plean&aacute;la tragic rejection of the current site?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcConalogue"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unacceptable that we have been waiting this long for a national children&rsquo;s hospital.  We should have seen its construction before now.  It is also unacceptable that the Minister is a year later launching his second review.  He must take responsibility in that regard.  If he had conducted such a review a year ago, perhaps we might be further ahead.  The reality is that he made a decision to proceed with the hospital on the Mater Hospital site.  If in his view it was the correct location this time last year, why is he not willing to proceed with it now on it?</P>
        <P>The Minister has not answered my questions about &mdash; to use his own language &mdash; the more &ldquo;grandiose&rdquo; aspects of the project.  What exactly were the grandiose aspects of it?  If he Minister considered they were an unnecessary luxury, why did he not intervene before now?</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, we are a year into the Minister&rsquo;s tenure and there is even more overcrowding in the children&rsquo;s hospital and, unfortunately, we are further behind in the delivery of a national children&rsquo;s hospital.  I ask the Minister to address these questions.</P>

	<P>In the context of the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to adhere to best international medical and clinical advice that there be co-location with an adult teaching hospital, the terms of reference of the review group under the chairmanship of Dr. Frank Dolphin in assessing various sites do not refer to this as being sacrosanct.  Clearly, if best international practice, based on the McKinsey report and the report that the Minister himself commissioned last year, is that there be co-location with an adult teaching hospital to secure the best clinical outcomes, should this not have been included in the terms of reference to ensure the review group can only look at sites where co-location is an the option, as opposed to greenfield sites?  Are we limiting the potential to provide a world-class co-located facility by not even mentioning this in the group&rsquo;s terms of reference in the context of seeking the best clinical outcomes in the provision of paediatric care?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>No matter what the Minister does, there is little doubt but that the new hospital is further down the road.

The children of today deserve a better deal in <Col N="59"/>Crumlin and Temple Street.  We need to spend money on these hospitals because provision of the new hospital is a while away.</P>

Having a maternity hospital co-located with an adult and a paediatric hospital would make sense and the Mater Hospital site allowed have allowed for this to happen.  However, I want to make it clear that everything is on the table.</P>

	<P>I am sorry, but that will not wash with me or the public.</P>
        <P>We were advised by the expert group, the recommendation of which at the time was that it be located on the Mater Hospital site.  The planners have decided otherwise.  We have put together a group to report within 56 days of its first meeting on the best route forward.  The main concern must be building a new facility for children in order that they can receive the best treatment in the best environment.</P>
        <P>Deputy Mick Wallace mentioned several persons.  I put it to him that even Professor Michael O&rsquo;Keeffe has spoken about the fact that he gets more work done in one day in a private setting than he does in a week in the public sector.  There are significant efficiencies capable of being achieved within the public sector in how we use theatres &mdash; the productive theatre initiative &mdash; <Col N="60"/>and much progress has been made.  I compliment Professor O&rsquo;Keeffe on having one of the shortest waiting lists and doing Trojan work, but I cannot agree that children will go blind or die from brain tumours because operations will not be carried out in time.  Urgent adult and children cancer cases are treated first as a matter of priority, which is the way it should be.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to developing a national paediatric hospital in order that children can receive the best care in the best environment.  We will look at all the options put to us by the review group.  I look forward to receiving its report within 56 days of its first meeting.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Small blood spot samples are collected from all Irish children in infancy via the heel-prick test.  These samples number 1.6 million since 1984.  There has been controversy in the past few years because of the lack of a formal written consent process for the analysis and storage of residual samples.  This has led the Data Protection Commissioner to call for the samples to be destroyed.  The call for sample destruction has been prompted by the lack of consent for sample retention and concerns about protecting the privacy of the individual.</P>
        <P>While there is little doubt that the taking and storing of samples without consent are no longer acceptable, it must be recognised that the destruction of older samples will result in the loss of a valuable national resource.  The blood samples have the potential to be used to form a national DNA database, in respect of which one critically important aspect is sudden cardiac death.  Up to 100 young people in Ireland die suddenly and unexpectedly each year and the cause is unidentifiable.  Based on estimates of the prevalence of sudden cardiac death in Ireland and on foot of a New Zealand research study, it is estimated that up to 170 samples could provide vital information for individuals and families prone to sudden cardiac death.  This would mean 170 families potentially could have access to preventive treatment to reduce the trauma faced by many on foot of an unexplained sudden death when, for example, a young person drops dead on a football pitch.</P>
        <P>It would not only be helpful in the case of sudden cardiac deaths.  It would also have the potential to help researchers to identify genetic conditions and develop treatments, even cures.  This covers the full range of genetic diseases ranging from rare diseases, including cystic fibrosis, from which 17 Irish children under the age of five die every week, to more common diseases such as multiple sclerosis and cancer.  Thousands of individuals and families could benefit in giving researchers access to this valuable bio-bank.</P>
        <P>There would be non-medical benefits also.  There would be massive benefits in using the bio-bank to confirm identities in the cases of missing persons, as Ireland is one of the few countries in the world which does not have a national identity card.</P>
        <P>In September last year the New Zealand Government announced a new legislative process to protect and preserve indefinitely blood spot cards in New Zealand by way of a clear legislative framework that would include a formal written consent process, information packages for consenting parents and legal limitations on how the samples were to be used.  The Data Protection Commissioner has taken the strictest possible interpretation, even when it is not benefiting society or the individuals in question.  Surveys have shown that the public overwhelmingly supports medical data being used for this type of research.  By all means, introduce an opt-out clause for individuals or parents who have concerns.  Surely such a clause could be introduced to address the concerns raised by the Data Protection Commissioner, while, at the same time, <Col N="61"/>protecting society and individuals in regard to the genetic diseases that can be identified and treated in order to save lives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  In late 2009 the Data Protection Commissioner received a complaint from a member of the public about the retention of newborn screening cards.  The basis of the complaint which was upheld by the Data Protection Commissioner was that the newborn screening cards should not be retained indefinitely without consent as this constituted a breach of the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003.</P>
        <P>During 2010 a number of meetings were convened with the deputy Data Protection Commissioner and representatives of the HSE, the Department of Health and the Children&rsquo;s University Hospital, Temple Street.  A policy was agreed in conjunction with the Data Protection Commissioner to address both the legislative and ethical requirements of the national newborn screening programme which included disposal of archived newborn screening cards older than ten years.</P>
        <P>Following receipt of representations concerning the proposed destruction of archived newborn screening cards, I requested the HSE to conduct a review of this decision.  The review examined both the legal and ethical basis for the retention of newborn screening cards and the potential use of the existing cards for research purposes.  It is my understanding the review group examined the governance arrangements for the retention and use of newborn screening cards in a variety of jurisdictions, including New Zealand, Australia and the United States.  As the Deputy may be aware, legal uncertainties over access to and use of newborn screening cards have led to the destruction of cards in Western Australia, Texas and the Netherlands.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report and recommendations of the review group were submitted to my office in January.  Having carefully considered the issue, I have accepted the recommendation of the review group that, in order to meet our legal and ethical responsibilities, newborn screening cards older than ten years will be destroyed.  However, I fully recognise the value of this material for research purposes, as outlined by the Deputy, which was why the review group was tasked with exploring ways in which the material could be made available to the research community in a way that was compatible with our ethical and legal obligations.  The international consensus clearly favours seeking explicit consent from an individual and-or his or her parent-guardian for use of previously collected biological material for research purposes.  Therefore, in the interests of facilitating research, the HSE will mount an information campaign offering members of the public the opportunity to have their screening cards returned to them, prior to destruction of the cards taking place.  This will ensure those who wish to donate their or their child&rsquo;s newborn screening card to research will be afforded the opportunity to do so.</P>
        <P>The proposed course of action seeks to ensure public trust and a continued willingness to participate in the national newborn screening programme, which is a vital public health measure for children and their families.  Given the complexities of this issue and being mindful of the genuine sensitivities of those concerned, I am anxious for the findings of the review group to be published.  I will arrange for my Department to liaise with the HSE to have this done as a matter of priority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his reply which is at least moving to try to deal with the concerns I have raised.  I ask that we try to find a mechanism, in so far as is possible, to explain to individuals clearly the potential uses to which this very valuable bio-bank could be put, not just for themselves but for society as a whole.  This would mean that, unless someone had a real and genuine concern, such blood samples would be offered for medical research.  As I said, the public very much believes such research should be facilitated.</P><Col N="62"/>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister ensure the report is published in full immediately?  Extracts from it were published in one of the national newspapers last Saturday.  It is important, therefore, that the full report be placed in the public domain as soon as possible in order that we can have a full and open public debate in advance of any option being given to the public in order that it can be fully aware of the concerns raised.</P>
        <P>Has a full assessment been carried out as part of the report of the potential uses to which such a bio-bank could be put?  I note with interest that last Saturday, the day this issue was raised in the newspaper, members of the Roscommon football team were undergoing cardiac screening.  It is unbelievable that, on the one hand, we are trying to screen young people and, on the other, there is a very large databank in place that could be used in ensuring every single young person in the country was screened for this and many other conditions.  However, we cannot access it at this time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There are plans for us to communicate with and ask people for their consent, which is only right, proper, legal, ethical and moral.  It is not right to collect biological information without someone&rsquo;s permission and it is not right to use such information for purposes other than that for which it was collected.  There will be much debate about this issue into the future as the field of genetics, including molecular genetics, continues to develop.  We have the spectre of insurance companies seeking a person&rsquo;s DNA to decide what risk he or she presents and what are the chances he or she will contract different diseases.  That is not something I would particularly relish because I could foresee people being almost uninsurable due to genetic information which, no matter how good it is, is not always 100% accurate.  It is certainly not 100% accurate in its current rudimentary stage.</P>
        <P>I will endeavour to communicate the benefits, as it is very important to do so.  I take the opportunity to advise that becoming involved in research and being part of clinical trials confers not alone access to the latest technology and medicines but also provides for a person tremendous supervision throughout his or her treatment that would not often be provided during normal treatment, given that the constraints during trials are so tight and the protocols so comprehensive.</P>
        <P>We will, of course, publish the report, as the Deputy has asked.  I believe he is right that we should have more debates on this issue and make a full assessment of the use of retained cards.  I have no doubt that, into the future, there will be even greater possibilities arising from such sources.  However, as I said, we have a legal obligation under the Data Protection Acts to ensure information, particularly biological information, is used for the purposes for which it was gathered, not for any other, unless there is express consent.  The House would agree with this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the House for agreeing to discuss the Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Bill 2012.  The Bill is needed urgently to allow Ireland to ratify the changes to the Greek loan facility to implement the new programme of assistance for Greece as agreed by the euro group finance Ministers on 20 February 2012.  The purpose of this Bill is to facilitate, in the public interest, the financial stability of the European Union and the safeguarding of the financial stability of the euro area as a whole.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As the House is aware, Greece has been beset by serious budgetary and economic problems for some time and is unable to secure international funding at sustainable rates.  In order to safeguard the financial stability of the EU and the euro area, it was agreed on foot of an intergovernmental agreement in May 2010 to provide a programme of financial assistance to Greece.  This was done by way of a bilateral loan totalling &euro;80 billion to Greece from the euro area member states in conjunction with IMF assistance of &euro;30 billion over a three-year period to mid-2013.  Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the agreement was ratified in the Euro Area Loan Facility Act 2010.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On entering our own programme of assistance in late 2010, Ireland stepped out of the Greek loan facility.  However, as an original signatory to the Greek loan facility, Ireland&rsquo;s consent is required to implement any amendment to the Greek loan facility.  The Euro Area Loan Facility Act 2010, as amended, must be further amended before Ireland can confirm acceptance of the second amendment to the Greek loan facility.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In June 2011, finance Ministers agreed with the euro group to revise the Greek loan facility.  These revisions provided for the extension of the grace period between drawdown and commencement of repayment from three to four and a half years, the extension of the maturity period for loans from five to ten years and a change in the calculation of the margin relating to loans to Greece to give it a lower interest rate.  The Commission signed the loan facility agreement for Greece on behalf of euro area member states on 14 June 2011, pending ratification by the individual euro area member states.  Ireland ratified the first amendment through the European Financial Stability and Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Act 2011, and issued formal confirmation of our agreement to the amendment with effect from 23 September 2011.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, these amendments have proved insufficient and need to be supplemented.  On 20 February 2012, euro group finance Ministers approved the new programme of assistance for Greece which includes approval of the second amendment to the Greek loan facility.  This amendment includes three elements: a further increase of the grace period, of up to ten years, for paying back the loan principal, a further lengthening of the loan maturity to a minimum of 15 years, and a further reduction in the margin to 150 basis points to apply from the three-month interest period that ended on 15 June 2011.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the ratification of these amendments to the Greek loan facility agreement.  The finalisation of the amendment, by way of signature of the European Commission <Col N="64"/>on behalf of member states and Greece, was not in place until 27 February 2012.  The Bill is thus being presented at the earliest possible date following this finalisation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All signatories to the Greek loan facility agreement have been requested to provide their acceptance to the second amendment to the chairman of the euro working group not later than 13 March 2012.  This is to ensure that the next phase of the Greek loan facility can proceed as planned for that date.  It has, therefore, been necessary to bring forward the Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Bill 2012 as a matter of urgency to ensure Ireland can confirm acceptance by that date.  It is intended to bring forward an earlier signature motion in the Seanad for the President to sign the Bill.</P>
        <P>These changes to the Greek loan facility are in conjunction with a number of other changes to the Greek programme, including additional funding of &euro;130 billion and changed private sector involvement, PSI.  A common understanding has been reached between the Greek authorities and representatives of the private sector on the general terms of the PSI exchange offer, covering all private sector bondholders.  Private sector investors are asked to accept a bond exchange providing for a nominal haircut amounting to 53.5%.  The closing date for the PSI exchange offer is 8 March.  The additional funding is also provided for interest rate support and banking sector support.  Greece and the other euro area member states agree that it is only by fully and strictly implementing the fiscal consolidation and the structural reforms included in their programme that Greece will regain competitiveness and will be able to return to markets.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for amendments to the Euro Area Loan Facility Act 2010, as amended by the European Financial Stability Facility and Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Act 2011.  The amendment Bill has four sections with the amendment of March 2012 to the loan facility agreement set out in the Schedule.  The first section provides the definitions to the legislation.  Section 2 provides for the second amendment of February 2012 to be included in the references to the Euro Area Loan Facility Act 2010, as amended by the European Financial Stability Facility and Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Act 2011.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 3 provides for the second amendment to the loan facility agreement to be inserted as Schedule 3 to European Financial Stability Facility and Euro Area Loan Facility (Amendment) Act 2011.  Section 4 sets out the Short Title of the Act.  Annex 1 contains the form of legal opinion, Annex 2 contains the amended scheduled principal repayments, and Annex 3 contains the list of contacts.  The Schedule contains the amendment of February 2012 to the loan facility agreement.  The amendment includes the three elements I have already outlined, namely, a longer grace period, a lengthening of the loan maturity, and a further reduction in the margin.</P>
        <P>Ireland provided &euro;345.7 million to Greece under the Greek loan facility before entering our EU-IMF programme, when we stepped out of the Greek loan facility.  Quarterly interest payments are being made by Greece on this.  The reduction in the interest rate chargeable on the loan under the second amendment will reduce the interest we receive each year by &euro;5.2 million, or roughly one third at current rates of interest.  We expect that this will be offset by the provision for the distribution of profits from the ECB&rsquo;s secondary market programme for Greek bonds.  A further result of the amendment is that the grace period before Greece begins to repay the principal of this loan will be extended from four and a half years to ten years.  The maturity of the loan will be extended from seven and a half years to 15 years.</P>
        <P>I look forward to a constructive debate on the Bill.  Now is a time for unity among euro area countries to ensure financial stability within the euro area.  The purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the stability of the European Union and the safeguarding of the euro area as a whole.  Ireland must play its part and stand in solidarity with its fellow euro area member states.  It is in the <Col N="65"/>interests of this country and the euro area.  Therefore, I urge Deputies to agree to ratify the changes to the Greek loan facility.</P>
        <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill.  Fianna F&aacute;il will support the legislation, not out of any great sense of conviction that the second Greek bailout deal will necessarily work either for Greece or Europe, but because we do not believe it is for the Irish Parliament to seek to block a deal for Greece which the Greek Parliament has backed and on which the euro group has signed off, especially since Ireland is not a financial contributor to the package involved in this facility.</P>
        <P>The fundamental question is whether this particular deal for Greece will work either for Greece, as a member of the eurozone, or the eurozone itself.  I am not convinced it will work and only time will tell.  I suspect it is only a matter of time before there are further crisis meetings at euro group level to deal with issues concerning the sovereign debt crisis and with Greece.  Some critical questions remain as to whether Greece has the capacity to deliver on its obligations under the second Greek bailout, in particular the tax increases, spending cuts, privatisation targets, structural reforms to the economy, public sector redundancies, wage and pension cuts.  It must be acknowledged by all that its record to date, to say the least, has not been great.  It is hoped Greece will be in a position to deliver on its commitments this time.  I suspect it will.  We all have a vested interest in the return of stability to the eurozone and in the Greek situation being dealt with in a comprehensive fashion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The second key issue is whether this bailout, if implemented, will be enough.  I wonder if the euro group believes Greece will return to borrowing on the international bond markets at the end of the second bailout.  In my view, it will not be in a position to do so.  I hope I am wrong.  However, only time will tell.  The introduction of this legislation in the House this evening comes against the backdrop of pretty grim economic data released by EUROSTAT which demonstrates that in quarter four of 2011 the eurozone economy contracted by 0.3% and Commissioner Rehn&rsquo;s confirmation today that the eurozone is back in recession.</P>
        <P>The proposal before us, which has been signed off on by euro group members and by the Greek Parliament, represents the collective wisdom of those in power in Europe that this deal is sufficient.  While it buys time for Greece and the eurozone, I suspect it will be only a matter of time before many of the issues contained in this deal will need to be revisited.</P>
        <P>The legislation we are debating today represents the latest instalment in the attempts to stabilise the crisis in Greece, which has been ongoing since 2009, and proposes to give the country breathing space to allow it recover.  While Greece, Ireland and Portugal are all in EU-IMF programmes, the origin of the crises in Greece and Ireland are very different.  In Ireland, a banking crisis precipitated a crisis in the public finances which was compounded by the collapse in the construction industry whereas in the case of the Greek, public spending was deliberately understated for years.  While Ireland stepped out of the original Greek loan facility when it became part of an EU-IMF programme in December 2010, the success of the Greek programme remains of critical importance to Ireland as it is essential to the overall stabilisation of the eurozone.  This is especially so given our reliance on an export-led recovery.</P>
        <P>By the end of 2009, as a result of a combination of global and domestic factors, namely, the world financial crisis and out of control government spending, the Greek economy faced its most severe crisis since the restoration of democracy in 1974.  As a European Union, we need to accept that attempts since then to get ahead of this crisis and put in place a range of measures that would allow Greece to get back on its feet, have been a complete and utter failure.  In truth, Greece has often acted in a manner which undermines international confidence in the <Col N="66"/>country and the wider eurozone.  In early 2010, it was revealed that successive Greek Governments had been misrepresenting the true state of the economy in order to keep it within EMU guidelines.  This allowed Greece to borrow money it simply did not have the capacity to repay.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To avert a default in May 2010, other eurozone countries and the IMF agreed to a &euro;110 billion rescue package, which included &euro;80 billion in loans from euro area member states and &euro;30 billion from the IMF.  Ireland participated in this facility.  While Greece was required to adopt harsh austerity measures to bring its deficit under control, this has understandably not met with the unquestioning acceptance of the Greek people.  Who can blame them?  The question that needs to be asked is, was it the austerity package which led ultimately to the need for a second bailout or was it an abject failure of Greece to live up to its obligations under the terms of the agreements that caused whatever investor confidence existed in the country to evaporate completely.</P>
        <P>Alongside this additional loan facility there is a write-down of debt by private sector investors.  It became increasingly obvious in recent months that this would inevitably have to be done, despite denials by European leaders for many months prior to that.  The depth of the crisis into which Greece had plunged meant there was no feasible combination of fiscal measures, namely, tax increases and expenditure cuts, which would have achieved a situation whereby Greece could fully discharge its debts.  Even during the best years for the European economy Greece ran deficits.  Its crisis is largely a public expenditure one, which has led to an enormous national debt.  Incredibly, none of the Greek banks has to date been nationalised.  The Irish crisis was largely caused by a property bubble which created massive problems in the banking system and public finances.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The inflexibility of the European Central Bank&rsquo;s approach to the banking crisis here meant that the burden of rescuing the banking sector fell predominantly on taxpayers in this country, leading to a huge increase in the outstanding Government debt.  It should be recognised that our capacity to deal with our difficulties is considerably greater than that of Greece.  We remain one of the wealthiest countries in the EU.  Our 2011 GDP<i> per capita </i>is forecast to be $39,000 &mdash; $3,000 above the eurozone average of $36,000 &mdash; while Greece&rsquo;s is forecast to be $28,000.  Of even greater importance is the manner in which our respective economies function.  We are a market-orientated economy and we have a generally vibrant traded sector. While the troika has highlighted that areas such as the legal and medical professions undoubtedly need to be opened up, we have a far more dynamic economic base as we continue our process of recovery.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the banking sector will never be allowed to return to its previous practices and it would not be desirable for the economy to ever again be so dependent on construction, we are not in need of wholesale economic reforms &mdash; certainly not of the scale facing Greece.  We need to continue to do what we do well, namely, attract foreign direct investment.  In terms of assisting indigenous exporters, we need to build on the gains to date and to give them every possible support.  </P><P Just="Left">Greece is different in that it has a general government debt level of approximately &euro;350 billion.  As a country, it is plagued by a combination of weak exports, poor tax collection and stifling bureaucracy.  The study of the Greek debt situation by the European Commission showed that its debt level was set to spiral to 200% of GDP.  I understand that the write-down in Greek debt, which accompanies this new loan facility, will bring its debt to GDP down to around 115%  before rising again to 120% by 2020.  In contrast, without a write-down, Ireland's general government debt will, according to the Government's medium-term fiscal statement, be 106% of GDP at the end of 2011.  Under the base case scenario set out in the statement, our debt to GDP will peak at 118% in 2013.</P><Col N="67"/>
        <P Just="Left">In August 2009, the OECD estimated the size of the Greek black market to be around &euro;65 billion, which is equal to 25% of its GDP.  This leaves a huge deficit in Greece&rsquo;s annual tax revenue.  Estimates put this at up to &euro;20 billion per annum.  No other European country is facing such a structural deficiency in its ability to levy and collect taxes.  By contrast, the Irish Revenue Commissioners estimate that the Irish black economy is approximately 13% of GDP.  While this is in itself a cause for deep concern it highlights that the Greek situation has been made considerably worse by its failure to put in place an effective tax collection mechanism.  I suggest it would be a worthwhile exercise for the European Commission to engage in a community-wide assessment of how the black economy throughout Europe can be tackled.  In an increasingly globalised world, there is an obvious need to maximise the sharing of information and to apply best practice across borders.  In addition, reforms of the Greek economy which have long been talked about need to be put in place immediately.  While I spoke against the German suggestion that Brussels appoint a proconsul to Athens to run Greece&rsquo;s affairs as this would be profoundly undemocratic in nature, I believe there is a need for very close monitoring of the implementation of the commitments Greece has given.  Clearly, implementation will be fundamental in this case.  Greece is set to benefit from a one-off debt reduction, but it will be months or, possibly, years before we will be able to discern its full effects on the Greek economy.  While a second bailout and a write-down have become inevitable because of the state to which Greece has fallen, it is not a strategy without considerable risks.  It is not one that Ireland should follow; assuming sensible policies are pursued that can stimulate economic growth, Ireland can emerge from the crisis and pay its sovereign debts in full.</P>
        <P>It is important to draw a distinction between sovereign debt issued by the Exchequer and bank debt.  Ireland should continue to seek to reduce the net cost of its bank recapitalisation.  The comments made by the IMF on Friday on the Government&rsquo;s efforts to renegotiate the promissory note structure with our European partners are highly significant.  They offer the Government a clear window of opportunity that must be seized to secure a reduction of the overall burden in recapitalising the banking sector.  In the public manner in which it was expressed, this support had not been offered previously, although all Members will have understood the IMF to have been supportive of Ireland, both in respect of burden sharing and the redesign of the promissory note structure.  However, unless this opportunity is taken now, particularly given the repayment of &euro;3.1 billion due on 31 March, it may not present itself again.  I genuinely wish the Government well in its efforts to negotiate a redesign of the promissory note structure that will deliver a genuine reduction in the bank debt Ireland must pay.</P>
        <P>The position within the Greek banks is worth noting.  According to its Ministry of Finance this week, bank deposits in Greece have fallen by approximately &euro;70 billion since the start of the crisis in 2009 and this trend is accelerating.  Approximately &euro;16 billion of the funds withdrawn were transferred abroad, mostly to the United Kingdom.  However, the rest either has been spent or is being hoarded in cash by households preparing for the worst case scenario of a Greek exit from the euro.  What is extraordinary at this stage is that no losses have been imposed on the senior bondholders in Greek banks, despite burden sharing of 70% by private sector investors in Greek public debt.  This highlights the absurdity of the strategy imposed by the ECB, although this lack of burden sharing may well change, given the write-down of the sovereign bonds held.  Three years into the crisis the European Union still does not have a common agreed framework for winding down insolvent banks and avoiding all costs falling on the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>In addition to the loan package being put in place under the terms of the euro area loan facility, there is an urgent need for investment in the Greek economy which is underdeveloped in comparison with other European countries.  Originally the Greek Government aimed to raise approximately &euro;50 billion by 2020 from privatisations by selling land, utilities, ports, airports <Col N="68"/>and mining rights, but recently this target has been revised downwards substantially because of the worsening economic position.  While some of these proceeds inevitably must be used to pay down debt, there is a strong case for allowing Greece to use some of the funds to refocus its economy in a way that ultimately would allow it to grow its way out of its problems.</P>
        <P>Apart from tourism, Greece has few sources of foreign earnings.  There is a minimal indigenous export sector and it has a poor record in attracting foreign direct investment.  This may be a legacy from its relatively recent return to democracy, although in more recent times the reputational damage it has inflicted on itself certainly must have deterred overseas investors who were considering investing in the Greek economy.  I suggest the European Investment Bank, EIB, should have a much expanded role to play in this regard.  The EIB was established as a policy-driven bank to support the European Union&rsquo;s priority objectives, especially European integration and the development of economically weak regions.  For the fiscal year 2009 it approved approximately &euro;104 billion in various loan products, of which &euro;93.6 billion was within EU and EFTA member states, with the remainder dispersed between so-called &ldquo;partner countries&rdquo;.  Solidarity between member states is a key founding principle within the European Union.  If Greece is serious about meeting its commitments, as I believe it is, as a community we must put our money where our mouth is and not simply lend Greece the money it needs to keep ticking over and pay its remaining debts.  We must work to ensure it has a sustainable economic platform on which to build its recovery and the wider eurozone recovery.</P>
        <P>Although the European Investment Bank should be at the forefront of bolstering the Greek economy, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, EBRD, established during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Union in 1990, also could have a role to play.  While its mission was to support the formerly communist countries in the process of establishing their private sectors, the scale of the Greek crisis and the underdeveloped nature of its economy mean that Greece needs all the sources of help it possibly can find.  The EBRD has been particularly successful in supporting the building of self-sustaining market economies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish the Government and all of the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues at Eurogroup and ECOFIN level well as they seek to build an economic recovery across Europe.  The statistics released by EUROSTAT today were deeply disappointing and confirm the scale of the challenge that lies ahead both for the European Union and Ireland as a country heavily reliant on its exports.  Given the stagnant market into which many Irish exports are being sent, this creates difficulties for Ireland and makes it all the more important to develop new markets in the emerging economies.  I note that during the debate on the Finance Bill Members discussed some measures that were designed to stimulate support for the indigenous sector, in particular, as it sought to develop markets in new and emerging economies.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the remainder of the debate on the Bill.  Fianna F&aacute;il will support it, even though, as I stated, we are not convinced this is a permanent resolution of the issues concerned.  However, given that it has been given the support of our European partners and domestic backing by Greek politicians, one must give it a go and hope it will have the desired effect.</P>

        <P>The problems in Greece, as well as in Portugal, Ireland and Spain, are not just domestic in origin.  They are a consequence of policy failures at domestic and European level.  This means that responsibility for the crisis must be borne at domestic and European level.  Unfortunately, the approach of the European Union and, in particular, the European Central Bank, ECB, has been to punish the Greek people for failures for which they are partly responsible.  Such an approach is not only unfair, it is also destined to fail.  For evidence of this failure one need only consider the bailout package agreed between the troika and the Greek Government last month.  In 2010, when the eurozone crisis first gripped Greece, that beleaguered country secured emergency funding of &euro;110 billion.  In return, it was obliged to increase taxes, cut social spending and dramatically reduce the size of the public sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The scale of the austerity foisted on the people of Greece was of a level unimaginable in most other European countries.  The figures speak for themselves.  By the end of 2011, 21% of Greek people were officially out of work and almost 50% of young people were jobless.  The level of homelessness had increased by 25% and poverty by 28%.  One in five people living in poverty could only afford meals with meat every second day.  The Athens suicide hotline reported that the number of calls it received had doubled to 5,000 in 2011.  In conjunction with this human hardship, all the economic indicators were revealing that the austerity programme was not working.  Greece remained locked out of the bond markets and its government debt continued to spiral out of control.  According to every available social and economic indicator, the first Greek bailout was not working.  Did this provoke critical reflection on the part of Greek and European politicians and policy makers?  Did anyone in power ask if the reason the first bailout was not working was it was so badly designed?  The answer is clearly not.  Just as those in power blamed the Greek people for the crisis, they were now blaming them for the failure of the first bailout programme.</P><Col N="70"/>
        <P>Almost two years after the first austerity programme for Greece, we are being asked to approve a second such programme which is based on exactly the same policies which gave rise to the former.  The scale of the emergency funding being made available, some &euro;130 billion, is even greater than that for the first programme.  The chances of the second programme being successful are even lower than for the first programme.  Another 30,000 jobs are to be culled from the public sector in Greece, modest pensions are to be cut by 20%, the minimum wage is to be lowered, taxes on low and middle income earners are to rise dramatically for the second year in a row and state assets to the value of &euro;50 billion are to be sold off.  All of these measures will further damage Greece&rsquo;s economy and its society.  They will lead to increases in unemployment and poverty which, in turn, will further depress the economy.  This will make a return to economic growth impossible in the medium term.</P>
        <P>One of the most obvious aspects of the first bailout programme was the failure to restrain the spiralling level of government debt.  Following months of difficult negotiations, private sector lenders, including some European banks, are to write off 53.5% of the money owed to them by the Greek Government.  However, the deal on this debt write-down has yet to be concluded and remains fraught with difficulties.  Many commentators believe that even if banks fully participate in the write-down, Greece still will not manage to lower its debt to below 120% of GDP.  Meanwhile, the Greek Government must bring forward a plan for the recapitalisation of the country&rsquo;s banks.  The cost of this recapitalisation remains unknown.  There is little doubt that the Greek people are being punished for the failure of their own politicians and that of political leaders across the European Union.</P>
        <P>The deal we are effectively being asked to endorse will mean more hardship for ordinary Greek citizens.  It will give rise to further unemployment and poverty and further assaults on the incomes and living standards of those already unable to cope with the cost of the first bailout.  We are informed that this is the necessary price which must be paid to fix the broken Greek economy, that it is the harsh medicine required to cure the sick Greek patient.  Unfortunately, even a cursory examination of the bailout programme demonstrates that this is not the case.</P>
        <P>Let us consider the position on tax reform, for example.  While the austerity programmes being heaped on the Greek people  dramatically increased tax revenue by &euro;2.32 billion in 2011 and will increase it by a further &euro;3.38 billion in 2012 and 2013, they do nothing to redistribute the tax burden in a fair way.  Tax evasion and avoidance will continue among the very wealthy.  A recent article in <i>Der Spiegel</i>, the German current affairs magazine, indicated that in Greece &ldquo;it is mainly a small wealthy class that manages to cheat the authorities out of &euro;40 billion in tax each year&rdquo;.  Nothing in the second bailout programme will address this issue.  Rather, the burden of increased taxation will fall on low and middle income earners, pushing them further into poverty, while also further depressing consumer demand and blocking economic recovery.</P>
        <P>The conditions attached to the second Greek bailout are a mistake.  They are bad for the people of Greece, the Greek economy and the eurozone.  While the Bill before the House does not detail these conditions, supporting it means giving our consent to them.  As a result of the conditions to which I refer, the loans being provided will not solve the structural problems blocking Greece&rsquo;s return to economic stability, nor will they assist in bringing stability to the eurozone.  Only this morning the Austrian Chancellor, Werner Faymann, said Greece would probably need a third bailout in the coming years.  Separately, a leaked troika report which was seen by the German magazine <i>Der Spiegel</i> indicates that Greece may need a further &euro;50 billion in 2015.  In itself, this is an admission that the austerity programme we are being asked to endorse is doomed to failure.</P><Col N="71"/>
        <P Just="Left">Everything I have stated proves the point that Sinn F&eacute;in has been right all along in this House since 2008, namely, that the approach taken by the Government and those across Europe is not working.  Austerity does not work.  One cannot cut and tax one&rsquo;s way out of a recession, let alone the type of debt crisis with which we are faced.  The continued human tragedy and economic catastrophe in Greece are evidence of this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is an urgent need for a new approach across the European Union which must be based on investment in growth, real debt write-downs and a real cleansing of the European banking system.  Investment in jobs is urgently required in the eurozone, particularly in those countries on its periphery.  This can be achieved by combining the resources of member states &mdash; in our case this would be the &euro;5.4 billion in the discretionary portfolio of the National Pensions Reserve Fund &mdash; with an enlarged investment fund in the European Investment Bank.  The existing funds of that bank should be supplemented by a one-off investment on the part of EU member states on a proportional basis.  This would be made not as fiscal transfers between states but rather in the form of sound investments that would provide sound returns.</P>
        <P>In addition, the matching funding criteria for member states should be amended to a 75:25 ratio, with the European Investment Bank providing the larger portion.  With this enlarged fund, the European Investment Bank would work in partnership with those member states experiencing severe recession to roll out major projects in order to generate employment, increase competitiveness and improve the social and economic infrastructure.  This would, in turn, lead to both immediate and long-term economic growth.  In the first instance, this EU-wide investment programme would aim to kick-start those economies experiencing recession and assist them in reducing their deficits.  An enlarged European Investment Bank working with member state governments would not only provide assistance in dealing with the immediate problem of under-investment, it would also help to address the underlying imbalances in the eurozone between those member states with excessive surpluses and those with excessive deficits.</P>
        <P>In parallel with this major investment programme, there is a need to reduce the debt burden of certain member states.  I refer, in particular, to Greece and Ireland which have unsustainable levels of debt.  This can only be achieved by writing down a portion of the debt held by the sovereigns.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, this could be done by writing down debts that were originally banking debts, while continuing to honour real sovereign debt.  In the first instance, this would require lifting the obligation on the State and the taxpayer in respect of the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note.  This could be achieved by agreement with the ECB and would reduce our debt to GDP ratio by up to 20%.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There is also an urgent need to cleanse the banking system of the as yet undisclosed and unquantified toxic assets on balance sheets.  This could only be done by imposing rigorous stress tests, including not only in respect of banks&rsquo; loan books but also their exposure to sovereign debt and all special purpose vehicles used for toxic assets such as credit default swaps and collateralised debt obligations.  These new stress tests should be followed by a process of writing down portions of the banks&rsquo; toxic debts and deleveraging assets in order to refocus the banking system on the needs of the real economy.  Only after such a process should the European Central Bank provide any capital required for the recapitalisation of the cleansed banks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sinn F&eacute;in will not be supporting the Bill.  Whereas some will argue that it is a demonstration of solidarity with the people of Greece, the opposite is the case.  The emergency funding being provided for Greece comes with conditions attached that are nothing short of an assault on the economic and social well being of the Greek people.</P>

	<P>In essence we are talking about a managed default position, where the establishment throughout Europe has understood that what was posed for Greece, given the scale of the debt, amounted to a disorderly default position.  It did not want to envisage such a scenario and so the debt was rescheduled in the manner before us today, with a scheme for extending the period for repayments in return for a second bailout.  The key point to register is that this was not just granted and is not a benevolent move.  What is being demanded in payment for this deal is a package of so-called reforms that are akin to unleashing the fires of hell on the population of Greece.</P>
        <P>This scenario has been compared to the position in Latin America in the second half of the 1980s and it is strongly reminiscent in many ways of the Brady plan implemented in that area.  We saw how that plan played a significant role both in defending bankers&rsquo; interests on the one hand and imposing permanent austerity on the other.  The plan for Greece essentially does the same thing by reducing the value of debt stocks, which will be swapped for new bonds, with private banks reducing their exposure to Greece, as they have done previously with Latin America.  Gradually but massively, the public creditors, including the likes of our friends in the troika, will take over and exert enormous pressure in order to ensure the new bonds held by the banks are repaid in full with interest on capital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should register that every cent of the so-called loans to Greece will be used to repay its debts.  Meanwhile, the troika is demanding permanent austerity in the form of social expenditure cuts, massive privatisation, regression in economic and social rights and other actions that we have not seen since the end of the Second World War.  As payment for that, we would see a surrender of sovereignty, which is really disgraceful.  In Latin America the period was called the long neoliberal night and there is something similar here.  We should register that even in Latin America countries never reached a level of indebtedness currently experienced by the eurozone, with a level of 160% of GDP in the case of Greece.</P>
        <P>I will spell out what is being demanded of the Greek population and we should look at the shock therapy to which these people are being exposed.  The memorandum of impoverishment, as it has been correctly called in my opinion, proposes a number of measures, such as reductions in salaries by 22%, the minimum wage going to &euro;751 per month, the abolition of sectoral bargaining agreements, the freezing of wage bills until 2015, full-time employment being converted to part-time employment based on the decision of employers and a massive decimation of what was already a vulnerable pension position.  Pensions will be reduced by &euro;300 million annually, with the new cuts affecting all schemes.</P>
        <P>One of the most reprehensible measures is the reduction in employer contributions being imposed, with a 2% reduction in the social contributions of employers through the abolition of contributions for the workers&rsquo; housing organisation and other social benefits.  These organisations will essentially be forced to close down as a result.  There will be a further reduction of 3% in the contributions paid by employers in the private sector in 2013.  It is worth noting that these measures were pushed through on a Sunday night on 12 February and the very next day the Greek Government was faced with the European Commissioner responsible for economic affairs stating that it was not enough.  He wanted another &euro;325 million in cuts to be introduced within 48 hours, in essence suspending whatever limited democracy already exists.</P>
        <P>On top of grinding austerity is the abolition of permanent employment in former state-owned companies, dismissal of 15,000 employees in the public sector this year, cuts of over 150,000 by <Col N="73"/>2015 and a process that will go on and on.  There will be cuts of &euro;636 million in salaries for public sector workers, and that is without considering reductions in benefits to families with more than three children, cuts in social benefits, a property tax as part of people&rsquo;s electricity bill, reduction in the overtime of doctors, and decreases in public investment.  This is the massacre being demanded as a result of the deal in front of us today.</P>
        <P>What we now have in Europe is the spectacle of an almost open colonial-style agenda being foisted by the stronger European economies, led by German capitalism, and this is effectively egged on and they are being allowed to get away with it by the obedient collaborators in the small, weaker economies like our own.  In order to deliver, people have been prepared to throw to the side what would be considered democratic norms, such as the right to elect one&rsquo;s own government and so on.  The only way in which this issue will be addressed ultimately is through ordinary people mobilising and uniting across national boundaries throughout Europe.  On the back of the imposed austerity, we have already seen the beginnings of this in a magnificent way with seven general strikes in Greece last year; major movements in Portugal, Italy, Belgium and Spain; the overthrow of the government in Romania and so on.</P>
        <P>The task for ordinary people in Europe now is to build a European-wide movement based on an unambiguous rejection of the payment of the national debt to market vultures and institutions like the ECB.  The genuine investments of working people, including pension funds, must be protected, but the siphoning of society&rsquo;s resources for a debt that was not ours in the first place is not the way forward.  This money and these resources should be invested in emergency programmes for putting people to work, engendering economic activity and ending austerity.  The measures being put forward now offer no solution, which we know, as it has been the show in town.  The choice is accepting further attacks on rights and being kicked out of the eurozone or taking more austerity and being kicked out in future; that is not a choice worth making.  The way forward is for people across Europe to unite and begin to organise to benchmark living standards against their own governments, which now seem to be more interested in protecting the wealthy rather than their own populations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>The title of the Bill indicates that its purpose is to facilitate, in the public interest, the financial stability of the EU and the safeguarding of financial stability in the euro area as a whole.  I note the insertion of the term &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; but would it not be more honest to insert the term &ldquo;in the interests of the European banking system&rdquo;?  What has happened in Greece cannot be described even remotely as being in the public interest.  Greece is now in its fifth year of recession and it is estimated that 75% of its decline over the past two years was due to austerity measures.  The country has a 25% unemployment rate, with 40% of that made up of young people.  There has been a cut in education funding of 25% from a very low spending base of 4% of GDP.  Greek society is being forced to jettison the young people who are its future.  The NGOs and street clinics for immigrants now service 30% of Greek citizens with food and clothes.  These cold statistics cannot give a real picture of what ordinary Greeks suffer.  The suicide rates are frightening, with an increase of 40% in the first six months of 2011 following an increase of 25% in 2010.  The human cost to the Greek people is staggering and must be taken on board.</P>
        <P>The recipe of austerity imposed, including the unprecedented demand for regime change by the troika and Merkozy, has been a disaster for the Greek people and the Greek economy.  The people bearing this enormous burden are not responsible for the crisis.  Those responsible &mdash; the bankers, speculators and market players &mdash; have been handed &euro;1 trillion at a 1% interest rate by the ECB under the long-term refinancing operation.  This has prompted a market rally and brought down sovereign borrowing rates for Italy and Spain as banks borrow at 1% and lend to these states at 6%, pocketing a 5% profit . The question is how much of this &euro;1 trillion, <Col N="74"/>if any, has filtered down to the real economy.  Has a single job been created?  How is the &euro;1 trillion to be repaid and by whom?  This money is not going into productive investment which would generate economic growth and provide the wherewithal to repay it.  It is adding to the debt burden of states which already have unsustainable debt levels with contracting economies in the death grip of austerity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The only benefit &mdash; if it can be called a benefit &mdash; is to gloss over the scale of the EU banking crisis.  We will now be asked in the upcoming referendum on the fiscal compact to endorse this madness.  Irish people must give these issues extremely careful consideration.  If the ECB can magic up &mdash; that is print &mdash; &euro;1 trillion for the banks, why could it not have bailed out Ireland, Portugal and Greece with a 1% interest rate on less than 50% of what was given to the banks and allow them to manage their deficits without the crippling level of austerity demanded by the troika and at the same time have a minimum &euro;500 billion for a programme to create jobs, develop infrastructure and promote growth in the periphery?  This would create the possibility of growing out of the crisis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Michael McGrath stated Fianna F&aacute;il would support the Bill on the basis that the Greek government and the powers that be have indicated it must be the case.  I reject this entirely.  A puppet prime minister was put in place by Merkel and Sarkozy.  He was parachuted into the Greek Government.  Strings are being pulled by international bankers who want their money back.  The cost of this is that Greek people must pay enormously, far beyond what they should be paying.  The suicide rates indicate the real suffering faced by the Greek people.  I cannot support this and I reject the payment of the bailout.  Ireland should consider what will happen in the coming months with regard to the fiscal compact treaty because it will batten down austerity in this country and in Europe.  The points made by Deputy Clare Daly on European people having more in common with regard to dealing with the needs, economies, lives and jobs of people is key and there should be a Europe-wide campaign.</P>

	<P Just="Left">It was not long ago when Berlin was very eager to be seen as the champion of European unity.  I am not convinced history will put that slant on it following this crisis.  There is no doubt the attitude towards Greece has changed.  I had the impression 18 months ago that under no circumstances would Germany allow Greece to fall away from the eurozone but I am not convinced of this any more.  A lack of trust has developed and the German finance Minister, Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble, has been fairly open about this.  He is eager to be rid of Greece at this stage.  Now that a better firewall is in place and there is not much confidence in Athens implementing the reforms the Germans would like it to implement, I would not bet on Greece being part of the eurozone in two or three years time.</P>
        <P>The austerity programme on which the Germans insist for all of us is hugely problematic, not for them but for us.  The German attitude has the potential to destroy the eurozone.  If European monetary policy is run according to German interests, huge structural imbalances will accumulate.  The unemployment rate in Germany is very manageable at present as it is less than 7%.  Last year its GDP growth was 3%.  It suits Germany very well for us to implement austerity but we can all see what austerity is doing here and it is even more draconian in Greece.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The unemployment level in the 17 countries of the eurozone has reached 16.9 million, which is 10.7%, and includes the good countries such as Germany and the Netherlands.  Mass unemployment is haunting Europe; it is the biggest problem out there.  I do not see how bleeding the patient will be a cure.  Unemployment will not be fixed by austerity.  The fiscal problems might be fixed but unemployment will not be.  It is frightening to see how EU-imposed cuts have left one in five people unemployed in Greece and increased the suicide rate by 40%.  This <Col N="75"/>is serious and very frightening.  Anyone who argues austerity will spur growth or boost employment is living in cloud cuckoo land.</P>
        <P>The philosophy of John Maynard Keynes is out of favour at present.  He famously stated if one looks after unemployment, the budget will look after itself, but sadly this is not how Berlin sees it.  I would like to argue that Europe&rsquo;s crisis is not only about economics.  Unlike GDP or inflation, unemployment is the major economic indicator which measures real human beings rather than growth or prices.  Having a job is not just about earning a living or paying taxes; it is about dignity and self worth.  The human and social costs of unemployment are well known and are the same here as in Greece: financial hardship, emotional stress, depression, loss of morale and status, shame, sickness, premature death and hopelessness.  These lead to crime, disorder and social unrest.  We are sowing the seeds of many problems.  Through cuts to education and the lack of employment, austerity is robbing us of the future.  It is also robbing us of the present because of the lack of work and the hardship people are going through.</P>
        <P>I know it is not easy to run a government.  It is not easy to run a business.  However, it is not good enough to state we have no money if we are able to find &euro;31 billion for Anglo Irish Bank.  A total of 450,000 people are unemployed in Ireland.  If it took &euro;30,000 to create a job for each of these people, it would amount to &euro;13 billion, which is less than half the amount being given to Anglo Irish Bank and less than one third of what it will eventually cost us to give it this &euro;31 billion.  We are able to find money for some things but not for others and this has to do with our approach.  I do not see how what is being done to Greece will help.  We are being told the Greek economy will contract by only 4.3% this year, will not contract next year, before achieving a growth rate of 2% in subsequent years.  Last year it contracted by 8%.  How, in God&rsquo;s name, will Greece reduce the rate of economic contraction to 0% next year?  This objective is not possible against a backdrop of wage, expenditure and pension cuts, collapsing consumer confidence, capital flight and an investment strike.  How will Greece turn its economy around under these conditions?  I wish the Greeks well, but at some stage Europe will have to reconsider the philosophy of austerity.  The medicine will not produce the cure it seeks.</P>

        <P>This debate provides me with an opportunity to speak not only about Greece, the subject of the legislation, but also the broader context of Ireland&rsquo;s position.  Despite previously bemoaning the fact that Ireland was being discussed in the parliaments of other European Union member states, several speakers in this debate do not appear to have a problem in lecturing the Greek Government on its internal affairs, especially how it deals with budgetary issues.  The Greek people have endured a tumultuous period and unfairly become the butt of many jokes.  Greece is a sovereign and proud country, to which we can trace back the roots of democracy.  It is a relatively new democracy which has experienced turbulent times since the Second World War.  Greeks will be annoyed to hear members of another sovereign parliament lecturing them on <Col N="76"/>what they should do with a deal negotiated by their sovereign government with 26 other member states, the European Commission, the European Central Bank and others.  They will not be grateful for lectures from Members of the Oireachtas on what they should or should not do or what impact the deal may or may not have on their economy.  When Deputies throw around comments about other member states in a European Union of equals, they should remember previous comments they may have made about how Ireland was being perceived in other parliaments.</P>
        <P>Some of the Deputies who have spoken have changed their tune in the past 12 months.  Having seen the fortunes of their party improving in the opinion polls, they may believe that if they temper their words a little more, their fortunes could improve further.  Some of them refused to admit until recently that they had anything to do with the bank guarantee and wondered whether they were present in the Seanad Chamber when a certain vote was called or whether their words about the green jersey and bailout were taken out of context.  They have suddenly gone full circle and want to distance themselves from their actions in this Chamber and the other House.  People will be able to judge the unfairness of that approach.</P>
        <P>We heard comparisons being made between Ireland and Greece.  For many months the Minister for Finance has been at pains to point out that one cannot draw comparisons between our two countries which are totally different in respect of economic forecasts, where they are coming from and where they are going.  The leadership provided in this country proves that is the case.  For instance, if one compares Greek and Irish exports, one finds that Ireland is in a much stronger position than Greece to drive its way out of its difficulties.</P>
        <P>That being said, as a member of the European Union, should Ireland wash its hands of countries that find themselves in difficulty or should we try to help them?  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the European treaty and put it to the people in a referendum because it will be the first time we will have a proper, informed debate on the issue.  The fiscal treaty is relatively small and those who seek to drag irrelevant issues into the debate will soon be found out.  The first set of opinion polls since the treaty was signed was published at the weekend.  The polls show that if issues are distilled for members of the public, they wish to be central to rather than on the periphery of Europe or left behind.</P>
        <P>One speaker referred to Greece signing up to austerity for posterity, while another argued that the European treaty would enshrine austerity in law.  To be fair to the speakers concerned, they may need a dictionary.  Countries are being required to live within their means.  One hears socialist parties argue it is a bad thing to live within one&rsquo;s means.  Many of these parties had close associations with some of the former Soviet leaders and many have admirers in the last remaining Soviet outposts of North Korea and Cuba.  They appear to believe it would be a bad thing to make it legally binding on countries to live within their means.  Greece finds itself in its current position because governance, oversight, accounting and reporting were lacking.  We heard about similar problems in this country.  Fortunately, however, Ireland&rsquo;s economy is export led.</P>
        <P>Deputy Mick Wallace is correct that austerity measures are having a major impact on families.  There comes a time, however, when people must take responsibility.  In fairness to the Leader of the Opposition, he attempted to take some responsibility at the weekend when he issued an apology.  Others must also ask themselves whether they acted responsibly or treated people fairly in the past 14 or 15 years.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I wish to share time with Deputies Thomas Pringle and Clare Daly.</P>
        <P>I would like to dedicate this speech to the late Paddy Concannon.  He was our president until he, sadly, passed away in the past week in his 94th year.  He fought this battle with us the whole way along the line and I hope he is looking down on us and supporting us.  He was the last living former elected member of Clann na Tal&uacute;n and our thoughts are with him and his family.  He would have been here this evening if he had lasted long enough.</P>
        <P>I thank Bord na M&oacute;na, especially Mr. Gerry McNally, who helped us with the information we needed along the way.  I cannot say we have been happy with everyone we have dealt with but he has been a gem.</P>
        <P>For the first time in 20 years, there has been a thorough canvassing of the views of domestic turf cutters on solutions to the difficulties they face due to the designation of their bogs as special areas of conservation, SACs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Based on the results of an extensive consultation process, the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, TCCA, has prepared proposals with the potential to resolve the issue to the satisfaction of all reasonable people.  The TCCA is ready and willing to progress these proposals in a spirit of co-operation and partnership towards a successful conclusion.  Over an 18-month period, our representatives have visited every one of the 53 SAC bog complexes or the 57 bogs affected.  In a series of 25 meetings, we met local turf cutters and distributed 17,000 questionnaires.  The results show that people are deeply committed to both their traditional turf cutting practices and to bog conservation.  It is important to point out that our consultation process is in line with the approach set out in the European Commission document entitled, LIFE-NATURE: Communicating with Stakeholders and the General Public, regarding Natura 2000 sites, which states:</P><Col N="79"/>
        <P LI="1">The principle of collaboration is enshrined in the Habitats Directive, requiring that conservation measures take account of the economic, social and cultural requirements as well as the regional and local characteristics of the area.  The manner in which Natura 2000 will be implemented is very important &mdash; the involvement of the owner of private land is crucial.  LIFE shows that contracts are preferable to constraints.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is important to remember that.</P>
        <P>I refer to the main pillars of our proposal, the first of which is, in the vast majority of the bogs, relocation to a nearby bog of similar quality and infrastructure.  I am one of those who is prepared to move to another bog.  There is one within a reasonable distance of my plot, which has good quality turf.  I am willing to move and compromise.  I do not know what my grand-uncle, Harry Fleming, would think of me moving from the plot his family had for more than 100 years but I hope he would be happy enough.  We are not moving for the craic; we are moving to show that we are prepared, if needs be, to compromise but that will require compromise on the other side as well.  If there is compromise on that side, we will compromise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The second element of our proposal calls for co-existence of domestic turf cutting and conservation in a small minority of bogs with the consolidation of turf cutting into smaller areas in conjunction with all possible mitigation measures.  This refers to people who do not have a bog to move to within a reasonable distance or who are within a reasonable distance of a bog but it does not have good quality turf with a high calorific value.  I propose in this instance, on behalf of the TCCA, that we will ask people who cut on various parts of the bog to consolidate into one area to minimise the impact on the hydrology of the bog.  There is no necessity to put down a liner or a dam between the area of co-existence where they cut turf and the area that is conserved.  Based on what we know from our management of these areas, that is not required.  However, if that is what the State bodies need to be done, it will be done.  We have been told by environmental groups that the liners or dams will not work but, last week, we were given clear examples of where the National Parks and Wildlife Service has made this work at the peatlands forum.  It can, therefore, make it work in our case.</P>
        <P>Third, we will require total compensatory habitat exchange on one bog.  In this instance, there is nowhere for any turf cutter to move.  There is no bog close enough with good quality turf and given the number of people cutting on the bog, consolidation would be a farce because even if they moved around into different areas, the entire bog would still be cut.  In that case, we require complete compensatory habitat exchange.</P>
        <P>The fourth pillar of our proposals is the designation of additional raised bogs of high conservation value by way of compensatory habitat to compensate for areas of co-existence and habitat exchange.  If the three previous pillars are implemented, only 2% of the land area of the 53 SACs will need to have turf cut on it but it is not right to leave it at that.  The TCCA has scoured the country and looked for alternative sites of equal quality and we have put them forward as an alternative to compensate for the habitat that is lost.</P>
        <P>The 2% of the SAC land we need will last 250 to 300 years.  Who knows what is around the corner?  Who knows whether we will still cut turf in 50 or 70 years?  However, one thing for sure is that, at most, all we need will be 2% of the land and we can compensate with 2.5 times that acreage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Domestic turf cutting has been in decline for years for a variety of reasons.  The decline in the numbers of people depending on turf for their domestic fuel is documented in the Fernandez report of 2005.  With regard to the notion that people will cut an entire bog away, if one has planted an acre of spuds and one&rsquo;s neighbour has acres of land beside it, one does not plant spuds on his land because that is not what people do down the country.  The same applies <Col N="80"/>to turf cutting.  The average plot size for turbary rights is 1 acre while some are 0.5 acres or 0.25 acres.  Once that is cut away, that is the end of it.  The notion that someone could cut away the entire bog is ridiculous given the State owns 95% of bogs.</P>
        <P>This has never been a monetary issue.  Even in today&rsquo;s economic climate, only a small minority of the 20,000 turbary owners on the 139 raised bog SACs and NHAs have accepted the compensation package on offer.  More than 95% of the people who have contacted our organisation were not entitled to it.  We can only conclude that the package is in essence only attractive to people who do not cut turf.</P>
        <P>If previously agreed compensation deals are honoured by the Government, we believe a further minority may be willing to give up their turbary rights or to sell their bogland entirely or in part.  This is not necessarily in our interest but people have free will to do what they wish.  A flexible approach should be taken on individual preferences for annual or lump sum payments, and the different ownership arrangements, formal and informal, for example, acquired rights, must be recognised and dealt with in a flexible and creative manner by the Government.  There is no one-size-fits-all solution.</P>
        <P>The strange thing about the compensation package is that people were told they were not entitled to it if they had not cut turf in the last five years.  The irony is phenomenal if we listen to some people who talk about the fact that there was no derogation.  In essence, the compensation package rewards only the people who ignored the fact that turf cutting was supposedly against the law.  It is interesting that is how it went.</P>
        <P>It is vital to note that our people have taken the responsibility of guardianship of Ireland&rsquo;s natural heritage seriously, but there can be no effective guardianship where those who have traditionally shouldered that responsibility are ignored, as has been the case.  It is not to the credit of previous Governments and the national agencies that we are no further advanced today than in 1998, and it has not done a lot for conservation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The TCCA represents some of the poorest people in Ireland, many of whom live in areas that are already recognised as disadvantaged, with objective one status.  Our people&rsquo;s grievances are too numerous to detail here.  They are best summarised by saying that over the six years of the negotiation of the habitats directive from 1986 to 1992 and the 14-year botched implementation attempt since its transposition into Irish law in 1997, the population indigenous to the designated areas has been excluded from all decision making, denied consultation, denied access to information both general and scientific, denied representation, denied legal assistance and denied reasonable compensation or alternatives.  They have had agreements dishonoured, been treated unfairly and been subjected to a State-backed campaign of intimidation, victimisation and threats.  That is, at the moment, in the past.  We should leave things in the past, but if we leave them in the past without learning from them, it is, to say the least, a wasted opportunity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The conduct of the relevant Government agencies, unfortunately, has brought both the law and the EU into disrepute in the eyes of the people.  I suggest the Minister read appendix A of the report entitled &ldquo;TCCA Proposals on 57 Raised Bog Complexes to EU Commission and Irish Government&rdquo;.  We will not have time to go through it today, but I hope the Government Members will before tomorrow.  Appendix A documents the process, begun in 2004, between the turbary rights holders and land owners of All Saints Bog, County Offaly, and D&uacute;chas, the predecessor to the NPWS, and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  As will be seen, it is a story of incompetence at best and, at worst, of neglect and disregard for citizens.  To date the Departments have failed to complete a contract they initiated.  Of 1,200 such agreements entered into by Departments, 540 have still not been hon<Col N="81"/>oured.  This is not something we came up with off the top of our heads; this information came on 11 July last from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</P>
        <P>The TCCA&rsquo;s submission to the working group on the cessation of turf cutting on certain raised bog special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas is provided in appendix F of the aforementioned report.  I suggest the Minister read it, as there is a lot to learn.  This detailed submission, along with the work documented in the report, are testament to the determination of the TCCA to work with the authorities in resolving this issue.  It is also testament to the numerous failed initiatives to date.  Appendix B contains extracts from the Official Report of meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs dated 17 November 2009 and 8 July 2010.  It can be seen that all members of the committee supported our case and argued that the settlement agreed in May 2007 should be honoured and completed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our members seek neither conflict nor confrontation.  Instead, we seek to rely upon adherence to the stated EU principles of democracy, transparency, due process and subsidiarity.  We bring an unrivalled and in-depth practical knowledge of our bogs and people to the table, combined with the know-how and equipment to deliver practical conservation solutions on the ground.  Under our proposals, as I said earlier, approximately 98% of SAC raised bog area can be conserved.  The addition of raised bog compensatory habitats will easily offset or perhaps completely negate any shortfall.  In many instances, the farmland surrounding a raised bog would be vulnerable to flooding if the drainage were allowed to close over.  Thus, many farmers would suffer if drainage was not maintained or compensatory drainage was not put in place to keep their lands flood-free.  It is not clear from what the NPWS has stated whether any such work will be done.  This is an issue that must be addressed and applies to nearly all bogs reviewed in our report.</P>
        <P>Bog owners, domestic turf cutters and farmers have a great responsibility in the guardianship of Ireland&rsquo;s natural heritage.  It is not a responsibility we take lightly.  A review of the site synopsis reports of some of the designated areas raises questions about why certain areas were included while other areas were not.  The synopsis of Derrynabrock bog and a map of same have been included in appendix C of the report.  The Minister should definitely look at that.  No reason was given in the synopsis for the fact that the SAC designation included a very large part of the bog but left out a considerable area that is contiguous to the entire bog and appears to have all the same characteristics of the area enclosed by the SAC.  The same designated area includes fields that were reclaimed in the 1970s.  These fields, which now produce silage, are part of the SAC, while part of the raised bog is not.  That is not good.  An examination of the sequence of maps issued by the NPWS for Derrynabrock bog is worth considering.  The boundary shown in a 1993 map moved eastward on a map issued in 1996.  People are confused enough already about this.  The boundary then moved east by one turf bank in a map issued in 2010 and then east by a further three banks in a 2012 map.  That is causing a problem for people.</P>
        <P>Similarly, there are many instances of bogs with SAC designations that finish abruptly at the boundary of a State or semi-State property.  In one instance, at Barroughter bog, the designation excludes a piece of property that is owned by the ESB, even though the bog and the land surrounding it on all sides are designated.  That is also shown in our report.</P>
        <P>The TCCA feels that any reasonable examination of bogs and any efforts to conserve bogland must include the activities of the large-scale commercial operators.  In appendix D, if the Minister has time to consider the report, there are two aerial photographs of bogs in the Clara-Ferbane area and the Longford-Lanesborough area.  The photographs show clearly what has happened in these areas, yet there is no plan to deal with this industrial-scale destruction.  It is no accident that the best preserved bogs in Ireland are those that have traditionally been used <Col N="82"/>by small-scale domestic turf-cutters.  In many instances, the presence of small-scale domestic turf-cutters has inhibited wholesale industrialisation and afforestation of the bogs in which we have traditionally operated.  Yet now that conservation efforts are a necessity, the small-scale domestic cutter is the first to be asked to make sacrifices.</P>
        <P>I might need another two minutes, if that is all right.</P>
        <P>It is important to tackle the issue of the supposedly evil turf machine in comparison to the sle&aacute;n.  Maybe the turf machine does not look quite as dreamy on the bog as the man with the peaked cap, the pipe in his mouth and the sle&aacute;n in his hand, but that does not necessarily mean it is worse to use the machine.  In fact, it is less harmful.  When a turf-cutter uses the hopper machine, he uses less turf.  Why?  If he is using the sle&aacute;n, he needs to go down further into the bog to find good turf.  With the machine, he can mix the bad turf and the good turf and he uses less of the turf bank overall.  It mixes the whole thing up.  On top of that, when one reaches the waterline, where the best turf is &mdash; my father calls it black stone turf &mdash; it cannot be cut with the sle&aacute;n.  This means that using the machine gives better quality turf while using less bog.  In addition, there is no need to drain the high bog for a tractor and transport box, as the machine is on tracks, which means it does not sink as readily.  The machine exerts two pounds per square inch on a bog while the average human exerts four pounds per square inch.  It does not look as nice as the man with the sle&aacute;n but it does not cause a problem in terms of putting pressure on the bog.</P>
        <P>The final argument that must be tackled is that someone with a machine will cut more turf.  About 20 years ago, my mother bought an electric mixer.  Until then she had used a wooden spoon.  After she bought it she did not make 100 times more cakes and we did not eat any more cakes.  The reality is the turf cutter does not want to burn any more turf.  He probably has a stove now and burns even less turf.  Even if he wanted to cut every last bit of turf, he can only cut what is on his patch, no more than a farmer cannot plant spuds in the neighbour&rsquo;s field.</P>
        <P>Research carried out for the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s bogland report in 2011 found that Irish people have positive attitudes towards the domestic cutting of turf and also value bogs as heritage, regarding both as compatible, as does the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association.  We are especially aware of how turf is deeply symbolic to Irish people wherever they are in the world.  It represents our history, economic self-sufficiency and identity.  We hope that the proposals of the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association will be developed by those who watch over and work the land and will ensure the living and working landscapes we see today are safeguarded into the future.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this motion and I commend Deputy Flanagan and the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association on the tireless work they have put into this issue over the past 18 months and on the preparation of the motion before the House.</P>
        <P>The proposals from the TCCA represent an enormous amount of work carried out by people in a voluntary capacity over the past 18 months.  These are people who travelled the country talking to communities, hearing their concerns and, in some cases, providing the first information that many of them had about the implications for their bog.  Only 15% to 20% of people throughout the country have been contacted about the intended designation of bogs.  For example, in the case of one bog in the Lough Ree complex, when the TCCA came to the local turf cutters in October last year, it was the first time that they had any information on the designation of the bog as a special area of conservation, SAC.</P><Col N="83"/>
        <P>This has resulted in a complete breakdown in trust throughout the country.  Mr. Justice Quirke&rsquo;s report has recognised this situation.  He has said: &ldquo;What is undeniable is that there has been a breakdown of communication and a breakdown of trust between the relevant parties which may be difficult to restore.&rdquo;  He goes on: &ldquo;Trust must, however, be restored and I am of the opinion that the Peatlands Council can and should play a significant role in the restoration.&rdquo;  This opportunity cannot be lost and it is the role of the Department now to ensure it is not lost.</P>
        <P>In doing this, the judge has acknowledged the integrity of the turf cutters:</P>
        <P LI="1">Those most affected by the restrictions are the turf cutting communities who for generations, and  in some cases for centuries, have enjoyed ownership, property and turbary rights on the relevant bogs.  It was made absolutely clear by the speakers who represented them that those communities comprise hardworking, decent, respectable and law abiding citizens of this State who have no intention or wish to break any Irish or European law ... [A]s a result of circumstances over which they have had no control and as a result of legal and other procedures into which they appear to have had little, if any, input, they are now at risk of acting unlawfully or failing to act lawfully.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He goes on: &ldquo;I accept further that these communities have a genuine and sincere commitment to the preservation of the environmental integrity of the relevant bogs and many are prepared to cease cutting turf in order to accommodate that overriding objective.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The TCCA report has made an honest attempt to address many of the issues involved and I believe has come up with a workable solution to the difficulties which, if followed in the spirit of the Government amendment to the motion, will resolve what could be a very difficult situation.  This solution would leave no one at risk of failing to act lawfully.</P>
        <P>Surely the implementation of environmental legislation and the preservation of the environment should also have at its heart the people who live in the environment.  Everyone supports the protection of the environment and people are as much part of the environment as the flora and fauna in the countryside.  In many circles in the media and the environmental lobby, people in rural Ireland are represented as Neanderthals with no concern for preservation.  The proposals from the TCCA show that with effort and concern for both people and the environment, a workable solution can be reached.</P>
        <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service&rsquo;s own figures have shown that in bogs where there has been no turf cutting, bogs have still declined and in others where cutting has continued, habitat has increased.  Stopping turf cutting is not a silver bullet that will solve the very real pressures that bogs are under.  Including people as part of the solutions is the way to ensure progress.</P>
        <P>What has been really shown by this dispute is how the State has failed its citizens and the environment.  There is only lip service given to consultation in this country.  A number of individuals working voluntarily can travel around the country, consult communities, give people information and arrive at a solution, yet the State, with all its resources, cannot achieve this and cannot inform citizens about decisions that are affecting them.  The Government must learn from this and ensure in the future that consultation is just that, not talking at or down to people and not presenting them with a done deal.  There is nothing that will undermine environmental protection than the superior behaviour of the State.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Quirke recommends that the Peatlands Council prepares a national plan for the raised bogs.  The TCCA plan is a good starting point on that road.  In a nutshell, the plan makes three recommendations: preserve 98% of the already designated bog, co-existence on 2% of the designated bogs and the creation of another compensatory habitat that would represent <Col N="84"/>5% of the acreage of the entire SACs.  By working with communities this plan has been put together.  By consultation it has been arrived at.  There is a lesson here for the State.  I only hope it is prepared to learn from it.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Minister will propose an amendment to the motion and that amendment has the type of language that could solve this problem.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service must live up to the sentiments in the amendment.  Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte are prepared to work with the Peatlands Council and be part of the solution.  The Minister must make sure that sentiment is acted on and correct the gaps in consultation highlighted by this dispute.  If volunteers can travel around and arrive at solutions, then surely the Department can do it too.  The development of the plan for the bogs could and should help to develop a model of consultation that can be used in the future to ensure communities can have faith in the process.</P>
        <P>There are no raised bogs in Donegal but there are plenty of blanket bogs.  Blanket bog around the country will come under scrutiny in the near future, with many already in SACs.  To avoid confrontation in the future, I urge the Government to use the model of consultation developed by the turf cutters and recognise that people should be at the centre of the environment.</P>
        <P>In the current climate in the country, as we face into a referendum on the fiscal compact, a terrible thought strikes me.  The need for the Government to have the referendum passed could be factoring into its response to the motion.  How can the turf cutters be sure that this is not a ruse to ensure they vote the right way in the referendum?  I urge the Minister to put on the record that as this process goes on, the referendum result will not impact on the work of finding a solution that is acceptable to the turf cutters.  If the referendum is passed &mdash; and I hope it is not for many reasons &mdash; I hope the attitude of the Government to finding a solution will not change and that work will continue, with the partnership seen in the consultation so far with the TCCA and the Peatlands Council.</P>
        <P>I commend the turf cutters on the work they have done and the proposals they have brought forward and I thank them for the opportunity to speak on the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Like my colleagues, I am pleased to speak in favour of this motion.  It is fitting that when we vote on it tomorrow night, it will be the first anniversary of the election of this D&aacute;il.  To me, that is quite fitting because what we have seen on this issue in the course of the past year is a process of democratic engagement, the likes of which has never been seen in this country.</P>
        <P>As part of that process, lay people have given of their time and resources to travel the length and breadth of the country to engage with residents affected by this issue.  Some representatives of these organisations have spent over 118 days on the road, engaging in discussions with their neighbours and people they had never met before.  Countless public meetings have been held across the country.  Hundreds of people have attended these real town hall meetings in order to air their grievances and look for solutions.</P>
        <P>Families already reeling from austerity are worried about their ability to meet their fuel needs by cutting turf on plots on which they have had turf cutting rights for many generations.  I have met many of the people affected during the campaign against the household tax.  Some of them turned up at meetings in towns such as Athlone and Newbridge, County Kildare.  They are feeling the effects of austerity, the attacks on rural Ireland and the ending of a particular way of life.  They feel strongly about this issue which they see as the last straw.  I have no doubt that such people will be in attendance tomorrow night in their droves to make sure our vote <Col N="85"/>marks the beginning of the end of the issue they have faced for so long.  Government Deputies will accept that it is undoubtedly the case that residents feel an acute sense of betrayal by Fine Gael, in particular.  Representatives of Fine Gael led voters to believe they would be on their side if they were elected.  The initiative proposed by Deputy Flanagan will give Fine Gael Deputies an opportunity tomorrow to do something positive and overcome some of the damage that has resulted from the clear betrayal I have mentioned.</P>
        <P>Deputy Flanagan has alluded to the process of designating areas as special areas of conservation.  When one examines some of the areas in question, it appears the designation process is random and arbitrary.  The Deputy mentioned the map covering the Derrynabrock bog.  A line was drawn down the middle of it.  A big chunk of the bog was left out in the designation, while fields were included in it.  Where was the scientific basis for this?  Similarly, Kilteevan bog was designated as a special area of conservation, while large industrial bogs in the area owned by Bord na M&oacute;na were not included, even though they were not in production and the habitats involved were just as worthy of preservation.  Kildare County Council allowed housing to be built on a flood plain near Mouds bog near my home town of Newbridge.  If the bog floods, as is proposed by the measure, the water table will be raised and the chances of flood damage to housing will be increased.  How can this be environmentally positive?  Some of the designations would lead one to believe visits to these sites were not made.  It is certainly not the case that all of the bogs were examined.  I suggest old maps were used in this regard.  It is clear that the designation process took place against the backdrop of Ireland being threatened by the European Union.  The idea was that every moment&rsquo;s delay would cost the taxpayer tens of thousands of euro.  Obviously, this was not the case.  Such a suggestion motivated much of the designation process in the background.</P>
        <P>This is an example of the usual <i>&agrave;la carte</i> attention being paid to European Union directives and proposals.  When it comes to issues such as bogs or septic tanks, we are told there is only one way to implement directives.  When it comes to corporation tax, however, the European Union can be ignored and stood down.  When it comes to abortion rights, it is also a case of &ldquo;who cares, let us ignore the European Union.&rdquo;  When it comes to these issues, we decide to hide behind the European Union and blame it for what is being done.  I suggest it is entirely possible for the Government to implement the measures being proposed by the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, while complying with European legislation.  I do not accept the view that it is not permissible under Irish law for turf cutting to take place with conservation on these sites.  There are ways in which it can be permissible; for example, in instances where there are no alternatives to co-existence.  In fairness to the representatives of the turf cutters, they have found alternative sites in the vast majority of cases.  Where they have not been able to do so, no alternative is possible.  In that sense, co-existence is legitimate.</P>
        <P>I suggest the over-riding public interest is an imperative reason to defend the rights of those who have engaged in this activity for many years.  It is the case that this is a priority habitat.  The evidence of the Government&rsquo;s own statistics demonstrates that, as Deputy Thomas Pringle said, turf cutting is not the only activity that has an impact on raised bogs.  There are countless examples of places where the active bog is decreasing, even though no turf is being cut.  There are other examples of places where the active raised bog is increasing, even though no turf is being cut.  Similarly, there are examples of places where the active raised bog is increasing, even though turf is being cut.  Turf cutting is not the only activity that is detrimental to these bogs.  That is vindicated by the scientific evidence available in the Government&rsquo;s own reports.  This is a hugely important part of the process.  It is entirely within the Government&rsquo;s remit to do this.  The solution being proposed by the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association recognises the importance of the habitat and the rights of individuals who have a long association with raised bogs.  The position of people who have respected, looked after and passed on such <Col N="86"/>bogs through the generations has not been given sufficient status.  As has been said, the proposal would protect an area greater than the size of any facility which will be used for continued turf cutting.  An alternative proposal that a greater area be protected is being made.  The relocation proposition is entirely credible and testament to the active engagement and participation that has taken place on a voluntary basis.  It is a positive step.</P>
        <P>I have examined some of the submissions we received today from those who oppose the motion.  They have suggested relocation would perpetuate unsustainable peat-burning and deny investment in alternative low carbon energy sources.  To be honest, such a suggestion really weakens the argument of the Friends of the Irish Environment.  The contention that relocation would mean an opportunity to invest in renewable energy sources would be lost is just ridiculous, given that we already have the designation.  Where are the Government&rsquo;s efforts to develop renewable energy sources?  Last week the Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, denied that the development of the sector was Labour Party policy prior to last year&rsquo;s general election.  There is absolutely no evidence to support that proposition, particularly given that the number of bogs being preserved is greater than the number on the table.  Any proposal that will work will undoubtedly need the co-operation of those involved in it.  In the absence of such co-operation, anything proposed will be doomed to failure.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the motion and this campaign has been to urge the Government to work with residents, particularly in areas where there will have to be co-existence, and come up with the best areas.  The only sustainable solution will be the one that is accompanied by active engagement.  If such a solution is to be delivered, resources and energy will have to be invested in this process.  If the Government is serious about what it is doing, it will have to be done in this way.  I reiterate that nobody will be conned by this.  There is a substantial degree of scepticism about the Government&rsquo;s record in this regard such that nobody will take promises lightly.  I urge the Government to take the opportunity to repair some of the damage it has done.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;recognises:</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />the innate value of Ireland&rsquo;s unique natural habitat and the necessity to protect it from harm;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />the need for a balance to be struck between habitat conservation and the freedom of the people of Ireland to benefit from their local natural resources;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />the full impact of the habitats directive, not just on the holders of turbary rights but also on the communities which surround designated areas;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />the significant concerns of turf cutting communities, farmers in particular, in relation to potential threats of flooding or bogland growth;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />the need to treat fairly the citizens of Ireland who have been affected by the habitats directive, including the need to address concerns in relation to proper planning <Col N="87"/>and consultation, the impact on income and the value of properties, the security of fuel supply and the protection of cultural heritage; and</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />the need for the trust and goodwill of ordinary land owners and turf cutters to be restored and strengthened through consultation and effective communication from the Government regarding measures to protect and restore raised bog special areas of conservation, SACs;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />acknowledges the proposals from the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, TCCA, entitled, The TCCA Proposals on 57 Raised Bog Complexes to EU Commission and Irish Government, dealing with the various issues surrounding SACs and natural habitats areas, and which, <i>inter alia</i>, propose that:</P>
        <P LI="3"><Miles com="mdash66" />in a small minority of bogs, domestic turf cutting and conservation should co-exist with the consolidation of turf cutting into smaller areas, in conjunction with all possible mitigation measures;</P>
        <P LI="3"><Miles com="mdash66" />in the vast majority of bogs, turbary rights should be relocated to a nearby bog of similar quality and infrastructural access;</P>
        <P LI="3"><Miles com="mdash66" />compensatory habitat exchange should be completed in one instance; and</P>
        <P LI="3"><Miles com="mdash66" />additional raised bogs should be designated areas of high conservation value by way of &ldquo;compensatory habitat&rdquo; to compensate for areas of co-existence and habitat exchange;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />further recognises the potential of the proposals, particularly in light of the fact of this being the most comprehensive consultation process to engage with affected communities and land owners in line with the approach set out in the European Commission document LIFE-NATURE: Communicating with Stakeholders and the General Public in relation to Natura 2000 sites, which states:</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />The principle of collaboration is enshrined in the habitats directive, requiring that conservation measures take account of the economic, social and cultural requirements as well as the regional and local characteristics of the area.  The manner in which Natura 2000 will be implemented is very important &mdash; the involvement of the owner of private land is crucial.  LIFE shows that contracts are preferable to constraints;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />recognises the steps taken by the Government to address longstanding issues, including establishing the Peatlands Council under an independent chairman, and the putting in place of compensation and relocation schemes to help address the needs of turf cutters;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />commends the contribution of the Peatlands Council, the TCCA, the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, Bord na M&oacute;na, environmental non-government organisations and all other relevant parties, for their work on developing solutions to address the needs of turf cutters affected by the requirements of the habitats directive;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />further acknowledges and accepts the report of Mr. Justice Quirke on the proceedings of the Peatlands Forum, held in Athlone between 28 February and 2 March;</P><Col N="88"/>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes Mr. Justice Quirke&rsquo;s recommendation regarding the need for a national plan for Ireland&rsquo;s SAC raised bogs;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />further notes Mr. Justice Quirke&rsquo;s concerns in relation to consultation, communication and trust between the State and those affected by turf cutting restrictions;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />welcomes the commitment of Government to act on the recommendations of Mr. Justice Quirke and, in particular, to:</P>
        <P LI="3"><Miles com="mdash66" />work with all parties to develop a shared understanding and future for the SAC raised bogs, including with Bord na M&oacute;na, the IFA, the TCCA, environmental nongovernment agencies and, in particular, the individuals and communities who are affected by the requirements of the habitats directive and its implementation in the State;</P>
        <P LI="3"><Miles com="mdash66" />work in particular with local interests to find local solutions, based on the report of the Peatlands Forum; and</P>
        <P LI="3"><Miles com="mdash66" />prepare a national raised bog SAC management plan, as recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke, and engage, on the basis of such a plan, with the European Commission as a matter of urgency to seek an overall resolution within the terms of the habitats directive;</P>
        <P LI="2"><Miles com="mdash66" />and further welcomes the decision of Government to enhance the compensation package for affected turf cutters, including a new commitment to introduce greater flexibility in relation to the supply of free turf.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">I join Deputy Flanagan in acknowledging the late Paddy Concannon.  When I was involved in a Seanad campaign 29 years ago, Paddy Concannon gave me a very good reception when I called to his house in County Roscommon, for which I will always remember him.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for raising this important issue in the House and hope he accepts the Government&rsquo;s bona fides in proposing the amendment.  The main difference in substance between his motion and our amendment to it is that we are taking on board the recommendations made in the report of Mr. Justice Quirke which was considered by the Government this morning and published on the website of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht this afternoon.  The motion and amendment otherwise share many of the same sentiments.</P>
        <P>Mr. Justice Quirke agreed to chair the peatlands forum, which was held over four days in Athlone last week.  All communities affected by the cessation of turf cutting on the 53 SAC raised bogs were given an opportunity at this forum to make a submission to Mr. Justice Quirke, and then to discuss the particular circumstances of their bog with a technical committee.  This comprised of staff from my Department and Bord na M&oacute;na, with the assistance of independent facilitators.</P>
        <P>I pay a sincere tribute to Mr. Justice Quirke for taking on this task at short notice and for carrying it out with diligence, notwithstanding the fact that his official retirement took place over the course of the forum.  I also pay tribute to all other participants, namely, the IFA, the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, the Irish Environmental Network and my own staff.  Bord na M&oacute;na provided an invaluable contribution, as recognised in the judge&rsquo;s report.  I thank Mr. Conor Skehan, chairman of the Peatlands Council, who instigated the idea of holding such a forum, together with the team of independent facilitators and the support staff who worked together to ensure the smooth running of the forum.  Most importantly, I pay tribute to the <Col N="89"/>representatives from the raised bog communities up and down the country who came to report on their own cases, and who engaged with my staff to see how their issues could be resolved.</P>
        <P>As stated by Mr. Justice Quirke, &ldquo;those most affected by the restrictions are the turf cutting communities who for generations, and in some cases for centuries, have enjoyed ownership, property and turbary rights on the relevant bogs.&rdquo;  His report makes sobering reading for all involved in this case.  While making the point that it was not his function to adjudicate on the submissions made before, he stated the following, which Deputy Pringle also quoted.  &ldquo;What is undeniable is that there has been a breakdown of communication and a breakdown of trust between the relevant parties which may be difficult to restore.&rdquo;  He went on to state that &ldquo;Mutual recrimination between the State and its citizens cannot be in the national interest and the State must not become embroiled in a quagmire of disputes and legal challenges by its citizens, at a time when it is facing severe sanctions for alleged non-compliance with a European directive arising from the same set of facts and circumstances.&rdquo;  The Government agrees with this analysis and we are committed to working with all parties to address the issues of communication and trust, mindful all the time of the commitments we have also given to ensure that we are in compliance with the requirements of the EU habitats directive.</P>
        <P>The first recital in both motions tonight states that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann &ldquo;recognises the innate value of Ireland&rsquo;s unique natural habitat and the necessity to protect if from harm.&rdquo;  There is no more unique habitat in Europe than our remaining examples of functioning raised bog.  We are legally bound to protect the relatively small amount of raised bog habitat remaining in Ireland that we have nominated as special areas of conservation.  In effect, we are asking that the communities affected by the designations sacrifice, or change, part of their cultural heritage, so that we maintain a representative sample of this very valuable part of our natural heritage for future generations.  Not to do so would be unforgivable.  This then places an obligation on the State to compensate fairly or otherwise look after the needs of those whose traditional rights are being curtailed.  This Government is committed to that principle.</P>
        <P>If there is one overall message in the motions before the House and in the report from Mr. Justice Quirke, it is that things could have been so different if we had confronted our difficulties when we had the time, instead of leaving it until the last minute.  The habitats directive was agreed by the European Community over 20 years ago with the objective of protecting endangered European habitats and species.  It applies to all member states and each must meet its own responsibilities under its terms.  It was very clear from the earliest days of the directive&rsquo;s implementation in Ireland, and indeed during the period leading up to it, that there would be significant implications for turf cutters on Ireland&rsquo;s raised bogs, over and above almost any other category of landowner in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Significant education and consultation campaigns were put in place as the directive began to be introduced in Ireland.  These included numerous local consultation exercises as well as much national level negotiation with interests such as the IFA.  Action was taken to end commercial cutting on raised bogs, and the voluntary bog purchase scheme was put in place.  However, in the face of opposition to ending cutting by domestic cutters, the then Government introduced the ten year derogation.  It was then conveniently forgotten.  Everyone else forgot about the issue and hoped that it would go away, but it did not.  Meanwhile, scientific studies demonstrated that there was continued and dramatic decline in the health of our raised bogs.  These reports should have galvanised everyone to action, but again nothing happened.</P>
        <P>By the time everyone was forced to confront the issue, due to the threat of major fines in the European Court of Justice and further reputational damage to Ireland, there were no answers and there was no understanding, no communication and no trust in which to build a shared solution.</P><Col N="90"/>
        <P>An interdepartmental committee was established in 2009 to consider the issues in the run up to the ending of the derogation.  However, the response to its report was inadequate and the last Government did not provide the certainty or the route map to deliver the long-term solution that was necessary.</P>
        <P>When this Government came into office, we had found that we had already run out of road, with legal proceedings already taking their course against Ireland.  We were determined to take a different route.  While we were obliged to bring Ireland into compliance with EU law, we also put in place new responses to address both the concerns of individuals and the wider need to build a shared future and understanding.  These responses included compensation schemes, relocation schemes, and most importantly the consultative Peatlands Council, under independent chairman Mr. Conor Skehan, to bring all parties together to build that shared understanding.  This has been a difficult process.  That is why, on the suggestion of Mr. Skehan, the Government asked Mr. Justice Quirke to chair the peatlands forum last week.</P>
        <P>I believe that the forum may be seen as the critical initiative where we begin to turn the tide of mistrust that was evident in its plenary sessions.   We saw some significant progress at the plenary sessions and in the technical sessions, as well as in the other bilateral meetings that took place over the four days.</P>
        <P>Following the first day&rsquo;s proceedings, Mr. Justice Quirke took the initiative to see if some manoeuvrability could be delivered through developing a national plan for our protected SAC raised bogs.  This is the central recommendation in Mr. Justice Quirke&rsquo;s report.  Therefore, the Government decided today to develop a national SAC raised bog management plan, which will set out how we propose to manage our SAC raised bog resource.  In the context of such a plan, it may be possible to bring some limited flexibility for a few of the most difficult bogs where there are no alternative solutions.  It should be stressed that this can only be done within the framework of the EU habitats directive.</P>
        <P>The bar is set very high.  Any case made must show that it stands up in terms of being for imperative reasons of overriding public interest, and any such proposals must obtain the consent of the European Commission.  It is also clear that there will be a requirement for compensatory habitat to meet the requirements of the directive.  In fact, the preparation of this plan will require the closest ongoing consultation with the European Commission.  Such a plan will not be acceptable and will have no credibility if cutting continues this year on the affected bogs.  I therefore appeal for patience and understanding as we develop the plan over the coming year.  Furthermore, it would be wrong to expect that such a plan could allow any cutting in the future on more than a very small number of bogs.  Nonetheless, it holds out the possibility of finding solutions in those cases where none appears credible at present, although further work needs to be done first to exhaust the possibility of alternatives.</P>
        <P>While that overall plan is being prepared, I believe we are now in a position to begin to roll out solutions, over the coming months, to many of the communities who came to the forum.  There are legal, planning and land purchase issues involved in many of these cases and it will take some time to deliver new relocation bogs as we work through all these issues.  We have models which work.  In both Clara, County Offaly and Mountbellew in Galway, my Department and Bord na M&oacute;na have worked with the local community to put in place re-location bogs. I understand that the former Member of this House, Mr. Paul Connaughton Snr., who raised this issue on several occasions in the House, explained at the forum how a relocation project was developed for his community.  More importantly, he explained the journey from mistrust to trust as this was delivered over the past six months.</P><Col N="91"/>
        <P>As starkly illustrated in the Quirke report, this is a journey we must replicate in many more communities.  This is the challenge ahead of us.  For my part, I can assure the House that we will make all efforts within our resources to build that trust.  Referring to the fact that the work on which we are embarking will take time, Mr. Justice Quirke stated:</P>
        <P LI="2">Innovation is required because resolution of these difficulties cannot be achieved within the time presently available to the parties.  Some means must be found to overcome this problem.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">In response to this need to respond innovatively, the Government is improving both the monetary compensation package and providing additional flexibility in terms of turf delivery as relocation issues are sorted out. The Government has, therefore, agreed to enhance the compensation package as follows.  The annuity payment will be increased from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,500 per annum, index linked, for 15 years; an additional once-off incentive payment of &euro;500 for qualifying cutters will be provided this year where agreements are signed with my Department; the quantity of cut turf to be delivered, as an interim measure, to those opting for relocation will be increased, from 10 tonnes to 15 tonnes.  Extra turf will be also provided where multiple users have sourced from one plot and where the total cut is more than 15 tonnes per annum.  Claimants must provide evidence to back up the claim, and this issue will be discussed further with interested parties.  The enhanced package will be available to those who already applied to date under the schemes. I can assure the House that my Department will work with all individuals and communities to ensure those who are entitled to have turf in their grates continue to do so.</P>
        <P>I have also directed my Department to put in place measures to expedite payments to applicants, subject to proportionate checks and appropriate audit controls.  Most applicants with signed forms, and who have certified their compliance with the requirements of the scheme, will receive their payment in the coming weeks.  The only way in which we can get ourselves out of the current situation is to work hard together, as Government, turf-cutters, community leaders, landowners and non-governmental organisations, to find solutions to our problems.  The work of the IFA and the TCCA has been invaluable in helping us all find a way around what appear like insurmountable challenges.  I am committed to working closely with them, and with all groups represented on the Peatlands Council, including the environmental non-governmental groups, to work through all the issues in the months and years ahead.  Our focus will be on those citizens who are being expected to bear the burden of these measures on behalf of the wider community.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan for putting this motion to the House.  It is opportune, before the turf-cutting season normally commences.  I also thank Deputies Pringle and Clare Daly for their contributions. In response to Deputy Clare Daly, regarding consultation and my involvement in that process, there has been more consultation and communication in the past 12 months than in the previous 20 years.  The first action I took when I got this job was to go to Roscommon and Galway and take a helicopter ride with Deputies Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan and Naughten and the chairman of the TCCA, Mr. Michael Fitzmaurice.  Unfortunately, there was not room in the helicopter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>No-one can accuse me of not engaging with these people.  We then set up the Peatlands Council and there has been constant communication in the past 12 months.  This Government cannot be accused of ignoring the wishes of these people.</P>
        <P>We have made significant progress since.  I thank everybody concerned because I know how difficult this is for those cutting turf on bogs.  The one bog, unfortunately for me, that was designated in Kerry was where my great-grandfather, grand-uncles and grandfather, and now cousins, cut.  I must meet these people on a regular basis.  It is not nice every Saturday when I have my clinic in Listowel, which is very busy, to see a large number of people on the square.  Even the week before last, they came all the way from Galway.</P>
        <P>It is not easy for any of us.  This is a difficult issue and I am doing my best to have it resolved.  I was given this challenge and I intend to see it through.  However, it needs co-operation between the turf-cutters, the landowners, the contractors, Government and, more importantly, the Commission.  I was delighted that last week Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan went to meet the Commission.  That engagement should have happened years ago.  The Deputy now has a clear understanding of the challenges that any Government would face.</P>
        <P>At the end of January 2011, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, got a letter of formal notice from the Commission stating clearly that it was not happy with the way Ireland was transposing the directive into Irish law and that the Commissioner was starting proceedings to take Ireland to court.  In June, we got a reasoned opinion.  This is really far advanced.  I do not wish to scare anybody, but I believe the Commission will move, if we do not move, on payment of up to &euro;9 million a year to Europe when we can find alternatives.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan for moving this motion and I commend the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the House, with the additional commitments to act on Mr. Judge Quirke&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughtonJnr"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul J. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I have in common with Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan the fact that the bog in my area of Mountbellew is one of those in the SAC area that has been designated to be taken over at the end of this year.  As much as I am an elected representative, I am fully aware of the issues and the hurt, anger and mistrust of people about this issue.  When I first got wind of this news I was 16 years old and at that stage in my life, the idea that we would not be going back to the bog was not the worst news I ever got.  It is amazing 14 years later how my opinion has changed drastically.</P>
        <P>My party has been in government for 12 months and this is an issue that has come to bear on us.  There were ten years in which nothing whatsoever was done with this issue.  Unfortunately, among many of those whom I represent there was a false belief that this issue would go away and that if we did nothing, the European Commission would not come back knocking on the door to see what we were doing about it.  Unfortunately, that is not the case and in the past few years, it has come back to bite us in a big way.</P>
        <P>Many Deputies elected to this D&aacute;il probably do not fully understand the issue.  The people I represent are honest decent people who have been cutting turf for generations and who had hoped to pass on the bogs to their sons and daughters and their families coming down the line.  That was the aim.  None of these people believed they were breaking the law or doing anything wrong.  Everything that I have done in the past 12 months is to represent those people.  My concerns were never with the Government or with the Commission; they were with the rights of those people to cut turf. We have been backed into a corner and we have had to come up with solutions to this.  The one issue that has been raised in this regard, and towards which we are working, is relocation.</P><Col N="93"/>
        <P>Relocation is a solution we have made happen in our bog in Mountbellew which takes in Carrownnagappal and Curraghlehannagh bogs.  The issue here is that people want to cut turf.  There are many issues with this.  It is not as simple as saying we have found a bog down the road, let us move there, job done.  A lot more work goes into it.</P>
        <P>I thank Dr. Conor Skehan for the work he has put in.  The biggest problem we faced when beginning the process 12 months ago, as Deputy Clare Daly said, was mistrust.  People did not trust the Government, Departments or officials.  All they had been receiving for years was threatening letters stating what would happen to them if they did not get off bogs, which was a ridiculous way to treat anybody.  Some were elderly persons who were cutting a few hoppers of turf to heat their house for the winter.  To see them receiving threatening letters from people they did not know was ridiculous.</P>
        <P>The first thing we did was to bring Dr. Skehan to our bog.  Deputy Clare Daly said she had met many of the people affected in town hall meetings.  We did not meet in the town hall, rather we met on the bog.  At 10 a.m. on a Saturday morning we met our neighbours, cousins and friends.  We first had to explain to them what was going on, why they were receiving threatening letters and why they, as honest and decent individuals, were being treated as if they were criminals, which was completely unacceptable.  It is to Dr. Skehan&rsquo;s credit that we began to build trust.  However, it was not done on one morning.  It took many months to get people to believe they could trust the Government, the State and the officials on what they wanted to do.</P>
        <P>Many issues arose.  What Deputy Flanagan has said is true.  Of those involved on 55 bogs, we understand many of them can be relocated, but if people are to be relocated under the new proposal, every case must be seen as unique.  For example, we were never going to move to a bog many miles away.  Therefore, the first point is that people want to be relocated to bog close to them.  The second concerns the quality of turf available.  We were not going to move from a bog which provided a very good source of fuel to one where the quality was not as good.  The third and most important point is that we had to work with those who wanted to move and those who wanted compensation.  There are those who genuinely want compensation and it is their right to seek it.  In that process which has taken well over six months to complete there has been a lot of hard work and consultation which had been sadly lacking for ten years.</P>
        <P>Deputy Thomas Pringle said he was afraid this issue might be linked with the upcoming referendum on the fiscal compact treaty.  I assure him that issue was not discussed once in recent months in Mountbellew or Newbridge for that matter.  I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows many of those about whom I am talking.  The fiscal compact treaty was not mentioned.  It was about one simple issue &mdash; cutting turf.  It was about the ability to cut turf, store it and bring it home, nothing more.</P>
        <P>My father would certainly not have moved if the conditions were not right.  We had to get the people to trust us on this issue.  We had to tell them how the process was going to work.  They had been let down for ten or 12 years by a decision we had to take on board.  If we are going to get through this, we have to work together.  I acknowledge the role played by the TCCA because the issue had continued for a long time.  The TCCA had continued to raise it and inform people about what was happening.  We were getting to a stage at which, every day, someone was receiving a threatening letter stating what would happen if he or she did not comply with the law, which was ridiculous.  In the past six months, however, we have built trust that this can and will work.  I am happy to say that in the past four weeks machines have moved into the bog at Killasolan just outside Mountbellew to begin to renovate it.  Two weeks ago we brought the people who had signed contracts to their new location.  We have now decided that they will be with us every step we take.  They will be the final judges; they are the ones who <Col N="94"/>are telling us whether we are doing it right or wrong.  We wanted to show them that by taking a leap of faith and moving with us we would see work being done.</P>
        <P>I would not stand over anyone&rsquo;s decision to relocate if he or she did not believe the Government was serious about renovating the bog to which he or she was moving.  As I said, we brought people there two weeks ago, with Dr. Skehan and Mr. Conor &Oacute; Raghallaigh of the National Parks and Wildlife Service present to supervise the work which is continuing.  The hope is the people concerned will be able to cut turf there the year after next, which is why I welcome the increase in the allocation of turf.  Approximately 35 to 40 people moved as part of the relocation and every case is different in that some cut for themselves, some for their family and some for relations.  That is what will have to happen from now on.</P>
        <P>I welcome Mr. Justice Quirke&rsquo;s report and the TCCA submission as they have a very good understanding of the position on the majority of bogs and of how the process will work and be implemented.  However, it has not been easy up to this point and it will not be easy in the future.  For every bog, there are 50, 60 or 70 people, all with different requirements and who will cut different amounts of turf.  We will have to ensure we deal with them on an individual basis and understand their concerns.  For too long, we did not bring people with us and they were ignored.  They were not told the truth.  We have to change this.</P>
        <P>I want to see everyone working together, whether it be the Peatlands Council, Bord na M&oacute;na, the National Parks and Wildlife Servide, the Department and the TCCA.  The only solution is to find the places to which people can relocate and set out a clear management plan for these bogs.  The most important point is to keep people informed of what we are doing.  A good start was made in Athlone last week which will have helped to build trust.  However, we cannot afford to continue for another six or 12 months without further consultation.  The more we keep people informed, the more they will feel they will have an opportunity to engage in the process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank Mr. Gerry McNally of Bord na M&oacute;na whom we found to be extremely helpful in sourcing new bogs and learning how we could develop them.  It is through that level of expertise and through such individuals in State bodies that we will be able to push on and genuinely solve the problem.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that relocation will be tougher in some instances and nigh on impossible in others.  We will have to work with the Commission on these issues.  These are issues in south Galway at Barroughter and Clonmoylan bogs and probably at Mouds bog in County Kildare.  The people concerned cannot be ignored.  The task for them and the Government is tougher, but they cannot be ignored.  Whatever we can do to solve the problems faced must be done and should be done immediately, where possible.  In the case of the bogs near Mountbellew &mdash; Carrownagappal and Curraghlehannagh bogs &mdash; we were able to find out quickly where the new bog was located and move to it.</P>
        <P>This has been a thorny issue for the past 12 months, but it had been ignored for 12 years.  We have done everything we can to restore the trust of the people involved, which has not been easy.  However, I have seen at first-hand how relocation can work.  Let us be very clear: it is not an easy path to follow.  The most important people are the turf cutters &mdash; my family, friends and neighbours &mdash; and they must be consulted every step of the way.  If we are to do anything, we must build trust among all those involved.  Trust had broken down, including last summer owing to the way departmental officials had treated those who were cutting turf, which was wrong.  We need to start from the base provided by the forum held last week in Athlone, to use what we achieved in Mountbellew and began at Clara.  Let us push on from here and <Col N="95"/>show that relocation can work, but let us not forget those who are working in very difficult bogs and who have as much of a right to cut turf in another bog as anyone else.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this issue.  My colleague, Deputy Troy, would like to be here as he has been very involved in this issue, but, unfortunately, he cannot be present owing to another engagement.</P>
        <P>We should go back to the beginning of this saga.  In 1997 the rainbow coalition Government signed the habitats directive into law.  I can remember the D&aacute;il debate held at the time on the issue with the then Minister, Mr. Michael D. Higgins, now President.  When Ms S&iacute;le de Valera and I entered the Department, we were both involved in the debate on the SAC issue, central to which was the raised bogs issue.</P>
        <P>It is absolutely true to say we never received a ten year derogation from the authorities in Brussels because they were never going to agree to one.  What we did &mdash; what Governments need to do in such instances &mdash; was we travelled to Brussels to tell the officials we would offer a ten year derogation to domestic bog cutters and arrange to remove the commercial turf cutters who accounted for a figure of 96% of the effort, if memory serves me correctly.  However, the European Union stated it was not going to extend an official derogation, but that it would not interfere in providing for the introduction of a ten year period.  I regret that within that ten years the Department was not more proactive in doing what the previous and current Governments have done to resolve the issue.  I have recognised for many years, and I am glad there has been a conversion on the Government side, that the European Union would take Ireland to court if there was not conservation of raised bog.  I am pleased there appears to be a consensus on all sides that raised bogs must be conserved.  I understand the proposals put forward by the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association recognise this and also that if any of the designated bogs continue to be cut, the preserved bog would be supplemented by compensatory bog that has not been designated to date and which would be of equal quality.</P>
        <P>The elements of the plan that are being put forward now were put on the table some years ago, these being that one could have a choice between cash, relocation or turf delivered to the door.  An argument arose about the duration of these compensatory arrangements and the amount.  Some progress was made, particularly in County Offaly, about which my colleague, Deputy Barry Cowen, will speak.  Even though as Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs I had no ministerial responsibility for this area, I was involved in discussions two years ago with various interests with a view to progressing the issue.  When I was Minister at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for a short time last year, the officials and I came up with the concept of Comhairle na bPortach.  It a nicety to give these organisations an Irish language title, although it is now called the Peatlands Council.  The great advantage of the Irish language is that peat and turf are the same in Irish.  A portach is a bog and m&oacute;in is turf.  To a country person, peat does not sound as homely as turf but we will not get into the semantics of language.  I was preparing a memorandum for Government, a copy of which I kept until the day the new Government assumed office and a copy of which the Minister will find in the files of the Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  I am glad the Minister did the same eye-balling.  The officials were telephoning me every day to send a letter to Brussels but I refused to do so.  I said the only letter I would send back would be one much more negative than their letter.  They took their chances with the Minister, who would be more moderate than me on these issues in terms of standing our ground.  I was told at that time that it would not be possible to cut turf last year, when it was.  It was wrong advice, I did not believe it, and I am glad the Minister succeeded on following through on what I had been doing in terms of not stopping people from cutting turf last year.  That was a right decision for the Minister to make and on which I commend him.  Progress has been made.</P>

	<P>I wish to provide some background to the debate.  I acknowledge and pay tribute to Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan for tabling the motion and the Minister for his response which goes some way without going the whole way.  The real background to the debate concerns issues in regard to fuel poverty and rural incomes.</P>
        <P>Rural household incomes in the midlands are 9.4% below the national average.  The majority of affected bogs are located in counties with the lowest disposable income.  This must be a central factor when making arrangements to stop cutting turf.  Turf is a very inexpensive source of fuel, being up to 60% cheaper than oil.  The cost of turf is in the labour.</P>
        <P>A cessation policy will expose another significant number of households to fuel poverty.  It is estimated that between 4,000 and 5,000 households will be directly effected by outright cessation.  Many at risk of fuel poverty face costs of converting existing heating systems and would need to purchase more expensive fuels.  Their needs must be given priority.  We have had derogations for ten years with further derogations for certain bogs for one year at a time since, with 75 natural heritage areas concluding at the end of 2013.</P>
        <P>Last year, during the course of the general election when the issue was live in rural and midland constituencies, we had wild abandon from certain Members of the Minister&rsquo;s Party and the Labour Party who made cynical promises calling for the ban to be lifted without acknowledging the templates for resolution that had just been put in place.  I acknowledge he has now used those in instances and has provided for improvements in those templates. <Col N="98"/> However, I remind the Minister there were cynical calls and much politics played by the Government side this time last year.</P>
        <P>As a public representative in recent years, especially as a councillor, I have dealt with three different classes of turf cutters in efforts to resolve these issues with real and workable solutions.  The first are those who have or had title to turf banks or turbary rights and who cut for their heating needs annually.  Second, there are those who did not necessarily have title or turbary rights but who cut annually for their families on lands or bogs known as commonage.  Third, there are those families whose area of bog extends well beyond what might be expected to be a life time area of ground for cutting.  As stated, one acre of bog equals roughly 60 years supply.  While some of those involved are commercial cutters they are serving the needs of those who have no access to turf, which must be acknowledged.</P>
        <P>In my experience, a solution for the first category has been available for the past six to 12 months.  An example in this regard is the bog in my own area of Clara and The Island in respect of which families and turf cutters have engaged through Irish Rural Link with the OPW, the IFA, Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte and come up with credible and flexible solutions in the form of an alternative bog four or five miles away.  In many instances, the bogs given to these familes are even more productive and will be longer lasting than were those in which they were cutting in the first instance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In some cases, the option of funding towards conversion was accepted.  I accept the right of people to do that too.</P>
        <P>The category of cutter on commonage land, such as in Ballinough, has in my experience adhered to the directive but has never been compensated for so doing.  They, too, need to be brought into the fold based on their history of cutting on unencumbered lands.  They should be offered the same compensatory options and rights.  As I stated, the ground on which they cut is not contested and they should, therefore, where they can provide the relevant proof of cutting over time, be entitled to compensation.</P>
        <P>The third category must be recognised as an asset which deserves to be compensated on a per acre basis.  We should not be seeking to allow only one lifetime of cutting for one family, which does not take account of historic value and ownership.  Turf cutting must be recognised as valuable farm or off-farm income.  While what the Minister has brought forward goes some way towards achieving this, it does not go far enough.</P>
        <P>We must compensate acre for acre.  A person who has ten acres of bog is entitled to ten acres compensatory bog.  They should not be entitled to only one acre of bog to provide for their family.  This does not take account of the historic value of an acreage to a particular family and the many generations before them.  These people must be properly compensated.  What the Minister has proposed this evening is the bones of a deal.  It goes much further than what was previously proposed.  The three categories that need to be considered are those who in places such as Mountbellew as mentioned by Deputy Connaughton provide for their immediate families and those in my constituency of Clara who came together to find a solution in respect of provision for themselves and their immediate families; those who cut on commonage and have been left behind because they do not have the type of representation which many others involved in this argument down through the years have or have had and, those who have large holdings who, like it or lump it, are entitled to like for like compensation.</P><Col N="99"/>
        <P>If compensation is to be monetary then there must be comprehensive analysis of land based on the income derived by families in recent years.  It must be remembered that these people provide a source of fuel which keeps so many people out of the fuel poverty trap.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I commend Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan and his colleagues on bringing forth this motion.</P>
        <P>Like others, Sinn F&eacute;in understands, appreciates and supports the need to protect our natural habitat.  Likewise, we support the right of domestic turf cutters to work their own bogs.  Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting this motion, which provides the basis for a comprehensive and reasonable solution to the current impasse.  The options proposed by the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, TCCA, have the potential to serve the best interests of local turf cutters while ensuring the State&rsquo;s full compliance with the habitats directive.</P>
        <P>This is a hugely emotive and important issue countrywide.  People in Cavan, Meath, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Mayo, Sligo, Offaly, Laois, Roscommon, Tipperary, Westmeath, Longford, Monaghan, Clare and the surrounding areas are affected.  Tradition, heritage, natural and cultural, economy, fuel, energy, heat and a way of life are some of the factors at play.  The Turf Cutters and Contractors Assocation, TCCA, with others, has done considerable work to find reasonable solutions for its members and Government.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s acceptance of the Quirke report which for the first time confirms the undeniable breakdown of communication and trust between the relevant parties, which may be difficult to resolve.  It has long been recognised that consecutive Governments have failed in their obligations to ordinary turf cutters.  It is hoped we will now see complete and comprehensive engagement with local turf cutters on a case by case to ensure reasonable agreements are made in all individual cases.</P>
        <P>There is without doubt potential for a win-win scenario, thus turf cutters can continue to cut turf and the State can meet its obligations to Europe.  This is what we need without delay.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan and all others associated with tabling this motion tonight.  This motion reflects the genuine and continued commitment of rural Deputies to addressing issues affecting rural Ireland.  I support this motion and the proposals made by the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, TCCA, in regard to the accommodation of turbary rights with the need to protect the natural habitat.</P>
        <P>This motion stresses the need to balance conservation as laid down in directives with the traditional right of people to utilise local natural resources, as they have done for a long time without causing serious environmental damage.  Key to all of this, and indeed other issues which are currently the cause of great concern in rural communities, is that faceless bureaucrats, often not even resident in or familiar with any part of this country, are laying down decrees with regard to important issues.  I have witnessed this many times before, including in regard to the fishing communities where a traditional way of life and a source of great potential for development has been restricted and, some would argue, condemned to slow death by the surrender of control to bureaucrats who are not interested in the needs of fishing communities and may in fact be outright hostile to them.  The Minister needs no reminding of what happened to drift salmon in our constituency and the consequences in that regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister will be aware of the anger that has been generated in relation to the Moanveanlagh raised bog outside Listowel.  It is the only bog in Kerry to which the ban is to be applied.  However, turf cutters there have insisted they will not be prevented from cutting turf after 1 April.  The Minister referred earlier to ongoing pickets outside his constituency office.  Many of <Col N="100"/>those picketing are personal friends of the Minister, which gives some indication of how deeply angry people are about this.  Many of them are, perhaps, Fine Gael supporters.</P>
        <P>The point has been made by the Kerry Turf Cutters Association that the State has refused to engage with them despite that they have come up with detailed and imaginative proposals which they believe form the basis of a solution, taking into account the various concerns and interests.  This is again illustrative of the lack of engagement with communities.  I am pleased to note that the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, has welcomed the association&rsquo;s proposals on relocation claims and has directed his officials to study them .</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s acceptance of the Qurike report on the national plan.  This matter can only be resolved by people sitting down together to find a solution which takes into account the rights of people involved in this area for many years.  This matter can be resolved.  The Minister has the power to do it.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware my Department was established on 2nd June 2011.  A total of 26 civil servants have left my Department between that date and the expiry of the grace period on 29th February 2012. In relation to the public servants employed in the bodies funded from my Department&rsquo;s Vote Group, I am advised that 70 public servants have left those bodies between 1st January 2010 and 29th February 2012.</P>
        <P>In relation to the issue of contingency plans to ensure continuity of service, I can advise the Deputy that my Department, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has reviewed staffing arrangements and vacancies arising across my Department with a view to ensuring the continued effective delivery of priority and key services. In line with the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, vacancies arising from recent staff retirements are being managed through effective use of redeployment, workforce planning and business process redesign.</P>
        <P>It will, however, be necessary to fill a small number of posts in the heritage area over the coming months so that Ireland can continue to meet its EU commitments and obligations. In this regard, I am pleased to be able to advise the Deputy that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has sanctioned an exemption from the moratorium to facilitate the filling of a number of these posts identified as being of particular importance.</P>
        <P>Regarding bodies from my Department&rsquo;s Vote Group, arrangements are being made by local management, in line with the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, to ensure continued delivery of services.  These bodies are in ongoing liaison with my Department concerning the filling of specialist posts as they arise.  In this regard, I can advise the Deputy that interim arrangements to ensure the filling of certain statutory posts, pending the development of firm proposals in relation to the merger of national cultural institutions, have been sanctioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to a number of previous Parliamentary Questions on this matter.  As previously stated, I have met the chair and chief executive of NAMA in relation to the potential use of NAMA buildings for cultural purposes.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, NAMA was set up to acquire loans from certain financial institutions and it does not own property as such. Accordingly, there is no list of properties that could be made available for use as arts facilities. In most cases, the property securing these loans is under the control of the debtor and will remain so as long as the debtor continues to meet his obligations. In the case of certain debtors, NAMA has taken enforcement action and the property securing the loans is now under the control of receivers or other insolvency agents appointed by NAMA.  Engagement is ongoing with NAMA in relation to assets of interest from a cultural perspective. The re-opening of the Lighthouse Cinema in Smithfield is a case in point.</P>

	<P>My Department and the institutions which it funds continue to work closely with the tourism agencies, at home and abroad, to promote cultural tourism. In that context, there are a number of standout initiatives, and a whole host of ongoing events of note, especially Culture Night. In 2011, it took place on September 23rd in a record 30 towns and cities throughout the island of Ireland, showcasing the best of our artistic and cultural heritage and facilities. It is estimated that upwards of 200,000 participated in the event in 2011, with over 150 cultural venues in Dublin alone welcoming visitors until late in the evening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Arising from discussions at the Dublin Castle Global Irish Economic Forum on the most appropriate way to increase the impact and popularity of Culture Night for 2012 and beyond, it is proposed to designate St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day as the <i>International Day of Irish Culture,</i> thereby building on solid foundations already in place. Discussions are ongoing with all relevant stakeholders as to the exact format and scope of such an event, which will depend also on the amount of funding that is available. I also propose to deepen the engagement with Music Day, scheduled this year for 21st June, and create a further cultural pivot point at a key moment during the year. In that way, there will be three main national cultural focus points throughout the year &mdash; St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day in spring, Music Day at midsummer, and Culture Night in the autumn.</P>
        <P>The National Cultural Institutions and other cultural venues supported by my Department play a very significant role in Ireland&rsquo;s cultural tourism product. In 2011, there were over 3.6 million visitors to such institutions and venues. At the moment, they and the Arts Council are being activated to support both <i>The Gathering</i>   and our upcoming EU Presidency Cultural programme.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will appreciate that, at present, there are two EU programmes operating within the areas for which I have responsibility:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. The Media Programme is the EU support programme for the European audiovisual industry and details are available at <i>www.mediadeskireland.ie</i>; and</P>

        <P>I am not aware of a fund of &euro;70 billion of the nature referred to by the Deputy, either at EU level or elsewhere.  There are, however, discussions currently underway between the Member States and the European Commission on a new framework programme for the cultural and creative sectors, for which a budget of some &euro;1,800 million is mooted.  This would run from 2014 to 2020 and be called the Creative Europe Programme.  This is far from finalised and it <Col N="106"/>will have to be considered in the context of the overall EU Budget.  It includes a proposal to amalgamate the current Culture and MEDIA programmes under a common framework and to create an entirely new facility to improve access to finance.</P>

	<P>The recent visit to Ireland of Vice President Xi Jinping provided a major boost to the profile of Irish culture and heritage in China, as well as strengthening our overall relationship with the People&rsquo;s Republic and with their most senior leadership.  During his time in Ireland, Vice President Xi visited Bunratty Castle and Folk Park, and this focus on Ireland&rsquo;s historic heritage was continued and enhanced with his visit to the Cliffs of Moher.  On the final evening of the visit, at Vice-President Xi&rsquo;s request, the Government organised a special performance of <i>Riverdance</i>, which took place in Dublin in honour of the Vice President and his delegation, building on the extraordinary success and impact that this show has generated in China over the last decade.</P>
        <P>International coverage of the visit was extensive both in China and worldwide.  The Xinhua News Agency covered the entire visit and reports appeared on Shanghai TV and Shanghai Oriental TV and in The Shanghai Daily, China Daily, Shanghai Morning Post, Beijing Daily, Can Kao Xiao Xi and the South China Morning Post.  Positive reports by agencies such as Bloomberg, Reuters and AFP appeared elsewhere in the Straits Times, the Nikkei Shinbum, the Mainichi, the Asahi, the Financial Times Deutschland, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Les Echos, Canada&rsquo;s Globe and Mail, the Ottawa Citizen, the Vancouver Sun, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, The Times and the Financial Times.  France 24 also covered the visit.  Given this extensive coverage, I expect the benefit both to cultural and heritage tourism and to Ireland&rsquo;s cultural profile generally to be very significant.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) Plenary Meeting in July 2007 agreed to proceed with the restoration of the section of the Ulster Canal between Clones and Upper Lough Erne. The then Government agreed to cover the full capital costs of the project, which were estimated at that time to be of the order of &euro;35m. However, Government Accounting procedures do not provide, in that sense, for the &lsquo;ring-fencing&rsquo; of funds for projects of this nature.</P>
        <P>I am advised that it was always the intention that the Ulster Canal project would be funded from the Waterways Ireland annual allocations, as agreed through the annual estimates processes in this jurisdiction, as well as the deliberations of NSMC in relation to annual budgets. I am advised that it was also a key consideration throughout the process that the Ulster Canal project would be supported by a significant level of projected income from the commercialisation of certain Waterways Ireland assets &mdash; a scenario that was affected negatively by the economic downturn.</P>
        <P>It was noted at the NSMC Plenary Meeting held in Armagh on 18 November 2011 that the Ulster Canal project is progressing incrementally.  Planning applications were lodged by Waterways Ireland with Monaghan County Council, Clones Town Council and Cavan County Council on 25 October 2011 and with the Department of the Environment Planning Service Northern Ireland on 28 October 2011. I am informed that Cavan County Council has granted planning permission.  Monaghan County Council and Clones Town Council have requested additional information.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree that this is a significant milestone for the project.</P>
        <P>I am continuing to explore all possible options to advance this project. In this regard, towards the end of last year, I met with senior officials of Monaghan County Council, Fermanagh District Council and Waterways Ireland to discuss approaches to setting up an inter-agency group that could examine ways in helping to advance the Ulster Canal project.  Officials of my Department are currently finalising the terms of reference for the inter-agency group.  I look forward to that work continuing in the period ahead.</P>

	<P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I am acutely aware of the beneficial effects of arts in the community, both from the aspect of individual participation and that of community involvement, as well as their potential for impact in addressing social inclusion issues.  The Government&rsquo;s priorities for the arts are set out in the Programme for Government. Responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved primarily to the Arts Council, as the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts.  The Council is a statu<Col N="108"/>torily independent body, funded by my Department, and independent in its day-to-day operations, including in relation to its funding decisions.</P>
        <P>I should also point out that over 80 projects received capital funding under the ACCESS and Arts Capital schemes operated by my Department.  These projects &mdash; situated in the heart of communities &mdash; assist in local arts endeavours and I would urge communities to support and participate in the many and diverse range of activities offered by them throughout the State.  Since taking office, I have engaged extensively with the arts community at local and national levels.  Following dialogue with local arts officers, a pilot interactive strategy has been put in place, which, I believe, will lead to more co-ordination in arts and culture activities at community and at local level.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 91 together.</P>
        <P>Positioned at the core of local, regional, urban and rural activities, the arts, creative and heritage-related sectors play a pivotal part in the economic life of communities across the country, including the vital area of employment.  Employment in the arts sector embraces a diverse and broad extent of activities, encompassing those engaged in specific arts practice, as well associated wider elements.  I believe strongly that cultural tourism can contribute in a significant way to the development of the economy and the creation of jobs.  A 2011 study by Indecon showed that total employment in the wider arts sector, which includes film and video, museums and other cultural activities, literature and publishing, amounted to 21,300 and contributed &euro;716m in Gross Value Added to the economy in 2010.</P>

        <P>The potential for the development of the Irish audiovisual industry is set out in the Creative Capital Report &mdash; <i>Building Ireland&rsquo;s Audiovisual Creative Economy, </i>which I<i> </i>  published last summer.  The advancement of its recommendations is being examined by an Implementation Committee at present.</P>

	<P>Due to the current national economic difficulties and the significant reductions in the capital allocations provided to my Department, the resources available to me for the provision of grants for the protection of the built heritage are limited. However, my Department will continue to provide funding for the protection, conservation and development of our built heritage, insofar as resources allow.</P>
        <P>In 2011, my Department provided &euro;650,000 through a &ldquo;Structures at Risk Fund&rdquo; to assist with works to safeguard structures, both in private and civic ownership, protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. This fund was administered by local authorities and was focused primarily on those protected structures most at risk. My Department also provided a further &euro;1.25 million in capital assistance to the Office of Public Works in 2011 to assist in the conservation and presentation of historic properties and national monuments in State care.  I intend to provide an allocation for the Structures at Risk Fund and capital assistance to the OPW in 2012 and I will be notifying both the local authorities and the OPW of the details shortly.</P>
        <P>My Department also provided funding of almost &euro;7.5 million to support the work of the Heritage Council in 2011, which included &euro;1.5 million made available from the Environment Fund. The Heritage Council supports a number of conservation grants schemes and my Department will be providing an allocation to the Council in order to assist these schemes in 2012.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the All-Party Oireachtas Consultation Group on Commemorations, which I chair, was recently strengthened by expanding its membership. Since then, the Group has met on two occasions, the most recent meeting being on 21st February.  It will meet again on this afternoon.</P>
        <P>The Group now includes the Minister of State at my Department, Mr Dinny McGinley, T.D., Ms Heather Humphries, TD, Mr Michael Conaghan, TD, Ms Anne Ferris, TD, Senator Mary White, Senator Mark Daly, Mr Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh, TD, Senator Kathryn Reilly, Ms Mary O&rsquo;Sullivan TD, Ms Catherine Murphy TD and Senator Dr Martin McAleese. While it is envisaged that the framework for commemorations of the decade of centenaries relating to the period 2012-2022 will be developed by officials and approved by Government, it is intended that particular commemorative initiatives and the arrangements for them will be brought to the attention of the All-Party Group.</P>
        <P>I would also report the establishment of an Expert Advisory Group of eminent historians, chaired by Dr Maurice Manning, supported by Dr Martin Mansergh. This Group will advise Government and the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on both the overall commemorative programme and on any specific issues which may arise. In particular, it will seek to set a tone that is inclusive and non-triumphalist, ensuring authenticity, proportionality and openness. It hopes to consult widely with scholars, with universities, with educational and cultural bodies, with local historical associations and committees, and with individuals, where appropriate.  It will seek to encourage original research at local and national level, at all times acknowledging the identities and traditions which are part of the historic story of the island of Ireland and Irish people worldwide.</P>
        <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that there has been a significant level of engagement with various interested parties in regard to the commemorations programme, including on both a North/South and an East/West basis. I hope to attend commemoration events in Belfast and London later this month, with further events planned in succeeding months for Dublin, Belfast and Waterford.  From an overall perspective, the Government&rsquo;s approach to these commemorations will seek to respect historical accuracy, promote tolerance, respect and inclusiveness, and recognise the All-Island and East/West shared past nature of the decade.</P>

	<P>The exact information requested by the Deputy is not available. The Farm Structure Survey in 2007 indicated that there were 21,300 farms with dairy cows in the State, of which 19,400 were classified as specialist   dairy farms under the farm typology classification (i.e. dairying was estimated to account for two thirds or more of the total gross margin on the farm).  It was estimated that there were 43,700 people employed on specialist dairy farms, comprising of 19,100 holders, 8,300 spouses of holders, 12,800 other family members and 3,500 regular non-family workers.</P>
        <P>The June 2010 Census of Agriculture recorded a total of 27,414 farms with dairy cows. However, this includes many small dairy herds; 18,458 farms had 10 or more dairy cows. Data on the farm typology and farm labour force in 2010 is being compiled and will be available in the fourth quarter of this year.  The annual Census of Industrial Production provides detailed structural statistics on manufacturing industry, including the dairy sector which comprises the Operation of Dairies, Cheese Making and the Manufacture of Ice-cream. There were 5,040 persons engaged in the dairy sector in 2008 and this  fell to 4,922 in 2009.  Corresponding data for 2010 will be published by June 2012.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I met representatives of the opposition parties and the D&aacute;il Technical Group on 28 February to consult them on the Government&rsquo;s proposals for the Constitutional Convention.  They undertook to revert to me with their views within a week, following which a further meeting is envisaged.  The Government&rsquo;s proposals for the Convention, including its composition, have been made public on <i>www.merrionstreet.ie</i>. We propose that the Convention should consist of 100 members, including a chairperson. Some 66 members would be ordinary citizens. The remaining 33 would be made up of Oireachtas members and one parliamentarian from each of the political parties in Northern Ireland which accept an invitation to be represented.</P>
        <P>The Government is conscious that a number of organisations, representing various interests, have signalled a desire to be members of the Convention.  However, as indicated above, the Convention is intended to be a forum mainly for ordinary citizens. Of course, the Convention can invite such organisations to make a presentation when matters in which they have a particular interest are being examined. They will of course also be able to make written submissions on any topic.</P>

	<P>The Government decided to proceed with Ireland&rsquo;s signature of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on 21 February 2012. Arrangements are now being made for signature, which will take place shortly.  Ratification of the Optional Protocol is a separate step, which must be preceded by a thorough screening of the obligations to be assumed, and will be considered in due course.</P>
        <P>The Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights opened for signature in New York in September 2009. To date thirty nine (39) States have signed. Nine European Union member states have signed. Seven States have ratified the Optional Protocol: Argentina, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mongolia and Spain. The Optional Protocol will come into force three months after the deposit with the United Nations Secretary General of the tenth instrument of ratification or accession. As only seven States have ratified the Optional Protocol so far it has not yet come into force.</P>

        <P>Below in tabular format is a statistical breakdown of the Freedom of Information Requests processed by my Department since 2002 and the fees associated with such requests.  Fees in respect of requests for access to non-personal information and requests for internal review were introduced in July 2003, in accordance with the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003.</P>
        <P>My Department makes every effort to work with requesters to reduce the cost of Search and Retrieval fees, which are generally incurred where the request ranges over a large volume of records or a significant time period. Less than 10 per cent of all requests did not proceed where Search and Retrieval fees were sought.  It is the policy of my Department to make all requests and replies made under the Freedom of Information Act, which are not of a personal nature, publicly available. The Freedom of Information Requests Database is available on the website of my Department (<i>www.dfa.ie</i>) and contains copies of the non-personal requests made since April 2004.</P>

	<P>In 2011, Argentina was Ireland&rsquo;s 44th largest trading partner.  Total merchandise trade stood at &euro;227,777,000, a 37.8% increase over 2010.  Exports were valued at &euro;60,261,000; imports at &euro;167,516,000.  The principal exports were medical and pharmaceutical products, and office machines and data processing machines.  The principal imports were foodstuffs for animals &mdash; which account for about 60% of imports &mdash; and essential oils, used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware that the government is committed to increasing Ireland&rsquo;s exports as a key element of economic growth; part of this strategy is to develop the potential of existing <Col N="117"/>export markets.  Argentina has not been identified as a priority market under the government&rsquo;s Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy.  It is recognised, however that that there are niche opportunities there for Irish companies in specific sectors.  The government and state agencies will continue to support Irish companies in accessing those opportunities in Argentina.</P>

Ireland, and other EU member states, supports an annual draft resolution at the UN General Assembly introduced by Cuba rejecting the extraterritorial effects of the US embargo, most recently on 25 October 2011.  We and our EU partners are not persuaded that the continued embargo on Cuba is contributing in a positive way to the democratic transition in Cuba; this position has been expressed on many occasions in contacts with the United States.</P>

The committee&rsquo;s most recent resolution was adopted on 21 June 2011.</P>
        <P>In this resolution, the special committee on decolonisation called for a peaceful negotiated settlement of the sovereignty dispute and expressed regret that implementation of resolutions adopted by the committee in the past had not started in spite of widespread international support for negotiations between the two governments.  In addition, the committee requested the two countries to consolidate the current &ldquo;process of dialogue and cooperation&rdquo; by resuming negotiations in order to find, as soon as possible, a peaceful solution to their sovereignty dispute.  I would encourage both countries to resume their negotiations in the interest of pursuing a peaceful resolution of their differences on this matter.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that non-established businesses that incur VAT in one Member State for the purposes of their taxable business in another Member State are entitled to a refund of that VAT where certain conditions are met. EU Council Directive 2008/9/EEC sets out those conditions and the claims for refund are processed through the Electronic VAT Refund (EVR) system.</P>
        <P>Passenger transport is an exempt activity and VAT is not refundable in respect of such activity, except in limited circumstances where a taxable person established in the State is engaged in the transport of passengers who are picked up from a destination in the State and transported to a destination outside the State. In 2011 Revenue undertook a review of domestic and EU legislation in relation to Electronic VAT Refunds, including the VAT and EVR Directives and ECJ judgements concerning interpretation of the latter Directive and the criteria governing entitlement to refunds set out therein. The review has clarified particular aspects of the Directive as it relates to VAT incurred for the purposes of carrying on activities that are taxable in the Member State in which the business is established but which are exempt in the Member State of Refund. Revenue have concluded that non-established passenger transport operators are not entitled to refunds of VAT, whether that service takes place wholly or partially in the State or whether it takes place wholly outside the State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The tax deduction introduced by the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Act 1992 applies in respect of the expense incurred in maintaining a second residence. The legislation does not specify the nature that a second residence has to take. Accordingly, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have set out their views on how they will grant the deduction in three possible scenarios &mdash; where a Minister owns a second residence, where a second residence is rented and where a second residence consists of hotel or guesthouse accommodation.  These were outlined in my reply to the previous Parliamanetary Questions referred to by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>As regards Ministers who avail of hotel or guesthouse accommodation, as an alternative to the actual vouched additional expenses incurred in living away from home, the Revenue Commissioners are prepared to accept that an annual claim in the amount of &euro;3,500 represents a reasonable estimate of the amount of such expenses, and I am advised that they have no plans to review this amount.  As with all tax measures, the Dual Abode Allowance remains under constant review.  However, I do not intend to amend the scheme at this time.</P>

	<P>The proposed betting (Amendment) Bill, which is being drafted at present, will amend the 1931 Betting Act to inter alia establish the regulatory framework for the licensing of remote bookmakers and betting exchanges, including measures to enforce the regulatory framework. The drafting of the Bill, which is fairly complex, is well advanced.  The Finance Act 2011 contained measures to allow for the extension of the 1% betting duty to remote bookmakers and for a 15% gross profit tax to betting exchanges. The taxation provisions are subject to a Ministerial Commencement order which can only be commenced when the Betting (Amendment) Bill is enacted.  In relation to the taxation treatment of betting exchanges, it is the operator of the betting exchange that will be liable to the gross profit tax which is also the position in the UK.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that provisions covering the Travel Agents Margin Scheme are contained in Section 88 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010. This scheme, which is provided for in Articles 306 to 310 of the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply, was introduced with effect from 1 January 2010.  Detailed discussions with the travel industry were carried out prior to the introduction of the scheme which is a standard EU-wide Scheme in operation in most Member States of the EU.   The scheme deals with the activities carried on by travel agents who act in the capacity of a principal when supplying certain travel services such as transport, accommodation, etc, which they have bought in from third parties for onward supply to travellers. Travel agents covered by the scheme are liable to VAT on their margin on the services provided rather than the full consideration they receive in respect of the supply of these services.</P>
        <P>The nature of the scheme means that the travel agent only has an obligation to account for VAT on the margin in the country where he/she is established.  The travel agent has no further VAT obligations in places where the travel services are supplied. The travel agent cannot recover any VAT charged when he/she purchases the travel services but this is because VAT is only accounted for on the margin when the services are supplied on to the traveller. The VAT treatment applied under the margin scheme has the same effect as for ordinary traders who account for VAT on the full consideration charged for a supply of goods or services and recover VAT on the purchase of those goods or services. There is no double taxation. Similarly travel agents like other traders can recover VAT on deductible overheads incurred by them in connection with their taxable supplies.</P><Col N="120"/>
        <P>The scheme has benefits for a travel agent in terms of complying with his/her VAT obligations.  In the absence of the scheme a travel agent could have compliance obligations across many Member States of the EU with a resultant increased administrative burden.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that no decision has been taken by them to transfer their payroll section from Ennis to Mayo.   The Government has agreed a strategic approach to progress shared services in all sectors of the Public Service. This is in line with the Programme for Government and the Public Sector Reform Plan and is explicitly provided for in the Croke Park Agreement.  This strategic approach includes proposals for an integrated payroll service on a shared basis for the Civil Service. This is likely to impact on Revenue&rsquo;s payroll section in Ennis.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners are constantly reviewing their processes and procedures to ensure that they are delivering their services in the most efficient and effective manner.  In line with the Government&rsquo;s decision on reducing public sector numbers, Revenue&rsquo;s Employment Control Framework numbers have been reduced significantly for 2012.  This requires Revenue to critically look at all areas of work and redeploy resources to priorities, such as targeting and confronting those who do not comply with their tax and duty obligations. The impact of the Government&rsquo;s decision on payroll shared services on Revenue&rsquo;s payroll section in Ennis will be considered in this context.</P>

	<P>The banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two pillar banks, namely Bank of Ireland and AIB to provide lending in excess of &euro;30 billion in the next three years. SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of &euro;16 to &euro;20 billion over this period. The lending capacity is incorporated into the banks&rsquo; deleveraging plans which allow for repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals over the period to 2013.  It is a commercial decision for each lending institution to decide the amount of deposit that it requires from each borrower who is seeking mortgage approval. It is important that each lending institution is allowed to assess properly and independently the risks when deciding on the level of deposit that it requires.</P>

        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the sale of new houses by a builder or developer is subject to VAT at the reduced rate of 13.5%.  VAT legislation provides that the seller is obliged to remit to the Revenue Commissioners the VAT on the sales, less certain input VAT.  Where, at the time of the sale, the houses are under the control of another person, including a receiver, mortgagee in possession or liquidator, then that other person is obliged to remit the VAT on the sales to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>The legal responsibility for meeting its obligation to account for and pay the VAT rests with the registered business concerned. Any arrangement entered into by the business and any other <Col N="122"/>party in regard to paying VAT is a matter for the business concerned.  I, as Minister for Finance, and the Revenue Commissioners have no function in this regard.</P>
        <P>With regard to the company referred to by the Deputy, a very significant debt is owed by them to Revenue and collection/recovery efforts by Revenue have been unsuccessful. Having regard to the quantum of the debt and the failure of the company to engage with Revenue towards an agreed approach to payment of the debt, Revenue is now proceeding towards a High Court petition for the appointment of a liquidator on the basis that the company is insolvent.</P>

	<P>The 2009 Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Report on the Accounts of the Public Services, in addressing the issue of tobacco smuggling, suggested that, in order to assess the performance of the Revenue container scanners, a comparison of detection rates with those of other countries would be useful.  Revenue commenced such a study in 2011.  This study involves liaison with the relevant administrations of other Member States and with the European Commission&rsquo;s anti-fraud office, OLAF, in order to acquire relevant data that can be used as a reliable benchmark for comparison of scanner detection rates. </P>
        <P>There are inherent difficulties in carrying out this study, which are delaying its completion.  These include the relative scarcity of comparable statistical data that is available internationally on scanner detection rates and sensitivities of some jurisdictions associated with the publication of information in relation to enforcement techniques and methodologies.  It is hoped that the study in question will be completed during 2012.</P>
        <P>Revenue currently has two mobile X-ray container-scanning systems, one of which was acquired in 2007 and the second in 2010. One scanner is based in Dublin Port and the other at Rosslare Ferry Port. However, both scanners are available for deployment at other ports as required. Revenue deploys the scanners on a risk assessment basis at various locations throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they monitor the effectiveness of their programmes and strategies for counteracting the illicit tobacco trade on an ongoing basis.  As part of this process the legislative penalties for excise evasion are regularly assessed in terms of their deterrent value. In this regard the Finance Act 2010 introduced significantly increased monetary penalties for tobacco offences. The penalty for conviction on indictment was increased from &euro;12,695 to &euro;126,950, or up to three times <Col N="123"/>the duty paid value of the goods, whichever is the greater. The new penalties are applicable in respect of court convictions for offences occurring after the passing of that Act.</P>
        <P>The Commissioners are satisfied that the new provisions are working effectively. In addition to monetary penalties imposed on conviction, in 2011 there were forty-five custodial sentences for tobacco tax offences, of which twenty-eight were suspended.  Revenue initiatives to counteract the illicit tobacco trade include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />the establishment of a high level internal group, chaired at Commissioner level, to examine the risks related to tobacco products tax evasion and to oversee and optimise the detection of contraband and counterfeit tobacco products,</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that an authorised dealer is a person who is authorised under section 136 of the Finance Act 1992 (as amended) &ldquo;<i>to manufacture, distribute, deal in, deliver, store, repair or modify unregistered vehicles and to convert registered vehicles</i>&rdquo;.  Authorisation brings a number of responsibilities concerning the management and record keeping in relation to vehicles, responsibilities that are subject to control and scrutiny by the Commissioners.</P>
        <P>Because of the significant amount of relief from both VRT and VAT available to purchasers of vehicles under the Disabled Drivers and Passengers scheme, it is appropriate that vehicles provided under this scheme should be provided by authorised dealers to facilitate the monitoring of various elements of the scheme.  It is not possible to avail of the scheme if a vehicle was purchased privately.  Motor Taxation is a matter for the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.</P>

	<P>Claims for relief from double taxation (&ldquo;correlative adjustments&rdquo;) arise in Ireland as a result of an upward adjustment to company profits in a country with which we have a double taxation treaty.  A company may make a claim for a correlative adjustment to Revenue in Ireland where tax paid in the other country is increased as a result of such an upward adjustment and the associated company in the other country has agreed to such upward adjustment.  Each claim is examined by Revenue and an appropriate amount of relief from double taxation is agreed.     The number of correlative adjustment claims and the amount of tax relief granted in respect of those claims for each of the years 2005 to 2011 is shown in the table.  The countries and industry sector involved are also listed in the table.</P>
        <P>Finally, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that their obligation to observe confidentiality in relation to the tax affairs of taxpayers or small groups of taxpayers precludes them from providing the information requested by the Deputy in relation to the amount of tax involved in the 3 largest cases.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality, they cannot comment on specific cases.   However, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that their views on the tax treatment of the reimbursement of expenses of travel and subsistence have been in the public domain for some considerable time and are contained in their Statement of Practice titled <i>Tax Treatment of the Reimbursement of Expenses of Travel and Subsistence</i> which is available on their website at <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In that Statement of Practice, they set out their views on the tax treatment of expenses in a wide range of situations, and I am including the following extract, which seems to be the most relevant, for the information of the Deputy: </P><P Just="Left">Individuals carrying out work on a voluntary and unpaid basis.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in tax law or in this Statement of Practice, the reimbursement of expenses of travelling and subsistence to individuals who work on a voluntary and unpaid basis for organisations whose functions and aims are both altruistic and non-commercial (for example, voluntary unpaid workers working for charities, sports bodies, etc.) may be paid tax-free provided the expenses of travelling and subsistence&mdash;</P>
        <P>(a) merely put the unpaid individual in a position to carry out his/her work; and</P>
        <P>(b) no more than reimburse the individual the expenses actually incurred by him/her and do not exceed what are known as the Civil Service rates for reimbursement of expenses of travelling and subsistence.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners further inform me that they do not determine the nature and quantum of payments made by any body, including sports bodies, to their officials, staff or volunteers.  That is entirely a matter for those bodies. If a body wishes to reimburse an official the expenses of travel and subsistence at rates less than what are known as the Civil Service rates, then that is a matter for that sports body.  If a body wishes to pay a higher figure than the Civil Service rates, then it is unlikely that such an amount would be simply a matter of reimbursement of expenses.  The question of the tax treatment of the excess would then arise.</P>

	<P>The lending institutions in Ireland, including those in which the State has a significant shareholding, are independent commercial entities.  Ultimately the pricing of financial products, including standard variable mortgage interest rates, is a commercial decision for the management team and board of each lending institution, having due regard to their customers and the impact on profitability, particularly where the cost of funding to each lending institution, including deposit pricing, is under pressure.</P>
        <P>Neither the Central Bank nor I have responsibility for any variation in the variable mortgage interest rates charged by Permanent TSB. However, as I have indicated in replies to previous Parliamentary questions on this subject, the Central Bank has advised me that it will continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds.</P>

	<P>The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Treaty, which was signed by all euro area Member States on 2 February, subject to ratification, provides &ldquo;that the granting of financial assistance in the framework of new programmes under the ESM will be conditional, as of 1 March 2013, on the ratification of the Intergovernmental Treaty (IGT) by the ESM Member concerned&rdquo; and on implementation of the balanced budget rule as specified in that treaty within the agreed timeline (one year after entry into force of the treaty).  The linkage between the ESM and the Intergovernmental Treaty to ratification was accepted in the interests of securing agreement on the ESM and its acceleration into force by July 2012. I believe the linkage between the Treaties will further contribute to confidence, solidarity and financial stability in the euro area. </P>
        <P>The ESM will replace the EFSF and it may assume the rights and obligations of the EFSF. However, it is important to note that it has been clarified that the linkage of both the ESM and the IGT refers to new applications for assistance under the ESM and will not affect the transfer to the ESM of undisbursed amounts under the EFSF to Ireland (and other existing programme countries). The funding approved under the existing Programme of Financial Support for Ireland is not therefore conditional on Ireland ratifying the fiscal compact but, as is currently the case, on Ireland successfully implementing our programme.  Primary legislation will be required to enable Ireland to ratify the ESM Treaty and implement its decisions. It is expected that the required legislation will be published this term.</P>

	<P>The Deputy is aware that under the Relationship Framework the Board of the bank is responsible for the day to day operations of the bank including the funding of the bank. I have been informed by the bank that there are two subordinated private placement bonds that were issued in 2005 and documented under US law, that are now held by Fir Tree.  The bank became aware that Fir Tree was the new holder in December 2010 and March 2011 respectively.  For clarity it should be noted that IBRC&rsquo;s liability is US$200 million not &euro;200 million.   </P>
        <P>The first bond is for $165,000,000 and has a maturity date of 29.9.2015. Interest is paid quarterly and the interest basis is 3 month US$ Libor +92basis points. Interest payments made to Fir Tree are as follows:</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>As set out in Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s (the &ldquo;Bank&rdquo;) preliminary statement of its financial results for the year ended 31 December 2011, released on 17 February 2012, the Bank&rsquo;s outstanding unguaranteed subordinated debt at 31 December 2011 was &euro;370m. This excludes the &euro;1bn contingent capital instrument investment subscribed by the State.  As the deputy is aware, I noted on 23 November 2011 that the Bank had to raise &euro;350m of core tier 1 capital by 31 December 2011 to satisfy the requirement of the 2011 Prudential Capital Assessment Review (&ldquo;PCAR 2011&rdquo;). In that context I considered using the powers available under the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 as amended (&ldquo;CISA&rdquo;) to apply for a Subordinated Liabilities Order (&ldquo;SLO&rdquo;) to generate, from subordinated liabilities, the residual capital required by the Bank by 31 December 2011.</P>
        <P>On 2nd December 2011, the Bank announced that it had raised approximately &euro;350m of core tier 1 capital, through its tender offer and purchase of capital securities.  As a result of the Bank&rsquo;s announcement and the fact that the totality of the outstanding PCAR 2011 capital required by 31 December 2011 had been raised, the grounds for use of the powers under CISA to raise that capital through burden-sharing no longer arose.</P>
        <P>It is not for the Minister to comment on the investment decisions made by the holders of subordinated debt in the Bank. The powers granted pursuant to CISA continue to be in effect and will be used in the future if necessary.  With regard to achieving burden sharing with subordinated bondholders in all of the banks including the Bank, I draw the deputy&rsquo;s attention to the fact that total capital generated from burden sharing with bond holders since 2008 is in excess of &euro;15bn.</P>

	<P>Tax relief for mortgage interest on a home loan is tax relief given to mortgage holders based on the interest paid on a qualifying mortgage on a home i.e. a new mortgage for a home, a top up loan used for the purposes of developing or improving a home, a separate home improvement loan, a re-mortgage or a consolidation of existing qualifying loans, secured on the deeds of the home.  The relief is paid at source by the mortgage provider either in the form of a reduced monthly mortgage payment or a credit to the funding account.</P>
        <P>Various eligibility criteria apply to the relief and the rates and ceilings for which Mortgage Interest Relief is available depends on the date the loan was drawn down and whether the mortgage holder is a first time buyer or not.  In any event, mortgages taken out prior to 1 January 2004 are no longer eligible for Mortgage Interest Relief.  However, top up loans/equity release loans taken out since 1 January 2004 on these pre-2004 loans may be eligible for Mortgage Interest Relief, provided they satisfy the eligibility criteria.  The details of the scheme are available at <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.  Mortgage Interest Relief is set to be abolished at end 2017.</P>

	<P>The NRA is within general government. Any loans and some other financial liabilities such as bonds of NRA therefore form part of general government debt. According to the NRA Annual Report the liabilities of the agency amounted to &euro;17.6m in 2010.  However, most of these liabilities are accounts payable and do not contribute to government debt. Neither do liabilities to private partners concerning future streams of payments form part of general government debt. The 2008 buy-out contract between NRA and National Toll roads of Westlink is, on the other hand, considered part of General Government Debt. These figures have formed part of deficit and debt figures of general government since 2008   Credit events cover a wide spectrum and can mean different things.  With regard to PPPs, the NRA does have payment obligations. I am informed by them that all payment obligations to PPP private partners are being met.</P>

	<P>In relation to the ranking of debt obligations between Government bonds, promissory note repayments and State guaranteed bank bonds, section 48 of the Finance Act 1978 provides the following: &ldquo;To remove doubt, it is hereby declared that any liabilities of the Minister for Finance, or of any other Minister of the Government with the consent of the Minister for Finance, of the due repayment of moneys borrowed by persons shall rank, and shall be deemed always to have ranked, pari passu in all respects with the liabilities of the Minister for Finance in respect of securities created and issued under section 54(1) of the Finance Act 1970.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>In relation to the National Roads Authority (NRA), under the Roads Act, 1993 the NRA may issue debt guaranteed by the Minister for Finance which would rank equally with all other debt obligations issued by the Minister or guaranteed by him. However, unguaranteed obligations of the NRA are not obligations of the State. It is not that they &ldquo;rank&rdquo; differently from those of the Minister, they are simply not his obligations and as such there is no equivalence between an NRA obligation and a bond issued under Section 54(1) of the Finance Act 1970 above.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140, 185, 186 and 197 together.</P>
        <P>A public service-wide review of allowances, announced by the Government as part of Budget 2012, is currently being led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Under Circular 70/2011 teachers who had been engaged in a public sector teaching post on or before 4 December 2011 are eligible to retain the qualification allowances they were entitled to be in receipt of on that date. Such teachers will not be paid any additional allowance where they acquire any further qualification on or after 5 December 2011. The position of teachers who, on 5 December 2011, were undertaking courses will be considered in the context of the review.  Teachers who were appointed to teaching for the first time on or after 5 December 2011 but before 1 February 2012 are eligible for allowances on the basis of their qualifications at entry to the profession up to a maximum of the allowance which had been applicable to an honours primary degree.</P>
        <P>Circular 3/2012 provides that allowances are not payable to new beneficiaries; i.e. those who become eligible for receipt of the allowance in question on or after 1 February 2012. Examples <Col N="132"/>of such allowances include any form of qualification allowance or the supervision and substitution payment paid to teachers, and the secretary to the Board of Management allowance paid to school principals. The only exceptions to this prohibition are principal and deputy principal allowances.</P>
        <P>These decisions were taken pending the outcome of the public service-wide review of allowances due to the upward pressure on the cost of teacher allowances. Without immediate action, this upward pressure would have cancelled out the savings made elsewhere in the education system and would bring about even harsher adjustments to schools and services.  I am not in a position to comment further on the position in relation to teacher allowances until the outcome of the public service-wide review of allowances is known.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 141 and 142 together.</P>
        <P>From the commencement of the 2012/13 school year, the use of the Catchment Boundary Area (CB) System as a means of determining eligibility will cease for all pupils newly entering post primary school. This means that from the 2012/13 school year, school transport eligibility for all pupils newly entering a post primary school will be determined by reference to the distance they reside from their nearest post-primary education centre having regard to ethos and language.  This change was announced as part of Budget 2011 but is not being introduced until the 2012/13 school year in order to allow parents of children newly entering post primary school ample time to consider their school choice options, taking account of the revised school transport eligibility arrangements.</P>
        <P>At post primary level, the evidence is, as set out in the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Schemes, that the majority of children are attending their nearest post primary school/centre.  The changes to the Post Primary School Transport Scheme will be applied equitably on a national basis.</P>
        <P>Given that Bus &Eacute;ireann will be communicating with the families currently availing of post primary school transport and that I have already set out the rationale underpinning the policy position for the Deputy and other local representatives and cannot make any exceptions to the policy, it is not feasible for me to meet with individual groups of parents to discuss these changes.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 143, 144, 190 and 200 together.</P>
        <P>Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of Vocational Education Committees (VECs) are paid directly by the Committees which employ them. The pay costs of the VECs are funded primarily by the pay grant issued by my Department, but also by pay receipts retained by the VECs comprised principally of retained superannuation contributions. The Deputy should note that the CEO is not a member of the VEC.</P>
        <P>CEOs do not receive expenses for attendance at VEC meetings. However, travel and subsistence is payable in accordance with public sector norms to CEOs for their attendance at meetings away from the VEC&rsquo;s headquarters and where the attendance of the CEO is necessary for the discharge of their role.  CEOs may qualify for payment of an allowance in respect of the discharge of the role of Secretary to a Board of Management of a Comprehensive School. An allowance was payable to CEOs for the role of Transport Liaison Officer, when that task was undertaken by them prior to 2012.  Details of all payments made to CEOs in 2011 are outlined in the table.</P>
        <P>My officials are currently in discussion with SIPTU, the union which represents the CEOs of the VECs, regarding the overall remuneration structure which will apply to the CEOs of the new Education and Training Boards once established.</P>

	<P>The final report and accompanying statement of expenditure in respect of the Waterford Crystal <Col N="136"/>EGF programme were submitted to the European Commission by the Department on 6 February 2012 as required under the relevant European Commission decision.  The total expenditure certified by the Irish authorities in the statement of expenditure was &euro;3,089,633.08.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has recently forwarded its initial calculations that include a reimbursement of &euro;562,591.50 in respect of the EU financial contribution of &euro;2,570,853.00 made to the Waterford Crystal EGF programme.  However, as the EGF case in question has not yet been closed by the European Commission, I am not in a position to confirm the final outcome at this time.</P>

	<P>An application for co-financing assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in respect of some 592 workers made redundant at the Talk Talk company in Waterford and at three ancillary enterprises was submitted to the European Commission by my Department on 29 February 2012.  The measures included in the application are costed in the region of &euro;5.4m at a maximum co-financing rate of 50% (&euro;2.7m) from the EU if approved and include guidance, training, further and higher education and enterprise supports and a contribution towards course expenses. I have already approved the implementation of a number of these measures through national funding in anticipation of approval of the application by the EU budgetary authority.</P>

    <P Just="Center" el="11">New Pay Scales for New Appointees to Teaching in 2011</P>
        <P><i>Introduction</i></P>
        <P LI="1">1. The Minister for Education and Skills wishes to inform vocational education committees, management bodies and teachers of the application of revised rates of salary and allowances for new appointees to teaching from 1 January 2011 onwards.</P>
        <P LI="1">2. As part of Budget 2011 the Government has applied a 10% reduction in the pay of new entrants to the public service (referred to in this Circular as &ldquo;new appointees&rdquo;) and all new appointees to the entry grades of the public service must start at the first point of the relevant pay scale with effect from 1 January 2011.</P>
        <P><i>Application of new pay rates</i></P>
        <P LI="1">3. The 10% reduction in pay applies to basic pay, allowances and the supervision and substitution payment.</P>
        <P LI="2"><i>(a)  Basic Pay:</i></P>
        <P LI="2">The 10% reduction applies to basic pay on all points of the incremental salary scale. Daily and hourly rates for casual and non-casual teachers in the primary sector and hourly rates for casual and non-casual part-time teachers in the post-primary sector have also been reduced.  The revised rates are set out in an Appendix to this Circular.</P>
        <P LI="2"><i>(b) Allowances:</i></P>
        <P LI="2">The 10% reduction also applies to all allowances with the exception of promotional allowances; <i>i.e. </i>special duties, assistant principal, deputy principal and principal allowances.</P>
        <P><i>New Appointee to teaching</i></P>
        <P LI="1">4. The new pay rates apply to all teachers who are new appointees appointed on or after 1 January 2011.</P><Col N="138"/>
        <P LI="1">5. Where a person gave service in an analogous teaching position before 1 January 2011 (including those currently on an approved leave of absence), s/he will not be regarded as a new appointee to teaching.  In addition, a person with a written offer of employment before 1 January 2011 will not be regarded as a new appointee.  In these cases, the person will be assigned to the appropriate pre-1 January 2011 scale and allowances, and incremental credit for approved teaching service and non-teaching experience which is deemed relevant will be awardable.</P>
        <P LI="1">6. Where a teacher who is retired and is in receipt of a pension returns to teaching on or after 1 January 2011, s/he will start on the first point of the post 1 January 2011 incremental salary scale.</P>
        <P><i>Incremental credit</i></P>
        <P LI="2">7. All new appointees to teaching will start on the first point of the post 1 January 2011 incremental salary scale.  The Government has decided that all new appointees to entry grades (subject to the criteria set out above) will start at the minimum point of the new reduced scale.</P>
        <P LI="2">8. However, incremental credit may continue to apply for relevant recognised service (<i>e.g. </i>recognised teaching service in another EU Member State).  Similarly, those who leave the system will be able to reckon such previous relevant service on re-entry.</P>
        <P><i>Circulation</i></P>
        <P LI="1">9. Please ensure that copies of this Circular are provided to the Board of Management/Vocational Education Committee and its contents are brought to the attention of all teachers in your employment including those on leave of absence.</P>
        <P LI="1">10. This Circular can be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website under <i>http://www.education.ie</i>.</P>

        <P FLI="0">You are a new appointee to teaching.  You will therefore be offered a contract at January 2011 pay rates and conditions.  This applies also to teachers who are moving to take up a post in other positions (<i>eg </i>Special Needs Assistants,<i> </i>administrators, etc).  You may be entitled to certain incremental credit in respect of your lecturing service.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>I have been employed as a teacher in the private sector for 5 years.    I will begin teaching in the public sector in May 2011 &mdash; What will my starting salary be?</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">You are a new appointee under the recent Government Decision.  You will therefore be offered a contract at the first point of the January 2011 pay rates and conditions.   You may be entitled to incremental credit subject to certain conditions.</P>
        <P FLI="0"><i>I am a teacher who was employed with a Vocational Education Committee since September 2005. I resigned from my post with the VEC in November 2010. I expect to take up a teaching post in a Voluntary Secondary school in September 2011. Which pay scale will I be paid on?</i></P>
        <P FLI="0">You worked in a teaching position prior to 1 January 2011.  You will therefore be offered a contract at pre-2011 pay rates and conditions if you resume teaching in a voluntary secondary school in September 2011.

	<P>A limited number of post graduate students who would previously have qualified under the standard grant thresholds will qualify to have a &euro;2,000 contribution made towards the costs of their fees.  There will be a new income threshold for this payment which will be lower than the standard grant threshold. The income threshold for this level of grant is currently being determined in the context of the formulation of the student grant scheme for the 2012/13 academic year.</P>

	<P>The Professional Diploma in Education (PDE) was previously known as a Postgraduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) was placed on the framework of qualifications at Level 8 with effect from the start of the academic year 2011/12. The course is considered to be a post graduate course for the purposes of the Student Grant Scheme.  Under the terms of the Free Fees Initiative, whereby the State meets the tuition costs of eligible students, an approved course is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of a minimum duration of two years in an approved third level institution. As the Professional Diploma in Education is a Level 8 post graduate course it does not qualify for funding under the Free Fees initiative.</P>

	<P>As autonomous statutory bodies it is a matter for each Higher Education Institution to manage its staffing resources and retirements as they arise. In contrast to other parts of the public service an Employment Control Framework is in place for the higher education sector which provides institutions with considerable flexibility to fill vacancies, through recruitment or promotions, subject to the conditions of the ECF. Staff turnover and retirement of long-serving staff is an ongoing feature of such institutions and their management authorities have been planning in anticipation of additional retirements this year.</P>

	<P>On 9 June 2010, the Department submitted an application for co-funded assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in respect of 9,089 former workers made redundant in the construction NACE 41, 43 and 71 sub-sectors during the nine-month EGF reference period between 1 July 2009 and 31 March 2010.  Applications for EGF co-financed assistance are made in support of specified redundant workers. Under the rules pertaining to sectoral applications, only identified workers made redundant during a specified nine-month reference period may be included in the application for EGF support.</P>
        <P>In accordance with Article 5(1) of EGF Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006, a maximum period of 10 weeks applies from the end of the EGF reference period in which an EGF application must be submitted. For the three Irish construction sub-sectors, the stipulated reference period ended on 31 March 2010 and the 10-week application period ended on 9 June 2010.  Redundant workers for inclusion in the EGF application submitted for all three construction sub-sectors were identified based on the most recent recorded date of registration for a statutory redundancy payment as at 28 April 2010 and, as appropriate for those redundant apprentices included in the NACE 41 and 43 sub-sectors, based on data from the apprenticeship database held by F&Aacute;S.</P><Col N="143"/>
        <P>Statutory redundancy payment data on which the cohort of eligible redundant workers was based, was received from the Redundancy Payments Division of the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on 28 April 2010.  Other requirements relating to the specification of employers and NACE 2 codings, and which involved liaison by the Department with external bodies holding data, also needed to be verified prior to the submission of the application.</P>
        <P>The EGF application was submitted on 9 June 2010 and was made on the basis of particular information at a given point in time. The point in time chosen yielded very substantial levels of redundancies, was based on the best current data available and allowed sufficient time to submit the application within the mandatory deadline. It should be noted that it is not the enterprise making the workers redundant but the individual workers who have been identified as having been made redundant, which is the key element in terms of eligibility.  Moreover, the statutory redundancy payments system, on which the EGF application was significantly based, does not automatically follow up each of the 3,349 enterprises encompassed by the application on a rolling basis seeking updated details of all workers who may have been let go at different times. Thus, the relevant information from this source was the best available to my Department when compiling the EGF application.</P>
        <P>As such, some 37 former employees of the enterprise named were identified as having been made redundant during the reference period as at 28 April 2010. No persons were informed of EGF eligibility until after the EU budgetary authority approval of the Irish application and its subsequent disaggregation across the three construction sub-sectors on 16 November 2011.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, total enrolment in both primary and post-primary schools is expected to grow by almost 70,000 between now and 2018 (over 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post primary) and will continue to grow up to at least 2024 at post-primary level.  The priority now is to focus on major school projects and smaller projects devolved to schools to meet the demographic demands. The primary aim will be to ensure that every child will have access to a school place.</P>
        <P>It is within this context that in 2011, I announced the establishment of 40 new schools nationally within the next six years, comprising twenty new primary schools and twenty new post-primary schools. Of these, 18 will be in the Dublin area, 12 of which will be primary and 6 post primary schools.  Lucan is one of the areas where a 1,000 pupil second level school will be established in the coming years. The school will cater for increasing demographic demand in the general Lucan area.</P>
        <P>I have already indicated in the context of the announcement on the 10th November 2011 last of the Government&rsquo;s Medium Term Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework, which sets out the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years, that I intend to publish shortly a five year plan outlining the projects that will commence construction in that time.</P>

	<P>The reforms to the teacher allocation process introduced for the 2012/13 school year revised the basis for appointment of Administrative Principal and Administrative Deputy Principal status in primary schools.  The criteria for such status will be solely based on pupil numbers rather than the current approach of mostly on pupil numbers but some also on teacher numbers.  The relevant enrolment thresholds for the appointment of Administrative Principals and Administrative Deputy Principals are outlined in Appendix B of Primary Circular 0007/2012 which is available on the Department website. </P>
        <P>To ease the transition to the entirely enrolment driven arrangements for Administrative Principals and Administrative Deputy Principals, schools that are adversely affected by the rule change can continue to keep their administrative status until there is a change of Principal or Deputy Principal, as appropriate, in the school providing they continue to satisfy the existing rule.</P>

	<P>While a key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target resources at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage, the current economic climate and the challenge to meet significant targets on reducing public expenditure, particularly given the upward pressures on teacher numbers and in the context of operating under a fixed ceiling on teacher numbers, affords no capacity to provide for additionality to the DEIS programme.</P>
        <P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) includes a commitment for ongoing evaluation of the programme to ensure successful implementation and appropriate measurement of outcomes at both local and national level.  The Educational Research Centre has undertaken this ongoing evaluation, on behalf of my Department, the aim of which is to monitor the implementation of the programme and assess its impact on students and schools at primary and post primary levels.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Inspectorate of my Department conducted evaluations of planning in a sample of 36 DEIS schools, 18 primary and 18 post-primary.  A national composite report on the effectiveness of DEIS planning in primary and post-primary schools has been completed and this report along with the ERC report were published in January 2012.  My Department will fully consider these evaluation reports before any decisions can be made regarding the future of DEIS.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 160, 174, 179, 181 and 183 together.</P>
        <P>My Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the 73 small schools that are losing a classroom post as a result of the budget measure.  It is worth noting that there are almost 1,200 small schools with 86 pupils or less and no small school will be forced to close as a result of this decision.</P>
        <P>Such schools will not lose their classroom post if they are projecting increased enrolments in September 2012 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.  The detailed arrangements are set out in the Department&rsquo;s Staffing Circular 0007/2012 including the relevant thresholds to retain a classroom teaching post at Appendix A. It is a matter for individual schools to provide information relevant to their projected increase in enrolment to the Staffing Appeal Board.</P><Col N="146"/>
        <P>The closing date for submission of appeals for the April meeting of the Staffing Appeal Board is 23 March, 2012.  Schools must submit to my Department by 16 March, 2012 a redeployment form for any teacher surplus to requirements who is eligible to be placed on the redeployment panel.  I can assure the Deputies that it is intended that the Appeal Board meeting will take place prior to the release of the main redeployment panel in mid to late April, 2012 thus allowing for any impact of the Board&rsquo;s decision on redeployment panels to be effected.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</P>

In anticipation of this the Department entered into discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and reform (PER) in order to highlight the staffing situation at the Schools Inspectorate Division in light of the large number of inspectors opting to retire early. These discussions culminated in an agreement being reached that key positions that were deemed essential in order to have an effective School Inspectorate could be filled. Some of these were promotions to higher positions.  In addition to this in January 2012 the Department engaged the Public Appointments Service (PAS) to conduct recruitment competitions for primary and post primary inspectors.</P>
        <P>The Teaching Council is the body responsible for the registration of teachers. Newly qualified primary teachers who are conditionally registered with the Council and who are seeking to obtain full registration as teachers must fulfil both service and professional competence conditions laid down by the Council.

The Inspectorate has planned its inspection programme for the period to June 2012 to ensure that, as far as possible, newly qualified primary teachers who will be able to fulfil the service requirement by 30 June 2012 will be inspected by that date for the purpose of fulfiling the professional competence requirement for full registration with the Council.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of a Vocational Educational Committee (VEC) school to the VEC in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.  My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My officials have been in contact with the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) on this matter.  The NEWB has confirmed that it has received notification from the school authorities of their intention to expel the pupil in question.  My officials also understand from the NEWB that 20 school days have not passed since the formal notification from the school authorities.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I can confirm that &euro;299,737 was provided by my Department in 2011 to enable a number of redundant DELL workers undertake an additional academic year on third level education courses that had been commenced with European Globalisation Fund funding. This funding covered fees which would have otherwise been payable by the individuals concerned for the courses provided by Universities (&euro;140,599), IOTS (&euro;114,676) and Griffith College (&euro;44,462).  F&Aacute;S is currently examining its records to see if funding was provided to other private colleges other than Griffith College and I will forward any further information to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>As was clearly indicated in the letter referred to by the Deputy, the decision to extend support to the Dell students for the 2011/12 academic year was based solely on the basis of understandings (based on an incorrect interpretation of the rules governing the Fund) that support for this academic year fell within the scope of the Fund.  It was also made clear that these concessionary arrangements would not extend beyond the academic year 2011/12 regard<Col N="149"/>less of the duration of the programmes involved.  The question of similar arrangements for redundant workers, on other EGF programmes does not arise.</P>
        <P>All EGF programmes are strictly time limited in accordance with the requirements of the relevant EU legislation and eligible redundant workers are so informed. Students in publicly funded institutions on programmes of longer duration may be eligible for support in accordance with the regulations governing the operation of the Department&rsquo;s Free Fees and student support schemes dependent on their individual circumstances.</P>

Schools will have autonomy on how best to prioritise its available resources to meet its requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to its students.

	<P>As previously advised, the information requested by the Deputy is not readily available within my Department.  I requested the HEA, at the time, to contact the seven universities with a view to obtaining as much information as is possible.  This information, where available, has been forwarded to the Deputy.  However, it should be noted that given differences between the various university management and financial information systems, it is difficult to collect consistent and comparable data. </P>
        <P>Details, as requested, on rental costs and travel expenses incurred by the seven universities in 2010 and 2011 have also been forwarded to the Deputy.  I have also forwarded copies of each university&rsquo;s travel policy.  It has not been possible to disaggregate travel costs incurred within the EU and outside the EU.</P>
        <P>In relation to question 224, my Department does not provide an allocation to universities for hospitality and entertainment.  The Higher Education Authority allocates an annual core recurrent grant to each institution and it is a matter for the institution to determine how this funding is allocated internally.  I have also been informed by the HEA that information on expenditure of this nature by the universities is not readily available and that the level of information requested by the Deputy would require a very substantial amount of administrative time to identify and extract the full range of details sought.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The position in relation to entrance fees is that a key requirement for all recognised schools in the Free Education Scheme is that the school does not operate a charge, in whatever form, that is in effect a mandatory fee and that is contrary to the principle of not charging fees. Voluntary contributions may be sought from parents, provided it is made clear to parents that there is no compulsion to pay and that a child&rsquo;s place in the school or continued enrolment is not dependant on a willingness to make a contribution.</P>
        <P>Registration fees are sometimes requested by schools in order to avoid &ldquo;double booking&rdquo; of pupils in schools. Under current arrangements, schools are allowed to request a booking fee/registration fee when considering applicants for enrolment, provided this is refundable at all times following a decision on enrolment.  The Department is strongly supportive of the integration of ICT tools and techniques into teaching practice. The Department&rsquo;s ICT in schools programme sets out a clear agenda to be pursued in this regard and schools are very much encouraged to plan for the integration of ICT into teaching practice as part of their Whole School Planning process.</P>
        <P>However, decisions on the specific ICT devices used to support teaching and learning and the extent to which such technology is used in place of traditional textbooks is an operational matter for the Board of Management of each school and my Department has no role at individual school level in approving such initiatives.  I believe it is important that where new technology is being adopted by schools, the costs of this transition are borne in mind by schools so that parents are not left in a difficult financial situation.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Under the Employment Programmes and Services and Skills Training (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2010, the functions of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in relation to F&Aacute;S were transferred to the renamed Department of Education and Skills from 1 May 2010.  As a result of this transfer, &euro;452 million (8 month costs) was added to the 2010 allocation of Vote 26: Education and Skills in respect of these services. Subsequently, the Department of Social Protection, following the commencement of the relevant sections of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010, assumed funding and overall responsibility for F&Aacute;S employment services and programmes, resulting in &euro;462 million, <Col N="152"/>being the 2011 allocation for these services and programmes, transferring to the Vote of the Department of Social Protection Vote with effect from 1 January 2011.</P>
        <P>In determining my Department&rsquo;s overall annual expenditure allocations for 2011 and 2012, all aspects of the Department&rsquo;s programmes and services were examined, given the requirement to effect expenditure savings on the Education and Skills Vote, while at the same time, however, endeavouring to protect as much as possible front-line services in the Education Sector. This protection includes the filling of teacher vacancies that arise, as an exception to the general moratorium on the filling of public sector vacancies. Thus, while Budget 2012 implemented a range of savings across the Vote for my Department, expenditure on First-Level Education Grants and Services as contained in the Revised Estimates Volume, shows an increase from &euro;3,081 million in 2011 to &euro;3,109.4m in 2012 &mdash; an increase of 1%. This compares to an overall decrease of 2% in the 2012 Vote for my Department, when compared to the provisional outturn for 2011.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that a Common Application System was agreed between the principals of the post-primary schools in Limerick City. This system is facilitated through the Limerick Education Centre with support from my Department. Whilst this administrative system ensures that a co-ordinated approach can be taken to enrolments in the area, each school authority, in accordance with the Education Act, 1998, retains autonomy in relation to its own enrolment policy.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the managerial authority of any school that is not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998.   In this regard a board of management may deem it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular age group or to children living in a particular area or on the basis of some other criterion.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.  The Deputy will also be aware that last June, I launched a discussion paper on school enrolment. The document, &ldquo;Discussion Paper on a Regulatory Framework for School Enrolment&rdquo; contains suggestions on how to make the process of enrolling in schools more open, equitable and consistent.</P>
        <P>I have made it clear that the paper was not meant to be prescriptive, nor have any decisions been made as to what elements will be contained in any final regulations or legislation. The purpose of the paper was to lead and provoke debate on enrolment policies and practices.  I invited education partners and interested parties to submit their views to my Department by the 28th of October last and my officials are now co-ordinating the submissions received.  The feedback from this consultation will help inform the nature and scope of a new regulatory framework for school enrolment.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, an application for planning permission forms part of the site acquisition process for the school to which he refers. A draft design for the school was discussed with the school authority and the design is currently being revised in light of those discussions.  The current position of all projects on the school building programme, including this project, may be viewed on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>. Details in relation to projects are updated regularly during the year.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is also aware, I have already indicated in the context of the announcement on the 10th November 2011 last of the Government&rsquo;s Medium Term Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework, which sets out the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years, that I intend to publish shortly a five year plan outlining the projects that will commence construction in that time.</P>

	<P>There are a range of foreign languages available on the curriculum in schools -- French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Japanese and Arabic. Mandarin Chinese is not currently on the curriculum.  It is not possible in the current budgetary situation to expand the range of languages available in the post primary curriculum. However, the availability of Transition Year and the option of school developed short courses proposed as part of junior cycle reform will, in the future, give opportunities to schools to provide additional languages, including Mandarin Chinese, if they wish to do so.</P>

	<P>DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provided for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of the Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the Inspectorate. There are 864 schools in DEIS. These comprise 669 primary schools (198 Urban Band 1, 144 Urban Band 2 and 327 Rural) and 195 second-level schools.</P><Col N="154"/>
        <P>Band 1 schools are those 198 urban/town primary schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  Primary schools serving rural communities, including towns with populations below 1,500, are designated as Rural. The indicators used in identifying schools for participation in DEIS took into account the differences between urban and rural disadvantage.</P>
        <P>While a key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target resources at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage, the current economic climate and the challenge to meet significant targets on reducing public expenditure, particularly given the upward pressures on teacher numbers and in the context of operating under a fixed ceiling on teacher numbers affords no capacity to provide for additionality to the DEIS programme, including reclassification from rural to urban.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 188 and 189 together.</P>
        <P>Due to conflicting numbers of posts being reported as potentially lost to DEIS Band 1 and Band 2 urban primary schools it was necessary to obtain clarity with regard to the net effect of a range of factors on teacher allocations in these schools; for example, increasing and decreasing enrolments, the reforms to the existing teacher allocations process and up to date enrolments, all of which contribute to determining the staffing requirement for these schools for 2012/13 school year.  The Report on the net impact, in terms of posts, of Budget measures on these DEIS Band 1 and Band 2 urban primary schools, that still had additional posts allocated under disadvantage schemes pre-dating DEIS, was published on 21 February 2012.</P><Col N="155"/>
        <P>The School to which the Deputy refers was not included as part of this Report, as it is a DEIS rural primary school. Of the 328 DEIS Rural primary schools, 16 of these schools with legacy posts will lose one teaching post each. It should be noted that the overwhelming majority of DEIS Rural Primary Schools have not been affected by this decision.  A letter has issued from my Department to the school referred to by the Deputy in relation to the withdrawal of posts from previous disadvantage schemes.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy is aware, in June 2011 I announced that 20 new primary and 20 new post-primary schools are to be established in the next six years across a number of locations. This announcement included a proposal to establish a new post-primary school in the area referred to by the Deputy. This school is to be established in September 2013. The closing date for receipt of applications for patronage of the post-primary schools to be established in 2013 and 2014 was Friday 24th February 2012.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the application criteria for patronage, applicants were required to provide evidence of parental demand by signing up lists of parents who expressed interest in having their children educated in their new school. They were also required to confirm willingness to enrol children in the area for whom the Department has identified the need for a school. The Forward Planning Section of my Department will assess all applications in line with the announced criteria and will prepare a report for submission to the New Schools Establishment Group, which will in turn submit its report to me for final consideration and decision.  Details of the new arrangements for patronage of new schools and the criteria for deciding on patronage of these new schools are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.education.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s Post Primary School Transport Scheme children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest education centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</P>
        <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann is responsible for the planning and timetabling of school transport routes. Bus &Eacute;ireann is also responsible for designating the pick up and set down points to be used by their bus services.  Occasionally, where Bus &Eacute;ireann considers there is a risk to the safety of school children carried, to the safety of the service itself, or to the safety of other road users, it may become necessary to amend routes or pick up points on safety grounds.  In these circumstances every effort is made to minimise any potential inconvenience to the families using the service.  Bus &Eacute;ireann endeavours, within available resources, to ensure that each eligible child has a reasonable level of school transport service in the context of the Scheme nationally.</P>
        <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the children referred to in the details supplied are availing of a school transport service within the guidelines of the scheme.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has further advised that upon reviewing conditions at Forge Cross for picking up children, the company decided that the arrangement posed a safety risk which could be resolved by making a minor change to the location of the pick-up point. A more suitable pick-up point located about half a kilometre away has been nominated for the purpose of safely picking up the children each morning instead.  There is no change to the afternoon arrangements because the children can be set down safely on their own side of the road.</P>

	<P>The number of Special Needs Assistants (whole time equivalent) employed nationally from 2007 to 2011 is available in the following document. The details for each year are the December figures for the year in question. The primary schools information is inclusive of the special schools details. The information in the detailed format requested by the Deputy is not readily available.  However, the website of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) does provide a specific breakdown of SNA allocations for the current school year which began last September. This can be accessed at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>SNAs are recruited specifically to assist in the care of pupils with disabilities in an educational context. The class teacher is responsible for educating all pupils in their class, including any pupil with a special educational need. In this task, the teacher may be supported by a learning support teacher and/or resource teacher. As a result, the allocation of SNAs in each school can alter from year to year. Some schools may receive an increased allocation, while others may experience a reduction because the allocation of supports are provided in line with the needs of individual schools.</P><Col N="158"/>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating special needs resources to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within the Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support. The NCSE will continue to support schools, parents, children and teachers and special needs assistants will continue to be deployed to schools to meet children&rsquo;s needs in line with the Department&rsquo;s policy.</P>

	<P>The main purpose of the Emergency Works Scheme is to ensure the availability of funding for urgent works to those schools that are most in need of resources as a result of an emergency situation or on receipt of an enrolment application from a special needs pupil.  An emergency is a situation which poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or the environment, which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action and in the case of a school, if not corrected would prevent the school or part thereof from opening.  Terms and conditions of the scheme were published in March 2011 and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.education.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 203 to 205, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I announced on 10th November 2011, in the context of unveiling the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework 2012-2016, that the Government has decided to review a number of options regarding the future of the National Lottery.  My Department is currently examining the various options with respect to the next Lottery licence and I expect to be in a position to revert to Government in the near future.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s intention is to seek a large upfront payment to the State as part of the arrangements for the new licence, with some of the payment to be used to help fund the building of the proposed new National Paediatric Hospital.  Any new arrangements for the National Lottery will also involve the continued provision of significant annual revenues from the Lottery for good causes.  However, in advance of a final decision by Government on how to proceed on the matter, it would be premature for me to speculate at this stage on possible terms for the next licence.</P>
        <P>In relation to retailers, I am cognisant of the important role which retailers play in the operation of the National Lottery.  I am also aware of the importance to retailers of income from the Lottery, particularly in the present economic climate.  I can assure the Deputy that the position of retailers will be taken into consideration in the context of any decision regarding the arrangements for the next Lottery licence.</P>

        <Quest> the protection levels that exist for local enterprises competing in the public tendering process against foreign or non-local companies; if the immediate impact on the local economy is considered; the measures being taken to ensure that required standards can be met by new entrants to the market; if he is willing to review this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12497/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very aware that public procurement can be an important source of business for local enterprises.  In general, SMEs&rsquo; flexibility and ability to respond speedily to requirements can be advantageous in competing for local contracts. Current guidelines from my Department require public bodies to promote participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the award of public contracts.  The guidelines set out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote SME involvement in a manner that is consistent with the principles and rules of the existing public procurement regulatory regime. The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.</P>
        <P>The key provisions of the guidance include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 or more to be advertised on the <i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i> website;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />less use of &ldquo;restrictive&rdquo; tendering procedures and greater use of &ldquo;open&rdquo; tendering;</P><Col N="160"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />the needs and possibilities for small businesses to compete and supply to be taken into account when setting up panels / framework arrangements;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />and encouragement of small companies to combine with others to make a joint bid for a contract that they might not be in a position to perform on their own.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Public contracts above a certain value must be advertised EU wide and awarded to the most competitive tender in an open and objective process. The aim is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. In this regard, it is worth pointing out that the open market regime also offers opportunities for Irish companies to win business abroad and reliable EU studies indicate that many Irish businesses are successful in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to review the situation in regard to SME participation in public procurement and where consistent with achieving value-for-money, probity and transparency, will seek to address any further issues that might be identified.</P>

	<P>My understanding is that the Public Accounts Committee has been given access to Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport records among which is reference to the Department of Finance having indicated orally that it could not consent to abandoning an attempt to recover VAT in a case involving Campus Stadium Ireland Development.  The relevant Vote section &mdash; which generally acts as a first contact point on a wide range of issues with the relevant line department and which at the time would have been part of the Department of Finance and is now part of my Department &mdash; has no record of any written instruction having been issued in this regard, nor any record of having received advice from CSID&rsquo;s advisers.</P>

	<P>The Brownshill Dolmen is a national monument in State ownership and is under the care and management of the Office of Public Works. The dolmen is accessed from a small car park on the public road by means of a pathway. The dolmen, a small area around it, and the pathway are in State ownership. The car park is owned and managed by Carlow County Council.  In 2009, additional strips of land were purchased alongside the pathway and at the area surrounding the dolmen. This provided improved access to the site. An interpretation panel is situated at the car park. The current budgetary position does not allow for further works to this site.  Tobinstown, also known as Haroldstown, Dolmen is a national monument but it is not in State ownership and is not in the care of the Office of Public Works.</P>

	<P>Section 47 of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, <i>inter alia</i>, provides for the charging of a fee by a public body and for payment by the requester in respect of the grant of a Freedom of Information request of an amount equal to&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="1">(a) the estimated cost of the search for and retrieval of the record concerned, and</P>
        <P LI="1">(b) the estimated cost of any copy of the record made by the public body concerned for the requester concerned.</P>
        <P FLI="0">as determined by the head of the public body concerned.</P>
        <P>Section 47 also provides for certain limitations and exemptions in respect of such fees.  In summary these are:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />No such search and retrieval fees can be charged when only personal information is contained in the record concerned unless the grant related to a significant number of records;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Copying charges shall be disregarded also if only personal information is contained in the record and it would not be reasonable, having regard to the means of the requester, to apply a charge;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Such fees could be waived or reduced when the record concerned would be of assistance to the understanding of a matter of national importance; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Neither search and retrieval fees nor copying fees can be charged when the cost of collecting and accounting for the fee would exceed the amount of the fee.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The powers under Section 47 in respect of copying and search and retrieval fees were unaffected by the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act, 2003 and the amount prescribed for such fees have remained unchanged since the legislation first came into effect.  These are:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Search and retrieval: &euro;20.95 per hour</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Copying charges</P><Col N="162"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Photocopy per sheet: &euro;0.04</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Floppy disk: &euro;0.51</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />CD Rom: &euro;10.16</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Radiograph: &euro;6.35</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">In 2003 the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act introduced application fees for requests for non-personal information.  The fees prescribed by Regulation under the amended Act are &euro;15 for a Freedom of Information request for non-personal information, &euro;75 for an internal review of a Freedom of Information decision and &euro;150 for an appeal to the Information Commissioner.  A reduced application fee structure applies to persons in possession of medical cards.  The reductions are as follows: initial request &euro;10, internal review &euro;25 and &euro;50 appeal to the Information Commissioner.</P>
        <P>According to the most recent information available to my Department contained in the Annual Report of the Office of the Information Commissioner for 2010, of 15,249 Freedom of Information requests received by public bodies in 2010, 10,688 related to personal information in respect of which application fees do not apply for the initial request or any internal review or appeal to the Information Commissioner.</P>

	<P>The Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill 2008 completed all stages in the D&aacute;il in June 2010 and is awaiting second stage in the Seanad.  This Bill represents the most significant extension of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit in almost 30 years.  On completion of its passage in the D&aacute;il the main areas included in the Bill are third level education institutions, the Vocational Educational Colleges and the Courts Service. </P>
        <P>The priority in terms of extending the Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit has been to identify public bodies currently outside her remit that have a significant interface with members of the public whose administrative actions have the potential to affect large numbers of people.  The extension of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit to cover additional bodies or additional areas of work, beyond those already covered by the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill 2008, will be reviewed in line with the Government Reform Agenda over the coming months. Bodies to be included or exempt will be agreed in the context of this review.</P>

	<P>The Irish Human Rights Commission&rsquo;s (IHRC) <i>Human Rights Guide for the Civil and Public Service</i>  makes an important contribution to the human rights agenda in Ireland. The updating of the 2010 edition is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the IHRC.  Organisational training strategies are aligned to civil service Departmental business objectives and are derived from training needs analyses and individual requirements identified through the Performance Management and Development System. In this context my Department will take the opportunity to advise civil service Departmental Training Units of the availability of the Guide.</P>

	<P Just="Left">A dynamic and healthy venture capital market is a prerequisite for the growth and development of high potential start-up companies in Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland assists companies that wish to raise venture capital funding to grow their businesses, focusing on stimulating funding for companies that would have difficulty raising capital through traditional sources of finance.  The agency&rsquo;s support for venture capital funds is undertaken through investment as a limited partner with other private investors on a pari passu basis.  The management of these funds is in the hands of private sector Venture Capital fund managers who take investment decisions on a fully commercial basis.</P><Col N="165"/>
        <P>Under the Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2007-2012, Enterprise Ireland has acted as catalyst for the establishment of four Seed Capital Funds.  These Funds have a total of &euro;124m in seed monies under management.  Enterprise Ireland can assist companies with contact details and specific areas of interest for the major Irish venture capital companies.  In addition, the agency can assist with introductions to these specific venture capital funds.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland also continues to focus on the development of high potential start-up companies.  This year, Enterprise Ireland is targeting the support of 95 High Potential Start Ups (HPSUs). Initiatives such as the Competitive Start Fund also provide critical early stage financing to entrepreneurs, while the &euro;10m International Start-Up Fund encourages overseas entrepreneurs to locate start-up businesses in Ireland.  Details of all these schemes are available on Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s website, <i>www.enterprise-ireland.com</i>.</P>
        <P>In November 2011 my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, TD,  announced a new Seed Capital Scheme to encourage individuals currently or formerly in employment to establish new business ventures. The scheme provides for a refund of tax already paid by an individual who sets up and takes employment in a new qualifying business.

        <P FLI="0">Additionally, and as outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs, I have been reviewing the structure of enterprise supports in recent months and, in particular, the role of the CEBs.  A new &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; micro enterprise support structure will be established through the dissolution of the existing CEB structures and the creation of a new Micro Enterprise and Small Business Unit in Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland will work with the Local Authorities to establish a new network of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs).  The LEOs will combine the enterprise support service previously provided by the CEBs and the business support work of the Business Support Units in the Local Authorities.  This will provide an enhanced service to micro-enterprises through seamless access to both Enterprise Ireland expertise and the broader business services of the Local Authority.  The intention is that the new LEOs will act as a focal point for a series of important new policy initiatives aimed at small businesses.</P>

        <Quest> following Ireland's application to become a member of the Human Rights Council and the Irish tripartite adoption of the United Nations&rsquo; International Labour Organisation in June 2011, if it is his intention to ratify the ILO convention No. 189 on Decent Work for Domestic Workers 2012 and by doing so demonstrate his commitment to protecting human rights and decent work for all. </Quest>

	<P>I welcome the successful outcome of discussions at the International Labour Conference (ILC) that lead to the adoption of a new International labour standard aimed at ensuring Decent Work for Domestic Workers.  The final text of the draft Convention was one that the Irish Government was in a position to support and the Convention on Decent Work for Domestic Workers now becomes ILO Convention No. 189 supplemented by a Recommendation.  </P>
        <P>The issue of ratification by Ireland of this Convention is being considered in the context of our standard approach to the ratification of international instruments.  In this regard, the Convention will be examined from the perspective of any changes that may be required to existing domestic legislation.  However, it is important to note that domestic workers are protected by virtue of the fact that the full suite of employment rights legislation, including that of redress for violations of their employment rights, apply to domestic workers in the same way as they apply to other categories of employees  in Ireland.</P>
        <P>A voluntary Code of Practice for Persons Employed in Other People&rsquo;s Homes was developed under the Industrial Relations Act 1990. The Code sets out certain employment rights and practices for persons employed in other people&rsquo;s homes and encourages good practice and compliance with the law in such employment situations.  In any proceedings before a court, or <Col N="167"/>a workplace relations dispute resolution body, a code of practice shall be admissible in evidence and any provision of the code which appears to the court, body or officer concerned to be relevant to any question arising in the proceedings shall be taken into account in determining that question.</P>
        <P>It is also worth pointing out that NERA has been carrying out an on-going pilot programme of inspections involving domestic workers.  In general, cooperation levels among employers of domestic workers was high and compliance levels were on a par with other employer/employee relationships.</P>

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes is a matter for the parties involved.  The system of industrial relations in Ireland is designed to help and support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences, rather than imposing a solution on the parties to an industrial dispute.  It is expected that parties would come to the Labour Court in good faith and, would be prepared to accept the outcome of any process, including, Labour Court recommendation.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the settlement of a workplace relations dispute rests, ultimately, with the parties themselves.  While it would be my wish that all employers in both the public and private sectors would observe Labour Court recommendations, given the voluntarist nature of the process, I am not in a position to instruct them to do so.</P>

The original provisions of the 2001 Carer&rsquo;s Leave Act were amended by Section 48 of the Social Welfare Law Reform and Pensions Act 2006 which increased Carer&rsquo;s leave from 65 to 104 weeks.

	<P>The Industrial Relations (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2011 was published on 22 December 2011. The Bill has completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and is currently awaiting Committee Stage.  The main purpose of the Bill is to implement the commitment in the Programme for Government to reform the Joint Labour Committee system. The reform of the legal framework for our statutory wage setting mechanisms is aimed at increasing employers&rsquo; ability to retain and employ workers, particularly in sectors hard hit by the prevailing economic circumstances, such as the hospitality sector, and to facilitate necessary cross-sector adjustment.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Bill provides for the more comprehensive measures required to strengthen the legal framework for the Employment Regulation Orders and Registered Employment Agreement sectoral wage setting mechanisms, under the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2004, in the light of deficiencies in the original legislation identified in the July 2011 High Court judgment in the John Grace Fried Chicken case.</P><Col N="169"/>
        <P>The fact that the process of making EROs has been found by the High Court to be unconstitutional, together with the identified lack of adequate Oireachtas scrutiny of this process, only underscores some of the main features of the recommendations for reform that were put forward by the Independent Review Report on these statutory wage setting mechanisms &mdash; the Duffy/ Walsh report. The commissioning of the independent review of the ERO and REA systems was one of the undertakings given by the last Government in the context of the EU and IMF-supported financial assistance programme for Ireland.</P>
        <P>When enacted, this Bill, will implement the programme of reforms to the JLC/REA systems agreed by Government in July 2011. It will radically overhaul the system so as to make it fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances and labour market conditions.  It will also reinstate a robust system of protection for workers in these sectors in the aftermath of the High Court ruling in the John Grace Fried Chicken case.</P>
        <P>The principal measures in the legislation include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />JLCs will have the power to set a basic adult rate and two additional higher rates, based on length of service in the sector or enterprise concerned as well as the standards and skills recognised for the sector concerned.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />JLCs will no longer set Sunday premium rates. In order to recognise the special status of Sunday working a statutory Code of Practice will be prepared by the LRC following submissions from employers and trade unions. This Code will provide guidance to both parties in the sectors covering EROs on the compensatory arrangements, including such additional amounts as are reasonable, for Sunday working and on the procedure to apply in the event of disputes concerning the varying entitlements to Sunday working.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Companies will be able to derogate from EROs and REAs in cases of financial difficulty. For this to occur, the Labour Court must satisfy itself that specified criteria have been met. Such derogation will be granted, for a limited period, in cases of proven economic difficulty, following consultation with the employees.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />In setting rates, JLCs will have to take into account a series of economic and industrial relations factors.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The burden of compliance and record-keeping requirements for employers in these sectors will be reduced.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Providing for Ministerial involvement in the supervision of JLCs and in the making of orders to  vary or revoke EROs.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Providing for use of civil remedies rather than an exclusive reliance on criminal sanctions.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The constitutionality of EROs and REAs will be restored through inclusion of robust principles and policies.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am also proceeding with a series of complementary reforms to the JLC/REA systems which can be implemented without the need for legislative change, including:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Reducing the number of JLCs from 13 to 6;</P><Col N="170"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Standardising benefits such as overtime through a nationally agreed protocol or Code of Practice, through the normal process of consultation with the employers and trade union interests.</P>
        <P FLI="0">From the beginning of this process I have been determined to strike a balance between protecting vulnerable workers and providing reforms that would make the systems more competitive and more flexible so as to allow the creation of jobs in these sectors.</P>
        <P>From an employer&rsquo;s perspective, the overall effect of these reforms will be to substantially reduce the burden of record-keeping and compliance. This Bill will make the long-established minimum wage setting mechanisms fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances and will eliminate rigidities that are considered to have had a negative impact on competitiveness and jobs in the</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs outlines a number of actions which will be implemented in 2012 to support the Cloud Computing sector in Ireland. Such actions include: </P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Examining the potential for demonstration projects in cloud computing to promote Ireland as a centre of excellence for this technology, providing a reference site for Irish companies, while potentially lowering costs and improving services;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Supporting industry groups (e.g. Irish Internet Association) to develop and deliver a practical tool kit to assist SMEs in assessing the adoption of Cloud Computing for their business;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Ensuring that the ICT Skills Action Plan incorporates needs associated with the development of Cloud Computing in Ireland;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Developing a Cloud Computing Procurement Standard with industry experts through an NSAI Standards group;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Supporting research groups in areas of relevance to exploitation of cloud computing; and,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Delivering a Cloud Computing Technology Research Centre in order to support an industry led research and innovation agenda in this area.</P>
        <P FLI="0">With regard to the last two bullet points, I can confirm that a Cloud Computing Technology Centre is being established jointly by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland. After an open consultation process with industry partners, a steering committee has begun the work of developing a detailed research agenda.  This agenda formed the basis for the Initial Research Programme which will be undertaken by Dublin City University, University College Cork and Athlone Institute of Technology and will formally commence in the coming weeks.  This phase will be funded by &euro;1m over 12 months.</P><Col N="171"/>
        <P>This research is particularly valuable in that, it not only includes considerations of the technical expertise and requirements to develop effective cloud computing platforms, but also incorporates the business acumen required to build new business models, end user requirements and novel ways to commercialise these platforms at the very outset of the research programme. This approach will continue to inform and drive the development of the ongoing research into this increasingly economically advantageous area. While this phase is running in 2012, an open competition will be held to establish a Host for the formal Technology Research Centre, which will allow for a significant scale up in activity over a 5 year period supported by &euro;5m in exchequer funding.</P>
        <P>While the Cloud Computing Technology Centre represents the primary mechanism through which Enterprise Ireland will assist the business sector to develop and acquire expertise Cloud Computing, Enterprise Ireland has, in addition, funded directly a number of Cloud Computing start-up companies through its High Potential Start Up Programme and its Competitive Start Fund and will continue to support start-up companies in this sector.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland has informed me that, at the end of 2011, it was supporting 67 client companies in the Computer, Electronic and Optical Equipment Sector that employed over 14,000 people. It is not possible, however, to state how many of these companies are focused solely on the Cloud Computing sector.</P>
        <P>The question of introducing Cloud Computing in the Public Service is currently under consideration by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, who has committed, in accordance with the Acton Plans for Jobs, to developing a Cloud Computing Strategy for the Public Sector in 2012.</P>

It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by or on behalf of the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought.  These papers were received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 16th February 2012 and the appeal will, in due course, be assigned to an Appeals Officer for consideration.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</P>

	<P>The new maximum rent limits which came into force on 1 January 2012 are in line with the most up to date market data available.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that value for money is achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.  The analysis of the rental market for Wicklow carried out by the Department found that rental prices for Bray were having a distorting effect on the prices for Wicklow as a whole.  Accordingly, for the purpose of establishing rent limits for Co. Wicklow, Bray was excluded and the Department indicated that this area would be managed separately. </P>
        <P>Department officials have now carried out a separate analysis of the rental market in the Bray, Delganey and Greystones area.  Local rent limits are now in place and are set out in the tabular statement.</P>

	<P>The criteria for participating on the Community Employment (CE) programme are based on age and length of time in receipt of various social welfare payments. The core eligibility criterion for CE is that the person is in <Col N="173"/>receipt of a qualifying Social Welfare payment, as defined on the Department&rsquo;s public website. This requirement is based on Government policy and Departmental guidelines and has been the rule since CE commenced in 1994.</P>
        <P>The aim of CE remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment and/or further education and training.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  The CE programme is one of a range of training and employment programmes available for unemployed persons. All of these programmes have specific objectives and eligibility criteria that address the specific needs of a wide range of participants.</P>
        <P>Unemployed persons who are not in receipt of the required social welfare payments can still participate on many education and training programmes.  Such persons are advised to contact their local Employment Services Office where an Employment Services Officer will be happy to discuss the employment and training options that are open to them.  Within the current very difficult budgetary constraints, the number of places on Community Employment will remain at 23,300 in 2012.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 234 and 242 together. </P>
        <P>The provisions of the Community Employment programme allow for funding by the Department of Social Protection of Community Employment (CE) Sponsors to employ participants and supervisors up to the last day of their 65th year, at which point the entitlement to a state pension becomes available. Consequently, funding from my Department for such participants ceases on their 66th birthday, in line with the aims and objectives of the programme under Government Labour Market Intervention policies.</P>
        <P>For a person who has already reached 66 years of age, no funding would be available for the Sponsor to cover their wages. Additionally, CE was specifically set up as a labour market intervention with a defined target population, including long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups, to ultimately assist them to return to the labour market. Pensioners were not in the target population for this programme.  It should be noted that Section 34(4) of the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2002, provide: &lsquo;it shall not constitute discrimination on the age ground to fix different ages for retirement (whether voluntary or compulsory) of employees on any class or definition of employee&rsquo;.</P>

	<P>The National Internship Scheme provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals on the Live Register, in organisations in the private, public and community voluntary sectors.  The scheme is limited to individuals who are currently on the Live Register and have been in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance/Benefit or are signing on for credits for at least 3 of the last 6 months.  My Department continues to monitor and review the operation of the JobBridge scheme including its eligibility criteria on an ongoing basis.  </P>
        <P>The eligibility to access the National Internship Scheme is based on the overall objective of labour market policy in ensuring a pathway to appropriate employment, training and education opportunities for those on the Live Register. It is important that as employment opportunities become available they are taken up by those on the Live Register. The structure for achieving this objective is through a reinvigorated National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) which currently provides the framework for engaging with the unemployed.</P>
        <P>Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy and of the NEAP will be to keep those on the Live Register close to the Labour Market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. This will ensure that Live Register members availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will, while retaining social welfare unemployment payments and a top up allowance of &euro;50, get an opportunity to engage in the workplace, get work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.</P>
        <P>For these reasons, it has been proposed as a matter of public policy that eligibility for the scheme be confined to those on the Live Register and in receipt of unemployment payments or signing for credits for 3 of the last 6 months.  As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.</P>
        <P>Our Department continues to monitor and review the operation of the JobBridge scheme including its eligibility criteria on an ongoing basis.  The extension of JobBridge to those in receipt of Disability Allowance forms part of this broader review process.  This review process is at an advanced stage and it is anticipated that the Minister may be in a position to present formal proposals in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Individuals in receipt of Disability Payments may access a wide range of activation supports including the Work Placement Programme, which is designed to provide participants with valuable work experience, thereby improving their prospects of securing employment.  In addition, people in receipt of a disability allowance can access a range of other specific programmes, such as the Supported Employment Programme and the Wage Subsidy Scheme. Both of these programmes aim to assist people with a disability to secure and maintain a job in the labour market.</P>

	<P>Social welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions is not entitled to a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  A student undergoing a full-time course of study, instruction or training is disqualified for receiving jobseekers allowance or benefit.  This disqualification also extends to the holiday periods, including the summer holidays. The disqualification for receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance does not apply in the case of mature students during the period between two academic years. During this period a mature student can apply for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance, subject to satisfying the standard qualifying conditions, including that of being available for full-time work.  The are no plans to change these aspects of the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes.</P><Col N="177"/>
        <P>It may be noted that Jobbridge, the national internship scheme was established to provide people with valuable work experience. The aim of the national internship scheme is to assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers are unable to get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers wishing to learn new skills. The scheme also gives people a real opportunity to gain valuable experience to bridge the gap between study and the beginning of their working lives.</P>
        <P>Additionally, my Department encourages people to engage in voluntary work within the State. Any person who engages in voluntary work may continue to be entitled to Jobseekers Benefit or Allowance provided that, in engaging in the voluntary work, the customer continues to satisfy the statutory conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work.  Examples of voluntary work in which jobseekers may engage include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />helping the sick, elderly or persons with a disability,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />assisting youth clubs, church groups, sports groups, cultural organisations, local resident associations.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The groups involved may be nationally organised groups or local voluntary or community groups. The aim of the Voluntary Work Option is twofold, namely &mdash; to encourage voluntary organisations to involve jobseekers to the greatest extent possible in their existing activities by creating new opportunities for voluntary work and to inform jobseekers of their freedom to involve themselves in voluntary work and to encourage them to do so. In addition, the existing Community Employment Scheme, operated by F&Aacute;S, offers the opportunity to unemployed persons to participate in paid employment in the social economy.</P>

	<P>My Department participated in the Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group (referred to as the Keane group) and is currently a member of the Steering Group set up by the Minister for Finance to oversee and drive its overall recommendations.  My Department provides a number of supports for those in mortgage difficulty, particularly through the Mortgage Interest Supplement scheme which aims to provide short term support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments. In 2011 some 19,000 people benefitted from this scheme at a cost to the Exchequer of almost &euro;68 million.</P>
        <P>The Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group recommended that an independent Mortgage Support and Advice Service be established to advise mortgage holders in arrears or pre arrears in assessing their options. The report stated that the need for this service would be time limited to approximately 3 years.</P>
        <P>The publication of the heads of the Personal Insolvency Bill in January 2012, proposes the introduction of a four step process to address personal insolvency issues with the first three steps involving non-judicial debt settlement arrangements. This is a new arrangement and was not envisaged when the thinking in support of a Mortgage Advisory Service was originally proposed. Therefore, my Department is examining the role envisaged for the Personal Insolvency Trustee to ensure that there is no conflict with or duplication of Government supported services. From the customers perspective for example, the target group and complexity of the problems that need to be addressed appear to be similar and from the advisory perspective, the skills and expertise required would also appear to be similar for both services.</P><Col N="180"/>
        <P>My Department is chairing a Working Group as part of the Implementation Steering Group to examine the issues relating to the establishment of the Mortgage Advice Service, and as part of its remit it is examining the efficiency, necessity and governance arrangements of potentially two separate services. The needs of the customer, the importance of ease of access and information on services and the way in which the services will be made available must be to the fore.  My Department will be consulting with all relevant groups as part of its work in this area.</P>

Payments have also been made in respect of essential household items such as carpets, flooring, furniture and white goods. Funding towards alternative accommodation costs have also been made in certain cases depending on the circumstances of the families. Larger payments in respect of longer-term needs, such as assisting with the cost of repairing homes and making them habitable again are also being made. </P>
        <P>Matters relating to emergency flood defence works or issues relating to insurance claims or settlements do not fall within the remit of the Department.  Any person continuing to experience hardship as a result of the recent flooding should contact the local Department of Social Protection representative administering the supplementary allowance scheme who may be able to offer assistance.</P>

	<P>The Community Employment Programme is a labour market intervention designed to assist the long term unemployed return to the work force.  Persons eligible to apply should be  aged 25-65 years who are unemployed for over 12 months and who are currently in receipt of one of the following payments from the Department of Social Protection:</P><Col N="183"/>

        <P FLI="0">Time spent in receipt of carers allowance or time spent on recognised training or employment programmes, in addition to receipt of above payments, can make up the qualifying period of 12 months.  To be eligible to participate on a  community employment scheme, it is mandatory that all participants are currently in receipt of one of the above listed payments on their expected CE start date.</P>
        <P>The person concerned was on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit from 7th August 2010 until 10th February 2012 during which time she completed a F&Aacute;S Computerised Accounts and Payroll course for 26 weeks.  Entitlement of the person concerned to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit ceased on 10th February 2012 and she was no longer eligible to start on a CE scheme after that date.  However, if the person concerned would like to speak to a employment services officer to explore her training options, an appointment can be made for her at her local employment services office.</P>

        <P>The determination of the PRSI insurability status of working directors has been the subject of recent legal advice and court judgments.  As a result of these developments the Department is currently examining its procedures for determining the insurability status of working directors to ensure that its decisions are in accordance with best practice and legal advice.  I regret the difficulties caused by the delay in processing cases for decision however this is a very difficult and complicated aspect of insurability and it is vital that this matter be examined fully before any further decisions are issued.</P>

	<P>The National Internship Scheme provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals on the Live Register, in organisations in the private, public and community voluntary sectors.  The scheme is limited to individuals who are currently on the Live Register and have been in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance/Benefit or are signing on for credits for at least 3 of the last 6 months.</P>
        <P>The eligibility to access the National Internship Scheme is based on the overall objective of labour market policy in ensuring a pathway to appropriate employment, training and education opportunities for those on the Live Register. It is important that as employment opportunities become available they are taken up by those on the Live Register. The structure for achieving this objective is through a reinvigorated National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) which currently provides the framework for engaging with the unemployed.</P>
        <P>Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy and of the NEAP will be to keep those on the Live Register close to the Labour Market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. This will ensure that Live Register members availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will, while retaining social welfare unemployment payments and a top up allowance of &euro;50, get an opportunity to engage in the workplace, get work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.</P>
        <P>For these reasons, it has been proposed as a matter of public policy that eligibility for the scheme be confined to those on the Live Register and in receipt of unemployment payments or signing for credits for 3 of the last 6 months.  As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to monitor and review the operation of the JobBridge scheme including its eligibility criteria on an ongoing basis.  The extension of JobBridge to those in receipt of One Parent Family Payments and Disability Allowances forms part of this broader review process. This review process is at an advanced stage and it is anticipated that the Minister may be in a position to present formal proposals in the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>An application for domiciliary care allowance (DCA) was received in the Department on 17th July 2009 and this application was awarded on appeal on 23rd March 2011.  DCA is payable from the month following receipt of the application unless good cause is shown for the delay.  Where good cause is shown, it can be <Col N="186"/>backdated by a maximum of six months or to April 2009 (when the Department took over administration of the scheme from the HSE), whichever is the most recent.  The person concerned did not indicate any reason for the delay in claiming the payment and, as a result, the allowance was put into payment from August 2009, the month after the application was received in the Department.</P>
        <P>If the person concerned wishes to make an application for backdating, she should do so in writing, stating clearly the reason the application was not made at the earliest opportunity.  As the Department took over responsibility for the DCA scheme in April 2009, this is the earliest date that payment can be backdated if good cause for the late claim is shown.</P>

	<P>The Government has provided various types of support to people affected by the November 2009 flooding. Humanitarian Aid payments were made, both in the immediate aftermath of the flooding and subsequently to enable eligible households to resume living at their home. Flood relief works were also undertaken in some of the affected areas and other works are at an advanced state of preparation. Discussions also took place with representatives of the insurance industry regarding giving households access to appropriate house insurance at a reasonable cost.</P>
        <P>Subject to certain conditions the Government also decided to provide support to a small number of families who are continuing to experience significant housing problems as a result of the November 2009 flooding and are considering the possibility of relocating rather than resuming living at their original home.  The household of the person concerned has been visited by an official from the Department and a report of their individual circumstances has been completed. In addition one of the conditions was that assistance could only be provided in situation where:  <i>&ldquo;in the opinion of the Office of Public Works the house is unsustainable due to flooding because of depth/duration/frequency and cannot be protected from flooding at an economical cost&rdquo;.</i></P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works (OPW) has confirmed that the person concerned satisfies this condition. The person has been advised that on the basis of all the relevant facts it has been decided that financial assistance towards relocation will be provided to them.

	<P>An application for domiciliary care allowance (DCA) was received on 29th March 2011.  This application was referred to one of the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors who found that the child was not medically eligible for DCA.  A letter issued on 10th June 2011 refusing the allowance.  The person concerned subsequently lodged an appeal against this decision.  She was informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 8th December 2011 that the appeal had been disallowed.  The decision/appeal process for this application is now complete.  If the person concerned has additional information which was not made available to the deciding and appeals officers when they made their decisions, it is open to her to re-apply for the payment.</P>

	<P>Carers allowance is a means tested social assistance payment made to persons who are unable to work because they providing full time care and attention to elderly people or people with disabilities.  Expenditure on carers has increased substantially over the last ten years, from &euro;100 million in 2000 to a provisional outturn of some &euro;658 million on carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit and respite care grant in 2011.  This does not include the cost of the household benefits package or free travel which carers also receive.  In 2011, there were almost 52,000 people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance from my Department; 22,000 of these were getting half-rate carers allowance in addition to another social welfare payment, an increase of almost 40% since 2008.</P>
        <P>The habitual residence condition, as provided for in section 246 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005 (as amended), applies to claims for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, non-contributory State pension, blind pension, non-contributory widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s pensions, guardian&rsquo;s payment, one-parent family payment, carer&rsquo;s allowance, disability allowance, supplementary welfare allowance including rent supplement, and child benefit.  The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not qualified for these payments in Ireland.  The purpose of this condition is to safeguard the social welfare system from abuse by restricting access for people who are not economically active and who have little or no established connection with Ireland.</P><Col N="189"/>
        <P>The legislation directs the deciding officer to take into consideration all the circumstances of the case, including, in particular, the following factors specified by the European Court of Justice:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. The length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country;</P>
        <P LI="1">2. The length and purpose of any absence from the State;</P>
        <P LI="1">3. The nature and pattern of the person&rsquo;s employment;</P>
        <P LI="1">4. The person&rsquo;s main centre of interest; and</P>
        <P LI="1">5. The future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have no plans to change this requirement for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  The operation of the scheme is kept under review to ensure it operates fairly and that applicants are not being refused without full and appropriate consideration.  There are a number of issues which contribute to rejection on HRC grounds.  These include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The applicant&rsquo;s main centre of interest clearly being outside Ireland, including Irish nationals returning home who clearly indicate that their homes, lives and future intentions are out of this State and that their stay in Ireland is of a short duration;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Failure to provide relevant documentation (such as proof that they have terminated their employment, residency, closed bank accounts abroad etc.) or no documentation at all;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Clear evidence that an applicant is continuing to receive welfare from another jurisdiction based on their residency there, for example a person receiving disability living allowance based on their residency in Northern Ireland;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Persons who make multiple applications in a very short time for different allowances such as jobseekers, disability and carers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The number of applications refused on grounds of habitual residency is small.  In 2011, 13,888 applications for carer&rsquo;s allowance were processed.  Of these, 223 were refused on the basis of habitual residency, of which 42 were Irish nationals.  This means that, in 2011, approximately 1.6% of all applications were refused on habitual residency grounds.</P>

	<P>Pathways to Work is a new approach to the provision of service to unemployed people, the objective of which is to reduce the level of long term unemployment and in so doing to ensure that the overall level of unemployment will reduce as the economy returns to growth</P>
        <P>Following approval by Government of the NEES project plan last June and the transfer of the CWS and the F&Aacute;S services in October 2011 and January 2012 respectively, the Department is now developing the new integrated service as set out in Pathways to Work.  The new integrated service will be piloted from four office locations in May of this year and extended to a <Col N="190"/>further 10 offices by the end of the year.  As the question suggests the roll-out of the new service will be very challenging for my Department and will require the allocation of additional resources to employment services/activation work.</P>
        <P>The transfer of approximately 1,700 staff from the CWS and F&Aacute;S, the majority of whom have significant experience in working with clients in a case management model has enhanced the capabilities of the Department in this regard.  In addition, the Department is also engaged in a programme of systems development and process change that should enable staff from within its own resources to be deployed to meet the requirements of the new business model.</P>
        <P>The Department will also work with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Appointments Service to address any resourcing deficit that arises notwithstanding the reallocation of resources outlined above.  The use of external resources, including private sector providers of employment services, will also be considered.</P>

        <Quest> if she will reverse the decision announced in budget 2012 to reduce the employer&rsquo;s rebate on redundancies from 60% to 15% which in effect increases the costs of redundancy for employers by 112%; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12778/12]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the redundancy payments scheme is to compensate workers, under the Redundancy Payments Acts, for the loss of their jobs by reason of redundancy.  Compensation is based on the worker&rsquo;s length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600.00 per week.  All payments are made from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).  There are two types of redundancy payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership or liquidation.  </P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all their eligible employees.  An employer who pays statutory redundancy payments to their employees is then entitled to a rebate from the State.  Rebates to employers and lump sums paid directly to employees are paid from the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
        <P>Significant and increasing amounts have been paid out in redundancy rebates to employers from the SIF in recent years.  While the SIF is constituted primarily from employer contributions, the taxpayers&rsquo; contribution is also significant.  One of the factors which influenced the Government&rsquo;s decision to revise the rebate rate was the increasing costs of rebates in recent years.</P>
        <P>I am very concerned about the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund.  Where the date of dismissal for the purposes of redundancy occurred before 1 January 2012 the Social Insurance Fund refunded employers 60 per cent of the cost of making people redundant.  &euro;152.2 million was paid out in rebates to employers in 2006; &euro;167.4 million was paid in 2007; &euro;161.8 million was paid in 2008; &euro;247.9 million in 2009; &euro;373.2 million in 2010 and &euro;188.2 million in 2011.  The amounts paid out in lump sums to employees have also increased.</P>
        <P>I do not see why this country should continue to borrow money to plug the hole in the Social Insurance Fund in order to fund the cost of making people redundant &mdash; often from very profitable companies.  As part of the deliberations on Budget 2012, the approach taken in other countries was examined and it was decided that the 60% level of rebate is not sustainable in the current economic climate.   While this may cause difficulties for employers it should be <Col N="191"/>noted that redundancy rebate payments to employers are not common in many EU and other jurisdictions.  The new arrangements bring Ireland more closely into line with practice in other countries.</P>

One of these conditions is that the carer is not employed outside the home for more than 15 hours a week. On the basis of the evidence provided, the person concerned did not satisfy this condition.  In addition, based on the advice of the Department&rsquo;s medical Assessors, the person being cared for was deemed not eligible on medical grounds, following a review.

	<P>The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004.  The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere would not normally be entitled to social welfare assistance or child benefit payments on arrival in Ireland. Guidelines were introduced for Deciding Officers in the Department to assist in ascertaining entitlements of such claimants to social assistance. Each case received for a determination on the Habitual Residence Condition (HRC) is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the legislation and guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case.  </P>
        <P>A review of the habitual residence guidelines undertaken by a Departmental working group in 2010 and 2011 was completed in June 2011.  An updated version of guidelines was published on the Department&rsquo;s website which can be found at  <i>http://www.welfare.ie/EN/OperationalGuidelines/Pages/habres.aspx</i>.  The purpose of this review was to make the guidelines clearer and more user-friendly for deciding officers and customers alike, and, improve consistency in decision making across the Department.</P>
        <P>The guidelines regarding determination of habitual residence address the issue of returning emigrants very specifically.   The Guidelines state:   &ldquo;A person who had previously been habitually resident in the State and who moved to live and work in another country and then resumes his/her long-term residence in the State may be regarded as being habitually resident immediately on his/her return to the State.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>In determining the main centre of interest in the case of returning emigrants, deciding officers take account of:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />purpose of return e.g. expiry of foreign residence permit,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the applicant&rsquo;s stated intentions,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />verified arrangements which have been made in regard to returning on a long-term basis e.g. transfer of financial accounts and any other assets, termination of residence based entitlements in the other country, or assistance from Safe Home or a similar programme to enable Irish emigrants to return permanently,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />length and continuity of the previous residence in the State,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the record of employment or self-employment in another State and,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />whether s/he has maintained links with the previous residence and can be regarded as resuming his/her previous residence rather than starting a new period of residence.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The following examples are acceptable as proof of permanent return to Ireland:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Documented evidence of transportation of personal possessions,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Proof of cessation of employment,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Proof of termination of lease on rented property or proof of sale of home,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Evidence of closure of financial accounts and transfer of funds,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Evidence of completion of studies abroad (where applicable),</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Copy of passport and expiration of visa at the time they returned.</P><Col N="193"/>
        <P FLI="0">(In a case where a person says they were resident illegally in a country outside the EEA, the entry visa to that country, stamped on their passport, will clearly show the permitted duration of their stay in that country.  For example, a person who went to the USA in 2007 and was granted an entry visa to remain there for 90 days but continued to live there until 2009, that person was resident in the USA illegally after the expiry of the 90 days.  In a case like this, the fact that a person cannot return to that particular country, would mean that they may be likely to be habitually resident in Ireland).</P>
        <P>This list is not exhaustive.</P>
        <P>This is generally sufficient to enable the deciding officer to determine whether their present circumstances in Ireland indicate a temporary visit or habitual residence.  Any applicant who disagrees with the decision on a case has the right to request a review of that decision and/or appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
        <P>There is no discrimination on grounds of nationality in social welfare legislation and to introduce such a provision would be contrary to the equality principles that Ireland has adopted in its equality legislation, the Treaties of the European Community, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and other international conventions.  I have no statistical evidence that there has been any significant increase in the number of disallowances on the grounds of not being Habitually Resident for claims made by returning Irish emigrants. An Irish national returning to live here on a permanent basis should experience no difficulty in demonstrating that they satisfy the requirements of the HRC.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Usually where an Irish citizen dies abroad, the death is registered by the civil authorities of the place where the death occurred, and a certified copy of the death registration is obtainable.  This certificate, translated if necessary, is normally sufficient for all legal and administrative purposes here and for these reasons alone there is no necessity for the death to be registered in the State.  The provisions and procedures governing the registration of deaths in Ireland are contained in Part 5 of the Civil Registration Act 2004.</P>
        <P>Section 38 of the Act provides that in specific circumstances the death of an Irish citizen domiciled in the State may be registered here.  This applies where such a death occurs in a place where there is no system of registration or where it is not possible to obtain a copy of or extract from the civil records of the death.  In all other circumstances the death is registered by the civil authorities of the place where the death occurred.  Any broadening of the current provisions requires careful consideration given the number of people who live and die in other countries and who have or are entitled to have Irish citizenship.  However, I would hope to be in a position to introduce legislation on this, and other aspects of civil registration, in 2012.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As part of the agreed Programme of Financial Support with the EU/IMF and ECB, the Department submitted a progress report to the troika by at the end of December 2011, outlining progress to date in developing a single working age payment.  This report detailed measures that were steps towards a single working age payment and were announced in Budget 2012. These measures included changes to the One Parent Family Payment, the Farm Assist Scheme and the ceasing of concurrent entitlements to new entrants to the Community Employment Scheme.</P>
        <P>A further commitment contained in the Programme for Financial Support is that the Department would submit to Government a comprehensive programme of reforms that can help better targeting of social support to those on lower incomes and ensure that work pays for welfare recipients. This programme is due to be submitted by end-March 2012 and it is expected that proposals in relation to the development of a single working age payment will be incorporated into this programme of reforms.</P>

	<P>The land referred to by the Deputy appears to be located in a Natural Heritage Area designated in 2004.   In 2010, the then Government decided that turf cutting should come to an end on raised bog Natural Heritage Areas at the end of 2013 and also announced the closure of the Voluntary Bog Purchase Scheme, administered by my Department, to new applicants. However, the current Programme for Government contains an undertaking to review the situation with regard to turf cutting on Natural Heritage Areas.</P>
        <P>On 15   April 2011, the Government made a number of decisions in relation to turf cutting in Ireland, including the putting in place of a compensation package for those who are required to cease cutting, the establishment of a Peatlands Council and the drawing up of a national strategy on peatland conservation and management.  In the context of the national strategy, the position regarding raised bog Natural Heritage Areas, which are designated under national legislation, will be examined in advance of the 2014 cutting season in accordance with the Programme for Government.</P>

	<P>The arts and culture sectors continue to offer vital opportunities for the provision of important cultural, social and employment benefits to communities throughout the country.  The nature of employment within the arts sector encompasses a very wide range of activities. It can include those engaged in the arts practice within specific artistic genres and can also encompass areas which flow from such artistic pursuits.  It may also embody the whole industrial creative sectors, including the audiovisual production sector.</P>
        <P>The Government appreciates and values the contribution the arts sector makes to the internationally renowned artistic reputation of this country.  Within the current economic constraints, investment in the arts, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever, having regard to the employment intensity of the sector.</P>
        <P>The heritage area is also increasingly identified as a primary stimulus in the tourism sector and my Department is committed to promoting greater appreciation and understanding of Ireland&rsquo;s rich heritage as a valuable amenity for business, farming and tourism and as a means of presenting Ireland as an attractive destination for sustainable inward investment.  While the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and the agencies under its remit, have primary responsibility for the promotion of Ireland generally as an attractive visitor location, heritage sites, including national parks and national monuments, feature strongly in much of this promotion.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department through, for example, the provision of important heritage inventories, the funding for the conservation and presentation of the built heritage, and through support for the Heritage Council, assists in promoting greater appreciation and understanding <Col N="197"/>of Ireland&rsquo;s heritage as a valuable amenity for residents and visitors alike. My Department is also directly involved in developing heritage initiatives with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Heritage Council and other organisations.  I am confident that these and other initiatives will contribute to the quality of the national heritage tourism product, economic recovery and job creation.</P>

        <P>I am strongly of the view that Ireland&rsquo;s arts and culture constitute one of our world-class, distinctive strengths as a nation and this view was reaffirmed by the positive findings of the Global Irish Economic Forum held last October. I am satisfied that the international promotion of Irish arts through my Department&rsquo;s <i>Culture Ireland</i> programme continues to make a notable contribution &mdash; not least in the US last year with the <i>Imagine Ireland </i>  programme &mdash; in helping to restore our global reputation in these difficult times. At the same time, the promotion of Irish cultural and creative excellence in Europe and in key expert markets, such as China, offers fresh and innovative opportunities for the country, working in tandem with the promotion of trade, investment, tourism, agri-food and science.  In particular, our EU Presidency in 2013 offers a new platform for cultural links with key European partners.  In relation to the promotion abroad of County Kildare, the Deputy will understand that my remit in this context is a national one.</P>

	<P>The National Cultural Institutions, which operate under the aegis of my Department, play a key role in increasing awareness of the value and benefit of cultural activities. Visitor numbers to our national cultural institutions and other cultural venues supported by my Department exceeded 3.6 million in 2011.  This figure represents a moderate increase on the 2010 figure of 3.58 million and a significant increase over and above the 2009 figure of 3.25 million. </P>
        <P>Initiatives to attract the interest of the general public and to enhance the visitor experience will remain a priority for all of these cultural institutions and venues in 2012 and my Department will continue to work closely with them in this regard.  The quality and diversity of the cultural exhibits and events on offer at these institutions plays a key role in attracting such significant visitor numbers. In this regard, the funding provided by my Department to the cultural institutions is of critical importance in terms of the maintenance and preservation of existing collections and enhancing the calibre and range of the collections and exhibitions on offer.</P>

	<P>My Department has a broad range of responsibilities in respect to the protection of our natural, architectural and archaeological heritage and, in each case, there is a different suite of legislative instruments that provide for the protection of the relevant national heritage sites.</P>
        <P>My Department directly manages 6 national parks and 66 nature reserves. In addition, it has responsibility for the monitoring of European nature sites established under the Birds and Habitats Directives, as well as natural heritage areas, nature reserves and refuges for fauna and flora established under the Wildlife Acts.  All sites designated for nature conservation have been identified as requiring protection and are monitored on an on-going basis.</P>
        <P>Under the provisions of Part IV (Architectural Heritage) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, each planning authority is required to include in its development plan a Record of Protected Structures. The making of an addition to, or deletion from, a Record of Protected Structures is a reserved function of the planning authorities. Inclusion in the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them, seek to safeguard their future and serve notice to require works to be carried out in relation to endangerment of protected structures. On the basis of information submitted by the planning authorities to my Department, there were 19 such notices served in 2008, 27 in 2009 and 10 in 2010. Information for 2011 is currently being sought.</P>
        <P>The 757 national monuments in the ownership or guardianship of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht are managed and maintained by the Office of Public Works on a day to day basis.  Local authorities are responsible for monuments in their ownership or guardianship.  The vast majority of recorded monuments (approx 120,000) are, however, privately owned and, while they are protected under the National Monuments Acts, the owners are responsible for their maintenance.  Appropriate action is taken where my Department becomes <Col N="200"/>aware of threats or damage to monuments, including advice to owners, prosecution under the National Monuments Acts or, occasionally, rescue excavation work.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the scope to provide for the protection of the State&rsquo;s heritage assets is constrained by the current national economic difficulties and the significant reduction in the public finances. However, my Department will continue to provide funding for the protection, conservation and development of our built and natural heritage, in so far as resources allow, in accordance with best practice and legal requirements, both nationally and internationally, and will intervene as provided by law to protect such sites.</P>

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s telecommunications market has been liberalised since 1999 and thus the delivery of broadband services is a matter, in the first instance, for private sector commercial operators.  Details of broadband services available in each county can be found on ComReg website at <i>www.callcosts.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) represents such an intervention.  It aimed to bring an affordable, scalable broadband service to certain designated electoral divisions where the extent of broadband coverage by commercial operators, at the time the Scheme was launched in 2008, was deemed to be insufficient.  Prior to the commencement of the NBS, a detailed mapping exercise was carried out to determine those areas that would be included in the scheme and those which, by virtue of being already substantially served by existing broadband suppliers, could not be included.</P>
        <P>EU State aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where existing service providers operate.  Accordingly, the NBS is restricted to providing a basic service and is prohibited from providing a service in areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.  That mapping exercise found that the general area of Aughadiffin, Kilkelly, County Mayo was served by existing service providers and consequently it was excluded from the Scheme.</P>
        <P>The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) was launched last year in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision, due to technical difficulties such as line of sight issues.  This Scheme, which is being rolled out this year, is aimed at making a basic broadband service available to those individual un-served premises in rural non-NBS areas that wish to avail of such services.  In total, 210 applications were received in respect of premises in County Mayo, with 3 applications from the Kilkelly area.</P><Col N="202"/>
        <P>The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland will meet the EU Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;Digital Agenda for Europe&rdquo; target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</P>
        <P>The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce which I convened last summer has an important role to play in this regard.  It comprises the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies operating in the Irish market, as well as CEOs of some other companies that provide broadband services.  The purpose of the Taskforce is to discuss and report on policy issues and proposals in relation to the provision of high speed broadband across Ireland.  I expect that the Taskforce will help to identify how best to deliver wider customer access to high-speed broadband generally and thereby assist in delivering on the commitment in the Programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The Taskforce will conclude its deliberations shortly.  It is my intention to consider the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the report of the Taskforce and to move quickly thereafter to put in place the optimal policy environment for the delivery of high speed broadband.</P>

	<P>The provision of secure, sustainable and competitive energy supplies is critical for the economy and for business and mitigating energy costs where possible remains a key priority.  Global gas and oil prices have risen sharply since the start of 2011 driven by events in North Africa and Japan and high demand from China and India and other emerging economies.</P>
        <P>Given Ireland&rsquo;s heavy reliance on imported gas and oil and small peripheral market size, the economy is a price taker in the global fossil fuel market and vulnerable to fossil fuel price fluctuations.  Competitor countries are in many instances facing the same prospect and the objective in the context of higher global prices is that Ireland retains and where possible improves comparative competitiveness in terms of energy costs.  I am committed to working with enterprise and with the energy sector to ensure that the costs of energy are as competitive as possible through those measures at our disposal, including sustained focus on energy efficiency and renewables to reduce our dependence and therefore lower our vulnerability to global price increases in such fuels.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The latest analysis of data published by EUROSTAT for electricity and gas prices is published by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and covers the period January to June 2011.  The figures show Irish electricity and gas prices performing well at that point by reference to the EU average for medium to large business customers (above 2,000 MWh/annum).  The VAT-exclusive electricity price in Ireland for these businesses ranged from 10% to 17% below the EU average and from 13% to 19% below the Eurozone average.  The category includes the large multinational employers.  The SEAI data also show that prices for business customers of gas were below the EU average by 4% to 25% for most business gas categories.</P><Col N="203"/>
        <P>The Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Carbon Revenue Levy) Act 2010 provided for the introduction of a Carbon Revenue Levy, payable by fossil fuel generators of electricity, the proceeds of which have been utilised for rebates to Large Energy Users (LEUs) to mitigate their electricity costs.</P>
        <P>A recent Supreme Court judgment has found against the Commission for Energy Regulation&rsquo;s prohibition on the Carbon Revenue levy from being &ldquo;bidded-in&rdquo; by generators to the wholesale price of electricity in the Single Electricity Market.  The consequences of the judgement are that generators will henceforth bid in the cost of the levy with potential impact on prices for the duration of the levy, which, under the Act, is due to cease at the end of 2012.  My Department is assessing the judgement from all relevant policy perspectives in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.</P>

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s telecommunications market has been liberalised since 1999 and thus the delivery of broadband services is a matter, in the first instance, for private sector commercial operators.  The State only intervenes in cases of clear market failure, such as in the cases of both the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS).  Any such State intervention is subject to EU State Aid scrutiny to ensure that it does not give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.</P>
        <P>The RBS was launched last year in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision, due to technical difficulties such as line of sight issues.  This Scheme, which is being rolled out this year, is aimed at making a basic broadband service available to those individual un-served premises in rural non-NBS areas who wish to avail of such services.  Approximately 3,700 applications qualified under the Scheme and the Verification Phase of the Scheme is now underway.  Under this phase, the details of applicants have been passed to Internet Service Providers who are participating in the Scheme and these companies have responded to my Department indicating where they may be able to offer services.  I expect that a significant number of applicants may be served by commercial operators as part of this phase of the scheme.  Once the applicants have given their written consent to be contacted by the companies in question, the companies will be in touch with written offers of service.</P><Col N="204"/>
        <P>The response to date by industry suggests that virtually all premises in the country are capable of obtaining a broadband service from a supplier using one of the available technology platforms i.e. DSL, fixed or mobile wireless, cable or satellite. Where a commercial service has been shown to be available, the State cannot intervene with a subvention for alternative services.</P>
        <P>While it is not feasible to re-open the RBS for applications, those living in areas covered by the National Broadband Scheme are still entitled to seek a service from &ldquo;3&rdquo; under this Government initiative up to August 2014 when the contract will expire.</P>
        <P>The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.

        <P>Standard Exploration Licence 2/11 was granted last year to a consortium comprising Providence Resources plc and Star Energy Oil and Gas Ltd over an area of approximately 380 square kilometres in the Kish Bank Basin.  The exploration licence confers on the holder the exclusive right to search for petroleum in the licensed area, but does not confer a right to produce/extract petroleum.  The licence is subject to the provisions of the Licensing Terms for Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration, Development and Production 2007 which can be viewed on my Department&rsquo;s web site at the following link: <i>http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Natural/Petroleum+Affairs+Division/Licensing+Applications/</i>.</P>

        <P>In the event that the exploration programme resulted in a commercial discovery being made then the licensees would require a number of statutory approvals for an extraction project, including a petroleum lease and a plan of development consent from the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Other relevant statutory consents could include an IPPC Licence from the EPA, a Foreshore Licence from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and a planning and development consent from An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  All of these consent processes would include an environmental impact assessment with a public consultation phase.  A safety permit would also be required from the Commission for Energy Regulation.</P>

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s telecommunications market has been open to competition since 1999 and since then has developed into a well-regulated market supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Despite the current economic difficulties, significant private sector investment continues to be made in the provision of broadband products and services.</P>
        <P>The State is not a provider of services, except in instances of clear market failure such as in the cases of both the National and Rural Broadband Schemes.  Such interventions are always subject to EU State Aid clearance to ensure no unacceptable level of market distortion takes place.  Between these private and public investments, at least a basic broadband service is now available right throughout the country.  Details of broadband services available on a county-by-county basis can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at <i>www.callcosts.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>However, given the nature of some rural development, particularly in relation to one-off-housing, a relatively small number of rural premises do continue to experience difficulties in accessing reliable and affordable broadband services.  The Rural Broadband Scheme should assist in addressing this problem.  The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland will meet the EU Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;Digital Agenda for Europe&rdquo; target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</P>

	<P>Under the Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC Ireland has been set a legally binding target for renewable energy as a proportion of all energy consumption that must be achieved by 2020.  The National Renewable Energy Action Plan sets out that this overall 16% target will be achieved through 40% consumption of renewables in the electricity sector, 10% in the transport sector and 12% in the heat sector.  The targets are challenging and the plan sets out the actions needed and the barriers to be overcome in order to achieve the targets by 2020.</P>
        <P>The progressive delivery of increased renewable energy is being supported by a variety of policy initiatives.  In the transport sector, the biofuels obligation introduced in 2010 under the Energy (Biofuel Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010, requires transport fuel suppliers to provide a specified amount of their sales in the form of biofuels.  The obligation currently stands at 4% by volume which is equivalent to 3% in energy terms.  The biofuel obligation will incrementally increase on a sustainable basis over the horizon to 2020 to meet the renewable transport target of 10% in 2020.  In April 2011, I launched the Electric Vehicle Grant scheme to encourage early adoption of the technology by offering support of up to &euro;5,000 for the purchase of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV).</P><Col N="207"/>
        <P>Due to the cost of transporting heat, heat is generally consumed at the point of generation to maximise efficiency.  The recently announced biomass feed-in-tariff for electricity exported to the grid provides for up to 310 MW of new biomass generation to be constructed.  This will support renewable heating by stimulating the production of biomass and anaerobic digestion combined heat and power.  Ireland&rsquo;s renewable heat target is particularly challenging given settlement patterns and housing density.</P>
        <P>Renewable electricity is the largest contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy consumption (estimated at 18% at the end of 2011) and will contribute most to the national 2020 target.  The largest contribution in the electricity sector is expected to be made through generation from wind technologies, followed by biomass technologies.  For the support of commercial renewable generation, my Department administers a renewable energy support mechanism known as the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff (REFIT). EirGrid&rsquo;s data, available on their website <i>www.eirgrid.com</i>, shows that at the end of 2011, there were 1630 MW of wind generation connected to the grid, representing the majority of the 1900 MW of renewable generation on the system.</P>
        <P>The latest modelling, undertaken by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), (Energy Forecasts for Ireland to 2020 [2011]), projects that capacity of around 4000 MW of renewable generation will be required on the electricity system to deliver the 40% renewable electricity target by 2020.  I am determined that the challenging 2020 target will be achieved and the policy measures set out above are testimony to my determination in this regard.</P>

	<P>Ireland is a price taker in the global fossil fuel market.  The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is free entry to the market.  There is no price control on petroleum products and it has been the policy objective of successive Governments to promote price competition and consumer choice.</P>
        <P>Previous surveys have shown that prices which Irish retailers charge for oil products, relate to the refinery price rather than to the price of crude oil.  Prices at the pump reflect the volatile market price, transportation costs, euro/dollar fluctuations and other operating costs as well as the impact of taxes on oil products.  Taxation of fuel products including petrol is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.</P>

        <Quest> when acceptable broadband will be rolled out at a location (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s telecommunications market has been liberalised since 1999 and the delivery of broadband services is therefore a matter, in the first instance, for private sector commercial operators.  Details of broadband services available in each county can be found on ComReg website at <i>www.callcosts.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) represents such an intervention.  Prior to the commencement of the NBS, a detailed mapping exercise was carried out to determine those areas that would be included in the scheme and those which, by virtue of being already substantially served by existing broadband suppliers, could not be included.</P>
        <P>EU State aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where existing service providers operate.  Accordingly, the NBS is restricted to providing a basic service and is prohibited from providing a service in areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.  That mapping exercise found that Kildare town was served by existing service providers and consequently it was excluded from the Scheme.</P>
        <P>The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) was launched last year in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive broadband provision, due to technical difficulties such as line of sight issues.  This Scheme, which is being rolled out this year, is aimed at making a basic broadband service available to those individual un-served premises in rural non-NBS areas who wish to avail of such services.  In total, 164 applications were received in respect of premises in County Kildare.</P><Col N="209"/>
        <P>The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland will meet the EU Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;Digital Agenda for Europe&rdquo; target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.</P>
        <P>The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce, which I convened last summer, has an important role to play in this regard.  It comprises the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies operating in the Irish market, as well as CEOs of some other companies that provide broadband services.  The purpose of the Taskforce is to discuss and report on policy issues and proposals in relation to the provision of high speed broadband across Ireland.  I expect that the Taskforce will help to identify how best to deliver wider customer access to high-speed broadband generally and thereby assist in delivering on the commitment in the Programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The Taskforce will conclude its deliberations shortly.  It is my intention to consider the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the report of the Taskforce and to move quickly thereafter to put in place the optimal policy environment for the delivery of high speed broadband.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for the regulation of disconnection and reconnection processes and fees is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  I have no function in the matter.</P>
        <P>It is the case that the continuing level of disconnections is a matter of considerable concern for me and my Government colleagues, the CER, voluntary organisations and energy suppliers.  The current economic climate is placing additional pressures on consumers and many consumers are experiencing problems meeting outgoings including energy costs.  The primary responsibility to manage customer debt rests with the energy suppliers and the customer.  The key message for all customers is to contact their suppliers to make arrangements before the situation gets to the point of disconnection.</P>
        <P>The CER, a statutorily independent body established under the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, has responsibility for overseeing the regulation of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and gas sectors.  CER promotes competition in the electricity and natural gas markets so that customers can ultimately benefit from competitive pressures on prices, and also protects the interests of final customers, especially the disadvantaged and the elderly, by ensuring that standards of services are set and codes of practice are in place to protect vulnerable users.</P>
        <P>In fulfilment of its customer protection remit, the CER has taken a number of initiatives in relation to disconnections policy since 2010.  In 2010, changes were introduced to the allocation of costs of both disconnections and reconnections for non-payment between the supplier and customer.  Instead of the customer bearing the entire cost, these costs are now shared equally by the supplier.  The CER also issued updated Guidelines for the Disconnections Code of <Col N="211"/>Practice requiring suppliers to engage with customers experiencing difficulties making payments against their bills.</P>
        <P>The CER has also proactively facilitated a &ldquo;Pay as You Go&rdquo; metering system, also known as a prepayment meter, in both the natural gas and electricity industry to allow customers to manage their bills more effectively.  The &lsquo;Pay as You Go&rsquo; metering system is being rolled out by all suppliers across the country.  In addition to providing a useful budgeting tool to customers, suppliers are required to offer customers facing disconnection the option of a &ldquo;Pay as You Go&rdquo; meter, where this is suitable, instead of proceeding to disconnect the customer.  In these circumstances the customer&rsquo;s outstanding debt is placed on the meter and is repaid over time.</P>
        <P Just="Left">CER advises that when a customer is disconnected from either natural gas or electricity for an extended period of time and their meter has been removed, prior to reconnection, the customer&rsquo;s installation requires safety checks and certification to ensure that it is still safe to have natural gas or electricity connected to it.  In addition, if the customer has been disconnected for over two years, reconnection costs will be charged.</P>
        <P>The Commission has a statutory responsibility to provide a complaints resolution service to customers with an unresolved dispute with their supplier or network operator.  An Energy Customers Team has been set up within the Commission to deal directly with customers who have complaints.  CER also provides a dedicated Energy Customers website at <i>www.energycustomers.ie</i>, which provides consumer information on the electricity and gas market and, in particular, on how to engage with its complaints resolution service.</P>
        <P>In relation to the individual customer to whom this question is related, my Department is advised that the customer has been offered reconnection with a &ldquo;Pay as You Go&rdquo; meter which will facilitate the repayment of outstanding debt and avoid any further build up from occurring.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s involvement with the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability relates primarily to the recoupment of a proportion of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants.  The grant schemes, introduced in November 2007, are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department together with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  It is a matter for each local authority to determine how the funding is apportioned between the various grant measures and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within the allocation.</P>
        <P>Local authorities are responsible for the administration of the grant schemes including the processing and approval of individual grant applications, monitoring of work underway and the payment of grants on the satisfactory completion of the relevant works.  Information relating to the status of individual applications is not available in my Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 339, 361 and 366 together. </P>
        <P>The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 provide the legislation underpinning the household charge.  Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.</P>
        <P>Section 3 of the Act provides that an owner of residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge.  Section 2(2) of the Act provides that certain buildings are not residential property for the purposes of the legislation.  Section 2(2)(<i>b</i>) provides that a building vested in a Minister of the Government, a housing authority (within the meaning of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992) or the Health Service Executive is not residential property for the purposes of the Act.  In addition, section 2(2)(<i>c</i>) provides that a building owned by a body standing approved for the purpose of section 6 of the Act of 1992 is not residential property for the purposes of the Act.</P>
        <P>A building that is not a residential property for the purposes of the Act is not liable to the household charge.  The Acts place the onus on an owner of a residential property to assess his or her liability to the charges on the relevant liability dates and, if liable, to declare that liability and to pay the charges in respect of that property by the due dates.</P>

These include the incremental purchase scheme, the availability of loan finance from local authorities for house purchase, including open market purchase, and the tenant purchase scheme.  Two types of house purchase loan are available from local authorities: standard annuity loans targeted at lower income first time buyers and those under the Home Choice Loan scheme which are available to qualifying middle income first time buyers affected by the &ldquo;credit crunch&rdquo;.  The terms and conditions governing the operation, including eligibility terms, of annuity mortgages and the Home Choice Loan are set out under the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2009 and the Housing (Home Choice Loan) Regulations 2009 respectively.

	<P>I intend to finalise the draft Guidelines for Planning Authorities on <Col N="221"/>Retail Planning by April 2012.  These are aimed at: ensuring that the planning system plays a key role in supporting competitiveness in the retail sector; advancing choice for the consumer while promoting and supporting the vitality and viability of city and town centres; and, contributing to a high standard of urban design and encouraging a greater use of sustainable transport.  My objective will be to strengthen national planning policy requirements for all planning authorities in relation to retail planning and the requirements in relation to driving city and town centres as focal points for retailing.</P>

	<P>The initiative referred to in the Question was one of a series of measures implemented through the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme (LDSIP) that was designed to counter disadvantage and to promote equality and social and economic inclusion.  The LDSIP programme came to an end on 31 December 2009 and was replaced by a new programme, the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP).</P>
        <P>The LCDP aims to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government/agencies and people in disadvantaged communities.  The primary focus of the programme is to support individuals into employment and self-employ<Col N="222"/>ment through education, training, work experience, job placement, enterprise and the social economy in both urban and rural areas.  Low income farm families are among the targeted beneficiaries of the programme.</P>

	<P>As indicated in the reply to Question No. 144 of 29 February 2012, a public consultation process on the Government&rsquo;s proposals for the establishment of a new public water utility and the proposed approach to water charges and water metering concluded on 24 February.  My Department received more than 300 submissions and these are now being considered.</P>
        <P>The approach to be taken for the installation of meters in different household types, including those outlined in the question, is under consideration by my Department.  Census 2011 asked households to provide information on the type of water supply they receive but householders were not asked if the supply was shared with other households or if their house was located in an urban or rural area.  The Central Statistics Office will be publishing Census data on housing and households later this year.</P>

No decisions have been made as yet in relation to the Headquarters of Irish Water.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently examining the submissions received during the six week period of public consultation initiated by the Government on water sector reforms.  These submissions will be taken into consideration in developing the implementation plan for the transition of water services functions from the city and county councils to Irish Water.  The plan will, amongst other things, take account of the work being undertaken by my Department and NewERA on whether, and in what manner, skills within the State sector can be harnessed for the successful implementation of the proposed water sector reforms.  It is expected that this implementation plan will be finalised in April 2012.</P>

	<P>The Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure in County Galway.  The programme includes contracts under construction and to commence to the value of some &euro;130 million in Co. Galway during the period of the programme. </P>
        <P>The programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth.  A key input to the development of the programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Galway County Council, in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  However, the Creggs Sewerage Scheme was not amongst the contracts and schemes included in Galway County Council&rsquo;s assessment of needs.</P>
        <P>Progress under the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012 was reviewed in mid-2011 and through this process, consideration was given to any newly emerging priority contracts and schemes submitted by local authorities for addition to the Programme.  No proposal for the Creggs Sewerage Scheme was received from Galway County Council in response to the review.</P>

	<P>The recruitment moratorium in the Public Service was introduced by the Government in March 2009 as an emergency measure in response to the financial crisis facing the State.  Under the terms of the moratorium no public service post, however arising, may be filled.  When vacancies arise public bodies must reallocate or reorganise work or staff accordingly. </P><Col N="224"/>
        <P>My Department has delegated sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for implementation of the moratorium across all local authorities.  Under the terms of the moratorium all local authority exceptions must be sanctioned by my Department.</P>
        <P>Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each County and City Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements, including recruitment and day to day operational measures, necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.  In this regard, it is a matter for City and County managers, in the first instance, to ensure that the reduction in staff numbers is managed so that the appropriate service level is maintained.</P>
        <P>My Department works very closely with local authorities to ensure that critical posts are filled while overall numbers are reduced.  All staffing sanction requests are examined on a case by case basis having due regard to the continued delivery of key services and the need for further reduction in overall staffing levels and expenditure in the local authority.  I understand that the position in relation to staffing in Dublin Fire Brigade is kept under constant review by Dublin City Council management and that the panel which was in place since 2007 expired in December 2011.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have been early movers in terms of staff reductions.  Between June 2008 and December 2012 staff numbers have reduced by 7,500(20%) from 37,243 whole time equivalent (WTE) to 29,744 WTE and further significant reductions have taken place this year which will be reported in the March 2012 quarterly staffing return figures.</P>
        <P>In the context of the very significant overall staff reductions, I am satisfied that fire service numbers have been protected. In the case of Dublin City Council its overall staff numbers have reduced from 7,326.15 WTE in June 2008 to 6,072.35 in December 2012, a reduction of 1,254(17%).  In the same period the total number of full time fire fighters in Dublin City Council increased from 825 WTE to 874 WTE.</P>

        <P>As part of the process of preparing the National Housing Development Survey 2011, published by my Department in October 2011, local authorities provided details of all unfinished housing developments in their areas.  Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents</P>
        <P FLI="0">Other relevant factors for the purposes of the categorisation process include, <i>inter alia:</i></P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting facilities, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the extent to which the development complies with the terms of applicable planning permission;</P><Col N="226"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the extent to which it complies with the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 as they pertain to dangerous places and dangerous structures within the meaning of the Act;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the extent to which facilities within the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned, and,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />where there is an agreement regarding the maintenance of such facilities, the extent to which this agreement has been complied with.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge.</P>
        <P>Only households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge.  The list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012.  A revised list of estates will be prescribed for 2013 after which time the waiver for unfinished housing developments will end.  Throughout this period it is anticipated that the numbers of categories 3 and 4 developments will decrease significantly as my Department continues to work with local authorities and other stakeholders to resolve outstanding issues, including through the Public Safety Initiative.</P>

	<P>It is estimated that the annual loss arising from vehicle owners declaring their vehicles off the road is in the region of &euro;84m.  I intend to bring forward legislation this year to address the issue of off-the-road declarations.  Currently, owners declare vehicles off the road for the purposes of motor tax after the fact, which is effectively unverifiable and open to abuse.  I intend to provide that drivers will be able to declare their intention to keep their vehicle off-the-road in advance, so that if a vehicle is not to be used on a public road for a number of months, the owner will be able to inform the relevant authorities before taking the car off the road rather than afterwards, and so avoid a future liability for motor tax.  As the new system will not allow for a retrospective declaration that a vehicle was off the road, there will not be any need for a verification check with motor insurers.</P>

	<P>Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta Teo (MFG) confirmed that its Board, upon examination of the company&rsquo;s financial situation, took the decision to cease trading on 7 September 2011 on the basis of insolvency.  MFG is now in liquidation.</P>
        <P>My Department is actively working to ensure that services in Gaeltacht areas previously supplied by MFG can be maintained.  With regard to the Rural Development Programme (RDP) potential solutions must also be compliant with the relevant national and EU regulations and frameworks.  There are complex legal and contractual issues with regard to MFG to be resolved and my Department is currently working on both long and short term solutions to ensure the continued delivery of the RDP, the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) and other programmes in Gaeltacht areas with the intention of finding a solution that will be efficient and effective and applied at the earliest possible opportunity. Any such solution will be compliant with all requirements of the Official Languages Act 2003.</P>
        <P>Pobal, who administer the LCDP on behalf of my Department, has recently put in place an interim arrangement whereby funding for LCDP activities in Gaeltacht areas will be administered through contiguous Local Development Companies (LDCs) for an initial six month <Col N="228"/>period, subject to a review of progress after 3 months.  The LDCs have been advised that the LCDP services continue to be delivered to communities in an effective and coherent manner, through the medium of Irish, in the short/medium term, pending a longer term solution for Gaeltacht service delivery.  The LDCs have been asked to prioritise the planning for this work by liaising with both Pobal and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta on how the work of the LCDP delivery to the Gaeltacht areas can be achieved.  It is the Department&rsquo;s objective to have LCDP actions delivered to these areas within the next four weeks.</P>
        <P>My Department is in the process of contacting promoters whose LEADER projects are at an advanced stage of development. An interim system, in cooperation with LDCs contiguous to Gaeltacht areas, is being established to facilitate payment of these projects in the short term. In parallel to this and as approved by the European Commission, a bidding/tendering process among LDCs that are currently contracted to deliver the LEADER programme, and thereby part of the accredited system, is being undertaken to determine a more permanent solution to address the long term delivery of Rural Development Programme (LEADER) funding in Gaeltacht areas.</P>

	<P>Long Term Residency is granted on the basis that a non-EEA national has completed five years legal residency in the State on work permit / work authorisation / working visa conditions.  Residency is calculated from the corresponding Stamp 1 or Stamp 4 endorsements in an applicant&rsquo;s passport and not by the dates of commencement and expiry of each work permit. Periods of time where a person has not had legal residency cannot be counted in any application for long term residency.  The current scheme for granting Long Term Residence is under review at the present time and the issue raised by the Deputy will be considered in that context.</P>

	<P>The programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is based on agreed priorities established by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The programme is progressed in co-operation with the Office of Public Works, who have responsibility for capital expenditure in respect of Garda accommodation.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that certain tasks, including archaeology works, have been completed at the relevant site.  In addition, I have been informed that proposals in relation to the remainder of the project have been developed to an advanced stage.  This is a matter which will be progressed in the context of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s identified accommodation priorities and in the light of available resources.</P>

	<P>I am happy to inform the House that the level of co-operation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI has never been higher.  The two forces co-operate seamlessly, across the range of policing activities.</P>
        <P>Operational policing co-operation is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner and the PSNI Chief Constable and their respective forces.  Both police chiefs have emphasised the close nature and the high quality of the ongoing co-operation between their forces and it has been instrumental in preventing attacks, combating criminality and saving lives.  The two police forces operate a Cross-Border Policing Strategy, which includes cross-Border investigations and operations, intelligence-sharing and security, information and communications technology and emergency planning.</P>
        <P>Of course, combating the subversive threat remains an absolute priority for the Garda authorities and their PSNI counterparts.  I can assure the Deputy, and the House, that the Government is committed to maintaining the highest level of co-operation between the Garda&iacute; and the PSNI.  Periods of temporary release may be granted to sentenced persons for humanitarian reasons, for example, for urgent family reasons.  Such applications are considered on a case-by-case basis.  Where necessary, the relevant authorities North and South consult with one another as to the arrangements to be made in such circumstances.</P>

	<P>Arising from the refusal of the person concerned and her daughter&rsquo;s asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned and her daughter were notified, by letter dated 15 April, 2010 that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of them.  They were given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against them. In addition, they were notified of their entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.  </P>
        <P>The person concerned initiated Judicial Review Proceedings in the High Court, challenging the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in her case. She later withdrew her Judicial Review Proceedings against the Tribunal in November 2011. The matter was struck out and this Department received the Court Order to that effect in November 2011.</P>
        <P>The position in the State of the person concerned and her daughter will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  The person concerned and her daughter have been invited to submit further representations in relation to their Section 3 applications and their applications for Subsidiary Protection. All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made.  Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned and her daughter.</P><Col N="234"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 391 and 394 together.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to reform and modernise aspects of family law.  In this context, the detailed recommendations in the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s Report on the Legal Aspects of Family Relationships on guardianship rights (parental responsibility) for unmarried fathers, civil partners and step-parents are under consideration in my Department with a view to preparing legislative proposals.</P>
        <P>Under the law as it stands, where a child&rsquo;s parents are married, both parents are automatically the child&rsquo;s guardians. Where a child is born outside marriage the mother is the sole automatic guardian.  Where there is agreement between the parents, they can make a statutory declaration under section 2(4) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act 1997, appointing the father as a guardian of his child. In the absence of agreement, a non-marital father may apply to the court to be appointed a guardian of his child.  A parent&rsquo;s same sex partner (whether or not they are civil partners) has no parental rights under the law.</P>
        <P>Section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act provides that the guardian of a child or the unmarried father of a child, even if he is not a guardian, may apply to the court for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the child, including orders on custody and access.  In making such orders, and in determining whether an unmarried father should be appointed guardian, the court has to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  It is worth noting that the vast majority of applications for guardianship which proceed before the court are successful.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that applications of this type are currently taking 7 &mdash; 9 months to process.  The processing time for dealing with such applications can vary depending on the particular circumstances of each individual case and the nature of the investigation required.  This processing time is considered a reasonable period in which to process such cases and in fact in the High Court Case of K M and D G -v- The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (2007 No. 321 J.R.) Justice John Edwards held that a period of between 9 and 12 months was reasonable for the making of such decisions.  The processing time is also well within international norms for this type of application.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In this case, INIS advises me that the person concerned entered the State on foot of a short stay &ldquo;C&rdquo; type visitor visa which is normally given for a stay of up to 90 days.  The person subsequently made an application for residency arising from marriage to an Irish national which was received by INIS on 10th January, 2012.  Applications of this type are dealt with in chronological order on the basis of the month in which they are received.  I understand that INIS is prepared to allow the person to remain in the State pending a decision on this application; if the person concerned leaves the State before a decision on the application she will need to be in possession of an Irish entry visa to enable her to return.</P>

He was advised that he was required to complete and submit the correct version of the application form (Form 8)  and also that a fee of &euro;950, which represents the certification fee payable by approved applicants, was not required at that stage.</P>
        <P>In November 2011, I signed into law Statutory Instrument 569/11, which  introduced an application fee of &euro;175 for all applications for naturalisation and updated the prescribed forms of application.  On 18 January, 2012 documentation submitted by the person referred to was returned to him and he was requested to re-submit the application with the application fee of &euro;175, which applies in respect of all applications lodged since 10 November 2011.  The application of 17 October 2011 cannot be taken into consideration as only applications in the form prescribed in legislation at date of application can be accepted.  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</P>

        <P FLI="0">All incidents where persons have been reported missing remain under investigation until such time as the person is located.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reviews missing persons cases on a regular basis.  The District Officer (Superintendent) in the area where a person has gone missing takes direct responsibility for all investigations and searches carried out.  Local investigation teams are appointed by the District Officer, and all means necessary, including the services of specialist units, are deployed to assist in these investigations, as considered appropriate.  The services of Interpol and Europol can also be availed of during such investigations, if necessary.</P>
        <P>The Garda Missing Persons Bureau, which is responsible for all data relating to missing persons, provides expert assistance and advice to District Officers in all high risk missing person cases.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that adequate resources, including staff and technology, are in place to deal with this issue and investigations are carried out in line with international best practice.</P>

	<P>The current processing time-frame for considering residency applications on the basis of marriage to an Irish national is 7-9 months.  In his judgment in the High Court Case of K M and D G -v- The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (2007 No. 321 J.R.) Mr. Justice John Edwards held that a period of between 9 and 12 months was reasonable for the making of such decisions.  This period strikes <Col N="239"/>an appropriate balance between facilitating the overwhelming majority of genuine applicants in this category within a reasonable period, while at the same time detecting less genuine cases, for example, marriages of convenience designed to circumvent immigration procedures. Having said this, however, it is hoped that this time frame can be reduced in the future.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may wish to note that a visa is solely a form of pre-entry clearance for visa required nationals seeking to enter the state and conveys no automatic right of entry into the state on the holder.  To preserve the integrity of the immigration regime, it is not the general practice of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service to issue any multiple entry or re-entry visa to an applicant for long term residency in Ireland, such as spouse of an Irish national, until a decision has been made on an the more substantive application.  To do so would effectively be to pre-empt the more substantive decision.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 400 and 401 together.</P>
        <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply to Questions Nos. 206 and 207 on 22nd February 2012, the Garda authorities have informed me that Garda records in relation to section 30 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 are not maintained in a format which permits them to readily identify each of the parties from whom payments are received under the section.  In that regard they have also indicated that during the years 2009 to 2011 policing services were provided for over 1,800 events.  In the circumstances the Deputy will appreciate that the specific information he has sought could not be made available without a substantial and disproportionate use of resources which are required for other Garda purposes.</P>
        <P>In so far as section 30 of the 2005 Act is concerned it is the policy of the Garda authorities that the relevant expenses should be recovered.  That being said, circumstances will vary in relation to different events and, bearing in mind that public safety will always be the prime consideration for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, certain costs may arise where recoupment is not sought.  This would be the situation, for example, where a helicopter might be deployed as part of the policing arrangements for a major event.  I understand that section 30 is generally operating effectively and this is a matter which will be kept under review.</P>

	<P>The position is that the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor in members&rsquo; clubs is governed by the statutory provisions of the Registered Clubs Acts 1904 to 2008.  Such a club may apply to the District Court for a certificate of registration following the giving of due notice to the fire authority and publication of a notice concerning the club&rsquo;s intention to apply for such a certificate in a newspaper circulating in the locality.  The Court may grant the certificate where it is satisfied that the club complies with the statutory requirements concerning membership and management of the club and where the club&rsquo;s facilities meet the required statutory standards.  The certificate of registration allows the club to supply intoxicating liquor to club members and their guests on the club&rsquo;s premises during permitted hours.</P>
        <P>I should add that the Government Legislation Programme provides for publication of the Sale of Alcohol Bill later this year.  It will modernise the law relating to the sale, supply and consumption of intoxicating liquor in licensed premises and registered clubs by repealing the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2011 and the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2008 and replacing them with streamlined and updated provisions.</P>

	<P>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is charged with responsibility for the accommodation of asylum seekers while their applications for protection are being processed. As of 12/02/2012, there were 5,313 accommodated in RIA centres located throughout the State.  It is understood that there is speculation locally in relation to the premises specified in the question as to its possible future use as an asylum accommodation centre.</P>
        <P>It is not uncommon for unused hotels in locations around the country to generate such speculation but, as a matter of long standing policy, RIA never comments on procurement issues.  The speculation in this case appears to be connected to the nearby Mosney Centre, where currently approximately 573 persons reside.  There are no immediate plans to change existing arrangements at that centre. RIA has now entered into discussions with the contractor at Mosney in the context of the expiry of the current contract this June.  It is not possible at this stage to say what the outcome of those discussions will be.</P><Col N="241"/>
        <P>As a general point, the number of asylum seekers requiring accommodation now and in the future is under constant review.  It is not possible to predict what particular accommodation facilities will be required in the short or medium term future. RIA will continue to have regard for the recommendations contained in the &ldquo;Value for Money Report and Policy Review &mdash; Asylum Seeker Accommodation Programme&rdquo; (May 2010), which is available on RIA&rsquo;s website (<i>www.ria.gov.ie</i>).  Generally, the management of the direct provision budget must operate under the general economic constraints which apply to all public spending.</P>

	<P>The Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 contains provisions which are intended to facilitate the fair, efficient and effective management of owners&rsquo; management companies.  Section 18 requires such companies to establish and maintain a scheme of annual service charges from which they may discharge expenditure incurred on the provision of common or shared services to the owners and occupiers of residential units, including insurance, waste management and security services.  In order to ensure transparency and accountability, the annual service charge, and the services to be provided, must be approved by a general meeting of the members.</P>
        <P>Section 18 also provides that the owner of each residential unit is under an obligation to pay service charges levied under the Act. As regards the recovery of unpaid service charges, section 22 provides that unpaid service charges may be recovered by the owners&rsquo; management company concerned as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction, i.e normally the District Court.</P>

Seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can, however, result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion. At present there are a total of 103 personnel assigned to the GCVU. Of this 103, 4 are members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and 75 are full-time Garda civilian personnel.

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 22 April 2003 and applied for asylum. She was deemed to be an unaccompanied minor and as such was accompanied by a (then) Health Board official when making her application. Following due consideration of her case in accordance with law, the Refugee Applications Commissioner refused her a declaration of refugee status.  This decision was subsequently upheld by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>In the matters of legal representation, the records indicate that the applicant received legal assistance throughout the determination process and subsequently. In that regard, she availed of the assistance of the Refugee Legal Service as well as the service of a solicitor in private practice during the course of her application.  Following the refusal of her asylum claim, representations were received under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) from the person concerned with the assistance of the Refugee Legal Service. After examination, it was recommended to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to sign a Deportation Order in respect of the person concerned which was duly signed on 27 October 2004. The Order required her to remove herself from the State. She presented herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau initially but failed to &ldquo;present&rdquo; since 5 July 2005.</P>
        <P>On 6 October 2005 she initiated Judicial Review Proceedings in the High Court, challenging the Minister&rsquo;s decision to make a Deportation Order against her. On 23 March 2007, the High Court refused the Judicial Review Leave Application. She instituted further Judicial Review proceedings on 10 February 2010 challenging the Subsidiary Protection decision made in respect of her son and the Deportation Order made against her son. Accordingly, as the matter is <i>sub judice</i>, I do not propose to comment further.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that a valid application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy in April, 2008.</P>
        <P>The application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible. As the processing requirements and time taken to complete necessary checks vary from case to case, it is not possible to provide a specific date for determination of an individual application. I can inform the Deputy that good progress continues to be made in reducing the time taken to process the generality of applications.</P>
        <P>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</P>
        <P>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may <Col N="245"/>consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</P>

They were granted temporary permission to remain by their local immigration officer.  Their current permission to remain is valid until 15 September 2012.  Their request for permission to remain in the State on a long-term basis will be considered when their current permission to remain comes up for renewal.</P>

	<P>The first discussions on the Global Strategic Framework will be held at the FAO Regional Conferences.  The European Regional Conference, which my Department will be attending, will take place in April in Baku, Azerbaijan and will be an opportunity for Ireland to feed into the process and to influence the consensus ERG position to be formulated.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s submission will be prepared by my Department in consultation with our colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  While our submission has yet to be completed, I can assure you that it will be very supportive of smallholder farmers, particularly women, in developing countries.  Our submission will be informed by the 2008 Hunger Task Force Report, which recommended three priority areas for Ireland in its efforts to address global hunger: 1) support to smallholder farmers, particularly women, in Africa; 2) addressing maternal and infant undernutrition, and 3) strengthening international political commitment to addressing Hunger.</P>
        <P>Ireland has made steady progress in implementing the Hunger Task Force recommendations.  Through our overseas development programme, Irish Aid, we support a comprehensive range of programmes to sustainably improve food and nutrition security of the poorest and most vulnerable.  For example, in Malawi, we support smallholder farmers&rsquo; organisations to improve soil fertility and diversify to more nutritious crops; in Tanzania, we support smallholder farmers&rsquo; access to better farm inputs such as seeds and fertiliser; and in Lesotho, we support smallholder farmers to develop vegetable gardens to improve household nutrition.

	<P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine does not keep records of mortality figures for factory farmed broilers.  The majority of broilers are reared under contract to processors and these figures would be a matter between the grower and the processor.  The table sets out the total number of birds slaughtered in export approved plants in the years 2009, 2010 and 2011:</P>

        <P FLI="0">Ante mortem checks are carried out at processing plants.  As a percentage of the national kill, less than 0.5% of broilers are condemned by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine personnel between arrival at the factory and processing.  There is no statutory requirement to maintain statistics on fracture damage.  There are many different causes of mortality in broilers including septicaemia, toxaemia, emaciation and pendulous crop, or other systemic diseases.</P>
        <P>In relation to veterinary medicines, only products which are licensed to the requisite EU scientific standard and have demonstrated quality, safety (including from a consumer viewpoint) and effectiveness may be used.  The Irish Medicines Board website (<i>www.imb.ie</i>) lists all authorised products.  Medicines may only be used following prescription by the farmer&rsquo;s private veterinary practitioner.  The prescribing practitioner must have formal responsibility for the care of the birds and having satisfied themselves that the medication is justified; specify the particular medicine to be used, together with any associated conditions, including duration of treatment.  While, under relevant EU and national legislation, the primary responsibility for producing safe food rests with the Food Business Operator, my Department carries out inspections and residue surveillance to verify that relevant requirements are being met.</P>
        <P>E.coli encompasses many strains, not all of which are pathogenic.  Scientists use the term colonised rather than infected due to the fact that the bacteria do not cause infection or lesions to the broilers.  It is known internationally that all broilers, including those reared under a free-range system are colonised with E.coli.  Campylobacter is found in most raw poultry and is common in raw meat.  The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) carried out an EU-wide survey in 2008, which indicated a high prevalence of Campylobacter across the EU.  77% of broiler carcasses samples tested positive with the prevalence in Ireland being the second highest.  Based on the number of case notifications the human population incidence rate in Ireland is below European levels.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) published recom<Col N="250"/>mendations for a Practical Control Programme for Campylobacter in the Poultry production and Slaughter Chain in 2011.</P>
        <P>In addition to normal good hygiene and storage practices, consumers are advised to thoroughly cook poultry meat as this will eliminate any campylobacter and E.coli.  I am advised that the practice of pumping fresh poultry meat, as described in the question, does not take place in the Republic of Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Schmallenberg virus is a newly emerging disease.  There is no evidence to suggest that the disease is transmissible to humans.  The disease is not officially notifiable and there is no evidence that the disease is present in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) and ECDC (European Centre for Disease Control) and also the animal and human health authorities at national level, are collaborating to ensure rapid detection of any change in the epidemiology in animals and humans.  Investigations and research projects are ongoing in the affected countries to better understand the epidemiological and the microbiological aspects of this outbreak among ruminants and Ireland is collaborating in this work.</P>
        <P>The information available on the Schmallenberg virus suggests that it is part of the Simbu serogroup viruses that are primarily transmitted by insect vectors (midges, mosquitoes).  There is no direct transmission from animal to animal, other than maternal transmission from mother to offspring in utero.  Exposure to a similar virus &mdash; Akabane virus (widespread in Australia) induces strong immunity in the infected animal.</P>
        <P>Schmallenberg virus manifests in ruminants&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Adult cattle &mdash; (transient) febrile illness and milk drop and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />As congenital malformations in newborn animals/aborted animals (mainly sheep).</P>
        <P FLI="0">It appears that the infection in Europe occurred last summer/autumn.  If in-calf cows were to have been affected in a similar manner to sheep, this would not manifest in the new born calves until later on, as the gestation period for bovines is about 280 days as opposed to 150 days for sheep.  The virus distribution is mainly concentrated across north-central parts of Continental Europe (Netherlands, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Italy and Belgium) and southern areas of England.  In the region of 1,000 farms are confirmed as being affected with these congenital defects so far.</P>
        <P>The Commission in collaboration with the Member States through SCOFACH (relevant EU Standing Committee) has published a guidance document on its website in which it sets out full details of the knowledge to date on the virus and procedures for providing surveillance <Col N="252"/>data to the European Food Safety Authority who have been charged with providing a full report on the virus by end of May 2012.</P>
        <P>The Department has notified relevant persons (Veterinary staff and practitioners) to report and submit samples of any animals showing unexplained clinical symptoms of the disease or suspect birth defects.  There is no suitable test yet available for general surveillance purposes.  However, a PCR test to detect the virus is currently in use in my Department Laboratories.  Some 58 samples tested to date in the Department&rsquo;s laboratory samples from animals presenting with clinical signs that may be associated with infection have tested negative.</P>
        <P>Single Market rules preclude Member States from interfering with intra-union trade in animals except on legitimate animal health grounds.  Accordingly, animals are free to move in trade in the Union provided they are certified as being compliant with animal health rules.  Importers should ensure that any such imports are fully compliant with EU rules and that they operate to the highest standards of bio-security to ensure that no diseases are introduced to Ireland via such imports or the vehicles transporting them.</P>
        <P>A Departmental group chaired by the Secretary General is monitoring developments is respect of the virus.  We will continue to monitor this developing situation, maintain close contact with our colleagues in Northern Ireland, and will review as appropriate in light of any new information that becomes available or with the development of new testing capabilities.</P>

	<P>The afforestation schemes provide attractive grants and premiums to incentivise the planting of agricultural land by farmers and other landowners, to support the continued development of a viable and sustainable national forest resource.</P>
        <P>All applications submitted to my Department for approval to undertake afforestation are examined regarding the suitability of the site from a silvicultural, productivity and environmental perspective.  This includes an evaluation of site productivity issues such as soil type, fertility, exposure and access, and an assessment of any potential environmental impact of the project on water quality, nature conservation, archaeology and landscape.</P>
        <P>Certain sites are less suited for forestry.  Poorer quality site types are predominantly peat and are often characterised by poor fertility, high elevation and constrained by poor access, wind stability issues, high fire risk, etc.  These poor site types are also very sensitive from an environmental perspective and have limited timber productivity.  In the current economic climate, my Department is not prioritising the use of limited Exchequer funds to support the establishment of new forests on such sites, on silvicultural, site productivity and environmental grounds.</P>
        <P>My Department has a legal responsibility to ensure that every hectare approved for afforestation complies with requirements set out under various environmental European Directives such as the Birds and Habitats Directives, the EIA Directive and the Water Framework Directive, and with corresponding national legislation.  This will ensure that the ongoing expansion of the national forest resource is compatible with the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s environment.  My Department is in regular communications with the National Parks and Wildlife Service <Col N="253"/>(NPWS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and with other bodies, to ensure an ongoing streamlining of procedures to ensure the afforestation programme is compliant with the legislation outlined above.  Changes to the restrictions in place to enable more farmers to plant are continually being looked at by my Department within this context.</P>

	<P>The first discussions on the Global Strategic Framework will be held at the FAO Regional Conferences.  The European Regional Conference, which my Department will be attending, will take place in April in Baku, Azerbaijan and will be an opportunity for Ireland to feed into the process and to influence the consensus ERG position to be formulated.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s submission will be prepared by my Department in consultation with our colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  While our submission has yet to be completed, I can assure you that it will be very supportive of smallholder farmers, particularly women, in developing countries.  Our submission will be informed by the 2008 Hunger Task Force Report, which recommended three priority areas for Ireland in its efforts to address global hunger: 1) support to smallholder farmers, particularly women, in Africa; 2) addressing maternal and infant undernutrition, and 3) strengthening international political commitment to addressing Hunger.</P>
        <P>Ireland has made steady progress in implementing the Hunger Task Force recommendations.  Through our overseas development programme, Irish Aid, we support a comprehensive range of programmes to sustainably improve food and nutrition security of the poorest and most vulnerable.  For example, in Malawi, we support smallholder farmers&rsquo; organisations to improve soil fertility and diversify to more nutritious crops; in Tanzania, we support smallholder farmers&rsquo; access to better farm inputs such as seeds and fertiliser; and in Lesotho, we support smallholder farmers to develop vegetable gardens to improve household nutrition.  At the international level, we work to ensure that global agricultural research is focused on the needs of women smallholder farmers, and that research outputs are readily available to the poorest farmers.</P>
        <P>The <i>UN Global Strategic Framework for Food Security and Nutrition</i> is another opportunity to further Ireland&rsquo;s work in this area, and I look forward to engaging with it.

	<P>The Turf Club is a private body which, together with Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee (INHSC), is responsible for the making and enforcing of the Rules of Racing in Ireland.  An individual wishing to make a complaint relating to the welfare of horses while in training with licensed trainers has a number of avenues open to them.  They may submit a complaint to The Turf Club, report the matter to the Garda&iacute; and/or institute civil proceedings.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s responsibility, which is set down in legislation, extends to the welfare and protection of farmed animals only i.e. animals normally bred or kept for the production of food or for use in or for the purpose of farming.  The relevant legislation in this area is the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act 1984 and the European Communities (Welfare of Farmed Animals) Regulations 2010, S.I. No. 311 of 2010.  Animals &ldquo;used in competitions/shows, cultural or sporting events or activities while so being used&rdquo; are outside the scope of S.I. No. 311 of 2010. Accordingly it is clear that the complaints forwarded by the named individual to my Department are not covered by this legislation and thus fall outside the remit of the Department.</P>
        <P>The principal statutes governing cruelty to all animals including race horses, in this country is the Protection of Animals Act 1911 and the Protection of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1965.  Responsibility for enforcing this legislation rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who may, on receipt of a complaint, investigate and bring a prosecution against any person alleged to have committed an offence under these Acts.</P>

	<P>The first discussions on the Global Strategic Framework will be held at the FAO Regional Conferences.  The European Regional Conference, which my Department will be attending, will take place in April in Baku, Azerbaijan and will be an opportunity for Ireland to feed into the process and to influence the consensus ERG position to be formulated.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s submission will be prepared by my Department in consultation with our colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  While our submission has yet to be completed, I can assure you that it will be very supportive of smallholder farmers, particularly women, in developing countries.  Our submission will be informed by the 2008 Hunger Task Force Report, which recommended three priority areas for Ireland in its efforts to address global hunger: 1) support to smallholder farmers, particularly women, in Africa; 2) addressing maternal and infant undernutrition, and 3) strengthening international political commitment to addressing Hunger.</P>
        <P>Ireland has made steady progress in implementing the Hunger Task Force recommendations.  Through our overseas development programme, Irish Aid, we support a comprehensive range of programmes to sustainably improve food and nutrition security of the poorest and most vulnerable.  For example, in Malawi, we support smallholder farmers&rsquo; organisations to improve soil fertility and diversify to more nutritious crops; in Tanzania, we support smallholder farm<Col N="258"/>ers&rsquo; access to better farm inputs such as seeds and fertiliser; and in Lesotho, we support smallholder farmers to develop vegetable gardens to improve household nutrition.  At the international level, we work to ensure that global agricultural research is focused on the needs of women smallholder farmers, and that research outputs are readily available to the poorest farmers.</P>
        <P>The UN Global Strategic Framework for Food Security and Nutrition is another opportunity to further Ireland&rsquo;s work in this area, and I look forward to engaging with it.  A full meeting of the UN Committee on World Food Security takes place every October and is attended by my officials and officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  A decision on Ministerial attendance will be taken closer to the event.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 450 and 466 together. </P>
        <P>While I would like to see fishermen receive a fair price for their catch, I have no role in determining the price they receive from processors, retailers or other agents.  Like other parts of the food industry, the price received by primary producers in the seafood sector is determined by the market.  A number of market factors may influence the price received by fishermen for their catch.  These include demand for the product and the available supply, the number of intermediaries in the supply chain and their relative power, the extent to which fishermen collaborate through co-ops or otherwise to increase their bargaining power, the selling price for the final product in retail outlets or in export markets and the extent to which the value is added to the raw material to maximise selling price and last but not least, the relative profitability of the Irish processing sector compared to foreign competitors.</P>
        <P>In relation to the profitability of the processing sector, Food Harvest 2020 recognised that the sector was fragmented, lacking in scale, uncompetitive in terms of production costs, too focussed on export of commodity products and constrained by inconsistent supply of raw material.  BIM, with Enterprise Ireland and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, is working to address each of these issues.  Grant aid support of &euro;1.749m under the Seafood Processing Business Investment Scheme was provided in 2011 to improve competitiveness and help the companies concerned develop export markets for high value added products.</P>
        <P>The lack of scale in the Irish processing sector is recognised as a cause of higher production costs, lower investment in strategic areas of planning, business development, marketing and product innovation, all of which adversely affect profitability.  The average net profitability of Irish seafood processing companies stands at 0.94% compared to between 4% and 6% for our European competitors.  BIM is working closely senior managers of Irish seafood processing companies on strategies to address these issues and is making available a range of technical and financial supports to assist the sector to modernise and become more competitive.</P><Col N="259"/>
        <P>I would hope and expect that a modern, efficient, competitive and innovative processing sector, selling value added products, differentiated from our competitors by quality and sustainability, would ultimately increase demand for fish from Irish fishermen and help assure them of a fair price for their catch.</P>

	<P>The horse and greyhound racing industries receive financial support from the State through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund (the Fund) under Section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 (the Act).  The State funding provided to Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) and to Bord na gCon (BNG) is crucial to sustain the horse racing and greyhound industries which account for an estimated 27,000 jobs, generating approximately &euro;1.4bn in economic output. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The Fund has allowed Ireland to develop into a world centre of excellence for horseracing and greyhound racing and has allowed HRI and BNG to undertake various initiatives including capital investment programmes that have underpinned growth in the sectors in the context of strong international competition in the breeding, training and racing sectors.  Both industries have a national network of breeders, owners, trainers <Insert>and </Insert>racecourses and they maintain a unique skill base.

        <P>Exports of milk and dairy products in 2011 at &euro;2.7bn were 13% higher than 2010. Based on these values, a 5% or 10% increase would result in export values of &euro;2.8bn and &euro;2.97bn respectively. However, due to the volatility of international markets, caused by variations in global supply and demand, there will always be fluctuations in dairy prices.  The production levels envisaged by the Deputy would, at a minimum, consolidate existing on- farm employment in the c.18,300 milk producing farms, as well as the 9,000 off farm jobs in the dairy industry generally and could result in additional off farm jobs being created in the processing, sales or distribution sectors.</P>
        <P>It should be noted, however, that it will be 2015 at the earliest, following the ending of the Milk Quota regime in April 2015, before milk production quantities can increase by the levels set out in the question. The &lsquo;soft landing&rsquo; concession, granted under the CAP Health Check 2008 of granting 1% quota increases to Members States from the 2009/2010 quota year to 2013/2014 (five increases) will continue.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 165 of 8 February 2012 and subsequent detailed information supplied, his views on the fact that a substantial number of applications under the early retirement scheme, which were received after 14 October, have been approved for payment, whereas of 139 applications received after 14 October 2008 under the installation aid scheme, only one has been approved for payment after appeal to the agriculture appeals office; if he will comment in general on the circumstances surrounding this appeal; if he will comment further on the different approach pursued by his Department to late applications under both schemes; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The Early Retirement Scheme and the Young Farmer&rsquo;s Installation Scheme were suspended for new applications with effect from 14 October 2008.  The early Retirement Scheme was reopened temporarily with limited funding for applications from 23 September 2009 to 30 October 2009 in order to accommodate as many as possible of those farmers who had completed, or were close to completing, applications at the point when the scheme was suspended. </P><Col N="263"/>
        <P>The Young Farmers&rsquo; Installation Scheme has remained suspended since 14 October 2008. In one case, my Department paid a grant under the Scheme where the Agriculture Appeals Office held, by decision of 13 June 2011, that my Department was required to process the application notwithstanding the fact that it had been lodged with my Department after 14 October 2008. Following a request by my Department for a review of the decision concerned, the Acting Director of the Agriculture Appeals Office upheld the decision on 19 August 2011. The Agriculture Appeals Office is an independent agency set up under the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001.</P>

No information has been received in respect of animals born during 2009, 2010 and 2011.</P>
        <P>The person named was advised of this by letter dated 26th August 2011 and was requested to return the required information by 5th September 2011.

	<P>Single Payment entitlements were established for the person named based on his farming activity in the 2000-2002 reference period.  The person named did not use his entitlements in 2005, the first year of the Scheme, as he had leased out his land. He then applied to sell his entitlements without land under the 2005 scheme year.  EU Regulations allowed for the sale of entitlements by Private Contract Clause before 16 May 2005 where the land was also being sold. As this was not the case, the person named was informed that it was not possible to process the requested transfer under the 2005 scheme year.</P>
        <P>The facility to sell entitlements without land only came into force in 2006 once the Scheme had been established and the entitlements had been used. EU regulations provided that, except in cases of<i> force majeure</i>, entitlements could only be sold without land once 80% had been used in one scheme year.  While the person named did not meet the 80% usage requirements in that he had not used his entitlements under the 2005 scheme, he applied for <i>force majeure</i> on medical grounds. This application was successful and the person named duly sold 57 Single Payment entitlements under the 2006 scheme year.</P>

	<P>This is an operational matter for the Teagasc Authority.  Teagasc has a very important role to play in supporting the Government&rsquo;s strategy for the development of the agriculture and food industries. For this reason, they receive substantial Exchequer resources each year to enable them provide first class education, research and advisory services. </P>
        <P>Despite the difficult economic circumstances in which the recent budget was framed, the allocation to Teagasc was substantially maintained at &euro;128.4m. This level of exchequer funding is a firm indication of the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to supporting Teagasc activities. Teagasc also earn other own income from advisory charges, education fees etc in addition to the exchequer allocation. I would point out that prioritisation of funding for particular services/programmes etc is a matter for Teagasc to determine.</P>
        <P>I understand from Teagasc that the works at Ashtown are being funded from own resources and the intention is that the balance will be funded from proceeds from asset disposals under the Teagasc Change Programme. The use of proceeds is currently the subject of discussions with the Department.</P>

	<P>Land declared by applicants for the purposes of the Single Payment Scheme and the Disadvantaged Areas must be eligible under the provisions of the relevant EU regulations and under the Terms and Conditions of each Scheme. In general, commonage land, including striped commonage iseligible for payment if it is actively farmed and the area is maintained in Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition. Furthermore, the following conditions must be met as outlined in the Terms and Conditions of the Schemes:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The land must be used and managed by the applicant. The land must be suitable for and compatible with the farming enterprise;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />There must be independent and suitable access for animals and/or machinery. Independent access means access by public or private roadway or by a defined right of way. Access over adjoining landowners land, or over land which is subject to a lease or rental agreement to another person, is not acceptable;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />There must be defined external boundaries except in the case of commonage;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />If, at inspection, the applicant claims to be farming the land with animals then the type of animals must be appropriate to the land and there must be appropriate handling facilities available to meet the animals&rsquo; welfare requirements.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />There must be evidence of an agricultural activity being conducted throughout the parcel; otherwise the unused part of the parcel may be found to be ineligible. This can arise where the stocking rate is too low.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><TitleTxt>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 471 and 476 together.</P>
        <P>The Adoption Authority is an independent statutory body charged with implementing the Adoption Act 2010. The Authority has responsibility for the direct operational implementation of legislation and Government policy.  Information relating to inter-country adoption from specific countries can be obtained from the Adoption Authority and is posted on the AAI website (<i>www.aai.gov.ie</i>). The adoption of a child or children from another jurisdiction is in the first instance subject to the views, rules and arrangements of the country of origin. The AAI notices reflect the information available to it on the current situation at any point in time.</P>
        <P>On 17 February 2012 the AAI posted on its website a notice relating to inter-country adoptions from India, which is a signatory to the Hague Convention. The notice stated that the Authority was notified on 1 July 2011 by the Indian National Central Authority, CARA, that it would not be accepting dossiers from Irish applicants either until 30 September 2011 or until further notice.  CARA has not been in touch with the AAI since that date. It has since come to the attention of the AAI that CARA proposes to introduce a new computerised system of online dossier registration which would appear essentially to present many features of a monthly &ldquo;lottery&rdquo; type process. To date, CARA has not invited the AAI to participate in such a scheme. Should CARA invite Ireland/AAI to participate in a new inter-country adoption <Col N="267"/>scheme, the invitation will be given careful consideration by the Board of the AAI, taking into account advice from relevant bodies including  the Permanent Bureau of the Hague Conference. The AAI has advised that it is proposing to send a delegation to India to discuss administrative matters relating to inter-country adoption between our two countries.</P>
        <P>Adoptions between Ireland and India must comply with the terms and conditions of the 1993 Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption. The role of the respective National Central Authorities is critical to this process. There is no role in the process for individual &lsquo;facilitators&rsquo; to secure referrals and to process adoptions.  In this context, the AAI advises that prospective adopters should not proceed with non-Hague Convention adoptions from India.</P>
        <P>The Hague Convention is a co-operative agreement drawn up to allow countries to mutually support one another in protecting the best interests of children in the intercountry adoption process. It is designed in such a way as to allow for mirrored mechanisms and structures to mutually assure countries of the safety and standard of intercountry adoptions in those countries.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) performs the function of a Central Authority under the Adoption Act, 2010, in accordance with the Convention. In choosing to deal primarily with Hague countries, the AAI has the mechanism to work collaboratively with equivalent structures in that country. Each Central Authority has the responsibility to oversee standards in respect of those parts of the process taking place within their respective jurisdictions. This mutual arrangement is designed to give the AAI, the Government and, most importantly, those involved in the adoption process assurance as to the standards being set and the oversight of the system.</P>
        <P>With effect from 1 November 2010, intercountry adoptions can be effected with other countries which have ratified the Hague Convention or with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement.  Ireland currently has no bilateral agreements in respect of intercountry adoption. As the Hague Convention is designed to ensure a minimum set of standards in intercountry adoption, it is appropriate that the immediate priority for the Adoption Authority on reaching agreements on arrangements with other Hague countries. The AAI are in the process of developing administrative arrangements with a number of countries which are signatories to the Hague Convention.</P>

        <Quest> when the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI, will visit Ethiopia with regard to the formulation of a bilateral treaty; if she will provide a timeline or date for this visit; the progress that has been made on the AAI review on this issue; when the results of that review will be published; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><TitleTxt>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Adoptions from Ethiopia, effected  under the transitional arrangements provided for in the Adoption Act 2010, are ongoing and are currently being examined,  and  recognised, by the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI).  These transitional arrangements may lead to adoptions from Ethiopia taking place up to the end of October 2013.</P>
        <P>Adoptions from Ethiopia which are not covered by the transitional arrangements referred to above would require a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Ethiopia. The negotiation of bilateral agreements on intercountry adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010 which states that &ldquo;t<i>he Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State</i>.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I have written to the AAI giving approval for the commencement of the process of examining the feasibility of a bilateral agreement with Ethiopia. The AAI have confirmed that, with the assistance of the Irish Embassy in Addis Ababa, they have sought an expert legal narrative and description of the current Ethiopian adoption law. The AAI will examine this to test for compatibility and compliance with the Adoption Act 2010. A delegation from the Adoption Authority will visit Ethiopia in the near future as part of this process. Arrangements for the AAI visit are currently being put in place by the AAI in conjunction with the Irish Embassy in Ethiopia. The review and the visit by the Authority will inform the AAI advice to me on the feasibility of a bilateral agreement with Ethiopia. The AAI is aware that I am anxious to bring clarity to the situation with regard to Ethiopia as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Any future bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would also be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Hague Convention. As the Hague Convention is designed to ensure a minimum set of standards in intercountry adoption, the Adoption Authority of Ireland  have indicated that their first priority is to reach agreement on arrangements with other Hague countries.  The AAI are in the process of  developing administrative arrangements with a number of countries who are signatories to the Hague Convention.</P>

	<P>The information provided in my response to Parliamentary Questions numbers 81 and 102 of 14 February 2012 is correct. The HSE has confirmed that no child has been confined to their bedroom and one child was restrained for a period of one minute since the publication of the HIQA report.</P>
        <P>The HIQA report published on 28 February refers to three physical restraints in relation to three children since the last inspection, which took place on 18/19 October 2012. These restraints took place on 17th and 18th of November and 1st December 2011 and were not referred to in the PQ reply which requested details of restraints since the publication of the HIQA report in December.</P>
        <P>Special Care Units care for children who are detained by a High Court Order as it is deemed that their behaviour is a danger to themselves. In such circumstances it is to be expected that staff members will, from time to time, have to intervene physically to protect children from harm. All staff are trained in accredited methods of physical restraint, and all episodes of restraint are recorded and reviewed by the senior manager, the HSE external monitor and the HIQA inspector.</P>

	<P>The National Poisons Information Centre, located in Beaumont Hospital provides information to doctors and health care professionals to assist them in the management of acute poisoning.  In cases of poisoning with venomous species, the treating hospital should contact this body for information on how to obtain stocks of anti-venom.  There are no centrally held stocks of anti-venom in Ireland.

	<P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of <Col N="273"/>hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or day case surgery.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the practice of the VHI in charging an insured couple seeking to cancel their policy 11 months from renewal a fee of &euro;634.40 in lieu of the Government health levy for 2012; if he plans to address the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>While insurers provide a facility to consumers to pay premiums over the policy year, rather than at the start of the policy, this does not change the twelve month nature of contracts.  Health insurance contracts are normally written for a <Col N="277"/>term of one year.  Like any contract, if a policyholder wishes to cancel their health insurance contract, the cancellation is subject to the relevant terms in the policy contract, provided the contract allows for mid term cancellation.  If the policy contract does not allow cancellation during the term of the year, an insurer can seek to enforce the contract under contract law and demand the balance of the year&rsquo;s premium.  All open market insurers give a 14 day cooling off period where they will cancel the contract and give a full premium refund.  It is important to note that customers are free to cancel and change their policy at their renewal date without difficulty.</P>
        <P>In respect of policies renewing or commencing in 2012, the current Scheme of Age-Related Tax Credits and Community Rating Levy provides for the payment by insurers of a levy of &euro;285 per adult.  It should be noted that, where customers leave before the twelve month insurance period expires, the insurer incurs a loss in relation to the levy paid as the levy may only be collected once.  If a policy is cancelled mid policy year, insurers cannot reclaim a proportion of the levy. Where a policy holder switches to an alternative insurer, the second insurer does not have to pay the levy in respect of the replacement policy, if the two policies commence in the same accounting period. In this regard, accounting periods are normally the twelve month period starting on 1 August and finishing on 31 July.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the VHI that the amount the couple are required to pay is based on a pro rata calculation of the levy for two adults and two children, which the VHI are required to pay in respect of the policy concerned. Where the policy is cancelled mid policy term, VHI were still required to pay the levy and therefore would otherwise be at a loss.  VHI must ensure that they take in enough premium income in a given year to cover the costs of their customers&rsquo; healthcare needs in that year.  This would not be possible if the terms of cover on policies were constantly changing outside of the agreed contract period.</P>
        <P>There is also a &euro;50 administration charge which I understand is imposed by VHI to cover the cost of the administration involved in the cancellation of a policy post-breach of the contract (it should be noted this is per policy rather than per person &mdash; the average VHI policy  involves two people).  The administration charge only arises if a breach of contract occurs.</P>

        <P>Under a new procedure, a medical card will remain valid, irrespective of the expiry date shown on the card, once the medical card holder is genuinely engaging with the HSE review process.  The medical card status of an individual can be confirmed by any doctor or pharmacist in their practice or pharmacy, or by the medical card holders themselves either on-line at <i>www.medicalcard.ie</i> or through their GP&rsquo;s practice system.  I have spoken to the HSE about the need for a public information campaign and the HSE will be taking steps in this regard very shortly.</P>

	<P>The procedures to be followed for authorisation of medicinal products are set out in EU legislation.  While no details have been provided by the Deputy on the product in question, I have been advised by the Irish Medicines Board that the company has made two applications to the Irish Medicines Board to market products in Ireland and these are currently under assessment by the Board.  An earlier application for authorisation of a particular product was made under the incorrect procedure.</P>
        <P>Under EU legislation, an application to market a medicinal product in a member state other than that in which it was first authorised must be made under the mutual recognition procedure.  This procedure is based on the principle of the mutual recognition by EU member states of <Col N="284"/>their respective national marketing authorisations.  The Irish Medicines Board is unaware of any engagement with the named company regarding a wholesaler&rsquo;s authorisation.</P>

	<P>The Directive on the Application of Patients&rsquo; Rights in Cross Border Healthcare was published in the EU Official Journal on 4 April 2011 and the transposition period of 30 months commenced on 24 April 2011.  Member States have until October 2013 to implement the Directive.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this patient-focussed Directive is to establish a clear legal framework to facilitate cross border health care with a focus on patient rights, information for patients   on entitlements and patient choice. This will require all Member States to put in place processes <Col N="285"/>to allow for the exchange of information on treatments, and their cost, to citizens across the EU.  Member States will also have to facilitate the exchange of patient information following treatment and put in place mechanisms to refund patients up to the amount the treatment would have cost them to have received the same procedure in their own Member State.  Given the complexity of the issues to be considered, both nationally and between Member States, it is envisaged that the transposition of the Directive into Irish law will be completed within the transposition time frame of October 2013.</P>

	<P>Approximately 4,400 health service staff retired between September 2011 and February 2012.  Planning for the impact of the end of the pensions &ldquo;grace period&rdquo; began last autumn. Contingency plans have been developed locally for hospital and community services, reflecting risk assessments undertaken by each hospital/community manager. These have been reviewed at regional and national levels to ensure appropriate measures are in place across all services.  The focus is on protecting and maintaining critical front-line services such as Emergency Department, maternity, critical care and neonatal services.</P>
        <P>In order to achieve this, it is essential that changes in work practices and in how services are organised are pursued in the first instance.  These include staff redeployment, streamlining of management structures, changing business processes and integrating services, as well as rostering and skill-mix changes. Some recruitment of new staff is also taking place, to ensure that key specialist services are maintained.  Such recruitment will be conducted in line with normal public service practice, including competitive selection procedures.  However I must emphasise that, given the need to reduce the size and cost of the public service, recruitment will occur only where issues cannot be addressed through other measures.</P><Col N="286"/>
        <P>Where permanent appointments are to be made, interim arrangements have where necessary been put in place at local level.  These include obtaining agreement of part-time staff to work extra hours, postponement of leave and the short-term employment of recent graduates in some disciplines.</P>

	<P>While insurers provide a facility to consumers to pay premiums over the policy year, rather than at the start of the policy, this does not change the twelve month nature of contracts.  Health insurance contracts are normally written for a term of one year. Like any contract, a customer wishing to cancel is subject to the terms of that contract. If the policy contract does not allow cancellation during the term of the year, an insurer can seek to enforce the contract under contract law and demand the balance of the year&rsquo;s premium.</P>
        <P>All open market insurers give a 14 day cooling off period where they will cancel the contract and give a full premium refund. It is important to note that customers are free to cancel and change their policy at their renewal date without difficulty.</P>
        <P>In respect of policies renewing or commencing in 2012, the current Scheme of Age-Related Tax Credits and Community Rating Levy provides for the payment by insurers of a levy of &euro;285 per adult.  It should be noted that, where customers leave before the twelve month insurance period expires, the insurer incurs a loss in relation to the levy paid as the levy may only be collected once.  If a policy is cancelled mid policy year, insurers cannot reclaim a proportion of the levy. Where a policy holder switches to an alternative insurer, the second insurer does not have to pay the levy in respect of the replacement policy, provided the two policies commence in the same accounting period (normally the twelve month period starting on 1 August and finishing on 31 July).</P>
        <P>I understand that, where customers cancel their cover mid-policy (and pay the normal penalties for breaking their contract), VHI treats them as if they were a new customer, with waiting periods applying if they take out another VHI policy immediately afterwards.  This measure is being taken as, where a policy is cancelled mid policy term, VHI are still required to pay the levy and therefore would otherwise be at a loss.  VHI must ensure that they take in enough premium income in a given year to cover the costs of their customers&rsquo; healthcare needs in that year.  This would not be possible if the terms of cover on policies were constantly changing outside of the agreed contract period.</P>
        <P>Section 8(5) of the Health Insurance Act 1994 (as amended in 2001) refers to the cessation of a contract with an insurer and the subsequent effecting of a contract with a different insurer. This section of the Acts does not cover circumstances of switching policies within the same insurer and does not prohibit an insurance provider from applying penalties to customers who cancel their cover mid-policy and wish to take out another, less expensive policy with the same insurer immediately afterwards.</P>
        <P>The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) is the independent regulator of the private health insurance market in Ireland and provides information to consumers regarding their rights and health insurance plans and benefits. My Department will examine this issue further, in conjunction with the HIA, as part of the overall strategy to address issues in the private health insurance market, leading in to the introduction of Universal Health Insurance.</P>

The recently agreed Health Service Executive Service Plan 2012 indicates services priorities for this year, including an overall provision of &euro;78 million for Palliative Care. Every effort has been made to develop Palliative Care services, including advancing improved evidence based performance measures to benefit the sector in the future. The Plan commits, for example, to develop Palliative Care in both the Hospital, and Community based, settings. The Department of Health and the HSE will continue to work closely with all relevant stakeholders to improve these services for patients and their families, in line with overall resource availability.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government published in March 2011 has committed to completing and implementing the National Positive Ageing Strategy so that older people are recognised, supported and enabled to live independent full lives.  It is not the intention that the Strategy will propose new service developments. Rather it will set the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Strategy will set out a common framework for the development of operational plans by Government Departments. These operational plans will clearly set out each Department&rsquo;s objectives relating to older people. Mechanisms designed to monitor the implementation of measures contained in operational plans will also be developed in consultation with Departments.</P>
        <P>In recognition that a wide range of policies, programmes and services impact directly on the lives of older people, development of the Strategy is being assisted by a Cross-Departmental <Col N="290"/>Group (CDG), comprised of officials from 11 Government Departments, the Central Statistics Office and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>In 2009, an NGO Liaison Group comprising representatives of twelve national level non-governmental organisations working with and for older people was established under an independent Chair. The role of this Group is to facilitate the exchange of information and views between the organisations, their members and the Cross Departmental Group during the development of the National Positive Ageing Strategy. To date, this Group has met with Government officials on six occasions.  In addition, given that the National Positive Ageing Strategy will have a wider focus than any previous strategy relating to older people, it was important to hear the views and opinions of older people themselves in addition to the views of representative organisations, non-governmental organisations, services providers and other interested parties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To this end, a wide ranging public consultation process between Government and older people in Ireland was concluded in November 2010. This process comprised a public call for written submissions, of which 190 were received; a series of public regional consultation meetings, which were attended by over 1,100 older people, representative organisations and service providers; and face to face meetings between Government officials and groups representing vulnerable and marginalised older people.  The report of the consultations was published on 22 November 2010, and is available on this Department&rsquo;s website on the following link, <i>www.dohc.ie/issues/national-positive-ageing/</i>.</P>
        <P>Work on developing the Strategy is on-going and taking place within the constraints posed by the present fiscal situation.  It is a priority for this Government and it is our intention to complete and publish the Strategy as soon as possible within the above constraints.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 570 to 572, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Following receipt of a complaint regarding the retention of Newborn Screening Cards (NSCs) to the Data Protection Commissioner, the Commissioner decreed that NSCs should not be retained indefinitely as this constituted a breach of the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003. Subsequently, a number of meetings were held with the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner and representatives of the Department of Health, Health Service Executive and relevant hospital personnel. A policy was agreed in conjunction with the Data Protection Commissioner to address both the legislative and ethical requirements of the National Newborn Screening Programme, which included disposal of archived NSC&rsquo;s older than ten years.</P>
        <P>As I was aware of the concern regarding the proposed destruction of archived Newborn Screening Cards, soon after I was appointed Minister I requested the HSE to conduct a review of this decision. The review examined both the legal and ethical basis for retention of NSCs and the potential use of the existing cards for research purposes. It is my understanding that the review group examined the governance arrangements for the retention and use of NSCs in a variety of jurisdictions including New Zealand, Australia and the U.S.A. As the Deputy may be aware, legal uncertainties over access to and use of NSCs has led to the destruction of cards in Western Australia, Texas and The Netherlands.</P>
        <P>The report and recommendations of the review group were submitted to my office in January 2012. Having carefully considered the issue, I have accepted the recommendation of the review group that in order to meet our legal and ethical responsibilities, newborn screening cards over ten years old will be destroyed. However, I fully recognise the value of this material for research purposes, which was why the review group was tasked with exploring ways which the material could be made available to the research community in a way which were compatible with our ethical and legal obligations. The international consensus clearly favours seeking explicit consent from an individual and/or their parent/guardian for use of their previously collected biological material for research purposes.</P>
        <P>Therefore, in the interests of facilitating research, the HSE will mount an information campaign offering members of the public the opportunity to have their screening card returned to them, prior to any destruction of the cards taking place. This will ensure that anyone who wishes to donate their or their child&rsquo;s NSC to research will be afforded the opportunity to do so.  The proposed course of action seeks to ensure public trust and a continued willingness to participate in the National Newborn Screening Programme which is a vital public health measure for children and their families.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The prevention and control of MRSA is a global challenge and important in the control of healthcare associated infections.  In 1995 the Department of Health published Guidelines for the control of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in acute hospital wards, including specialist units.</P>
        <P>However, in the period following publication of the guidelines many significant new challenges, including  the increasing rate of resistance to antibiotics, arose.  In 2005, the Infection Control Committee of the Strategy for the Control of Antimicrobial Resistance in Ireland (SARI) reviewed the literature on MRSA and revised the 1995 Irish guidelines.  The Subcommittee utilised guidelines produced in other countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States of America, New Zealand and the Netherlands.</P>
        <P>Implementation of guidelines is now  within the context of the National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections, which were published by the Health Information and Quality Authority in 2009.  These standards were designed to promote an environment that maximises safety, quality and accountability in health and social care services and to drive a culture of responsibility and accountability among all staff involved in the management and delivery of health and social care services.  These National Standards are the key component in maximising patient safety and improving the quality of health and social care in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The HSE/Royal College of Physicians in Ireland (RCPI) Clinical Advisory Group on HCAIs has submitted the latest guidelines on the Control and Prevention of MRSA to the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) for consideration to become part of the national suite of clinical guidelines.  The NCEC has received 16 submissions and is currently undertaking a prioritisation exercise to identify which submissions will proceed to the next stage of the process.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that appropriate steps are being taken by the HSE to address the issue of HCAIs, including MRSA, and to treat them promptly when they occur.  The HSE&rsquo;s performance indicators at national level continue to demonstrate encouraging improvements in the area of infection prevention and control with the reported incidence of MRSA dropping by 43% in the number of MRSA cases reported between 2007 and 2010.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The control of Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs) continues to be a policy priority for the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive (HSE).  Maintaining hospital hygiene practice is an essential component of the drive to reduce HCAIs.</P><Col N="293"/>
        <P>Under Section 8 of the Health Act 2007, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has statutory power to set standards on safety and quality in relation to services provided by the HSE and service providers in accordance with specified Acts.  The Authority is also charged with monitoring compliance with such standards.  However, it is a matter for the Authority to determine how it can most effectively deliver on its responsibilities having regard to competing priorities and available resources.</P>
        <P>HIQA&rsquo;s National Infection Prevention and Control Standards were published in May 2009.  The Authority carried out a national hygiene audit in late 2009 and undertook hygiene audits of hospitals during  2010.  It is the intention of the Authority to undertake a number of unannounced inspections this year to monitor compliance with the National Standards.  Furthermore, when the National Standards for Better Safer Healthcare are mandated, the Authority also intends to assess the management of HCAIs as part of the monitoring of these Standards.  Previously, the Authority has included laypersons on a number of inspection teams and as part of every investigation team.  The Authority is favourably disposed to having lay people joining its inspection teams and is looking at the feasibility of enabling this.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that the HSE undertook two self-assessment units in acute facilities against HIQA&rsquo;s national standards in 2009 and 2011.  The results of these assessments showed a significant improvement in the national score.  The Internal Audit Service of the HSE has also undertaken a review in a small number of facilities of some of the standards.</P>

	<P>Any possible adverse reaction to a medication should be reported to the Irish Medicines Board. To date, the IMB has received 33 reports relating to the vaccine which the Deputy is referring to which included reactions affecting the eyes or vision. These were mainly transient reactions such as swelling of the eye and blurred vision.</P>
        <P>During the 2009/10 H1N1 Pandemic, the European Medicines Agency specifically reviewed reports of eye related disorders and concluded that there was no evidence of any direct adverse effect on the eyes or vision in relation to the H1N1 vaccines.  If the Deputy&rsquo;s constituent is still concerned then they should seek the advice of their General Practitioner who may liaise further with the Irish Medicines Board, if necessary.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 581 and 582 together.</P>
        <P>A table is attached detailing the number of Freedom of Information requests received for each year between 2002 and 2011, the amount of &ldquo;up-front&rdquo; fees received and the amount of search and retrieval fees received. Over the time period involved the Department would not have details of search and retrieval fees charged but not paid.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might note that the high volume of FOI requests received between 2002 and 2005 reflected requests received by the Department in relation to children who were in institutional care. A significant number of these requests were dealt with outside the Freedom of Information Act through the Access to Institutional and Related Records project that was undertaken between 2004 and 2006.</P>
        <P>Another point that is worth noting is that while numbers appear to have reduced over recent years a practice has evolved whereby multiple requests for records are now included in one submission thus only paying one up-front fee and being treated under FOI legislation as a single request.</P>

	<P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</P>
        <P>As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient&rsquo;s general practitioner consider that the patient&rsquo;s condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.</P>

        <Quest> if he will consider, within the context of the transposition of EU Directive 2010/63/EU, introducing an obligation to use the new non-animal alternatives (details supplied) for the testing of chemicals, for which the EU granted approval last month. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Directive (2010/63/EU) on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes will strengthen the protection of animals still needed for research and safety testing. The Directive will also play a significant role in minimising the number of animals used and require alternatives to be used where possible, whilst ensuring a level playing field for EU industry and enhancing the quality of research conducted in the EU. The &ldquo;Three Rs&rdquo; principle of replacing, reducing, and refining animal testing is firmly anchored in the new legislation and this is something that I strongly support. </P>
        <P>I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that the IMB has advised the Department that a new non-animal cell-based test method has been approved for the testing of Botox. The test replaces the animal-based LD50 assay for testing of botulinum neurotoxins, an assay method which has been the standard up to now. They further advise that the new test has been validated for use to determine the potency of product for release onto the market and in stability studies and it will result in a significant reduction in the use of animals in testing of Botox. The change in test methods is in line with the overall &lsquo;3Rs&rsquo; principles of replacement, refinement and reduction in the use of animals in research testing which is enshrined in the Directive.</P>

	<P>The Public Service Agreement (PSA) is an essential enabler for the health sector to allow it to respond to the healthcare needs of the population in an appropriate and sustainable manner, against a backdrop of very significant reductions in both financial and staff resources.  Particular reforms to date include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the agreements to provide for an extended working day for medical laboratory and radiographer staff;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />significant redeployment within the health sector; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the first major cross-sectoral redeployment of over 1,000 Community Welfare Staff from the HSE to the Department of Social Protection.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Detailed progress reports on implementation of the Agreement in the Health Sector are available at <i>www.implementationbody.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>I want to acknowledge and welcome the improvements in productivity that are being delivered by staff at local level through the Public Service Agreement in relation, for example, to staff redeployment, streamlining of management structures including clinical management roles, changes in skill mix and more cost effective rosters.</P>
        <P>With regard to the delivery of services after 29th February, 2012, I am satisfied that suitable arrangements are in place at national, regional and service specific levels to proactively manage the impact of staff exits on front line services.  The focus is on protecting and maintaining <Col N="298"/>critical front line services such as Emergency Department,  maternity, critical care and neonatal services.  I believe there is a particular onus on all of us working in the health services to be as innovative and flexible as possible in order to mitigate the impact on services of reduced budgets and staffing.</P>
        <P>The health sector&rsquo;s revised action plan for implementation of the Agreement in  2012  has recently been submitted to the Implementation Body and is currently under consideration by that Body.  The is plan is particularly focused on meeting the commitments in the HSE National Service Plan 2012 and facilitating the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s reform plans for the health sector.  It takes account of the impact of the &ldquo;grace period&rdquo; retirements and requires an acceleration of changes to ensure that all essential services are protected.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 594, 595 and 597 together.</P>
        <P>The Government has agreed the shape and scale of the asset disposal programme to be pursued as a commitment under the EU/IMF Programme, and as provided for in the Programme for Government.  CI&Eacute; and its three operating subsidiary companies are important State assets.  However, it must be recognised that they are unique semi-state companies, in that they are in receipt of significant amount of Exchequer funding from the National Transport Authority for the provision of non-commercial public service obligation services.  Even after these payments for PSO services, they still recorded a loss of &euro;53.6m in 2010. Furthermore, there is a significant pension deficit within the Group.</P>
        <P>In this regard, I would concur with the Report of the Review Group on State Assets and Liabilities, which stated that &ldquo;having regard to the unavoidable losses inherent in maintaining a nationwide railway and uneconomic urban and rural bus services, disposal or part-disposal of the main CIE companies is not a realistic short-term option.&rdquo;  Having considered the matter I do not consider the disposal of Expressway as a realistic short term option. </P>
        <P>CI&Eacute; Tours International, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann and is registered in the United States of America where most of their customers reside and its main offices are located. The main business of CI&Eacute; Tours International, Inc. is to retail coach tour packages on behalf of CI&Eacute; Tours.  I have asked the Chair of CIE to examine the future role of CIE Tours within the CIE Group.</P>
        <P>Following a request from me, I have received the financial statements for CI&Eacute; Tours International, Inc. for the years ended March 31, 2011 and 2010. It is my intention, subject to legal considerations, to ensure a copy of the financial statements is laid before each House of the Oireachtas following submission to Government of the 2011 CI&Eacute; accounts.</P>

The Act assigned full responsibility to local authorities, subject only to consultation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and/or the National Roads Authority (in relation to national roads), for the implementation of a broad range of traffic management measures, including the provision of parking spaces for coaches and buses. The designation of such spaces in Dublin City therefore, is entirely the responsibility of Dublin City Council and I do not have any role in the matter. </P>

        <P>The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the regulation of the taxi industry under the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 and is also the lead agency with responsibility for implementation of the recommendations of the Taxi Regulation Review Report. The NTA has commenced the scoping work required for the further development of the proposal for a local area hackney licence.</P>

	<P>As regards the contracts for the Public Private Partnership schemes, these are commercial agreements between the NRA and the PPP concessionaires concerned.  The NRA has published information on its forward commitments in the Authority&rsquo;s 2010 Annual Accounts, copies of which have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and hence are available from both the D&aacute;il and Seanad libraries.</P>

	<P>Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 477 of 2006) the Road Safety Authority has responsibility for the delivery of the National Car Test.  The RSA has overall responsbility for the operation, oversight, development, quality assurance and delivery of vehicle testing arrangements. The testing function is carried out by Applus, since January 2010, under a contractual arrangement with the RSA.  I have requested the RSA to respond to the specific aspect of the Deputy&rsquo;s question. I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a reply has not been received within ten working days.</P>
